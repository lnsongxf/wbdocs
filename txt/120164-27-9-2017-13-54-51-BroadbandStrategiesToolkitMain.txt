1.1 Introduction
In just one decade, the world of information and communications technologies (ICT) has changed
dramatically. The Internet has become an integral part of people’s personal and business lives; critical
for a wide range of information, communication and entertainment services. With broadband
networks, consumers can now access the Internet at speeds up to or exceeding 100 megabits per
second (Mbit/s) and they can use their mobile phones for a wide range of activities, including surfing the
Internet, purchasing goods and services online, streaming video or music and conducting financial
transactions.
A look at the state of broadband some 10 years back, however, presents a much different picture. In
2001, fewer than 11 in 100 people around the world had any type of Internet access, the majority of
which was through a dial-up connection.1 Korea (Rep.) was the only country with a wireline broadband
penetration rate in the double digits;2 the other top five countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) had just over three subscribers per 100 people by the end of 2001.3
Wireless broadband was still in its infancy. Although there were 15.7 mobile cellular subscriptions per
100 people worldwide in 2001, third generation (3G) networks capable of mobile broadband services
and applications were just beginning to be deployed.
Despite relatively low speeds and penetration, by 2001 the Internet was already beginning to provide a
rich and dynamic source of content and communications. Email was in common use—in 2001 nearly 12
billion email messages zipped around the world every day. Blogs had become a popular form of social
media, with sites such as LiveJournal and Blogger.com leading the way. Entering the search engine
business in 1998, Google had quickly expanded and provided access to over three billion documents by
December 2001. Due to limited bandwidth, however, many websites were text-heavy, with few images
and virtually no video. Social networking sites were merely looming on the horizon; it would be another
two years before the launch of Myspace, three years for Facebook and four years for YouTube. Other
bandwidth-intensive online applications, including Skype, YouTube and Apple’s iTunes store, were also
years away from commercial launch. Converged services, such as Internet Protocol television (IPTV),
were just being introduced.
Fast-forward a decade and we find that much of what was popular in 2001 is still in high demand today.
Google has continued its rise and now processes over one billion search requests every day (see Figure
1.1). The number of email accounts worldwide exceeded three billion in 2011, while the number of
emails sent averaged about 300 billion per day and is expected to reach over 500 billion per day by
2013.4 With over 150 million blogs in 2011, blogging has evolved from a simple online diary to a type of
new media, which is used by “citizen journalists” as an alternative to traditional journalism, as well as by
governments and corporations to communicate less formally with the public. In addition, a multitude of
new services and applications has emerged that were not even conceived of a decade ago. YouTube has
surpassed three billion views a day,5 while Skype has over 700 million user accounts6 and Facebook over
845 million active monthly users at the end of 2011.7 The growth of today’s most popular services and
applications would not have been possible without broadband access. In turn, for those currently
without such access, many of these tools are still not available.

Improvements to users’ online experience and the rise of digital media are largely attributable to more
widespread deployment of wireline broadband, along with significant improvements to mobile
technologies and services. As of December 2010, the OECD found that the average wireline broadband
penetration rate in the top five countries was over 36 subscribers per 100 people, more than a ten-fold
increase in less than a decade.8 Additionally, among all OECD countries, the average advertised wireline
broadband speed had surpassed 37 Mbit/s by September 2010, which allows users to download a
feature-length movie in a matter of minutes.9 Despite these advances, a digital divide remains between
developed and developing countries. Although wireline broadband has grown considerably in terms of
the global average, penetration levels in developing countries remain low. By the end of 2010, the
number of fixed line subscriptions reached about half a billion globally, with just 4.4 subscriptions per
100 people in developing countries compared to 24.6 in developed countries.10 In effect, wireline
broadband deployments in many developing countries are a decade behind those in developed
countries.
But broadband is not just about high-speed access to the Internet to allow users to surf the web, play
video games and engage in social networking (although these are useful drivers of demand and provide
their own benefits to users). Broadband is an enabling platform for advanced services and applications.
The benefits of broadband can reverberate throughout the economy and act as an essential input in all

                                                    2
other sectors, including education, health, transportation, energy and finance; similar to the impact that
electricity has had on productivity, growth and innovation. However, in order to achieve this potential,
governments must put in place effective policies that spur supply and demand, as well as encourage
uptake of broadband in all sectors of the economy.
The roll-out of broadband requires significant investment from the private sector, as well as support
from the public sector. It will also require a long-term perspective because its benefits will not occur
overnight. For developing countries with limited resources, it may be difficult to focus on broadband
when many of their communities do not have schools for children, safe drinking water or access to
hospitals and health care. However, broadband offers countries a platform to provide other sectors of
the economy with new tools to enhance businesses, improve the economy and benefit its people. This
will require resources and the benefits will not be immediate, but making this high priority and part of a
country’s development agenda will be necessary to ensure that developing countries do not further
extend the digital divide between developed and developing countries.
This module of the Broadband Strategies Toolkit expands on the significance of broadband to both
developing and developed countries, first by identifying what broadband means in various contexts,
including speed and functionality, identifying broadband as an enabling platform and broadband in
terms of network infrastructure. Secondly, this module examines why broadband is important,
particularly the potential positive impact that broadband can have on the productivity, employment and
throughout every sector of the economy. The main market trends regarding the supply and demand of
broadband networks, services and applications are addressed, as well as an overview of how
policymakers and stakeholders can take advantage of these trends to implement deployment and
adoption strategies that maximize the benefits of broadband.

1.2 What is Broadband?
Despite its worldwide growth and promotion by policymakers, network operators, content providers
and other stakeholders, broadband does not have a single, standardized definition. The term
“broadband” may refer to multiple aspects of the network and services, including: 1) the infrastructure
or “pipes” used to deliver services to users; 2) high-speed access to the Internet; and/or 3) the services
and applications available via broadband networks, such as Internet protocol television (IPTV) and voice
services that may be bundled in a “triple play” package with broadband Internet access. Further, many
countries have established definitions of broadband based on speed, typically in Mbit/s or kilobits per
second (kbit/s), or based on the types of services and applications that can be used over a broadband
network (i.e., functionality). Due to each country’s unique needs and history, including economic,
geographic and regulatory factors, definitions of broadband vary widely.
Traditionally, broadband has often been defined in terms of data transmission speed (i.e., the amount of
data that can be transmitted across a network connection in a given period of time, typically one
second, also known as the data transfer rate or throughput). Defining broadband in terms of speed has
been an important element in understanding broadband, particularly since the data transfer rate
determines whether users are able to access basic or more advanced types of content, services and
applications over the Internet. However, attempts to define broadband in terms of speed present
certain limitations. To address these limitations, some countries (e.g., Brazil)1 and international
organizations (e.g., OECD)2 have decided or proposed not to categorize broadband in terms of speed,
but are instead looking at broadband in terms of functionality—focusing on what can and cannot be
done with a certain type of connection.



1.2.1 Broadband as an Enabling Platform
The Broadband Strategies Toolkit and Handbook view broadband more holistically as a high-capacity ICT
platform that improves the variety, utility and value of services and applications offered by a wide range
of providers, to the benefit of users, society, and multiple sectors of the economy.
From a policy perspective, broadband should not be viewed simply as a certain speed or functionality,
but as an enabling ICT platform that can potentially influence the entire economy. As noted by the
OECD and the World Bank, the true benefits of broadband are expected to arise less from any direct
impact but instead from the applications that broadband enables and the associated gains in
productivity.3 While there are direct effects from investments in broadband technology and
deployment of the infrastructure, the indirect effects arise from factors that drive growth, including
innovation, efficiency and competition, as well as the facilitation of new and useful products, services,
processes and business models that could not exist without broadband.4 According to the OECD, as
broadband technology continues to improve and bandwidth increases, the capacity for broadband to act
as an enabler of structural change in the economy expands due to its impact on an increasing number of
sectors and activities.5 Viewing broadband as an enabling platform and key input across sectors is the
basis of identifying the role that broadband can play as a general purpose technology (GPT), which is
further addressed in the section 1.3.4.
In order to capture the full range of these potential benefits, it may be useful for policymakers to
consider broadband through an ecosystem framework, as outlined in section 1.5.1. This perspective
comprises both supply-side considerations (network platforms) and demand-side considerations, such
as e-government initiatives, development of services and applications). To encourage the diffusion of

                                                    4
broadband-enabled innovations throughout the economy, policymakers should also consider the
absorptive capacity of various sectors, including health, education, energy and transportation. Unless all
these elements—supply, demand, and absorptive capacity—are coordinated, the impact of broadband
on the economy as a whole will be constrained.

1.2.2 Broadband in Terms of Speed, Functionality and Technology
Seeing broadband as an enabling ICT platform does not contradict or exclude common understandings
that define broadband in terms of speed, functionality, or technology. This section will give an overview
of more specific elements of broadband, usually used to narrow the term down.
In the most practical sense, the term broadband is generally understood to mean a dedicated or
“always-on” connection to the Internet with speeds faster than dial-up. The concept of broadband also
involves being able to do things that are virtually impossible to do over dial-up given its limited
bandwidth—videoconferencing, online gaming and watching videos, to name a few. Broadband has
commonly been defined in terms of a minimum data transmission speed, usually referring to the
amount a user can download. Defining broadband in terms of speed refers to the amount of data
(generally in bits) that can be transmitted across a network connection in a given period of time,
typically one second. Also known as the data transfer rate or throughput, speed has been an important
element in understanding broadband, particularly since the data transfer rate determines the types and
range of content, services and applications that a user may access.
Speed matters for users: An increasing number of Internet applications, such as those that display high-
quality video content, require high speeds to work. These applications often cannot be downloaded or
viewed unless the Internet connection is of a certain speed and quality. When a user tries to access an
application hosted on a remote server, the speed and quality of the user’s connection is measured by
the server, and an error message is displayed if the connection does not meet the minimum
requirements to provide the service. Even if an Internet application or website does not impose these
requirements, there are other consequences to users on slower connections. Usability suffers when an
application or website meant to be used over broadband is accessed over dial-up, often to the point of
futility. A website or application that is accessible but effectively unusable over slower connections will
lead only to frustrated users and, for commercial websites, higher expenses for customer support. In
addition, as broadband connections have become faster and more widespread, website designers have
taken advantage of the added bandwidth to offer richer and more complex websites. Consumers on
slower connections, and especially those on dial-up, may find that their experience on the Internet
worsens with each website redesign.
Box 1.1. Understanding Broadband Speeds

 1 kbit/s = 1,000 bits per second
 1 Mbit/s = 1,000,000 bits per second (1,000 kbit/s)
 1 Gbit/s = 1,000,000,000 bits per second (1,000 Mbit/s)

However, definitions of the precise threshold of transmission rates that determines whether Internet
access is considered broadband vary. At the low end, broadband is often defined as download speeds of
at least 256 kilobits per second (kbit/s). A 2009 ITU document, for example, defines broadband as at
least 256 kbit/s.6 This is the definition used by other organizations, including the OECD, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and the Partnership for Measuring ICT for
Development, a consortium of international organizations and agencies. However, Recommendation

                                                    5
I.113 of the ITU Standardization Sector, defines broadband as “transmission capacity that is faster than
[...] at 1.5 or 2.0” Mbit/s, and in reality, broadband services are increasingly being offered at 100
megabits per second (Mbit/s), with the goal of reaching 1 Gigabit per second (Gbit/s) and beyond.7 The
higher the data transfer rate, the faster that files can be transmitted and, in this way, broadband speed
is linked with functionality.
Attempts to define broadband more specifically in terms of speed can be challenging. As a 2008 study
on behalf of the European Union (EU) noted:
        Definitions based on data transfer speed are not able to take into account the very fast evolution
        in technologies and uses. Is a bandwidth of 256 kbit/s a broadband connection? Should the
        lower limit be set to 1 Mbit/s? There is no definitive answer as the bandwidth required to run
        internet applications is continuously increasing and infrastructure standards are also
        continuously improving to face the growing demand. Such a definition can only be relative to a
                                                           8
        particular moment in time in a particular country.
Defining broadband in terms of speed presents several difficulties. First, broadband speed definitions
vary widely among countries and international organizations from at least 256 kbit/s on the low end
(such as in India)9 to faster than 1.5 Mbit/s on the high end (such as in Canada). Second, as referenced
in the above-mentioned EU study, definitions based on speed may not keep pace with technology
advances or with the speeds services and applications require to function properly. In other words,
what is considered “broadband” today may be seen as too slow in the future as more advanced
applications technologies develop. Thus, any speed-based definition of broadband will need to be
updated over time. Third, such definitions may not reflect the speeds realized by end users such that
the speeds advertised by commercial broadband providers may be much higher than the speeds set by
the government as broadband or vice versa. For example, while Colombia’s broadband speed definition
is 1 Mbit/s, its average broadband connection speed is already 1.8 Mbit/s.
Policymakers and regulators are struggling to develop definitions of broadband that are appropriate to
the time and that reflect rapidly improving technological capabilities. In July 2009, for example, India’s
telecommunications regulator suggested that the government redefine broadband as connectivity of 2
Mbit/s or faster, up from the 256 kbit/s defined in the Broadband Policy of 2004.10 Some countries have
developed different categories in addressing broadband. The Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission, for example, distinguishes between “high-speed Internet service,”
defined as at least 128 kbit/s, and “broadband service,” which must be at least 1.5 Mbit/s.
In addition to or in place of these definitions, a number of countries have minimized or avoided the issue
of defining broadband in terms of speed and have focused instead on setting ambitious minimum speed
goals. Broadband speed goals in these countries include:
       Australia’s goal is to make connections with speeds of 100 Mbit/s available to 93 percent of
        homes, schools, and businesses by 2018.
       Finland has the goal of making 100 Mbit/s connections available to every household by 2016.
       Germany’s goal is 50 Mbit/s connections for 75 percent of households by 2014.11
       The EU’s “Digital Agenda for Europe” calls for all Europeans to have access to connections with
        speeds of at least 30 Mbit/s by 2020, with 50 percent or more of households having access to
        speeds in excess of 100 Mbit/s.
       Korea, a country where broadband connection speeds already average almost 50 Mbit/s, has
        set the lofty goal of 1 Gbit/s connections by 2013.12

                                                        6
       Sweden aims for 40 percent of households and businesses having access to 100 Mbit/s
        connections by 2015, and 90 percent by 2020.13
       The United Kingdom has relatively modest goals. Its “Digital Britain” plan aims for universal
        connections of at least 2 Mbit/s by 2012.14
       The United States set a goal of providing 100 million households with access to actual (not
        advertised) speeds of 100 Mbit/sMbit/s and all households with access to actual speeds of at
        least 4 Mbit/s downlink and 1 Mbit/s uplink by 2020.15 Given the speed and unpredictability of
        technological progress, the FCC plans to “review and revise” these goals every four years.16
Some countries are moving away completely from understanding broadband in terms of speed and
instead seek to define it in terms of functionality. This is because minimum upload and download
numbers do not always paint the whole picture, and definitions based on bandwidth run the risk of
always being a step behind. Defining broadband in terms of functionality cuts to the chase: what can
and cannot be done with a certain connection. As with many information technologies, broadband has
demonstrated that it is quick-to-market, continually changing and unpredictable. Customer
expectations are continually ramping up as the need for more bandwidth and faster connections is
driven by more advanced services and applications.
For example, Brazil’s broadband plan avoids attaching a minimum speed to its definition of broadband.
Instead, broadband is defined as “the provision of telecommunications infrastructure that enables
information traffic in a continuous and uninterrupted manner, with sufficient capacity to provide access
to data, voice and video applications that are common or socially relevant to users as determined by the
federal government from time to time.”17 This definition identifies those Internet applications that must
be accessible over an Internet connection in order for that connection to be considered broadband. At
the same time, it allows for the government to adjust the set of Internet applications that serve as the
benchmark.
However, for some purposes, defining broadband in terms of functionality can be problematic as
meeting the definition becomes more subjective. A definition based on speed is easy to apply: if
broadband is defined as at least 1.5 Mbit/s, a 2 Mbit/s connection is broadband while a 1 Mbit/s
connection is not. But when broadband is defined in terms of functionality, the distinction between
what is and is not broadband becomes fuzzy. Admittedly, this can lead to positive outcomes, for
example, if citizens of a country can appeal to operators and regulators for speeds that meet actual
current usage criteria. Yet, the questions that need to be answered also become more equivocal: Is
being able to watch a YouTube video equal to a broadband connection? What if it takes minutes to
buffer and starts and stops throughout?
For several contexts, being able to universally quantify broadband can be useful. If a country wants to
compare itself to its peers in terms of broadband penetration, for example, it needs to follow a common
metric. If it wants to be able to track its growth in broadband availability from year to year, it needs to
set a standard that can be easily and reliably measured over time. Likewise, if it wants to hold
accountable telecommunications providers to their broadband deployment plans it must provide a clear
definition or set of expectations for providers to meet.
To allay some of the aforementioned shortcomings, some countries seem to be embracing a “hybrid”
approach to defining broadband. On one hand, they specify the minimum speed that will qualify as
broadband. On the other hand, they list the Internet applications that a broadband connection should
support. For example, the Canadian National Broadband Task Force has defined broadband as “a high-
capacity, two-way link between end users and access network suppliers capable of supporting full-

                                                    7
motion interactive video applications to all Canadians on terms comparable to those available in urban
markets.” Nonetheless, the CRTC defines broadband as at least 1.5 Mbit/s (with anything faster than
128 kbit/s being defined as “high-speed”). The U.S. Federal Communications Commission divides
broadband into tiers as described above, but also describes broadband as an “advanced
communications systems capable of providing high-speed transmission of services such as data, voice,
and video over the Internet and other networks.”18
Next to speed and functionality, in addressing “what is broadband,” it is also useful to identify the
various wireline and wireless technologies that deliver connectivity to users. Generally, the three main
wireline technologies currently in use to deliver broadband to end user locations are: 1) digital
subscriber line (DSL); 2) hybrid fiber coaxial cable (HFC) or cable modem; and 3) fiber optic cable. Fiber
networks generally offer the fastest speeds. Particularly if fiber network access reaches directly to the
end user’s home or business, referred to as fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP), then download speeds can
reach 100 Mbit/s or more.19 Maximum download speeds ranging from 40 Mbit/s to over 100 Mbit/s can
be achieved through fiber-to-the-curb or -cabinet (FTTC), which carries the fiber network to within a few
hundred meters of the end user location with the remaining distance covered by DSL or HFC.20 Fiber, as
well as cable modem and the more advanced versions of DSL (such as Very-High-Speed DSL), can
support the latest business services, such as videoconferencing ‘or triple play’ services for households
(Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), television services and video-on-demand, and high-speed Internet
access).
Third generation (3G) networks are the main mobile broadband technologies available today. In 2011,
there were nearly three billion 3G subscriptions,21 of which over 70 percent had peak download speeds
of 7.2 Mbit/s or higher.22 As the number of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) deployments grows, mobile users
will be able to take advantage of the wide array of services available with fourth generation (4G)
networks offering download speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s. Notably, LTE deployments are occurring at the
fastest rate of any mobile technology ever, faster than both second generation (2G) and 3G networks.23
For greater detail on the evolution of mobile broadband, as well as greater technical specifications of
wireline broadband, see Chapter 5 of the Broadband Handbook and Module 2 of the Broadband Toolkit.

1.3 Why is Broadband Important?

1.3.1 Positive Impacts of Broadband
With the appropriate policies in place, broadband is a transformative platform that impacts the ICT
sector as well as other sectors of the economy. While some may disagree on the precise economic and
social benefits that can be attributed specifically to broadband, and may challenge the studies that have
suggested a large impact, few argue against the fact that broadband has dramatically changed our
personal lives, our businesses and our economies. Moreover, as an enabling ICT platform and potential
GPT, broadband can facilitate growth and innovation in the ICT sector and throughout the economy,
serving as a vital input for each sector that strengthens the economy as a whole. Broadband has the
capacity to “contribute to virtually every sector in the economy through productivity gains.”1
Even beyond productivity increases, broadband affects the economy in multiple ways, for instance,
through job growth and improved quality of life. It is capable of facilitating micro- and macroeconomic
growth by “accelerat[ing] the distribution of ideas and information and foster[ing] competition for and
development of new products, processes, and business models.”2 Broadband impacts a country’s
economic output and GDP in multiple ways by: 1) enhancing the role of human capital through easier
acquisition of knowledge and technical skills; 2) improving the efficiency and productivity of enterprises;
3) increasing community competitiveness by attracting knowledge-based businesses; and 4) sparking
new and innovative technologies, services, applications and business models.3 The multiplier effect of
broadband can drive GDP, productivity, and employment growth. However, policies that support the
supply and demand elements of the ecosystem, as well as the absorptive capacity to develop broadband
capabilities in other sectors, must all be in place in order to fully realize such benefits.

1.3.2 Impact of Broadband on Gross Domestic Product
Due to the potentially wide-ranging impacts of broadband, and its ability to provide easier access to
information that increases efficiencies and productivity in the economy, it is unsurprising that increased
use of broadband networks and services has been found to produce positive outcomes that reverberate
throughout a country, particularly involving GDP. A frequently cited World Bank study found that low-
income and middle-income countries experienced “about a 1.38 percentage point increase in GDP for
each 10 percent increase in [broadband] penetration” between 2000 and 2006.4 The World Bank
further found that the development impact of broadband on emerging economies is greater than for
high-income countries, which “enjoyed a 1.21 percentage point increase in per capita GDP growth” per
10 percent increase in broadband penetration.5 The study also demonstrates that broadband has a
potentially higher growth effect than other ICTs, including wireline telephony, mobile telephony and the
Internet, as shown in Figure 1.2. The predominance of broadband may be unexpected considering that,
over the last decade, mobile telephony has been the fastest growing ICT worldwide, with a 2010 global
penetration rate of 76.2 out of 100 persons.6

Broadband, p. 45.

The World Bank’s findings of broadband’s growth effects are supported by other independent studies.
In a study noting the extensive benefits of broadband for emerging markets, management consulting
firm McKinsey & Company estimated that “a 10 percent increase in broadband household penetration
delivers a boost to a country’s GDP that ranges from 0.1 percent to 1.4 percent.”7 Additionally, a study
of OECD countries by global consulting firm Booz & Company found that among high-income countries,
there is a strong correlation between average annual GDP growth and broadband penetration wherein
“[c]ountries in the top tier of broadband penetration have also exhibited 2 percent higher GDP growth
than countries in the bottom tier of broadband penetration.”8
Although numerous studies have found a positive impact on economic growth, the estimate of its actual
magnitude varies. For example, a ten percent increase in broadband penetration has been found to
increase economic growth from a low of range of 0.24 percent to a high of 1.50 percent (Figure 1.3).

While these studies provide important insight into the growth effects of broadband, data collection and
further systematic research and analysis in this area are needed, particularly for developing countries.
Currently, there is ample anecdotal evidence of the effects of broadband on economic growth, with
some cases highlighted below. However, these cases provide only limited evidence of the impact that
broadband has on the economy as a whole. It is also important to note that investment in broadband or
policies fostering its deployment or adoption are unlikely to produce significant GDP gains without
complementary investments or policies in other sectors, notably education, innovation, civic
participation and health care. However, even with the implementation of appropriate policies, the
impacts of broadband on growth in certain areas may be limited. For example, developing countries
may be in less need of telemedicine to improve health outcomes and more in need of low-tech and
inexpensive solutions, such as mosquito nets and de-worming pills.14 Additionally, despite providing a
new educational resource, broadband can also create a new distraction if careful controls are not in
place that limit Internet access to non-academic sites such as Facebook, YouTube and file-sharing
websites.15
Examples of the impact of broadband on economic growth around the world
Australia
The Australian Government is in the process of deploying the country’s largest-ever infrastructure
project, the National Broadband Network (NBN). At a cost of up to AUD 43 billion (USD 41 billion) over
eight years, the NBN is set to rollout a fiber network delivering broadband speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s

                                                           12
to at least 93 percent of the population and wireless networks delivering speeds of 12 Mbit/s or more to
those living in remote areas.16 As the NBN is implemented, both the public and private sectors are
researching the impact that the NBN is expected to have on economic growth.
One such study, completed in November 2010, reviewed the anticipated effects of the NBN up to the
year 2020 based on the NBN’s rollout plan.17 The results revealed that for 18 industries, the NBN’s
impact would improve economic outcomes between 0.17 percent and 0.54 percent with an average of
0.43 percent across all industries.18 As Table 1.1 below shows, four industries—transportation,
electricity, water and government services—will have more than 0.5 percent growth due to broadband.
Interestingly, the communications industry is expected to gain 0.46 percent in output from broadband,
which is less than the expected gain in the top six sectors. Despite these estimated gains, the authors of
the study believed “they most likely underestimate the full impacts of applications, processes and
business models that are only available with a high speed and quality service.”19 Overall, the benefits
across all sectors help to demonstrate the significant network effects of broadband.

The study also surveyed 540 businesses across the 17 industry groups with annual revenues ranging
from less than AUD 5 million to over AUD 1 billion, finding that 57 percent expected that the NBN will
change the way they communicate with suppliers and customers while 55 percent believed that their
online capabilities will definitely or likely be enhanced by the NBN.20

Canada
Over the last several years, broadband access studies in Canada have focused on the importance of
broadband for economic growth and development, particularly in rural areas. In 2005, for example,
Industry Canada commissioned a survey to be conducted in the rural areas of British Columbia regarding
subscribers’ views of the significance of broadband access. More than 80 percent of all business
respondents “reported that absence of broadband would affect their businesses negatively” and over 18
percent stated “they could not operate their businesses without broadband.”21 Additionally, according
to business owners’ self-reported figures, broadband increased productivity by 62 percent and there
was “a majority indicating an increase in productivity of more than 10 percent.”22 Overall, the study
showed that, even prior to 2005, broadband had become a significant competitive factor for businesses
in rural British Columbia.23
An earlier study on broadband investment, conducted in the township of Dundas, Ontario in 2003,
showed that investment in fiber optic network infrastructure of CAD 1.3 million resulted in CAD 25.22
million “increase in GDP for Dundas County and CAD 7.87 million increase for the Province of Ontario,”
as well as the creation of 207 new jobs.24 The researchers also found that the new fiber lines directly
contributed to an additional CAD 3.5 million in provincial tax revenues and CAD 4.5 million in federal tax
revenues.25
China
Between 2010 and 2013, China’s network operators, China Unicom, China Telecom and Chi na Mobile,
are expected to invest an estimated CNY 62.billion (USD 9 billion) in the creation of a single fixed
broadband access network providing speeds of 1 Mbit/s or more.26 These investments seem justified
given the fast growth of the number of fixed broadband subscribers: it is expected to reach 182 million
by 2013, which represents growth of nearly 77 percent between 2010 and 2013.27
Set against these figures, the impact of broadband on China’s GDP is anticipated to be substantial. As
such, China’s “dial-up and broadband Internet together may contribute a combined 2.5 percent to GDP
growth for every 10 percent increase in penetration.”28
Germany
Under Germany’s National Broadband Strategy, 75 percent of households are expected to have
broadband access of at least 50 Mbit/s by 2014. By 2020, 50 percent of German households will have
100 Mbit/s access while another 30 percent will have 50 Mbit/s broadband access. A 2009 study on the
economic impact of the National Broadband Strategy found that investments in the network are
expected to result in a contribution of EUR 18.8 billion to Germany’s GDP between 2010 and 2014.29 By
2020, Germany’s ultra-fast broadband network will contribute an additional EUR 14.6 billion in GDP.
The study further found that from an “incremental economic growth standpoint, network construction
would yield additional value added of 33.4 billion Euros, while network externalities will result in
additional 137.5 billion Euros.”30
India
A study released by Analysys Mason in December 2010 on the deployment of wireless broadband in
India found that each percentage point increase in mobile broadband penetration in India could
increase India’s GDP by INR 162 billion (USD 3.8 billion), or 0.11 percent, by 2015.31 The study further
indicated that if the Indian Government allocates an additional 5 MHz of 3G spectrum to each licensee,
the broadband penetration rate would likely increase 3.3 percent.32 This could result in an increase of


                                                   14
INR 538 billion (USD 12.7 billion) of GDP, in addition to the case that no additional allocation is made,
translating into an additional 3.3 percent growth in GDP by 2015.33
The study also estimated significant improvements to other sectors within the wireless broadband
ecosystem by 2015 regarding content, applications, service models and device categories:34
       82 percent increase in the consumer/retail sector, including mobile advertising, entertainment
        and commerce.
       67 percent increase in the financial services sector, including mobile banking.
       101 percent increase in social services, including mobile learning, health and government.
Latin America and the Caribbean
A study of 24 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean found that, controlling for educational and
developmental starting levels, a “1 percentage point in broadband penetration can generate 0.0178
percentage points in GDP growth” (i.e., 10 percent increase in broadband penetration results in 1.78
percent increase in GDP).35 Based on this figure, it was estimated that the contribution of broadband to
GDP growth throughout Latin America and the Caribbean was 3.4 percent between 2009 and 2010.36
The study also found that from 2007 to 2008, the growth of broadband access in Latin America and the
Caribbean contributed between USD 6.7 billion and USD 14.3 billion to the economies, taking into
account both direct and indirect effects.37
South Africa
In July 2010, the South African Government issued the Broadband Policy for South Africa, which aims to
provide 256 kbps download speed to 15 percent of the country’s households with broadband being
within 2 km of the remaining households by 2019.38 A 2010 study by Analysys Mason reviewed the
likely direct and indirect effects the broadband policy might have on South Africa’s economy, finding
that wireless broadband is expected to increase the country’s GDP by 1.8 percent, or over ZAR 72 billion
(USD 9.4 billion) by 2015.39 In addition, wireless broadband is expected to create about 28,000 new jobs
directly, not including further jobs outside the communications industry.40
Thailand
A 2010 study of broadband in Thailand noted that even without a formal broadband plan or policy —the
“business as usual” (BAU) path to broadband access (considering fixed and wireless connections with
speeds of at least 256 kbit/s) would result in a broadband penetration rate of 17 out of 100
households.41 This is expected to add nearly 1 percent to the country’s GDP growth by 2015.42 The
study notes that while “this increase will contribute marginally to Thailand’s economy, it represents a 50
percent to 60 percent lower broadband penetration rate than what we can expect from most other
Asian peer nations by 2015,” which is likely to leave Thailand at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis its
neighbors.43
The study noted that if a broadband plan is implemented that provides “meaningful broadband,” the
penetration rate in Thailand may nearly double by 2015, with 80 percent of this penetration based on
wireless broadband technologies.44 Based on this broadband projection, mobile broadband “would
drive new investments, expand the domestic economy, and bring a rise to GDP of as much as 2.4
percent per year, all other things being equal.”45 As such, broadband has the potential to be a “meta-
driver” of “overall macroeconomic growth, rather than merely a driver of ICT industries alone.”46

1.3.3 Broadband, Employment and Job Creation
Broadband enables job creation through three main channels: 1) direct jobs created to deploy the
broadband infrastructure; 2) indirect and induced jobs created from this activity; and 3) additional jobs
created as a result of broadband network externalities and spillovers.47 Each of these channels includes
the employment of unskilled, skilled and highly skilled workers. Direct jobs relate primarily to civil works
and construction of broadband infrastructure, which involves more low-tech positions. Indirect and
induced jobs require various levels of skilled workers. However, network-effects (i.e., spillover) jobs are
mainly high-skill jobs requiring specific technical knowledge and education. Indeed, broadband spillover
employment effects are not uniform. Instead, they tend to concentrate in service industries, such as
financial services, health care, etc. It can also produce some effects in middle-skills jobs, such as in
manufacturing, but usually related to the use of ICT, requiring ICT-skills.
Numerous studies have estimated the impact on broadband in each of these job creation categories for
specific countries by calculating employment multipliers for each of the categories (Table 1.2). While
these studies are country-specific and cannot be applied directly to other nations, they provide an
estimate of the potential employment gains that could result from effective broadband development. A
simple average of these estimates indicates that potential broadband job creation results in 2.78
indirect and induced jobs per direct broadband construction job created and 1.17 spill-over additional
jobs created per direct job. This means that broadband can create between 2.5 and 3 additional jobs
per direct broadband employment. Some studies have estimated the impact of broadband on the
employment creation rate. For instance, Katz estimated that an increase of about 8 percentage points
of broadband penetration in 12 Latin American countries could result in almost 8 percent increase on
average over their employment rate.48

It should be noted that although broadband is likely to have overall positive effects on job growth, short-
term job losses may result from broadband-enabled improvements in productivity due to process
optimization and capital-labor substitution. Various studies have confirmed that broadband creates
many more jobs than it displaces in the longer term. For example, the OECD has found that increased
broadband penetration rates can significantly affect labor productivity; raising broadband penetration
five percentage points has yielded an estimated 0.07 percent increase in labor productivity.55 Similarly,

                                                        16
Booz & Company found that “10 percent higher broadband penetration in a specific year is correlated to
1.5 percent greater labor productivity growth over the following five years.”56 By simultaneously
lowering the costs of doing business and increasing productivity, broadband can be instrumental in
promoting the growth of enterprises.57
As with broadband’s effects on GDP, further data collection and analysis are needed to confirm the
positive impact that broadband has on employment growth. Yet, aside from the studies identified
above, researchers focusing on various regions and outcome measures have reported more evidence of
how broadband development has stimulated the job market.
A European Commission study found that broadband had a positive impact on employment in 2006 with
a net creation of 105,000 jobs throughout Europe due to broadband deployment.58 A nationwide study
in the United States examined how broadband deployment affects job creation, determining that the
availability of broadband at a community level increased employment growth by more than 1 percent.59
Another study focusing just on the state of Kentucky in the southern United States found that a 1
percentage point increase in broadband penetration increased employment by 0.18 points, with the
increase ranging from 0.14 percent to 5.32 percent depending on the industry sector.60
In Malaysia, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) estimated in 2008
that achieving 50 percent broadband penetration by 2010 could increase the country’s GDP by 1
percent, as well as create 135,000 new jobs. The regulator further projected that by 2022, the number
of jobs created would reach 329,000, again based on 50 percent broadband penetration rate.61 An
evaluation of multiple studies showed that for “every 1000 additional broadband users, roughly 80 new
jobs are created.”62

1.3.4 Broadband as a General Purpose Technology
The importance of broadband might only be fully realized once it is understood as a general purpose
technology (GPT). While the notion of broadband as a GPT has been addressed only in recent
discussions of broadband and development, as well as in government-funded stimulus plans, the
concept of GPTs was introduced on a more general basis already in the 1990s. It includes three key
characteristics:
       Pervasive use in a wide range of sectors;
       Technological dynamism (inherent potential for technical improvements); and
       As GPTs evolve and improve, they spread throughout the economy, bringing about general
        productivity gains.63
In broad terms, GPTs are technologies that enable new and different opportunities across an entire
economy, rather than simply addressing one problem or one sector. According to the OECD, GPTs
“fundamentally change how and where economic activity is organized.”64 Common examples of GPTs
include electricity, the internal combustion engine and railways.
Although the initial conception of GPTs did not include the ICT sector, later research has considered ICTs
(with broadband as the enabling platform) through the lens of the GPT concept. This view of broadband
as a potential GPT has also been embraced in publications from, or on behalf of, the World Bank,
infoDev and the European Commission, as well as in academia.65
When taken holistically, broadband as a platform—coupled with services, applications, content and
devices—has the potential to satisfy the three criteria mentioned above, so that it can be considered a
GPT. First, broadband can be used as a key input in nearly all industries. Second, broadband has the

                                                    17
potential for technological dynamism through the development of new technologies, as well as
improvements to the capacity and speed of broadband systems. For example, the average global
broadband (wireline and wireless) speed in mid-2011 was 2.6 Mbit/s, with the top 20 countries having
average speeds of over 7.6 Mbit/s, which allows services and applications requiring higher bandwidth,
such as streaming video, to develop and become accessible to users.66 Third, broadband has the
potential to enable and engender new organizational methods that result in more general increases in
productivity. Global architecture firms, for example, may have offices around the globe, but team
members working on a new building design no longer have to be in the same place or even the same
time zone. By using broadband connections to share work products, the team can be completely
decentralized.
As broadband’s potential as a GPT is realized, it becomes an enabler of technology-based innovation and
growth throughout the economy by businesses and individuals, as well as by academic, governmental
and other institutions. Businesses and individuals are able to use currently available broadband
technologies and services to create entirely new applications and services in areas such as advertising, e-
commerce, online video, social networking and financial services, including online banking and loans.67
Innovation in these areas is important for the growth of new markets in developed economies and for
the transfer of technology to emerging economies, which can benefit from e-services, such as mobile
health and mobile banking.68 Broadband-enabled services also allow the public sector to access new
communities and regions, as well as deliver higher quality services more efficiently, including online
education, telemedicine and civic participation. In the following several specific examples of how
broadband can enable growth in and beyond the ICT sector in both developed and developing countries
are provided. Five common themes are discussed: improved research and development efforts,
reduction in business costs through cloud computing, improved productivity in the retail, services and
manufacturing sectors, and improved outcomes in education and health care.
Research and Development throughout Economic Sectors
Broadband can have a particularly strong impact on research and development (R&D) leading to
innovative technologies, as well as enabling new ICTs to lead to further innovations. Additionally,
broadband may allow businesses to move more rapidly in the product development cycle from the idea
stage to final product.69 For example, a company could have teams in various locations around the
world working on related portions of the same project, using broadband connectivity to provide
seamless communication and information sharing (see Box 1.2).
Box 1.2. Examples of the Potential Impacts of Broadband on Innovation in R&D

    Enable instant sharing of knowledge and ideas
    Lower barriers to product and process innovation via faster and less expensive communications
    Accelerate start-ups
    Improve business collaboration
    Enable small business to expand their R&D and collaborate in larger R&D consortia
    Reduce time from idea to final product
    Foster greater networking
    Promote “user-led innovation”

Increasing broadband penetration may also enable more than just large firms, governments and
academic research institutions to develop innovative products. For example, Apple’s iPhone App Store
has over 100,000 registered application developers, most of which are small companies.70 Since the App
Store opened in 2008, Apple has paid app developers over USD 2.5 billion.71
Cloud Computing: Reducing Costs for Businesses
For enterprises of all sizes, the costs of IT infrastructure, including hardware, software, and technical
support, can be significantly reduced with the adoption of cloud computing technologies. Cloud
computing generally allows for instant access to and storage of applications and data via broadband
connectivity. Currently, almost every traditional business application has an equivalent application in
the cloud, which means that cloud services can effectively replace the more conventional, and typically
more expensive, method of accessing and storing applications and data through software installed
locally on one’s own computer or in-house server.72 Additionally, cloud computing reduces or
eliminates the need for on-site IT staff since these data processes are handled remotely. Other potential
benefits of cloud computing for businesses include:73
       Reduced need for up-front investment since cloud-computing is typically based on a pay-as-
        you-go pricing model;
       Lower operating costs since the service provider does not need to provision capacities
        according to the peak load;
       Easy access through a variety of broadband-enabled devices; and
       Reduced business risks and maintenance expenses, as business risks (such as hardware failures)
        and maintenance costs are shifted to infrastructure providers, who often have better expertise
        and are better equipped for managing these costs and risks.
In 2011, Harvard Business Review Analytic Services conducted a global survey of nearly 1,500 businesses
and other organizations on their current and planned use of cloud computing, as well as the perceived
benefits and risks associated with cloud computing services.74 About 85 percent of respondents stated
that their organizations will be using cloud computing tools on a moderate or extensive basis over the
next three years in order to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing, including improved
speed and flexibility of doing business, lower costs and new avenues for growth, innovation and
collaboration. Only seven percent of respondents stated that their businesses had been using cloud
computing for over five years; however, these early adopters reported that real business value had
already been created, including faster time to market, lower operation costs and easier integration of
new operations.
In addition, cloud computing itself can provide for new business models and avenues for revenue. For
example, Amazon, the largest U.S. online retailer, began offering cloud computing services to businesses
and individuals in 2002 because the company had excess computing and storage capacity.75 In order to
accommodate the busiest shopping week of the year in the United States, Amazon had to purchase a
much larger amount of capacity than was required for the rest of the year. Rather than let the extra
capacity go unutilized, Amazon began renting out its system to others, thereby becoming a “utility” for
computing services.
Despite the promise of cloud computing as a source of substantial cost savings for enterprises, there are
various issues that may limit its impact, particularly lack of access to broadband services. Cloud
computing requires access to fast, reliable and affordable broadband in order to achieve its maximum
functionality. In addition, cloud computing raises several network and data security concerns.76 Other

                                                   19
significant concerns include reliability of the technology, lack of interoperability with existing IT systems
and lack of control over the system.
Retail and Services Sectors
Particularly for the retail and services sectors (that is, customer relations averages 50 percent or more of
a company’s activities), broadband can improve the ability to reach new customers and maintain
contact with existing customers.77 As such, the ability to send multimedia email or use targeted online
advertising to keep and attract customers can increase a company’s sales while using less capital and
labor inputs than would be required for postal mailings or door-to-door sales calls. Broadband also
enables self-service websites, such as online airline reservations or e-government services, as well as
remote services such as online technical support and video conferencing.78 For example, broadband is
essential for developing countries, particularly India, Mauritius, and China, which are the main off-
shoring destinations for IT technical support and business process outsourcing.79
In addition, sophisticated services, enabled by broadband and the development of ICTs, have become
not just a traded input for goods, but a final export for direct consumption.80 Success stories such as
call centers in Kenya, business consulting and knowledge-processing offices in Singapore, accountancy
services in Sri Lanka, and human resources processing firms in Abu Dhabi are different forms of this
phenomenon. Recent research has found that sophisticated service exports are becoming an economic
driver of growing importance in developing countries and may be an additional channel for sustained
high growth.81 The deployment and adoption of broadband also has the potential to provide an
additional conduit for economic growth through service exports.
Manufacturing and Industrial Sectors: Supply-Chain Management
Broadband allows businesses to more efficiently manage their supply chains by automatically
transferring and managing purchase orders, invoices, financial transactions and other activities.82 As
with any information-based business activity, broadband can enable faster, more secure and more
reliable processing than previously possible. Broadband connectivity saves processing and transfer time
along the supply chain, and it can also substantially increase competitiveness by helping businesses
reduce stock levels, optimize the flow of goods and improve the quality of final products.83 Since
manufacturing and industrial sectors have been the main driver of overall economic growth in
developing countries for the last 15 years, broadband is expected to play a vital role for them in
improving productivity in these sectors and in ensuring the ability for companies to effectively compete
in a global market.84
Education: Building Human Capital
In order to fully realize broadband’s potential for economic growth, it is necessary to have an educated
workforce trained in the use of ICTs. Additionally, there is a self-reinforcing effect between education
(and technological literacy in particular) and broadband adoption, since broadband can help improve
fundamental educational outcomes, including learning how to better use broadband. For example, the
services and applications available over broadband networks have been shown to improve basic
educational performance in a review of 17 impact studies and surveys carried out at national, European
and international levels by the European Commission.85 These studies found that broadband and ICTs
positively impacted learning outcomes in math, science and language skills.86 In addition to facilitating
basic skills, broadband improves the opportunities for those with ICT training; they generally have a
higher chance of finding employment, as well as higher earning potentials.87 Bridging the connectivity
divide is critical to ensuring that today’s students—and tomorrow’s high-tech workforce—can take
advantage of these benefits.


                                                     20
One way to expand access to broadband and ICTs in rural and remote areas is through the deployment
of mobile education labs: vehicles fitted with broadband connectivity, computer equipment and learning
facilities.88 They allow educators to drive to various schools throughout the week. In addition, these
mobile labs can provide ICT training for adults to improve digital literacy. As opposed to transporting
children in rural areas to where broadband facilities exist or waiting until the network is built out to
them, mobile facilities offer a more cost-effective way to reach rural populations.89 The United Nations
has noted the success of mobile schools in Mongolia, where 100 mobile “tent” schools have been
introduced in 21 provinces, as well as in Bolivia.90 Bolivia has implemented a bilingual education
program for three of the most widely used indigenous languages, which has been expanded to include
indigenous children in remote areas.91 In Morocco, the government implemented a program called
NAFID@ to help over 100,000 teachers afford wireline or mobile broadband connections, which has
allowed the teachers to receive training in the use of ICTs in the classroom, as well as to use e-learning
programs and online libraries to improve class lessons.92
Health Care Sector
Health-based broadband applications and services are significantly improving health and medical
outcomes around the world, particularly for patients in remote areas and those with limited mobility
through e-health and mobile health (m-health) initiatives.93 Considering that there are fewer than 27
million doctors and nurses for the more than six billion people in the world—and only 1.2 million
doctors and nurses in the lowest income countries—harnessing mobile technologies will be a valuable
tool for healthcare practitioners to reach patients. As mobile broadband develops and spreads in
developing countries, examples of the benefits are already becoming clear.94
Although basic voice and data connections can be useful in improving health and medical care,
broadband connectivity is necessary to capture the full potential of e-health services, including
telemedicine that enables real-time audio and video communications between patients and doctors, as
well as between healthcare providers. Improvements in telemedicine and other e-health initiatives rely
on increasing bandwidth capacity, more storage and processing capabilities and higher levels of security
to protect patient information.95 As noted in Table 1.3, the U.S.-based California Broadband Task Force
estimated that telemedicine will require speeds between 10 and 100 Mbit/s and high definition
telemedicine will require broadband speeds of over 100 Mbit/s.96 The current wireline and wireless
infrastructure in most countries is insufficient to take advantage of the e-health opportunities in the
digital economy. This is particularly important for developing countries where ensuring access to and
adoption of wireline and wireless broadband networks would be particularly useful for including those
who have been left out of more traditional healthcare models.

This was the case in Rwanda where a three-phase e-health project was delayed due to lack of high-
speed broadband connectivity.97 The first phase of the initiative, which established an electronic data
storage system that permitted sharing of patient information among three hospitals, was completed
without delay. However, the final two phases involving video conferencing and a real-time telemedicine
system were put on hold for a year until a broadband Internet connection could be established to
connect the three hospitals with a fiber optic cable network.98
Box 1.3. Mobile Health Services in Nigeria
In Nigeria, the government lacked sufficient public health information to efficiently allocate health care
services to over 800 villages that lacked primary health care. A public-private partnership, Project
Mailafia, was established to alleviate this situation. Project Mailafia sends teams of mobile health care
providers to remote villages, where they treat patients and collect health data that support better public
health decision-making and resource allocation. The mobile health workers collect the data on
ruggedized netbooks, and transfer the data to area clinics. The clinics then upload the data to a central
database using Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Wi-Fi technologies.

E-government covers a broad range of applications that transform government processes and ways that
it connects and interacts with businesses and citizens. This allows citizens to better participate in
society and improves the efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of government programs and
processes.99 Broadband is important for e-government as it provides the foundation for public
administration networks that allow processes to flow more smoothly.100 E-government can also help to
drive demand for broadband.

Countries around the world are providing increasing access to online services, including the provision of
basic services, the use of multimedia technology to promote two-way exchanges and consultation with
citizens on public policy issues.101 Although the Republic of Korea, the United States, and Canada take
the top three places in terms of number of online government services available, the UN found that
several countries have made significant progress over the last two years, including Bahrain, Chile,
Colombia and Singapore.102 The UN also found that the use of mobile phones for e-government
services, such as alert messages, applications or fee payments, are almost as popular in developing
countries as they are in developed countries.103

1.4 What Market Trends are Fostering Broadband Deployment and
    Adoption?
Broadband connectivity is expanding globally. Between 2005 and 2010, the average wireline broadband
penetration rate grew over 60 percent—from 3.3 to 8.8 subscribers per 100 people.1 As a result of such
growth, the estimated number of wireline broadband subscriptions surpassed 550 million by mid-2011,
up from 471 million in 2009.2 A sizable number of these new subscriptions come from Brazil, Russia,
India, and China (known as the BRIC countries), which have collectively doubled their subscriber base in
the last several years.3 The number of active mobile broadband subscriptions reached nearly 1.2 billion
by mid-2011, representing a 45 percent increase annually since 2007, with total mobile subscriptions
topping five billion.4 By the end of 2010, there were over twice as many mobile broadband as wireline
broadband subscriptions (see Figure 1.4).5

Despite these advances, a “digital divide” remains between developed and developing countries.
Technology fitting the needs of users is critical, but broadband deployment also depends on structural
market characteristics, such as competitiveness and purchasing power, as well as the evolution of
relevant (localized) content, international connectivity, geography, and several other factors. As shown
in Figure 1.5, there are nearly six times more wireline broadband subscribers in developed countries
than in developing countries and nearly four times more mobile broadband subscribers.6 In effect,
wireline broadband deployments in many developing countries are a decade behind those in developed
countries. Given the cost and resources required for the deployment of wireline broadband, wireless
broadband is more likely to be the broadband solution for users in developing countries, particularly in
rural and remote areas.

1.4.1 Trends in Supply
Developments in the types of technologies and business models used to deploy broadband network
infrastructure are allowing operators to supply more people at lower costs. In developed countries,
network operators are installing fiber optic cables closer to end users, reaching directly into their
neighborhoods, offices and homes. In developing countries, the spread of high-speed wireless networks
promises to gain momentum over the next few years. Wireless broadband is already more prevalent
than wireline broadband in many developed and developing countries. As noted in Figure 1.6, the
number of wireless broadband subscriptions in Africa, for example, is more than four times that of
wireline.7 In comparison, Europe’s wireless broadband penetration is nearly double the wireline
penetration rate at 26 percent and 54 percent, respectively.8 This suggests the potential for wireless
broadband in areas where traditional wireline infrastructure may be absent, as well as in areas with
substantial wireline build-out.
With the number of wireless broadband subscriptions worldwide surpassing the one billion mark in
2011, developing countries, particularly India and China, are often leading the way.9 Together, India and
China have the top five mobile operators in terms of total number of subscriptions, which is expected to
continue as mobile broadband grows.10

*Estimates

Another important trend affecting broadband networks is their ever-increasing speed. In 2011, Akamai,
a major Internet traffic manager, noted a global shift away from narrowband to broadband
connectivity.11 As shown in the figure below, the global average Internet connection speeds (for users
who pass through the company’s servers) rose 43 percent year-over-year to 2.6 Mbit/s, and all of the
top ten countries achieved average connection speeds well above the “high broadband” threshold of 5
Mbit/s.

A result of greater supply of broadband and improved technologies is the steady decrease in broadband
prices, generally for equal or faster broadband speed. In its report, Measuring the Information Society
2011, the ITU reported that among 165 countries studied, the retail price of “entry level” (i.e., 256
kbit/s) wireline broadband access halved between 2008 and 2010.12 In developed countries, these
monthly broadband subscriptions represented just 1.5 percent of income—for 31 developed countries,
a basic broadband subscription costs on average the equivalent of 1 percent or less of average monthly
gross national income (GNI) per capita. Comparatively, in 19 countries, most of which are least
developed countries, a broadband subscription costs on average more than 100 percent of monthly GNI
per capita. For example, the monthly price for a wireline broadband connection in Ethiopia, Guinea,
Malawi and Zimbabwe is over ten times the average monthly income. As such, the price of wireline
broadband Internet access in developing countries is substantially more expensive relative to developed
countries, which demonstrates that despite falling prices, broadband Internet access remains too
expensive for many around the world. While wireline broadband prices may be prohibitively high, they
are declining most rapidly in developing countries. The ITU found that the steepest reduction in retail
broadband prices has taken place in developing countries with wireline broadband prices dropping by
over 50 percent between 2008 and 2010, as compared to a drop of 35.4 percent in developed countries
(Figure 1.8).

In addition to overall increased availability, faster speeds and declining prices in broadband network
access, the release of new broadband-enabled devices may also be viewed as a supply-side input. The
overall trend for broadband devices is improved capabilities, mobility and portability. According to
research firm IDC, in the second quarter of 2011, global smartphone shipments grew 11.3 percent year-
on-year while the feature phone market shrank 4 percent over the same period.13 In Western Europe,
the number of smartphone shipments surpassed feature phone shipments for the first time.14 By the
end of 2011, over 450 million smartphones will be shipped, leading to the worldwide smartphone

                                                         32
market growing nearly 50 percent since 2010 as users upgrade to smartphones with more advanced
features.15 These devices are designed to take advantage of broadband connectivity, whether provided
by a mobile network or by Wi-Fi distribution of the wired broadband connection in a home, workplace,
or Wi-Fi “hotspot.”
Mobile Broadband for Developing Countries
While developing economies often do not have the type of infrastructure that is usually associated with
broadband deployment (that is, wireline access), the significant deployment and availability of mobile
services is proving to be an easier way for the developing world to shrink the digital divide. Access to 2G
mobile networks is now available to 90 percent of the world population and 80 percent of the
population living in rural areas. By mid-2011, 3G networks reached 45 percent of people worldwide.16
According to the ITU, people are moving rapidly from 2G to 3G platforms, in both developed and
developing countries, with 159 countries offering 3G services commercially by mid-2011, compared to
95 countries in 2007.17
Globally, there has been steady growth in the number of advanced mobile wireless broadband
networks. As of October 2011, 424 HSPA systems had been launched commercially in 165 countries,
including 152 commercial HSPA+ networks launched in 79 countries.18 By mid-2011, nearly 600 WiMAX
networks had been planned or launched commercially worldwide.19 Most of these WiMAX networks are
being deployed in developing countries and Africa regions. For example, there have been 120
commercial or planned WiMAX deployments in 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries and 117
deployments in 43 African countries.20
As mobile broadband subscriptions have overtaken fixed broadband subscribers, the continued
accessibility to mobile services has spurred the growth and deployment of broadband in the developing
world. Indeed, because of high penetration of mobile in the developing world, as the broadband market
matures, the majority of growth is likely to occur there.21
The immense commercial success of mobile telephone service attests to the attractiveness of
untethered access to users around the world. In the developing world, it is important to note that
mobile services are in many cases the first widely available two-way telecommunications technologies.
As such, while the appeal of mobility is certainly a factor, the choice for many users is not between
mobile and fixed service, but rather between mobile broadband and no broadband. In addition, in many
countries, particularly developing countries, the deployment of new access lines is time consuming,
costly, and yields unattractive returns. As noted in the case of India (see Table 1.4), there are
substantial cost differentials when comparing the costs of deploying broadband technologies.

Deployment of mobile broadband technologies is beginning to advance beyond 3G in both developed
and developing countries. In particular, LTE systems are capable of providing broadband speeds faster
than DSL and comparable to fiber optic networks. Regulators are assisting these developments by
increasingly permitting mobile operators to upgrade existing network infrastructure, as well as releasing
new spectrum bands for mobile services.
As of January 2012, 285 network operators in 93 countries were investing in LTE systems, including 49
commercial LTE networks launched in 29 countries (Figure 1.9).22 Although current commercial
deployments of LTE are focused in developed countries, there have been a few commercial LTE launches
in emerging economies, including Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates.23 LTE is in
the trial stages in many other developing countries throughout Latin America (e.g., Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay); the Asia-Pacific region (e.g.,
China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam); and the Middle East and Africa
region (e.g., Angola, Bahrain, Egypt, Kenya, Namibia, Oman and South Africa).

Towards Ubiquitous/Seamless Broadband Access
Perhaps the ultimate trend in advanced wireline and wireless broadband technologies is the ability for
users to access networks seamlessly, whether at work or at home, in shops or restaurants, on planes,
trains, at sea and in the most remote areas. Beyond the current and emerging terrestrial wireless and

                                                     34
wireline technologies being used for provision of broadband services addressed above, satellites are also
capable of providing Internet access, reaching the most remote locations. A new generation of satellites
was launched in the beginning of 2010 that are capable of providing true broadband speeds to end
users. The advantage of satellite broadband access is that it can extend broadband to those areas that
neither wireline nor terrestrial wireless providers can go. Collectively, terrestrial and satellite
broadband deployments will help to provide ubiquitous access and ensure that anyone has the option to
subscribe to a broadband service, as well as maintain connectivity regardless of where they travel. In
addition to ubiquitous broadband access, cloud computing services, which help to drive demand for
broadband, will enable a seamless broadband experience from any device, as addressed below.

1.4.2 Trends in Demand
The development of novel or enhanced applications, services and devices enabled with broadband
connectivity has served as a key driver of demand for broadband access over the past several years. The
availability of broadband networks has allowed at least a partial migration of existing services away from
more traditional models requiring consumers to conduct in-person transactions and/or abide by pre-
scheduled services (such as banking, education, healthcare, shopping and entertainment) towards
broadband digital networks that allow consumers to conduct a wide variety of activities online and on
their own time, regardless of standard business hours or scheduled programming. While many of these
same services saw an initial online presence with dial-up and other narrowband services, the rise of
broadband connectivity has facilitated the development of more robust applications and services.
Today, broadband networks allow consumers near-instantaneous access to on-demand entertainment
content; permit professionals to better communicate and collaborate with far-flung colleagues; and
create opportunities for students to access richer, more interactive educational materials. From the
perspective of organizations leveraging broadband-enabled services to better reach consumers, clients,
members and citizens, the efficiency of electronic communications has led to an increasing interest in
bringing traditionally offline or non-electronic services to the Internet, or at least augmenting traditional
means with online alternatives.
Innovative Applications and Services
Demand for more and higher-quality video and other rich content will be a major factor in driving the
demand for higher-capacity broadband access. In addition, applications are also increasingly driving
broadband use and development. Applications consist of function-specific software that delivers
content to users or allows them to perform certain tasks.24 Social media applications, which connect
users and allow for creative, collaborative, user-centered and interoperable environments in real time,
are also helping to drive demand for broadband.25 These applications include social networking, a wide
variety of Web 2.0 applications and cloud computing services, as addressed below.
Social Media and Web 2.0
Social media, which include YouTube and Facebook, are applications that facilitate social interaction,
using web and mobile technology. For example, YouTube, which allows users to generate video
content, upload it and share it with others, is one of the most widely used social media applications and
requires broadband capabilities to be effective. In 2011, some 48 hours of video was uploaded to
YouTube every minute, resulting in nearly eight years of content uploaded each day—equivalent to
240,000 feature films every week.26 Web 2.0 is closely related to social media and is a term generally
associated with applications that feature user-generated content and facilitate collaboration among
users.27 Web 2.0 applications—including web-based communities, hosted services, web applications,
social networking sites, photo and video sharing sites, wikis, blogs, mashups and folksonomies—are

                                                     35
interoperable, user-centered, and collaborative. Unlike the “traditional web,” they allow users to
generate, distribute and share content in real time and typically require broadband connectivity. The
availability of social media and Web 2.0 applications is stimulating demand and is an important factor to
bear in mind in developing demand creation or facilitation strategies.
        Social Networking
Social networking applications allow people to initiate and maintain connections, communicate with one
another via various media, including text, voice and video, interact through social games and share user-
generated and traditional media content. The highly personalized, easy, and flexible nature of social
networking applications makes them some of the most-used online tools and one of the main drivers of
broadband demand. Since these websites tend to offer only limited functionality with low bandwidth
Internet connections, they help to drive broadband demand among users seeking to take full advantage
of them. Non-adopters who may not have found broadband to be relevant in the past may seek out
broadband services in order to interact with family and friends, as well as discover and create other
engaging user-generated content.
Mobility is an important part of social networking. In December 2011, of the over 845 million active
Facebook users, more than 425 million accessed Facebook through their mobile devices and use
Facebook twice as much as their non-mobile device counterparts.28 Indeed, evidence already exists that
social networking applications are driving mobile broadband use in many countries. In the United
Kingdom, mobile operator Hutchison 3G released traffic statistics showing the amount of data
customers use when browsing social networking sites.29 The operator found that social networking
accounts for most mobile broadband usage in the country, with Facebook being the most popular
application. With the number of mobile broadband users surpassing the one billion mark in 2011, the
value of social networking driving demand for ever-increasing amounts `of data is substantial.30
Box 1.4. Impact of Facebook—Some Key Statistics
   Facebook has more than 845 million active users around the world.
   About 80 percent of Facebook users are located outside of the United States and Canada.
   Over 70 languages are available on the site.
   Over 700 billion minutes a month are spent on Facebook.
   Over 425 million people access Facebook via their mobile phone per month.
   48 percent of young people said they now get their news through Facebook.
   The average user is connected to 80 community pages, groups and events.
   On average, more than 250 million photos are uploaded per day.
   In just 20 minutes on Facebook over 1 million links are shared, 2 million friend requests are
    accepted and almost 3 million messages are sent.

Particularly in developing countries where mobile broadband is likely to be more accessible than
wireline broadband, social networking applications accessed through mobile devices are likely to be a
major driver of demand for broadband access. Facebook is actively reaching out to users without
advanced phones or networks, in the expectation that it will entice more advanced usage in time.31
India is now number two (after the United States) in terms of active Facebook users with nearly 43.5
million users as of February 2012, with Indonesia a close third with over 43 million users.32 One of the
reasons for Facebook’s popularity in Indonesia is that it is “a way to establish social status, success and a
platform for self-promotion.”33 This resonates with many people in developing countries where
Facebook has emerged as the leading application.34 Indonesia’s interest in social networking extends to

                                                      36
Twitter: around one-fifth of Indonesian Internet users access the microblogging application, equaling the
world’s highest penetration.35 All of this has spurred a demand for faster connectivity, with available
mobile broadband speeds rising to 40 Mbit/s.36
In general, the exchange of user-generated content, particularly through video-sharing sites, also helps
to drive broadband. Since social media focus on user-generated content, they are often quite localized,
meaning they are available in local languages and character sets and deal with topics that are locally
relevant. As noted in a 2011 survey by Pew Research Center, 71 percent of online adults in the United
States use video-sharing sites, which is a 38-point increase from 2006.37 For example, with more than
three billion videos viewed every day, YouTube has become the most popular online video sharing site
in the world.38 As Forbes magazine noted, the site is likely the “biggest television station on the
planet.”39 Not only does broadband access facilitate use of these social networking applications, but the
applications are major drivers of broadband demand.
Perhaps most indicative of future trends is that younger users report more frequent usage of video-
sharing sites, implying that, as younger users get older, the popularity of video-sharing sites among all
age groups will continue to rise. This trend is visible in data from the last five years, as shown in Figure
1.10. In each of these cases, broadband connectivity enables access to the media, information,
conversations or services that users are sharing. While some of these services may function over a
narrowband connection, most are intended for the always-on, high-speed connectivity of broadband.

As another important social networking application, Twitter, an application that allows users to
broadcast short text messages, had over 100 million registered users worldwide in 2011.40 Formed in
2006, it is already a powerful tool for the organization of social and political activities across the world.41
In particular, Twitter and other social media helped play a pivotal role in the 2011 so-called “Arab
Spring” uprisings. Protest organizers used Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, in addition to texting and

                                                       37
similar narrowband technologies, to coordinate protest activities. Social media facilitated the spread of
information about citizens’ grievances through YouTube videos and conversations on social networking
websites when official or traditional media sources may not have given those grievances much or any
coverage. These online tools are now firmly embedded within a more expansive media ecology that
includes traditional sources such as radio, as well as popular satellite television stations.
Indeed, there is much interest in user-created content created outside of professional routines and
practices. The OECD predicts that the popularity of user-created content will likely continue to grow,
with new drivers furthering its creation and use. Specifically, consumers will increasingly use mobile
devices to watch and create user-created content, with higher uplink data transmission speeds and
other consumer devices allowing easier content upload.42 All this means that the demand for mobile
broadband devices capable of video capture and sharing will only grow.
        Social Collaboration: Wikis, Mashups, and Crowdsourcing
Web 2.0 applications allow for more than simply connecting with others—they also allow for people
anywhere in the world to collaborate: they can create content through blogs and podcasts; co-create
content, for example, through wikis; link different types of content from different sources together to
create new media (e.g., mashups); or use social tags to identify folksonomies. Additionally, Web 2.0
applications often have strong network effects in which websites become more useful as more people
participate (e.g., Wikipedia entries or reviews of products on Amazon).
Although perhaps to a lesser extent than social networking applications, these social collaboration tools
help to increase the demand for broadband services by engaging users and making the online
experience more personalized and flexible. Often, they draw on the idea of the “wisdom of the crowd,”
which refers to practices where opinions and information are collectively created rather than arrived at
by the views of a single or small group of experts.
   Wikipedia is a well-known example of such social collaboration. The popular collaborative
    encyclopedia is multilingual, web-based, free to access and written by Internet volunteers, most of
    whom are anonymous. Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia
    articles, and there are currently more than 82,000 active contributors around the world who are
    creating and editing over 19 million articles in 270 languages.43 Launched in 2001, Wikipedia is now
    available in over 280 languages—the English Wikipedia contains nearly 3.9 million distinct articles,
    followed by German with 1.36 million and French with 1.21 million44, though many languages native
    to developing countries remain under-represented. .45
   Users can also create mashups, which are interactive Web applications that integrate content (e.g.,
    video, text, audio or images) retrieved from third party data sources in order to create new and
    innovative services and applications.46 Mashup websites tend to rely on external websites that use
    open source application programming interfaces (APIs), which expose all of the instructions and
    operations in an application to facilitate the interaction between different software programs.
    Mashups may be as simple as a restaurant’s website embedded with a single API, such as a Google
    map to make it easier for customers to find it. Other mashups combine multiple APIs. For example,
    a web-based interactive restaurant guide could use APIs from sites with online reviews, photos, and
    maps to tell you the best places to eat in a given city and where to find them.
   Crowdsourcing is a type of web collaboration referring to the outsourcing of tasks to a large,
    undefined group or community (the “crowd”) through an open call for assistance, such as via
    Twitter, Facebook or a dedicated webpage. Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the Crisis Map
    of Haiti used crowdsourcing to coordinate relief efforts on the island. Those in need could submit

                                                   38
   incident reports via the organization's website, phone, SMS, email, Facebook, Twitter, etc., and thus
   request aid or even report missing persons. After being reviewed by volunteers, the reports were
   mapped with Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates in near real-time on a map also showing
   shelter sites and hospitals. These tools helped speed search-and-rescue efforts and provide vital
   supplies to those most needing them. The events in Haiti provide a model for how to deal with
   future disasters, both natural and man-made, as well as demonstrating a practical application of
   Web 2.0 technologies.
       Collaborative Working Tools for Businesses and Institutions
Businesses and institutions are taking advantage of Web 2.0 applications (often referred to as
“Enterprise 2.0”) to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as lower costs. Generally, Web 2.0
applications are not only less expensive, faster to deploy and more flexible than commercial or
customized software packages, but also offer built-in collaborative workspace tools that enable people
to interact across differences in time and space.47 These tools often center around “groupware” that
allows multiple people to work together on projects and share documents, calendars and other data and
to participate in video and audio conferences. Since Web 2.0 apps require large amounts of bandwidth
to download and upload the various types of digital media, a broadband connection is essential.
       Education and Web 2.0
Support for school connectivity programs can be strengthened through the use of Web 2.0 applications
in education. Even where virtual classrooms or other e-learning tools are in use, Web 2.0 tools can
replace or complement expensive Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) software to provide a more
flexible approach through the use of blogs, wikis, and other collaborative applications. For example, a
classic VLE involves the teacher sharing slides and resources with students through an enabling software
program. Web 2.0 applications, such as Slideshare for presentations, Google Docs for documents, Flickr
for images, and YouTube for videos, however, are capable of replicating the core functions of the VLE
software at no cost to educators or students.48 Open source and cloud technologies also allow for more
educational opportunities where fewer resources are available. For example, students without personal
computers can complete assignments at a university computer lab or Internet café via Google Docs.
Other services, such as Flat World Knowledge’s open source textbooks, allow professors to review,
adopt, and even customize textbooks for their classes, which students can then purchase in print format
or view online for free, further reducing the cost of education. Additionally, teachers can incorporate
blogging and wikis to encourage student participation and interaction.
A 2009 study by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission on e-learning initiatives in
Europe found that student and teacher participation in Web 2.0 applications supports technological
innovation in education and training by providing new formats for knowledge dissemination, acquisition,
and management.49 These tools increase the accessibility and availability of learning content through a
range of platforms that offer a large variety of educational material. Further, Web 2.0 tools support
new strategies for studying a subject matter by making available a host of dynamic tools for
transforming content and displaying information in different formats, as well as contribute to
diversifying and enhancing teaching methods. Students are able to have more personalized and flexible
lessons targeting their specific needs and are able to learn valuable networking and community-building
skills. Additionally, these tools allow collaboration among geographically dispersed groups and can
facilitate intercultural, cross-border, and cross-institutional exchange, while reduced costs allow for
institutions in developing countries to compete with those in other areas.

        Cloud Computing
While applications have traditionally resided on the user’s computer or other device, there is increasing
interest in hosting applications on remote servers, or in “the cloud.” Some cloud-based applications,
such as web-based email (or webmail), have been in use for several years, even predating widespread
broadband deployment. However, the rise of broadband has enabled more robust applications,
including productivity applications, such as the office suites offered by companies including Google50
and Microsoft.51 Some of the benefits of cloud-based applications include access to information and
documents from multiple locations, decreased processing power requirements for end-user devices, and
decreased responsibility for users to update and maintain applications. In particular, cloud computing
allows users to use any device from any network location to access uploaded files while keeping the
costs of software and data distribution very low.
Other cloud computing applications focus on file storage, independently of format. For example,
Dropbox is a digital storage service with over 50 million subscribers who can upload, access and share
documents, photos and videos from any location—up to 2 MB of storage is free while 50 MB is USD 10
and 100 MB is USD 20.52 Online retailer Amazon also offers cloud services to consumers and businesses,
allowing users to create a “personal hard drive in the cloud.”53 By January 2012, Amazon had hundreds
of thousands of customers in 190 countries storing 762 billion objects, which was nearly triple the
number of stored objects at the end of 2010.54 The rising popularity of cloud computing services can
help drive consumer demand for broadband since access to fast and reliable broadband is needed in
order to maximize the value of the cloud.
Compelling and Local Content
Ultimately, what motivates people to buy broadband services and devices is that they believe
broadband will enrich their lives, offer convenience, provide entertainment and improve their
businesses. The network infrastructures or policies in place to expand broadband access are less
important to end users on a day-to-day basis than the availability of relevant and useful online services
and applications that allow users to access, create and share content. What Bill Gates said about the
Internet in 1996 remains true today: “Content is King.”55 Attractive and useful content, as well as
context (with the development of location based services, which require broadband access), are perhaps
the most important underlying elements of broadband adoption.
The English language currently used for the majority of websites around the world;an estimated 56.4
percent of all websites are in English followed by German at 6.6 percent and Japanese and Russian at 4.7
percent each.56 Interestingly, when looking at the number of Internet users by first language, Chinese
was a close second to English in May 2011 (Figure 1.11) and is likely to overtake in the near future.
However, Chinese is ranked number six in terms of number of websites with about 4.5 percent of all
websites in Chinese. This discrepancy helps highlight how there can be a significant obstacle to Internet
and broadband use by non-English speakers due to the scarcity of content in their own languages.

Efforts to create content that is relevant and interesting, using the local language and character sets, is
expected to increase the demand for broadband services in local areas. For example, the Kenya ICT
Board in 2010 launched a grant of KES 320 million (USD 3.7 million) to promote the development of
relevant, local digital content and software by targeting entrepreneurs in the film, education,
entertainment and advertising industries. The goal of the project is to increase Internet penetration and
promote local content, which is viewed as a potential area for new revenues in the country.
In addition to direct grants for the production of local content, governments can support the
development of local content and applications in other ways, such as the development of standardized
keyboards, character sets and character encoding. This type of indirect intervention would have an
impact on the content available by enabling users to create content in their own languages.57
Additionally, translation and standardization of operating systems into local languages can help to
facilitate the development of local applications that are relevant and comprehensible to local users.58
Governments can also play an important role in developing local content and local applications by
directly creating local content and local applications in the form of e-government applications as
described above.
Some forms of user-generated content, such as YouTube videos, face fewer barriers to expression as the
speaker is recorded in his or her own language directly. YouTube is localized in 25 countries and is
available in 43 languages.59 This helps to overcome some of the barriers in content reaching a possible
community of interest, but not entirely, as content generated in languages other than those used in the
43 local versions or the worldwide version may encounter barriers in reaching an audience.
It is likely that greater amounts of local content will continue to become available in the near term. For
example, a website called d1g.com is a platform in Arabic for sharing videos, photos, audio, a forum, and
a question and answer facility. Launched in 2007, d1g.com is one of the Arab world’s fastest -growing

                                                       41
social-media and content-sharing websites, with more than 13 million users and 5.3 million unique
monthly visitors in mid-2011.60 It has 15 million videos, and streams an extensive amount of Arabic
videos—600 terabytes of data per month. Notably, nearly 100 percent of d1g’s content is user -
generated, with a small amount produced in-house. d1g.com became the most popular Arab social-
media site (after Facebook and Twitter) when a user created the “Egyptstreet” diwan during the
Egyptian revolution. During that time, unique visitors rose from three million to five million per month,
and visits per month grew from six million to 13 million.
Broadband-Enabled Devices
In addition to services and applications, the continual development and evolution of devices and device
use cases has been and will continue to be a key driver of broadband demand. The trends in device
development are to make them smaller, faster, less expensive and more useful with a wider range of
capabilities.
Portable Internet access devices, including laptops, smartphones, netbooks and tablets, can leverage
broadband connections to access services and applications in much the same ways as traditional
desktop PCs. Further, there is a growing trend toward connecting devices not traditionally used for
Internet access to online services and to connect devices to each other directly – an idea known as the
“Internet of Things.” A wide spectrum of services and applications are used by a variety of devices, each
enabled by broadband connectivity. As more devices are able to take advantage of broadband to
provide information, services or functionality in a more effective or efficient manner, they drive demand
for broadband service. Box 1.5 describes three trends in user devices that promise to alter the terrain of
the computing and communications industries, bringing them closer to converging.
Box 1.5. Three Trends in User Devices

Three trends in user devices have implications for broadband. First, traditional computers such as
desktops and laptops are becoming cheaper. A computer capable of multimedia functions and Internet
connectivity is much cheaper today, with prices dropping over 90 percent over the last decade. Indeed,
producer price indices for the computer manufacturing industry have plummeted since 1992 (see figure
below).

                                           Personal computers and workstations (excluding portable computers)

Second, mobile telephones are becoming smarter. Popular smartphones include handsets powered by
Windows or Linux derivatives. They both host applications and allow users to connect to applications
over wireless connections. A survey of business technology professionals found that more than a third
of smartphone users “occasionally or frequently leave their laptops at home in favor of their

                                                                              42
smartphones.” Over 700 million smartphones were shipped worldwide in the first half of 2011 with
double-digit growth expected in 2012.
A third development is the netbook—inexpensive portable computers that support simple applications
and Internet connectivity. Netbooks are increasingly being bundled with mobile broadband
connectivity. In the United States telecommunications service provider Sprint has bundled a netbook
for USD 1 for subscribers who sign a two-year mobile broadband service contract.
Pyramid Research predicts that netbooks will accelerate mobile broadband adoption among low-income
customers, estimating that mobile broadband subscriptions will rise by 25 percent after services go
below USD 20 a month and include ultralow-price netbooks. A growing demand for netbooks has led
microprocessor maker Intel to see rapidly increasing sales of its Atom microprocessor, designed for the
netbook market.

http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS22962811.

Portable Devices
With respect to the expanding universe of Internet access devices, the rise of portable devices is
generating significant new demand for broadband services, especially mobile broadband. While feature
phones continue to outsell smartphones, the latter are enjoying significant growth. Research firm IDC
has also found that the nascent tablet computing market is growing rapidly. For example, nearly 18.1
million tablets were shipped worldwide in Q3 2011 alone, representing a 265 percent increase over the
previous year.61 In a separate forecast, IDC predicted that combined shipments of smartphones, tablets,
and other application-enabled devices would overtake traditional PC shipments by mid-2011 as
complementary devices to PCs.62 By October 2011, however, it appeared that tablets had not yet
displaced PCs in terms of sales.63
It is important to note that the majority of tablet shipments in 2010 and 2011 were Apple’s popular iPad
and iPad2, which now have a 61.5 percent worldwide market share, while the first competing product
from a major vendor did not enter the market until the last quarter of 2010.64 The expected growth in
2011 tablet shipments reflects continued interest in the iPad, as well as further introductions of
competing products, many based on the Android operating system. However, IDC believes that the
non-PC devices are not necessarily replacing PCs, but rather are expanding the market for Internet
access devices. All of these devices are designed to take advantage of broadband connectivity, whether
provided by a mobile network or by Wi-Fi distribution of the wired broadband connection in a home or
workplace.
The explosive growth of wireless telephony services in the developing world has been one of the great
ICT success stories in recent years, and has brought about significant change in the way the world’s
population communicates and conducts business. With the low level of fixed telephony or broadband
connections in the developing world, it is expected that advanced mobile devices will provide a primary
means by which those in developing countries gain access to broadband. Thus, while broadband
services in much of the developed world began with PCs and laptops and expanded to mobile devices,
the pattern in the developing world is more likely to be the reverse, or may not even include a
significant role for traditional PCs and laptops.
                                                      43
Internet of Things
The Internet of Things can be characterized as the networked interconnection of objects, including those
that are not traditionally considered as Internet access devices. It includes the idea of machine-to-
machine (M2M) communications, in which machines or devices exchange information without the need
for human intervention. Beyond connecting consumer devices, such as household appliances or
cameras, the Internet of Things can also encompass connections to, for example, a wide range of
sensors, utility networks (the “smart grid”) and healthcare devices. The connection of everyday devices
and objects could enable a number of activities, including remote monitoring or activation of household
devices; automated reporting from networks of weather, geologic, or other sensors; improved vehicle
traffic management; and alerts to individuals or doctors regarding medical needs.
As stated in the U.S. National Broadband Plan, “the Internet of Things will likely create whole new
classes of devices that connect to broadband, and has the potential to generate fundamentally different
requirements on the fixed and mobile networks: they will require more IP addresses, will create new
traffic patterns possibly demanding changes in Internet routing algorithms, and potentially driving
demand for more spectrum for wireless communications.”65 As shown in Box 1.6, a number of countries
are deploying smart city initiatives around the world.
Box 1.6. Examples of Smart City Initiatives around the World

 The concept of an Internet of Things may be extended to encapsulate all of the major systems of a city.
 In such a “smart city,” transportation, public services, utilities, and other systems are interconnected
 and constantly updated to create a type of “living, breathing” organism. Businesses, residents, tourists,
 and government can all tap into this network to communicate with each other, glean information,
 identify trends, and even provide corrective action as needed.
 As advanced, Internet-connected devices become available and more ubiquitous, a number of smart city
 initiatives have appeared. In Barcelona, a municipal fiber-optic network complemented by a Wi-Fi mesh
 network facilitates smart city functions. Traffic lights, parking meters, surveillance and traffic cameras,
 and public lighting are all connected to the network. In addition, sensors throughout the city monitor
 traffic flow, parking availability, pollution, and noise and report to the network. Police officers, city
 planners, and even social workers can tap into this network for real-time information. Even trash
 containers are tracked using RFID tags; a pilot program measures the amount of trash produced per
 household to enable a “pay as you throw” program and optimize collection routes.
 In Venice, 10,000 kilometers of fiber optics and 120 Wi-Fi hotspots combine to enable a smart city
 platform that connects residents, businesses, schools, universities, museums, and city management. An
 RFID-enabled card allows citizens to access municipal buildings (including libraries, museums, and sports
 venues), use municipal transportation services, and even pay for items and services such as parking,
 tickets, and food. A similar service is available for tourists, allowing them to plan their visit and pre-pay
 for tours and services online. ARGOS, the Automatic & Remote Grand Canal Observation System,
 provides city managers real-time information of canal traffic and automatically detects and highlights
 illicit behavior.
 In India, a number of smart cities are being developed. For example, the Rajasthan government is
 collaborating with the Japanese government to develop Bhiwadi-Neemrana town in Alwar district as a
 smart city—part of a smart community development project. The aim is to integrate water supply, solid
 waste management, power production, and transportation systems to create an efficient city with a low
 carbon footprint. The project is being financed largely by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and
 Industry (METI) would finance the ambitious project, with additional support from India’s Delhi-Mumbai

Although the concept of the Internet of Things has been discussed for several years, and some devices
are deployed, it is fair to say that a global Internet of Things is still in the early stages of development. A
variety of stakeholders are taking steps to guide and advance development of multiple aspects of a
world where most humans are surrounded by perhaps hundreds or thousands of networked objects at
any given time. For example, the European Commission in 2009 adopted an Internet of Things Action
Plan66 intended to promote the evolution of the Internet of Things through technology standardization
and research funding, as well as protection of privacy, data and security. In June 2010, the European
Parliament followed with a resolution encouraging the development of the Internet of Things in
Europe.67 In July 2010, China’s vice minister of industry and information technology announced that his
ministry was developing a national Internet of Things plan. Further, the European Union and China in
May 2010 inaugurated a joint Internet of Things expert group.68
Beyond government plans to guide and promote the Internet of Things, private-sector companies are
also moving forward with technologies and solutions to develop and expand the Internet of Things. For
example, Hewlett-Packard’s CeNSE (“Central Nervous System for the Earth”)69 and IBM’s Smarter Planet
campaign70 both work to create networks of Internet-connected sensors that enable a feedback loop for
objects and people, and thus the monitoring and analysis of a wide range of environmental conditions
and data. The volume of data transmitted to or from an individual device may be miniscule, but if
billions or trillions of objects around the world are connected to the Internet, the result will be
significant data flows best that can only be handled by broadband connectivity. One Hewlett-Packard
estimate, for example, states that one million sensors, running continuously would generate 20
petabytes of data over a six-month period.71

1.5 How Can Broadband Development Be Supported?
Despite the rapid growth in broadband supply and the development of broadband-enabled applications,
services, and devices, there are also notable challenges. Whether within a particular economy or when
comparing nations or even regions, the more affluent and better-educated populations generally have
earlier and better access to broadband networks and services than the less-affluent and less-educated
populations. With the rise of broadband-enabled services and applications, and the increasing
migration of many aspects of modern life online, a lack of broadband connectivity can increasingly have
a negative impact on social and economic development by excluding those who lack broadband access
or do not see the relevance of broadband services.
Governments can employ a wide range of strategies and policies to support the development of
broadband, such as through market liberalization efforts including opening international gateways to
competition and the allocation of new spectrum for wireless broadband, including the release of the
“digital dividend” spectrum for commercial wireless use once a country’s digital television transition is
completed. To help government policymakers and private sector investors better understand the
various ways in which broadband networks and services can best be supported, it is useful to have an
overarching concept of how to think about broadband from a policy point of view. This Toolkit proposes
to view broadband as an ecosystem of mutually dependent and reinforcing components of supply and
demand. Viewing broadband as an ecosystem helps to encourage the development of coherent,
integrated policies that maximize the benefits of broadband across all sectors of the economy and
aspects of society.

1.5.1 Broadband Ecosystem: Framework for Deployment and Adoption
Under the ecosystem model (Figure 1.12), the supply of broadband network platforms is the first
necessary condition—broadband infrastructure must be available. However, demand for broadband is
just as important in order to make substantial network investments worthwhile. Additionally, the ability
for non-ICT sectors to use and create broadband-enabled services and applications boosts demand and
encourages further network deployments. Developing these synergies will largely determine the extent
to which broadband impacts the economy and serves as an enabling platform, and ultimately, as a GPT
that can act as an essential input in driving innovation and growth in all sectors.

Viewing broadband as an ecosystem helps define the likely roles that governments will need to play in
using broadband as a tool in ICT for development (ICT4D). Broadband is more than the supply of access
to networks and services, and thus represents a significant shift away from the models used with
telephones. To foster broadband markets, governments will have to move beyond their traditional
“push” role focused on supply-side growth in ICT infrastructure and development of the ICT sector.
A broader conceptual framework helps because it encourages a rethinking of the areas of focus for
broadband policies and strategies. It suggests that, in order to expand the ecosystem, governments will
have to design various policies and programs focused on different components of the ecosystem.
Countries might overlook the “demand facilitation” aspect of broadband strategies if they consider only
the supply of broadband connectivity. For instance, failing to consider the demand side, such as
promotion of useful applications and services, could lead to an incomplete policy or strategy.
There are various interdependencies among the components of the broadband ecosystem, and hence a
holistic approach to broadband development will tend to produce better results.                        These
interdependencies link the various components in multiple ways. Investments in high-speed networks
improve the quality of service and promote the creation of even more complex or bandwidth-intensive
applications. Similarly, the availability of various applications attracts more users by increasing the value
of broadband and supports wider investments in networks and quality of services. Widespread access
to services has also allowed users to create their own content, again driving the demand for high quality
services that can do more than simply ‘download’ content, but also allow sharing among users. Building
a high-speed telecommunications network is only the necessary first step in developing a broadband
system. A range of policies and programs are needed to promote and universalize the use of this
network by supporting the development of services and applications, encouraging users to go online
and taking steps towards wider inclusiveness.

                                                      50
Viewing broadband as an ecosystem fits with the growing recognition that government strategies need
to develop “push” measures that promote broadband supply, as well as “pull” measures focused on
building demand. Such pull measures can promote digital literacy, establish an enabling environment
(including an appropriate legal framework), and foster the development of applications (including local
content).
Broadband Ecosystem: Supply-Side Constraints
The basic elements of supply in the broadband ecosystem consist of four levels: 1) international
connectivity; 2) domestic backbones; 3) metropolitan and backhaul connectivity and 4) local
connectivity (see Module 2 for more on the broadband supply chain).1 At all levels, broadband
connectivity is expanding globally. The estimated number of wireline broadband subscriptions
surpassed half a billion in 2010, up from 471 million in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India and China (referred
to as the BRIC) countries doubling their subscribers in the last four years.2 The number of wireless
broadband users has also expanded rapidly with over 1 billion mobile broadband subscriptions in 2011.
Between 2002 and 2008 demand for international submarine cable bandwidth grew 54 percent a year.
And supply is rising to meet this demand: more submarine cables will be built between 2009 and 2011
than between 1999-2001, at the height of the telecommunications boom.3 Capacity will grow even
faster because technologies are able to squeeze more data into the same bandwidth.
In considering policies and strategies to promote broadband development, one important goal is to
ensure that access is available to the widest possible user base. This means that networks need to be
built out to reach as many people as possible. But facilitating broadband supply presents at least two
significant issues. First, there are areas in virtually every country that have no meaningful access to
broadband services at all. This problem is most pronounced in developing countries, which have seen
less investment in the construction of networks outside metropolitan areas. This situation has improved
in recent years with the spread of wireless networks, but there are still areas without network coverage.
Second, some areas have networks in place, but these networks are not capable of supporting
broadband speeds and services. These areas will need to be upgraded to provide broadband through
the construction of high-speed wireline networks and/or through advanced wireless networks (3G or 4G
services). In many developing countries, where wireless penetration can far exceed wireline
penetration, upgraded wireless networks capable of providing true broadband speeds are expected to
be the main supplier of broadband services.
On the supply side, the problem is not as simple as just building more networks; as operators roll-out
their broadband business plans, issues of cost, service quality (bandwidth/data speeds), and technology
choice will also play important roles in deciding how best to bring access to a nation’s citizens. Even
then, simply building more networks or providing access to all is not a guarantee of success—
governments may need to support broadband development by encouraging demand for broadband in
those limited instances where the private sector does not generate useful and relevant applications,
services and content.
Broadband Ecosystem: Demand-Side Constraints
For the demand side of the ecosystem, relevant, useful and innovative advancements in services,
applications, and content are important for encouraging adoption and use of broadband. As such, the
many demand-side components—including services, applications and content—are essential to
promoting a vibrant broadband ecosystem. While generally a distinction is made between services and
applications, as technology evolves there is likely to be overlap between them. For example, mobile
banking may be treated as a service or an application (and maybe even as both), depending on how and
what features are offered. In addition, electronic government (e-government) covers an entire range of

                                                    51
services and applications that transform government processes and modes of interacting with
businesses and citizens.4 The distinction, at least in terms of the ecosystem, may be irrelevant—what is
important is that these services/applications drive demand.
In order to improve access to broadband, stakeholders will need to consider approaches that can
alleviate cost concerns, improve digital literacy across societies and ensure the availability and
awareness of relevant content. There has long been discussion of a “digital divide,” the gap between
the “haves” and the “have-nots.” With the rise of broadband-enabled services and applications, and the
increasing migration of many aspects of modern life online, a lack of broadband connectivity can
increasingly have a negative impact on relative social and economic development.
Improving the availability of broadband networks only addresses one impediment linked to broadband
development. Even with networks in place and accessible, there are likely to be barriers due to lack of
demand and skills. This problem involves people who have access to broadband networks, but are
unable or unwilling to obtain service. Addressing lack of demand is important because low adoption
rates will leave networks underutilized. This has at least two implications.
First, from a network externalities standpoint, fewer users reduce the economic and social utility of the
networks. Where relatively few people can communicate online, the network externalities will be
reduced since there is a smaller number of potential customers for businesses to serve. This further
means that there may be fewer local businesses and consumers to offer broadband-enabled services
and applications, such as video streaming services (e.g., Hulu+), voice and video communications (e.g.,
Skype) and download services for a variety of applications like software, e-books, etc.
Second, low adoption and use will undermine the business case of any network—even those built with
public funds. Fewer users means that the cost of networks is spread over a smaller user base, making
them relatively more expensive to build and maintain/operate. Thus, it is important from the overall
goal of improving broadband development for governments to focus their attention on developing
policies that not only facilitate and encourage the building of broadband networks, but ensure that as
many people as possible can and do use them. Barriers to adoption vary and will likely not be the same
in all countries, but some broad categories are identifiable.
In studies conducted to identify barriers to Internet and broadband adoption, the primary reasons
respondents cite for not subscribing to broadband services can be grouped into four main categories: 1)
broadband is not relevant; 2) equipment or service is too expensive; 3) lack of training or comfort with
using broadband Internet services; and 4) broadband is not supplied.5 This is not to say that demand
inhibitors are exactly the same in all countries. The factors seen as impediments to adoption in some
countries may be less of a factor than in other countries, due to different social and cultural histories
and experiences, as well as different socio-economic conditions.6 Figure 1.13, which reflects survey data
collected from non-adopters of Internet services in Brazil and the United States, shows how some
factors vary in their importance in these two countries.7 Respondents in the United States, for example,
see digital literacy as a much bigger problem than respondents from Brazil who consider high cost to be
a larger issue. Therefore, each country must analyze and address the demand-reducing factors on a
case-by-case basis and tailor solutions to the individual problems.

With respect to social and political development, broadband can serve as an enabler of more effective
and efficient delivery of services and information. As an increasingly large percentage of customers (or
citizens, in the case of government services) take advantage of online services, the resulting savings or
revenues encourage an increasing number of private and public service providers to shift more services
online. However, an increasing reliance on online services will result in the exclusion of those
populations who lack broadband access or do not see the relevance of broadband-enabled services.
There are, of course, multiple levels and arenas in which broadband access enables social and political
interaction, whether casual communication on social networks, familiarity with the news or
entertainment of the day on a video-sharing website, or access to current government information and
services. However, as these online platforms become increasingly integrated into social and political
lives, it becomes more important for broadband to be widely available and accessible so as to ensure
the possibility of participating for all sectors of society. As Dr. Nicholas Gruen, former chair of Australia’s
Government 2.0 Taskforce stated in September 2010, a new facet of the digital divide is what he termed
the “participation partition,” in which citizens who are more active in online discourse have more
influence in their communities.8
Given the social and economic benefits of broadband access, the countries, communities, organizations
and populations that lack broadband have a greater likelihood of being excluded from important
economic and social developments. It is incumbent upon all stakeholders to pursue strategies to expand
broadband access in order to enhance the social development of citizens and organizations as well as
the economic development opportunities of communities and countries.
Absorptive Capacity
Addressing supply and demand are necessary conditions for the promotion of broadband network and
services, but by themselves they are still not sufficient to guarantee that broadband can reach its full
potential in the economy. For that to happen, broadband users (citizens, businesses and government)
must also have the capacity to understand, learn and apply the lessons learned about broadband’s
benefits and capabilities across the economy and society.
Absorptive capacity generally refers to the ability of an organization to recognize the value of new,
external information, to assimilate that information and then apply it to the organization’s benefit. This
ability is critical to an organization’s innovative capabilities, as new technologies are assimilated by
organizations to create, improve and transform business processes, products and services.9 As users

                                                        53
have the ability to become co-creators of content10 and as broadband user-led innovation is enabled11
this same concept can be extended to include other users of the broadband platform, including citizens.
Thus, to fully realize the benefits of broadband, the various sectors of the economy and society must
have the capacity to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit the capabilities enabled by this platform.
Under the ecosystem model, absorptive capacity is the mechanism by which the benefits obtained from
broadband feed into the greater economy, allowing this technology to unleash its potential as a GPT.
Policymakers can facilitate the capacity to understand and incorporate the many benefits of broadband
through the development and implementation of policies that are complementary to broadband build-
out. In addition, the private sector should be encouraged to adopt broadband as an input to drive
productivity, growth, innovation, and welfare throughout the economy and society.
Broadband alone has limited direct impact as a technological platform, but instead acts as an enabler.
As such, broadband holds the potential to significantly impact economic and social progress and
transform the economy. However, for this potential impact to materialize, broadband must be used by
businesses, government and citizens in ways that increase productivity in the economy.12 This requires:
1) that the creation and availability of broadband-enabled services and applications that increase
efficiency and productivity and 2) that businesses, government and citizens have the capacity to use
broadband-enabled services and applications in a productive and efficient way. These two requirements
are critical for achieving the potential economic impact that broadband can produce.
The economy’s capacity to absorb broadband depends on how the two requirements described above
are fulfilled in the economy. In a nutshell, a country’s absorptive capacity can be thought as determined
by:
    1. The capacity of business to create broadband-enabled services and applications and use these
       applications and services to transform their business processes to be more productive and
       efficient;
    2. The capacity of citizens to create and use broadband-enabled services and applications to
       increase their welfare; and
    3. The capacity of the government and other institutions (e.g., schools) to introduce and
       accommodate broadband-enabled services to deliver public services more efficiently and
       transparently to the public.
Components of Broadband Absorptive Capacity
Four components determine the degree to which a country’s economy is able to absorb broadband and
translate it into economic and social development. These components are: 1) the economy’s
macroeconomic environment; 2) the business environment; 3) the quality of human capital; and 4) the
governance structure (Figure 1.14). The macroeconomic environment determines the “broadband-
friendliness” of the economy and whether the economy and its main actors (i.e., businesses,
government and citizens) are open to using ICTs. The business environment, which includes access to
financing and diffusion of previous technologies, determines the ability of businesses and entrepreneurs
to create new broadband-enabled innovations, modify business processes based on these innovations
and update existing products, services and strategies using broadband and the broadband-enabled
environment. The quality of human capital depends on the ability of the labor force, businesses and
academic institutions to understand the potential of broadband and adapt their mindsets to the
broadband-enabled environment. Finally, the governance structure determines the degree to which
businesses and citizens are permitted to share and access information openly, as well as to share
broadband-based ideas and innovations. Additionally, governance addresses the security of investment

                                                   54
and the cost of creating new broadband-enabled business, services and products. Governance that
promotes the absorptive capacity of broadband generally requires free, open access to information and
abidance by the rule of law to protect investments. Although there are a wide range of elements for
each of the components of absorptive capacity, the following figure provides some important examples.

Degree of Broadband Absorptive Capacity
The degree of absorptive capacity in a given economy will determine the amount of broadband-enabled
economic development. Without strong absorptive capacity, the impact of broadband on economic
development will be limited or even non-existent (see Box 1.7 below). A country can have nationwide
broadband coverage and widespread adoption, but will obtain very little overall economic and social
benefit if absorptive capacity is limited. Conversely, in a country with relatively limited broadband
coverage or adoption, broadband can have a targeted impact on the economy if there is sufficient
absorptive capacity. Moreover, absorptive capacity can be targeted to specific sectors of the economy,
which has been the case with the IT and business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in countries like
India. This targeted absorptive capacity can then expand throughout the economy.
Box 1.7. Technological Absorptive Capacity

 An economy with a flexible facilitating structure that has an entrepreneurial business environment; few
 technological regulatory restrictions; an ICT-educated workforce; high penetration of previous
 complementary technologies (e.g., electricity); a business-friendly financing structure; and a responsive
 public policy structure will experience faster diffusion of broadband-enabled applications and services
 and larger economic and social impact. The impact of broadband-enabled ICTs on economic growth
 will be slower and smaller in an economy that lacks some of these elements or that delays the needed
 changes to adapt the facilitating structure to broadband-enabled ICTs (e.g., by not modifying the
 regulatory framework to eliminate technological restrictions or to facilitate their diffusion).

                                                     55
 In relative terms it can be put as follows: assuming that the maximum and fastest effect on the
 structure of the economy that a country can obtain from broadband-enabled ICTs is 100 (i.e., potential
 positive impact from broadband), the degree of absorptive capacity of the economy will determine
 how much and how fast that 100 value can be actually realized.
 Sweden and Italy provide a good illustrative example of how this mechanism works. Both countries
 have relatively similar levels of GDP per capita and an in-depth penetration of previous complementary
 technologies, such as electricity and telephone lines. However, the absorptive capacity in both
 countries was different. Sweden performed better in business environment and human capital. In
 addition, Sweden took a very active role in modifying the facilitating structure of its economy to allow
 for faster diffusion of broadband (e.g., by establishing a public policy to enable the diffusion of
 broadband and implementing e-literacy programs).

 There are many other factors in place that explain the better performance of Sweden’s economy in the
 diffusion of broadband-enabled ICTs, but what it is important to highlight is that Sweden actively
 adapted the facilitating structure of its economy to allow broadband to diffuse faster and broader than
 Italy did. As a result, the economic effects of broadband-enabled ICTs in Sweden have been larger and
 surfaced faster. For instance, from 1998 to 2007, average annual productivity growth has been much
 faster in Sweden than in other peer countries (2.32 percent vis-à-vis 0.39 percent in Italy and an
 average of 1.66 percent among OECD countries). Even though the source of this growth is not
 exclusively due to broadband, Sweden’s policy has transformed the country into a broadband leader,
 which has played an important role in its economic growth.

1.5.2 Lessons and Principles from Broadband Experience
There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach that will guarantee greater broadband deployment and adoption
in every country. Political and economic conditions vary, and each country is endowed with different
technological resources. Some countries have a relatively well-developed wireline telephone network
that could support broadband deployment, while others have widely deployed cable TV networks that
might be able to provide a measure of facilities-based competition from the start. In yet other
countries, there may be various regulatory, political, economic or other barriers to entry that prevent
potential competitors from offering broadband services or building broadband networks.
This variance makes it unwise to propose a uniform solution to promote broadband development. In
some cases, the challenge will be to create incentives so that widespread networks can be used to offer
broadband services. In other countries, the main challenge may be to find ways to educate potential
users about the benefits of broadband and train them to use broadband applications and services. As a
result, each country will face its own unique circumstances that will drive policy and investment

                                                     56
decisions. However, the key objective for governments is to pursue policies that will create an enabling
environment that will foster broadband development.
Development of Country-Specific Solutions
Important lessons can be learned from those countries that have pursued broadband development
policies (see Box 1.8Box 1.8).13 First, the focus in these countries has been on improving the incentives
and climate for private investment—a policy that even highly resource-constrained countries might be
able to follow (and many have successfully attained with mobile telephony). Many of the policies and
programs that have been developed support private sector investments and call for specific, limited and
well-justified public funding interventions only in exceptional circumstances. In particular, where
governments are trying to promote growth of underdeveloped markets, policies and regulations that
may reduce private sector investment should be avoided.
Government funding or policy should generally avoid having the effect of “crowding out” private sector
investment. For example, governments can encourage private investments in many cases without direct
subsidies, such as by developing passive infrastructure—ducting, towers, cable conduits, and opening
rights of way—which can significantly cut costs and create minimal market distortions.14 Public
investments should be considered only when no or insufficient private investments are expected for a
significant period. Furthermore, to maintain a level playing field for competition even with public
investments, governments should seek to avoid favoring one company (or access technology, e.g.,
telephony vs. cable) over another. For example, if and when governments intervene to increase
network availability, it may be necessary to ensure that subsidized networks are open access—meaning
that network operators offer capacity or access to all market participants in a nondiscriminatory way.15
This is the case in some countries, particularly Australia and South Africa, which have opted to create
publicly financed, state-owned enterprises to deploy nationwide broadband networks on a wholesale,
open access basis.16 Additionally, it is recognized that there may be cases where a dominant provider
may need to be appropriately regulated to avoid market concentration or other adverse impacts on
overall market competition.
Box 1.8. Public Sector’s Role in Fostering Broadband Development—Key Lessons
    Government should focus on maximizing competition, including removal of entry barriers and
     improving the incentives and climate for private investment.
    Government should provide for specific, limited, and well-justified public funding interventions
     only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where governments are trying to promote growth of
     underdeveloped markets).
    Government funding or policy should not compete with or displace private sector investment.
    Government should maintain a level playing field for competition even with public investments by
     avoiding favoring one company (or access technology, e.g., telephony vs. cable) over another.
    Subsidized networks should be open access (i.e., offering capacity or access to all market
     participants in a nondiscriminatory way).
    Government may need to regulate dominant providers to avoid market concentration or other
     adverse impacts on overall market competition.
    Government should eliminate barriers to content creation and refrain from blocking access to
     content, including social networking sites, or restricting local content creation.

Developing countries in particular will also need to identify ways to leverage limited resources to
maximize impact, prioritizing programs based on demand and market evolution, rather than shying
away from policy reform altogether. For most developing countries, the most effective approach to
promoting broadband development is likely to involve a mix of approaches and policies that rely on
private sector investment, coupled with regulatory reform that will promote efficient and competitive
markets (which will also increase private sector investment). Direct government intervention should be
limited to those cases where markets do not function efficiently (such as providing service to high-cost
areas) or where larger social goals are clearly identified (such as digital literacy training). The basic
principle remains the same: governments should only intervene based on sound economic principles,
where the benefits of intervention outweigh the costs. For example, particularly at the initial stage of
broadband market development, there may be a need for aggressive government policies to generate
demand, expand networks, and reach underserved areas and communities.
Factors and Policies Common in Countries with High Broadband Penetration
Some of the main factors common to all countries with high broadband penetration rates—particularly
levels of urbanization and wealth—cannot be addressed through broadband policy alone. Achieving
high broadband penetration in countries with large rural populations and low levels of urbanization is
generally more difficult than in highly urbanized countries due to substantially increased network build-
out costs. A country’s wealth also significantly impacts broadband penetration since wealthy countries
are better positioned to financially support the supply-side initiatives while consumers in those
countries are better able to afford broadband services, applications and devices. These non-policy
factors especially challenge many developing countries, which tend to have low levels of urbanization
and low income levels. For example, Sub-Saharan Africa not only has the lowest broadband penetration
rate of any region in the world,17 but it also has low urbanization and income levels—only 26 percent of
the population lives in an urban area while the GDP per capita is just USD 1,286.18 Urbanization, income
and other non-policy factors, such as education levels and degree of income equality, also impact
broadband penetration in developed countries. According to an analysis of 30 OECD countries, such
non-policy factors can account for roughly three-fourths of a nation’s broadband performance.”19
Regardless of a country’s non-policy factors, there are certain policy-related elements common among
countries with high broadband penetration rates that may be adopted in developing and developed
countries alike.20 The creation and implementation of comprehensive, national broadband strategies
are one the main common features among countries with high broadband diffusion. Market
liberalization and regulatory frameworks that promote competition are also a key hallmark of high
broadband penetration. Many countries have also supported broadband infrastructure deployment
through some degree of public financing. Additionally, policymakers in these countries have developed
broadband strategies, regulatory frameworks and public-funded initiatives in three main stages: 1)
focus on encouraging market growth by creating an enabling regulatory environment, such as by
reducing barriers to entry and supporting large infrastructure projects; 2) encourage competition among
private sector actors in order to drive growth, using a competition-based (ex post) regulatory framework
to provide market oversight and; 3) focus on ensuring universal access to broadband services as the
broadband market matures.21 Module 2 further addresses these and other policy approaches to
promoting the development of broadband.

   In particular, the World Bank defined absorptive capacity in the context of innovation as the quality of its labor
force and the business environment (including access to finance) in which firms operate and are able (or unable) to
start up, expand, and reap the financial rewards of their new-to-market innovations. See World Bank, Global

broadband-enabled services and applications and would also expand to the use of and creation by businesses,
citizens and the government of these services and applications to modify transform their behavior and processes
to be more productive and efficient.

2.1 Introduction
The development of broadband networks and services over the last decade or so has been largely
focused in developed countries. In that time, private sector investment, coupled with enabling polices
put in place through liberalization and regulatory reform, has driven the building of broadband networks
and the adoption of broadband services throughout the developed world. But as more economic and
social activity has moved onto broadband networks in recent years, developing countries are
implementing their own broadband plans and initiatives to realize the benefits that broadband can bring
to a country and its citizens.
As they consider how best to promote broadband, policymakers and analysts have come to realize that
broadband must be viewed as an ecosystem with supply and demand considerations (the ecosystem is
described in Module 1). On the supply side, the building of networks to carry broadband services is the
first priority. But simply having a network available does not guarantee that broadband services will
automatically be used. It will also be necessary for government policy and private sector investment to
focus on driving demand for broadband services—whether by putting more services online or educating
users on the benefits of broadband and the skills needed to effectively use the new services. Those
countries with the best success in broadband development have focused on developing holistic policies
to support both sides of the broadband supply and demand equation.
This module identifies the issues policymakers must address as they seek to create an enabling
environment for broadband and examines what policies and regulatory approaches may be effective in
encouraging broadband development. It is designed to provide an overall introduction to the issues,
policies and strategies that are discussed in more detail in subsequent modules and provides hyperlinks
to the modules where these issues are addressed in detail. These topics are also covered in the
Broadband Strategies Handbook, which is a condensed, but comprehensive, version of the Toolkit that
the World Bank has also made available. The cross-referenced modules and the Handbook analyze the
issues extensively, and provide many examples of how different countries have approached broadband
development. They deal respectively with the technologies that make broadband possible, how
broadband networks and services can be universalized, how demand for broadband can be stimulated
and what changes to policies, laws and regulations can help broadband reach its greatest potential.


2.2 The Public Policy Context for Broadband
As discussed in Module 1, broadband is a general purpose technology that significantly affects how
people live and work. It is a key driver of economic growth and national competitiveness,1 as well as
social and cultural development. Broadband-enabled cities can attract more services firms and so
create more jobs than their narrowband counterparts.2 Communities also benefit from faster Internet
access: their residents have enhanced real and virtual opportunities to communicate with each other
and to access government services and public officials. Conversely, countries, communities,
corporations, and individuals that lack easy access to broadband may miss economic and social
opportunities.
Recognizing the widening broadband divide and the risk that some groups may be missing out on the
economic and social benefits of broadband access and use, policymakers in a growing number of
countries are looking to encourage greater broadband development. Even some countries with well-
developed telecommunications markets and good broadband penetration are looking to universalize
broadband, sometimes as part of larger macroeconomic stimulus and development programs.

                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


The development of strategies and policies to promote broadband, however, is not an easy task.
Policymakers are quickly realizing that promoting broadband may be harder to achieve compared to
other types of services, such as mobile telephony. The usefulness of a mobile telephone is typically
obvious to consumers regardless of income or education level, and, coupled with relatively low prices,
such intuitive services have grown rapidly. But the same cannot necessarily be said of broadband—
especially if the opportunity to try it is undermined by high prices. Using broadband services requires
access to a computer or smartphone, and some way to pay for using the network—either through a
subscription (and often some form of term contract), a pay-as-you-go approach or through prepaid
services. In the absence of access through the workplace, school or community centers, this can make
ownership relatively costly (even with falling prices for hardware and subscriptions) for individual users.
In addition, understanding the benefits of broadband, and having the skills to make use of the available
services, requires some level of digital literacy, as well as basic literacy (i.e., the ability to read and
write). This section addresses the public policy context within which broadband development strategies
are made and identifies the challenges that policymakers and other interested parties may face in trying
to facilitate greater broadband availability and use.

2.2.1 The Public Sector’s Evolving Role in Broadband
The past decade has seen significant debate on the appropriate role for government in expanding
broadband diffusion. The public sector has played two general roles in promoting the growth of
information and communication technologies (ICT): 1) making markets more competitive, efficient and
accountable/transparent; and 2) ensuring equitable access for all. This has enabled the private sector to
lead the roll-out and investment in ICT. This same approach should be pursued with broadband
development. The role of government should be to enable, facilitate and complement market
development, rather than to substitute government decisions for market forces and public sector
investment for private investment.
Due to broadband’s importance, however, there have been calls to view broadband as a public good in
order to ensure affordable universal access and spread the benefits across the full range of economic
sectors.3 Based at least partially on a public goods analysis, some countries have taken more direct
action to promote broadband development, establishing initiatives and strategies where the
government intervenes more directly to promote, oversee and universalize their broadband markets.
This was particularly the case as a result of the economic crisis of 2008, as many governments came to
see broadband networks and services as a way to preserve and enhance their economies. In 2009, for
example, countries with different economic philosophies included broadband in their economic stimulus
plans (e.g., Australia), indicating that they were no longer averse to making strategic investments. By
2011, however, such policies were being increasingly called into question as government debt levels
rose, in some cases dramatically, forcing austerity programs and corresponding cuts in government
spending on a wide range of priorities, including broadband.

2.2.2 Technological Change and Convergence

New Technologies and Services Provide Opportunities and Challenges4
As policymakers and regulators consider ways to expand broadband infrastructure and stimulate
demand for broadband services, it is also important to remember that technologies, applications and
services will continue to evolve and present new challenges to the legal and regulatory underpinnings
for broadband development. Increased broadband access and use over the next decade will lead to an
even greater breadth of applications and services -- many of which are not yet commercially available,

or even conceived. This is likely to require policymakers and regulators to find ways to embrace these
new applications, while balancing competitive and regulatory goals.
More importantly, this change is likely to come quickly. For example, little more than five years ago,
YouTube was just beginning to become popular; it recently surpassed the four billion views a day
milestone on a global basis (as of March 2012), nearly double the combined primetime audience of all
three major free over-the-air television networks in the United States.5 Similarly, in its relatively short
history, Skype has become the equivalent of the largest “carrier” in the world based on registered users,
contributing 12 percent of world-wide international long distance traffic (see Figure 2.1).6

The development of such new services and applications may provide policymakers with lessons on how
to draw people to the Internet and broadband. A good example is the rapid rise of so-called “social
networking sites,” such as Facebook or Twitter. Such services have exploded in popularity among
broadband users and are becoming more and more popular in both developed and developing
countries. In fact, of the top 30 countries ranked by the number of Facebook users, fully half are
developing countries (see Figure 2.2.). In addition, as it has grown and evolved, Facebook has begun to
offer a wider range of services—from transferring personal messages and “status updates” to
exchanging photos to gaming–all of which gives users a wide range of things to use and do just within
Facebook itself. The popularity of such sites, and the many services they offer, can be used as a way to
show non-users the benefits of broadband use. However, it is also true that some of these new services
also raise new regulatory issues (e.g., relating to data protection and privacy) that may subject such sites
to increased regulatory scrutiny as governments seek to further define the rules for personal
information, etc.

Convergence Continues
As broadband technologies and services grow, so will the ability of users to create and share all types of
digital content. And as their drive to control costs and grow revenues gets stronger, providers will look
to new technologies and services to help them. Countries with policy and regulatory frameworks that
allow converging technologies to develop and markets to function well will benefit the most. With the
pace of convergence likely to increase, many countries are adjusting their policy and regulatory
frameworks to facilitate convergence.
Three main forms of convergence can be identified:
                                Service convergence, or “multiple play,” allows a firm to use a single network to provide severa l
                                 ICT services that traditionally required separate networks. Conversely, any individual service can
                                 be provided over many different networks.
                                Network convergence exists where a common standard allows several types of networks to
                                 connect with each other. Consequently, a communication service can travel over any
                                 combination of networks.
                                Corporate convergence results from mergers, acquisitions, or collaborations among firms. New
                                 business entities are created to offer multiple services (old and new) and address different
                                 markets.
Convergence has a significant impact because it alters market structure and dynamics. On one hand,
users are able to access a wider range of services, choose among more service providers, and produce
and distribute content. On the other hand, convergence allows service providers to adopt new business
models, offer new services, and enter new markets.
Policy frameworks that restrict competition or prevent convergence from playing out in a market lead to
suboptimal outcomes that may reduce the development impact of broadband. In the long term,


                                                                                                                                                                                 5

countries that resist change are likely to miss the benefits of improved technologies and services.
Countries that take a “wait and watch” approach might benefit if the frameworks in place do not pose
major immediate problems, but risks remain because converged networks and services typically do not
fit easily into traditional policy frameworks and both technologies and markets are likely to continue
changing quickly. Evidence suggests that the greatest benefits are derived in markets that seek to
facilitate convergence.
Expanding access to broadband, the demand for multimedia and user-created content, the availability
of inexpensive multimedia devices, and the drive to cut costs while increasing value from broadband
services are coming together to speed up the pace of convergence. All these trends are challenging
policymakers and regulators on several levels. First, there is the issue of how to treat similar services
provided by operators that had been traditionally separate and governed by different sets of rules. In
addition, there are numerous issues involved in market and competition law/regulation that depend on
specific market definitions and analyses that are coming under increasing scrutiny. Finally, as more and
more content and services move online, governments must also address what their role is in promoting
the demand for such services as part of an overall strategy to promote broadband development.

2.2.3 Defining the Challenges: Barriers to Broadband Growth
As policymakers and regulators consider approaches to stimulate and promote broadband
development, it is important to recognize the full scope of the challenges that must be addressed.
These challenges tend to be multi-layered and involve stimulating the supply of broadband
infrastructure and encouraging demand for broadband applications and services, as discussed in Module
1. On the supply side, the problem is not as simple as just building more networks; as operators develop
their broadband business plans, issues of cost, service quality (bandwidth/data speeds), and technology
choice will also play important roles in deciding how best to bring access to a nation’s citizens. Even
then, just building more networks or providing access to all is not a guarantee of success—governments
may need to support broadband development by encouraging demand for broadband in those limited
instances where the private sector does not generate useful and relevant applications, services and
content. As discussed in Module 1, governments must think of broadband as an ecosystem, with supply
and demand components, to maximize their chances for broadband development success. Such a
holistic approach, however, may prove challenging for some governments where organizational barriers
may exist to greater cooperation and joint policy development and execution between departments
that historically have not had to work together.

Supply: reaching unserved and underserved users
In considering policies and strategies to promote broadband development, one important goal is to
ensure that access is available to the widest possible user base. This means that networks need to be
built out to reach as many people as possible. But facilitating broadband supply presents at least two
significant issues. First, there are areas in virtually every country that have no meaningful access to
broadband services at all. This problem is most pronounced in developing countries, which have seen
less investment in the construction of networks outside metropolitan areas. This situation has improved
in recent years with the spread of wireless networks, but there are still areas without any type of
network coverage. Second, some areas have networks in place, but these networks are not capable of
supporting broadband speeds and services. These areas will need to be upgraded to provide
broadband, either through the construction of high-speed wireline networks and/or through advanced
wireless networks (3G or 4G services). In many developing countries, where wireless penetration can
far exceed wireline penetration, upgraded wireless networks capable of providing true broadband

                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


speeds are expected to be the main supplier of broadband services. Box 2.1 describes some of the
barriers to bringing higher speed services to the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Box 2.1. Constraints on Backbone Capacity in Africa
 Current backbone network infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa is characterized by widespread, low-
 capacity networks generally owned and operated by vertically integrated operators focusing on voice
 services. Incumbent network operators have much less extensive networks than in other regions and,
 in many cases, do not play a major role as providers of backbone network services. In other regions of
 the world, by comparison, large-scale investment in backbone networks has resulted in intensive
 competition and vertical disaggregation of networks, encouraging entry into the downstream market
 and stimulating the rollout of broadband services. The underlying causes of this pattern of network
 and market development in Sub-Saharan Africa are the high cost of network construction and
 operation, regulatory restrictions, and the historical evolution of networks and the market.
 Most of the terrestrial backbone infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa is wireless. In fact, only 12
 percent of the total terrestrial infrastructure in the region is fiber-optic cable, while the remainder is
 microwave. If satellite-based backbone network infrastructure is also taken into account, the
 significance of fiber in the total backbone network infrastructure of Africa is even smaller. This mix of
 wireline and wireless infrastructure varies considerably among various types of network operators.
 Approximately 99 percent of the backbone network length of mobile operators in Sub-Saharan Africa is
 made up of microwave technology, while only 1 percent is fiber. Fixed operators in the region have
 much more fiber in their networks, with approximately 40 percent of the length of their backbone
 networks built from fiber technologies.
 The capacity of a backbone network is determined by the technology on which it is based and the
 capacity of the transmission equipment installed on the network. Though there are technical limits on
 the maximum capacity of wireless networks, in practice, the choice of whether to use wireless or fiber-
 optic cables in the backbone network is usually determined by cost structure rather than technical
 capacity limitations. For low-traffic volumes such as those generated by mobile voice networks,
 wireless backbone networks are the most cost-effective technology. For higher volumes of traffic, fiber
 networks are typically the optimal solution due to their very high data-carrying capacity. Detailed
 technical information on the capacity of backbone networks in the Sub-Saharan Africa region is not
 available, since it is usually commercially confidential. However, the predominance of microwave and
 satellite backbone technologies in the networks provides a clear indication of network capacity
 limitations. These wireless networks are not capable of handling the volumes of traffic generated by
 broadband services, particularly for a large customer base.
 Differences in the cost structure of wireless and fiber-optic backbone networks help to explain why
 operators have preferred to utilize wireless technologies. In wireless backbone networks, only a small
 proportion of the total costs are fixed with respect to the capacity of the network, so total costs are
 primarily driven by the volume of traffic carried. The costs of fiber-optic cable networks, by contrast,
 are largely fixed. A recent study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 (OECD) concluded that 68 percent of the costs in the first year of rolling out a fiber network to the
 premises are in the civil works. These costs are completely unrelated to the volume of traffic that the
 network will carry. This is consistent with other studies, which have put the percentage of total costs of
 fiber networks that are fixed at 60-80 percent.7
 Going forward, expanding these backbone networks, and improving the capacity of the wireless-
 dominated backbone networks will be a challenge. African policymakers and regulators will need to
 creatively address the following issues to help operators make the transition:


                                                    7
                    Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


 Regulatory Environment. In many Sub-Saharan African countries, mobile operators are allowed to
 build their own backbone networks for the provision of services to their own retail customers but have
 been prevented from selling backbone services to other operators on a wholesale basis, effectively
 constraining the development of a market in backbone network services. The restriction also limits
 opportunities for taking advantage of economies of scale in network infrastructure and reduces
 incentives to invest in high-capacity backbone networks. As a result, mobile operators have built their
 own networks that operate parallel to each other and there is very little consolidation of traffic onto
 core backbone networks.
 Stage of market development. The second reason for the lack of aggregation of traffic onto backbone
 networks in Sub-Saharan Africa lies in the stage of market development in most countries. Operators
 face a tradeoff when deciding whether to allow competing operators to use their backbone networks.
 On one hand, by doing so, they increase their revenues and utilize spare capacity on their networks. On
 the other, they may lose some competitive advantage by allowing other operators to effectively
 increase their network coverage faster than they would if they were required to build their own
 networks. The result of this tradeoff is that direct competitors in growing markets typically cannot
 reach agreement on the use of each others’ backbone networks, a difficulty that is often exacerbated
 by a failure of the regulatory authority to facilitate commercial negotiations or to impose regulatory
 interconnection obligations on operators.
 Network economics. The current predominance of wireless backbone networks in the region has
 implications for the way in which the backbone market is developing. Wireless backbone networks are
 scalable, meaning that operators develop them incrementally to meet internal capacity requirements.
 Operators are therefore less likely to have excess backbone network capacity than might have been the
 case if they had invested in fiber networks.8 This has implications for the market in backbone services
 because the marginal cost of capacity on a network in which there is a large margin of spare capacity is
 much lower than on a network that is scalable. Operators with spare capacity have a strong
 commercial incentive to sell spare capacity and, since their marginal cost is low, any competition
 among operators could be expected to reduce prices. An operator with a predominantly microwave
 backbone network, on the other hand, is likely to install the amount of capacity it requires to meet its
 own traffic needs. If it were to decide to sell backbone capacity on a wholesale basis, additional
 capacity would have to be installed. An operator with a wireless backbone network thus has less of an
 incentive to enter into this market than an operator with a fiber-optic cable network.

Demand: Barriers to adoption
Improving the availability of broadband networks only addresses one impediment linked to broadband
development. Even with networks in place and accessible, there are likely to be barriers due to lack of
demand. This problem involves people who have access to broadband network(s), but are unable or
unwilling to obtain service. Addressing lack of demand is important because low adoption rates will
leave networks underutilized. This has at least two implications. First, from a network externalities
standpoint, fewer users reduce the economic and social utility of the networks. Where relatively few
people can communicate online, the network externalities will be reduced since there is a smaller
number of potential customers for businesses to serve. This further means that there may be fewer
local businesses and consumers to offer broadband-enabled services and applications, such as video
streaming services (e.g., Hulu+), voice and video communications (e.g., Skype) and download services
for a variety of applications like software, e-books, etc.


                                                   8
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Second, low adoption and use will undermine the business case of any network—even those built with
public funds. Fewer users means that networks are correspondingly higher-cost, or their costs are
spread over a smaller user base, making them relatively more expensive to build and maintain/operate.
Thus, it is important for governments to focus their attention on developing policies that not only
facilitate and encourage the building of broadband networks, but ensure that as many people as
possible can and do use them.
In studies that have been conducted to identify barriers to Internet and broadband adoption, the
findings are roughly consistent across countries. In the United States, for example, the Pew Internet and
American Life Project found many reasons why people do not use the Internet and/or broadband
services.9 The reasons can be grouped into four main categories:
       Broadband is not relevant to me                 50 percent
       Equipment or service too expensive              19 percent
       Service not available                           17 percent
       Lack of training or use issues                  13 percent
These four groups are generally consistent with the data collected in Europe by Eurostat.10 Importantly,
even in high-adoption countries, relevance or need is still the most common reason for non-adoption.
In the United Kingdom, for example, 42 percent of those without Internet service said that the main
reason was “there’s no need,” or “I’m not bothered” by the lack of access.11 Of that group, 43 percent
said they would not get Internet service even if it (and the computer to access it) were free. Demand
issues also tend to cluster according to particular demographic groups. In summing up the barriers to
adoption for the European Commission’s Supporting Digital Literacy program, the Danish Technological
Institute found that the greatest numbers of non-computer and non-Internet users are found among:12
       The elderly (from 55 years of age and older – especially those between 65 and 74 years of age);
       Women compared to men;
       Persons with low education levels;
       Persons with few economic resources;
       Persons in low-density population areas;
       Persons in manual jobs, the unemployed, and especially the retired or inactive.
This is not to say that demand inhibitors are exactly the same in all countries. The factors seen as
impediments to adoption in some countries may be less of a factor in other countries, due to different
social and cultural histories and experiences, as well as different socio-economic conditions.13 Figure
2.3, which reflect survey data collected from non-adopters of Internet services in Brazil and the United
States, shows how some factors are more important than others.14 Respondents in the United States,
for example, see digital literacy as a much bigger problem than respondents from Brazil who consider
high cost to be a larger issue. Therefore, each country must analyze and address the demand-reducing
factors on a case-by-case basis and tailor solutions to their individual circumstance.

Institutional Barriers
Holistic broadband strategies addressing both supply and demand issues should define the institutional
framework within which the various programs and policies will be implemented. Some of these
institutions might be obvious, such as ICT industry regulators, but there are also other agencies that
could have a role in implementing the strategy. For instance, competition regulators, trade ministries,
and finance departments might support broadband development by ensuring a level playing field, easing
equipment import restrictions, or providing tax breaks. Line ministries such as those overseeing health,
agriculture, education, and public administration may also play a role in broadband development by
supporting content development, bringing their services online, implementing specific programs or
using broadband to streamline their functioning.
A range of institutional structures has been tried across countries. Some successful broadband markets
have one agency that spearheads policy development and implementation. Japan and Korea offer one
model, where a single organization took the entire responsibility for implementing policy, thus ensuring
consistent and efficient promotion of broadband. Establishing legal systems to support the broadband
vision and policies can also contribute to consistent policy implementation. Japan and Korea enacted
laws on their broadband visions and policies and used them to secure stability in policy deployment and
secure cooperation from the ministries involved.
But political circumstances often hold back governments from reforming organizational structures.
Many countries have legacy administrative systems. In such cases, some mechanism for collaboration
should be in place to coordinate policies and implementation among government bodies. For instance,
the United States and some European countries have regulators that take full responsibility for
regulatory policies, while promotional and universalization policies are handled by ministries dealing
with economic affairs. Despite such separated management of policies, these organizations have
maintained efficiency through their capacity for policy coordination.

2.2.4 Development of Country-Specific Solutions
There is no “one-size-fits-all” approach that will guarantee greater broadband deployment and adoption
in every country. Political and economic conditions vary, and each country is endowed with different
technological resources. Some countries have a relatively well-developed wireline telephone network
that could support broadband deployment, while others have widely deployed cable TV networks that
might be able to provide a measure of facilities-based competition from the start. In yet other

                                                                      10
                    Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


countries, there may be various regulatory, political, economic or other barriers to entry that prevent
potential providers from offering broadband services or building broadband networks.
This variety makes it unwise to propose a uniform solution to promote broadband development. In
some cases, the challenge will be to create incentives so that widespread networks can be used to offer
broadband services. In other countries, the main challenge may be to find ways to educate potential
users about the benefits of broadband and train them to use broadband applications and services. As a
result, each country will face its own unique circumstances that will drive policy and investment
decisions. However, the key objective for governments is to pursue policies that will create an enabling
environment that will foster broadband development.
Important lessons can be learned from those countries that have pursued broadband development
policies.15 First, the focus in these countries has been on improving the incentives and climate for
private investment—a policy that even highly resource-constrained countries might be able to follow
(and many have successfully attained with mobile telephony). Many of the policies and programs that
have been developed support private sector investments and call for specific, limited and well-justified
public funding interventions only in exceptional circumstances. In particular, where governments are
trying to promote the growth of underdeveloped markets, policies and regulations that may reduce
private sector investment should be avoided.
Government funding or policy should not have the effect of “crowding out” private sector investment.
For example, governments can encourage private investments in many cases without direct subsidies,
such as by opening passive infrastructure—ducting, towers, cable conduits, and providing access to
rights of way—which can significantly cut costs and create minimal market distortions.16 Public
investments should be considered only when no or insufficient private investments are expected for a
significant period. Furthermore, to maintain a level playing field for competition even with public
investments, governments should seek to avoid favoring one company (or type of company, e.g.,
telephony vs. cable) over another. For example, if and when governments intervene to increase
network availability, it may be necessary to ensure that subsidized networks are open access—meaning
that network operators offer capacity or access to all market participants in a nondiscriminatory way.17
Nonetheless, it is recognized that there may be cases where a dominant provider may need to be
appropriately regulated to avoid market concentration or other adverse impacts on overall market
competition. Box 2.2 summarizes the actions that governments can take to promote greater broadband
development.
Box 2.2. Public Sector’s Role in Fostering Broadband Development—Key Lessons
        Government should focus on maximizing competition, including removal of entry barriers and
         improving the incentives and climate for private investment.
        Government should provide specific, limited, and well-justified public funding interventions
         only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where governments are trying to promote growth of
         underdeveloped markets).
        Government funding should not compete with or displace private sector investment.
        Government should maintain a level playing field for competition, including government-
         owned providers, by avoiding favoring one company (or type of company, e.g., telephony vs.
         cable) over another.
        Subsidized networks should be open access (i.e., offering capacity or access to all market
         participants in a nondiscriminatory way).

        Government may need to regulate dominant providers to avoid market concentration or other
         adverse impacts on overall market competition.
 Government should eliminate barriers to content creation and refrain from blocking access to content, including
 social networking sites, or restricting local content creation.

Developing countries in particular will also need to identify ways to leverage limited resources to
maximize impact, prioritizing programs based on demand and market evolution, rather than shying
away from policy reform altogether. For most developing countries, the most effective approach to
promoting broadband development is likely to involve a mix of approaches and policies that seek to
boost private sector investment, coupled with regulatory reform that will promote efficient and
competitive markets (which will also increase private sector investment). Direct government
intervention should be limited to those cases where markets may not function efficiently (e.g., providing
service to high-cost areas) or where larger social goals are clearly identified (e.g., digital literacy
training). The basic principle remains the same: governments should only intervene based on sound
economic principles, where the benefits of intervention outweigh the costs. For example, particularly at
the initial stage of broadband market development, there may be a need for aggressive government
policies to generate demand, expand networks, and reach underserved areas and communities.


2.3 How to Do It: Implementing Policies and Strategies to Enhance
    Broadband Development
Governments have a number of ways to promote the development of broadband networks and services
in their countries. In most cases, the most effective government strategies are those that seek to
harness the power of private sector investment to spur broadband growth. For purposes of this Toolkit,
there are four broad categories of government action in this regard that will be examined: (i) legal and
regulatory policies and reform; (ii) universal access policies; (iii) support for private sector broadband
network build-out; and (iv) policies that seek to grow demand and spur adoption. These approaches are
illustrated in Figure 2.4.

2.3.1 General Approaches to Promote Broadband
As policymakers seek ways to promote the development of broadband in their countries, certain general
lessons can be learned from those countries with more developed broadband networks and services.
This section describes the general elements that governments should be aware of as policies and
strategies are created.

Establish Specific Plans and Policies
Based on an evaluation of the supply and demand challenges that exist in a country (see section 2.2.3),
the next step is developing the specific policies and strategies to address those challenges. This will
entail setting concrete, measurable objectives for improving the supply of broadband through
infrastructure build-out as well as promoting demand for broadband services and applications. Setting
specific plans or policies will provide a clear sense of direction that will encourage investment, as well as
provide a blueprint for long-term action. Many countries have already developed such plans, as shown
in Practice Note 2.1.

A good plan should aim to promote efficiency and equity, facilitate demand and help to support the
social and economic goals of the country. The most successful plans will start with a clear vision of what
broadband development should be and contain well-articulated goals that can be used to develop
specific strategies to achieve success. Such frameworks can launch or revise ambitious national
broadband visions, including definitions of broadband, service goals (including national and rural
coverage), transmission capacity, service quality, and demand-side issues such as education and skills
development. The government of the Republic of Korea, for example, was one of the early broadband
leaders. It has developed six plans since the mid-1980s that have helped shape broadband policy in the
country. As the Korea example shows, policy approaches can effectively move beyond network rollout
and include research, manufacturing promotion, user awareness and digital literacy. It also highlights
the possibilities for sector growth to be based on long-term interventions focused predominantly on
opportunity generation rather than direct public investment.
For many countries, the development of an extensive national broadband plan or strategy is an
important step towards elaborating more specific broadband development policies. The countries
highlighted in Table 2.1 have national broadband strategies containing specific broadband development
goals.
Table 2.1. Publicly Stated Policy Goals for Broadband Service Delivery and Adoption
 Country                Goal for Broadband Service Delivery, Access and Adoption

                        levels by 2010. By year end 2015, 99 percent of all permanent residences should
                        have access, within two kilometers (km), to an optical fiber or cable network
                        delivering 100 Mbit/s service.

 Germany                75 percent of households should have high speed broadband access with
                        transmission rates of at least 50 Mbit/sec by 2014.
 Malaysia               By end of 2011, it is expected that the penetration rate for total household
                        broadband connections will reach 60 percent.
 Morocco                One out of three households connected by 2013.
 South Africa           Household broadband penetration should be at least 15 percent by 2019.

                        By 2015, 40 percent of households and businesses should have access to 100
                        Mbps.
                        By 2020, 90 percent of households and businesses should have access to 100
                        Mbps.

As Table 2.1 shows, however, countries differ in their approach to setting targets and goals. Some focus
on improving access, while others seek to set specific targets for data transfer speeds. Other countries
have also sought to develop national broadband strategies as shown in Box 2.3.
Box 2.3. Broadband Strategies in Middle-Income Countries
 Chile was the first Latin American country to announce a national broadband strategy. The strategy
 identifies ICT as a priority for economic development. Chile has also planned and implemented ICT
 policies from both the supply and demand sides. On the supply side, the government has authorized
 four Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) operators as regional providers, and the
 regulator plans to award additional spectrum for a third generation (3G) operator to introduce a new
 operator. The demand-side strategy has included programs for e-literacy, e-government, and ICT
 diffusion. For example, almost all taxes are filed electronically, and government e-procurement more
 than doubled the volume of transactions processed between 2005 and 2008. The government has also
 promoted broadband use by municipalities. By 2008, almost all municipalities had Internet access, and
 80 percent had websites. In May 2010, Chile’s wireline broadband penetration was 10.66 percent, while
 mobile broadband penetration was less than half that, but growing at a much faster rate. Chile’s goal is
 to provide Internet access to 3 million rural households by the end of 2011. By 2014, the country hopes
 that 100 percent of schools and 70 percent of households have broadband, and by 2018, 100 percent of
 households will be served by broadband.
 Turkey’s government recognizes the importance of a vibrant telecommunications market and is keen to
 promote the spread of broadband. For instance, many educational institutions have been given
 broadband access. The Information Society Strategy for 2006–2010 aims to develop regulation for
 effective competition and to expand broadband access. Targets include extending broadband coverage
 to 95 percent of the population by 2010 and reducing tariffs to 2 percent of per capita income. The
 regulator has also looked at issuing licenses for the operation of broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA)
 networks in the 2.4 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands. In June 2010, Turkey had penetration rates of nine percent
 for wireline broadband and 4 percent for mobile broadband.
 Malaysia developed its Information, Communications, and Multimedia Services (MyICMS) 886 strategy
 in 2006, setting a number of goals for broadband services. One was to increase broadband penetration
 to 25 percent of households by the end of 2006 and 75 percent by the end of 2010. Although these
 targets were not met, the results have been impressive—the household broadband penetration rate in
 the country topped 53 percent in October 2010. Now the government is focusing on WiMAX, 3G, and
 fiber to the home (FTTH) platforms to boost broadband adoption. To that end, the government is
 funding a fiber optic network that will connect about 2.2 million urban households by 2012. The
 network will be rolled out by Telekom Malaysia under a public-private partnership where the
 government will invest MYR 2.4 billion (USD 700 million) in the project over 10 years, with Telekom
 Malaysia covering the remaining costs. The partnership is expected to cost a total of MYR 11.3 billion
 (USD 3.28 billion).

Recognize that implementation of a plan will take time and persistence
In many cases, the success of programs that have increased broadband adoption has simply been the
result of longevity. Some countries prioritized broadband in the 1990s or early 2000s and have thus
been working on promoting broadband for quite a number of years, thereby providing them with a
meaningful head start over other countries. For example, in 2000 Sweden enacted its IT Bill, which
established the pillars of its ICT strategy as competence, confidence, and access.18 Sustained, focused
efforts with continual updates over a number of years contribute to the long-term success of any
broadband strategy. Conversely, seeking a “one-shot” solution that can simply be achieved with
minimal time and resources is not likely to produce a sustainable long-term outcome.

Develop research mechanisms to track progress of plan
As broadband technologies and applications evolve over time, the various segments of the broadband
market will change as well. Further, notions of digital literacy and underserved populations will also be
in flux. A number of agencies and organizations are already tracking various parts of the broadband
equation. To keep up with this dynamic and ever-changing sector, governments may wish to create an
ongoing, multi-year, broadband-specific research program that tracks population use, ongoing barriers
and levels of digital literacy. This program could serve a complementary function to the ministry or
regulator’s efforts to encourage the supply-side parameters of broadband (e.g., network build-out,
speeds and capabilities). The program could be housed within the agency responsible for broadband
development or could be run out of one of the existing government agencies that perform such
research. The ongoing issues of measurement and assessment, including international benchmarking,
are discussed in more detail in section 2.7.
Pilot projects can play an important role in ongoing research and development (R&D) efforts related to
broadband deployment. Such projects can help demonstrate the viability of a new technology or
service, but more importantly may help to identify those policies and strategies that do not work very
well. This may be a cost-effective approach to broadband development as it allows concepts, plans and
methods to be tested on a small scale before committing larger amounts of resources. In the United
Kingdom, for example, Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK), a unit of the government, gives out grants
(supplemented with private funds) for pilot projects to build/upgrade broadband networks in rural
areas. Once the upgrades are completed, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will gain access to the
infrastructure, which may use any technology, on a wholesale basis. Box 2.4 summarizes the elements
governments should consider as they develop their broadband plans.
Box 2.4. General Elements for Governments to Consider When Creating Policies and Strategies
        Establish specific plans and policies that define broadband development and contain concrete,
         measurable objectives that can be used to develop specific strategies to achieve success.
        Ensure that plans address mechanisms for improving the supply of broadband through
         infrastructure build-out as well as promoting demand for broadband services and applications.

        Allow ample opportunity for stakeholder input in developing plan.
        Be realistic when establishing objectives—recognize and take into account that implementation
         of a plan will take time and persistence.
        Focus on long-term success by developing sustained, focused efforts (with continual updates)
         over a number of years.
        Avoid seeking a “one-shot” solution that can simply be achieved with minimal time and
         resources as this is not likely to produce the best outcome.
        Consider developing an ongoing, multi-year broadband-specific research program that would
         track population use, ongoing barriers, and levels of digital literacy to track progress of a plan
         and determine whether objectives are being met or modifications need to be made.
        Develop one coordinating agency as responsible for implementation of the plan.

2.3.2 Provide a National Focal Point for Broadband and Develop Broadband
         Capacity
To optimize the benefits of broadband, it is key to have a comprehensive national-level focus on
promoting broadband use, a clearinghouse for successful projects, and a consistent evaluation of what
works and what does not. An important part of establishing and maintaining that focus over time will be
developing capacity-building programs for government officials to provide education on how broadband
can provide benefits across many sectors of the economy. Such programs, in turn, can help to shape the
development of effective broadband development strategies throughout all levels of government from
local training programs to national network regulatory regimes.
Numerous countries have established agencies or special offices specifically to oversee broadband
development issues. In Sweden, for example, the IT Policy Strategy Group recommended the creation
of an internal strategic coordination function to oversee holistic IT policy development and
implementation. This internal coordination function was also envisioned to improve coordination
between central government, local authorities, county councils and the business sector. The United
Kingdom now has a Minister of Digital Inclusion. Brazil has appointed a Digital Inclusion Secretary
housed within the Ministry of Communications that will be in charge of the National Broadband Plan, as
well as of all digital inclusion projects that are currently being carried out by various branches of the
federal government.
Often, broadband development efforts are overseen by the ministry responsible for communications or
the regulator. In many cases, this responsibility is exercised in conjunction with a comprehensive
broadband development plan. In Singapore, for example, the government developed and is actively
pursuing its Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) master plan, which is designed to transform Singapore into
“an intelligent nation and a global city, powered by info-communications.”19 As part of that plan, the
Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (Next Gen NBN) is being developed to bring fiber to
homes and businesses across the whole territory. A wireless broadband network is also part of the
strategy. All these efforts are being overseen by the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), which is
providing the government leadership in the development of these networks. In India, the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology established an advisory group with members from
telecommunications companies, industry associations and various government departments (including
health, education and rural development) to help guide India’s plan for a national fiber network that is
envisioned to reach all villages and towns with more than 500 people. India’s approach is particularly

                                                    17
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


noteworthy because it not only recognizes the importance of a central focal point, but also the cross-
cutting impact of broadband on various sectors of the economy and the need for a coordinated
approach that involves all relevant agencies.
The decision regarding whether to set up such an agency or office will depend on the local situation in
each country, and will need to take into account existing laws and institutional responsibilities as well as
the ability of the government to provide adequate funding for such an activity. For developing countries
with limited financial and human resources, devoting a whole agency or branch of government to
broadband development may seem ambitious. Nevertheless, given the importance of broadband
development and its potential role as a general purpose technology (GPT) capable of supporting
advances in many different sectors of any economy, developing such human resource capacities will be
critically important.
The issues surrounding the development of effective broadband policies are extremely complex and
cover a wide range of disciplines, including engineering, law and economics, among others. This will
require governments to build capacity so that trained, knowledgeable professionals can guide the
implementation of a country’s broadband plan from concept through construction and adoption.
Without such leadership, even the best laid plans may fail through inattention and neglect.

2.3.3 Consult with Stakeholders
The development of broadband plans should involve the participation of all relevant stakeholders, both
public and private. As such, governments should provide for a public consultation process that allows
ample opportunities to obtain input from the private sector, consumers, and other relevant
stakeholders. Given the complexity, varied issues and broad impact of broadband, these transparent
discussions are an important part of bringing stakeholders to the table in an open, objective and neutral
manner so as to maximize cooperation between the public and private sectors. A variety of mechanisms
can be used to foster stakeholder input—presentation of filings by stakeholders, workshops, hearings,
and inputs made through an online comment mechanism on regulatory website or blog.

Benefits of Consultation
Consultations are also important because investors will lose confidence if the government is seen as
taking unilateral steps—even if such steps might have positive outcomes. If government initiatives are
seen as damaging, they might undermine efforts to develop an enabling regulatory regime that supports
investment and growth. Consultations and discussions are also proven mechanisms for regulators and
ministries to understand the varying potential challenges and opportunities that are part of the policy
development process. Opening discussions to all stakeholders and maintaining ongoing, clear
communication make the process more effective. Transparency also ensures that regulatory reforms
consider and satisfy public interests and that the process occurs without bias to any one segment of the
market. Moreover, exchanging ideas in an open, transparent setting helps regulators develop effective
relationships with stakeholders and increases their capacity and knowledge, making it easier to counter
potential resistance. Box 2.5 below provides a summary of the benefits of transparent regulation.

Box 2.5. Benefits of Transparent Regulation
1. Efficiency and Effectiveness: Open processes enhance consensus and create confidence in the
   regulator. Increased public participation promotes diverse ideas in decision-making and increases
   support for rules and policies, making implementation easier. In addition, transparency can lead to
   greater efficiency by ensuring that duplication of functions is avoided.
2. Certainty and Reliability: Regulatory credibility and legitimacy builds stability, essential for attracting

                                                     18
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


   investment. This is particularly important in newly liberalized markets, where potential entrants
   need to trust that their investments are protected from arbitrary action and that further commercial
   development will not be thwarted by sudden changes to “the rules of the game.”
3. Accountability and Independence: Openness promotes accountability and legitimacy, reinforcing
   regulatory independence and reducing political and industry interference. Stakeholders will have
   confidence that their views will be heard, without bias, by the regulator. Where regulatory actions
   are exposed to public view, regulators are more likely to engage in careful and reflective decision-
   making.
4. Continuity: A stable set of rules governing transparency will transcend political changes and outlast
   political appointments, ensuring a continuous regulatory record regardless of who is in charge of the
   regulatory agency or which political party is in office.

Principles of Effective Consultation
The principles of good regulatory decision-making are universal: (a) transparency; (b) objectivity; (c)
professionalism; (d) efficiency; and (e) independence.20 Although all of these principles are necessary
for successful regulation, transparency is particularly critical, as it provides accountability and legitimacy
to regulatory decisions. In the context of telecommunications regulation, transparency refers to the
openness of the process of exercising regulatory power, which, in turn, ensures the fairness,
accountability and credibility of the results.21
Although public consultation procedures can vary from country to country, minimum procedural
safeguards are generally instituted to make sure that there is maximum participation in the decision-
making process, such as: issuing public notice of consultations; allowing for a proper comment and reply
comment period; publishing the comments and reply comments submitted by interested parties; and
publishing the consultation results and final decisions. Box 2.6 describes the objectives that the
government of Anguilla set out for its public consultation process.
Box 2.6. Objectives of a Public Consultation
       To obtain input, information and feedback from persons affected by the proposed decision,
        other stakeholders and the public so as to ensure that consumers have the best
        telecommunication services possible in terms of choice, quality and value for their money.
       To acquire substantive information and knowledge from stakeholders, regulatory and industry
        professionals and other regulatory institutions so as to effect an orderly transition to a fully
        liberalized and competitive marketplace.
       To ensure that the Commission has investigated all aspects of an issue; and
       To ensure transparency of decisions of the Commission.
Source: Anguilla, Administrative Procedures Regulation, 2004.

Public consultations can take different forms depending on: the nature of the issue being consulted; the
number of people that could be affected by the decision; the impact on the market; and whether a
formal written consultation process is mandated by legislation. Public consultations can range from
informal meetings to more formalized and structured written consultations (see Practice Note 2.2).
Some of the forms of public consultations used by regulators are:22
       Formal invitations for written submissions;


                                                       19
                    Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


      Individual meetings with one or more interested parties;
      Meetings, seminars, and workshops with representative groups and other interested parties;
      Issuing draft documents containing the preliminary view of the regulator and soliciting
       comments from the public at large before taking a final decision;
      Public hearings;
      Surveys;
      Consultation with independent advisers; and
      Discussions and consultation with regulatory professionals and regulatory institutions in other
       jurisdictions.
Many regulators find the written consultation process to be the most efficient means of conducting a
public consultation. The U.K. regulator, The Office of Communications (Ofcom), will usually engage in a
formal consultation process to seek the written views of the public. However, recognizing that formal
consultation has its limits in reaching smaller businesses or community groups or individuals who lack
time and specialist skills, Ofcom supplements the formal written consultation with other methods of
gathering information, such as having meetings across the country, holding open meetings, operating
online bulletin boards, or organizing focused discussion groups.23
Application of these principles and processes for public input has been an essential element in the
development of national broadband plans and strategies around the world. Typically, the level of
engagement of stakeholders through consultation and open decision-making processes rises as a
broadband plan becomes more detailed and ambitious. Australia, for example, developed its National
Broadband Network (NBN) Plan in April 2009, beginning with a two-month public consultation entitled
“National Broadband Network: Regulatory Reform for 21st Century Broadband.”24 The NBN
consultation set out the proposed regulatory reforms for the roll-out of the NBN, as well as the
consultations that will accompany each stage of the reform process, particularly regarding the
facilitation of fiber network deployment and consumer protection safeguards, including universal
access, retail price controls and enforcement of consumer protection rules.
India also initiated its National Broadband Plan with a public consultation. On June 10, 2010, the
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released the “Consultation Paper on National
Broadband Plan.”25 The consultation was originally open for approximately one month and was
supposed to close on July 7 with the opportunity to present reply comments by July 15. However TRAI
extended the consultation period to July 20 for initial comments and July 27 for reply comments due to
stakeholders’ requests.26 With the extension, TRAI received over 71 initial comments and six reply
comments from industry associations, consumer advocacy groups, service providers, equipment
vendors, other companies such as Google, consultants and interested individuals, all of which TRAI
published on its website.27 This open and transparent consultation process allowed TRAI to release its
“Recommendations on the National Broadband Plan” in December 2010. These recommendations
include the creation of a state-owned National Optical Fiber Agency (NOFA) that will build out a
nationwide fiber network by 2013 with the help of State Optical Fiber Agencies (SOFAs).28

2.3.4 Ensure Broadband Policies Support Other Sectoral Strategies
As policymakers and regulators consider policies and strategies to promote broadband development in
their countries, it will be important to consider the issues in the broader context of larger economic and
social goals.29 Module 1 discusses how broadband applications and services are increasingly intersecting
with virtually every other major sector of the economy—including education, health, banking, the
environment and climate change, and cybersecurity. Tackling such cross-sector goals will require: (i)
close coordination among various regulators so that policies and approaches support each other; (ii)
policy approaches and regulatory frameworks that are broad enough for policymakers to consider the
relevant interrelated issues; and (iii) a high degree of committed leadership at the most senior levels to
ensure that all parts of government work together to promote the development of broadband as part of
the more general goals of promoting social and economic growth. Despite increasing recognition of the
importance of broadband and its impact on the policies and implementation of programs in other
sectors, most countries’ laws do not typically address the jurisdictional issues related to other sectors of
the economy vis-à-vis broadband. As a result, it will be increasingly important for governments to adopt
provisions outlining the cooperative arrangements between the ICT/broadband regulator and other
governmental agencies. For agencies not used to working together—and which come to the same
issues with vastly different points of view—such guidelines or arrangements will be crucial to ensuring
that policies and decisions are mutually supportive of both broadband development and sector-specific
goals and programs. This section briefly describes how broadband development policies interact with
policies in other key sectors of a country’s economy.

Expanding the Regulator’s Mandate

In most countries, the telecommunications/ICT regulator operates separately from the broadcasting and
video content regulator. This stems from the past, when different technologies were used to deliver
communications, broadcast and data services. In today’s converged world, however, where broadband
networks are capable of delivering all of these services over one infrastructure, nearly 30 countries have
established a converged regulator to better adapt and respond to an environment where distinctions
based on services and networks are becoming blurred. These countries include Australia, Finland, Iraq,
Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mali, Malaysia, South Africa, Singapore, Uganda, and the United Kingdom. In some
of these countries, the jurisdiction of the telecommunications regulator has been expanded to include
broadcasting, content (e.g., video programming) and Internet services. As such, converged regulators
can provide “one stop” service for businesses and potential licensees and also give consumers a single
agency for all matters relating to the communications sector. Although many countries see benefits in
the converged approach, many countries still maintain some distinctions based on their specific
circumstances and policy approaches. For example, most OECD countries still have separate regulators
for broadcasting and telecommunications, and content regulation in many countries is typically
addressed by a separate ministry or government authority (e.g., in India and Saudi Arabia) or by the
broadcasting authority (e.g., in Botswana and Chile). In India, in fact, two entities are responsible for
content regulation; the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting monitors content related to
broadcasting and film while the Ministry of Information Technology regulates Internet content.

                                                     21
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


In many countries a shift from ex ante regulation to an ex post approach is taking place in the ICT sector.
With this dynamic comes a much greater focus on competition matters. Thus, one particular area that
policymakers will have to address involves how the competition laws of the country will be developed
and enforced. If a country has a set of general competition laws and a separate regulator to handle
these issues, the ICT regulator may, or may not be granted jurisdiction over telecommunications
matters. In such cases, the challenge is to establish clear rules that specify how jurisdiction will be
shared and/or how overlapping issues will be handled in order to avoid conflicts between agencies. For
countries without general competition laws, it is often the case that the ICT regulator gains additional
authority to guard against unfair or anticompetitive conduct. In this case, new electronic
communications laws or regulations are likely to expand the traditional mandate of the ICT regulatory
authority.
For many countries without a long-standing competition law framework, liberalization of the ICT sector
has been the impetus for governments to expand the mandate of ICT regulators to include the
regulation of competition matters related to the telecommunications market. Based on their expertise
and experience with the sector, regulators receive expanded powers to resolve issues related to sector-
specific competition laws when no overarching competition framework exists in the country. The
Kingdom of Bahrain, for example, does not have any general competition laws, but one of the main
responsibilities of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) under the Telecommunications
Law is to “promote effective and fair competition among new and existing Licensed Operators.”30 Based
on this mandate, the TRA has effectively introduced competition to the telecommunications markets,
including local and long distance fixed services, international gateways, mobile services and Internet
services.
Conversely, in countries with general competition laws and agencies to govern these issues, the specific
electronic communications or telecommunications law can still give authority to the
telecommunications/ICT regulator to issue rules and decisions related to competition in the ICT sector.
The challenge in such countries is to ensure that any jurisdictional overlap between different agencies
does not result in conflicting rules or “forum shopping” by parties seeking the best outcome. Therefore,
it is necessary that the country’s laws provide clear guidance on exactly what the boundaries are for
each authority as well as outlining the procedures that will be followed where jurisdiction may be jointly
held; in order to issue coherent, consistent and effective decisions. In some cases, competition and ICT
authorities issue guidelines or publish memoranda of understanding on how they will work together on
competition related matters in the ICT sector. This can be very helpful in avoiding duplication and
inefficient use of public resources as well as giving all parties legal certainty as to what agency holds
what responsibilities (see Box 2.7). In the United Kingdom, for example, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
has general powers to enforce EU competition mandates and the country’s Competition Act, but it
shares jurisdiction over electronic communications, with Ofcom, which was granted its competition
powers under the 2003 amendment to the Communications Act. As a result, OFT then published a letter
addressing the agencies’ concurrent jurisdiction and providing an initial overview of how they would
work together, a process it expanded on in further guidance.31
Box 2.7. Relevant issues for coordinating competition and ICT authorities’ jurisdiction in the ICT
sector
Taking into account the specific provisions of the legal framework, the following lists some issues that
should be considered when establishing guidelines on the exercise of concurrent powers over
competition matters in the ICT sector:
•   Exchanging information to determine which authority has jurisdiction over a specific case;


                                                    22
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


•   Determining which authority is better suited to exercise the concurrent powers in relation to a
    specific case;
•   Resolving disputes as to which authority should exercise the concurrent powers in relation to a
    specific case;

Some developing countries have pursued a similar approach. In Mauritius, for example, in March 2010
the Competition Commission (CCM) and the Information and Communication Technologies Authority
(ICTA) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) governing their concurrent jurisdiction over the
ICT sector.32 Where the two agencies have overlapping powers, the MoU establishes a set of guidelines
to promote cooperation and coordination when dealing with cases of anti-competitive behavior. It also
sets forth the responsibilities of both agencies in such matters; and establishes mechanisms for
communication and sharing of information between CCM and ICTA with the aim of minimizing
duplication of work and facilitating prompt and efficient resolution of cases.

Cooperation with Sector-specific Agencies

Despite increasing recognition of the importance of electronic communications laws and policies and
their impact on the policies and implementation of programs in other sectors, most countries’ laws do
not typically address the jurisdictional issues related to other sectors of the economy vis-à-vis
broadband. As the influence of ICT and broadband policy continues to grow, it will be increasingly
important for governments to adopt provisions outlining the cooperative arrangements between the ICT
regulator and other governmental agencies. Since such cross-sector initiatives are still relatively new, it
is unclear how successful they will be in the long term; can agencies develop the good working relations
that will lead to effective policy outcomes? While there is great potential to capture high-level expertise
from multiple agencies; these collaborative efforts are also likely to result in new challenges, such as
jurisdictional conflicts or funding issues that will need to be addressed by executive leadership and/or
further legislative guidance in the form of new laws. The following sections describe how the ICT
regulator may need to work with a variety of other sector-specific ministries or agencies.
Cooperation between ICT regulators and environmental agencies. Traditionally, limited overlap has
existed between the environmental and ICT regulatory issues, with the possible exception of
electromagnetic field (EMF) and radiofrequency field (RF) emissions from broadcasting and mobile
communications towers or from handheld mobile devices. However, increasing concerns about climate
change and the environmental impacts of ICTs, along with the growth of “green ICT” initiatives, will
likely require new levels of cooperation between the ICT and environmental regulators. In February
2010, for example, Egypt implemented its Green ICT Strategy through a joint Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) signed by both the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology
(MCIT) and the Ministry of Environmental Affairs (MEA).33
Other countries have begun similar coordination efforts in order to take a more comprehensive
approach to meeting environmental and ICT policy objectives. In Singapore, for example, multiple

agencies have begun to collaborate on new cross-sector initiatives. In November 2009, for example, the
government launched of the “Intelligent Energy System,” a pilot project to test smart grid
technologies.34 The project requires the cooperation of the ICT regulator and the regulators in charge of
energy, the environment, economic development, science and technology research, and housing and
development. More recently, the Singapore government established the Energy Efficiency Programme
Office (E2PO), led by the National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Energy Market Authority (EMA), to
promote the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, develop local expertise in energy management
and support research and development in green ICTs.35 As shown in Figure 2.5, E2PO includes
Singapore’s ICT regulator, IDA, as well as nine other agencies with responsibilities in various sectors.

Cooperation between ICT regulators and law enforcement agencies. The relationship between law
enforcement agencies (LEAs) and telecommunications regulators goes back many years, based on the
need for LEAs to lawfully intercept and access electronic communications (e.g., wiretapping) as part of
their investigative processes. IP and broadband networks, however, pose new challenges to law
enforcement and ICT regulators as the use of communication networks to commit crimes becomes more
widespread and a more direct threat to a broader range of activities and users. As more business and
personal activities and transactions have moved online, the number of crimes committed using
communications networks, applications and services has grown, and is expected to continue to grow as
broadband networks become more ubiquitous. Although ICT regulators have begun to play a stronger
role with respect to consumer protection issues such as spam, these laws have traditionally required
LEAs (or defense or security agencies) to take the lead due to public safety and national security
interests in issues including interception of communications, data privacy, cyber theft and fraud.
Against this backdrop, it is expected that increased cooperation and coordination between
telecommunications/ICT regulators and LEAs will be necessary to combat increasingly common and
sophisticated cybercriminals.
In particular, the telecommunications/ICT regulator’s role in combating the various forms of cybercrime
is likely to increase due to its technical expertise. This is likely to involve: 1) assisting LEAs in the
technical/forensic investigation of cybercrimes; 2) coordination of various LEAs and national security
agencies at local and national levels; and 3) assisting service providers and consumers in understanding
their rights and obligations. As cybercrime has become an increasing concern, some countries have
even given the ICT regulator the lead in implementing laws designed to prevent or prosecute
cybercrimes. The recently passed digital piracy law in the United Kingdom, for example, assigns most of
the implementation and enforcement powers with Ofcom, rather than a LEA (see Box 2.8). As with any
type of potentially overlapping jurisdiction, the laws and enabling regulations should clearly define the
roles of all parties, as well as provide adequate resources for enforcement.

         found to have breached the code, including imposition and collection of a financial penalty up to
         £250,000.

         have had copyright enforcement actions taken against them.

Cooperation between ICT regulators and education sector authorities. Education is another area
where the potential benefits of telecommunications have long been recognized. In many countries, so-
called “distance learning” projects go back almost 30 years.36 Today, as the benefits of broadband for
education have become clearer, regulators and education authorities are increasingly working together
to ensure that schools and universities have access to broadband networks and can benefit from a
growing array of e-learning and knowledge programs. As governments seek to encourage such
programs, it will be critically important to forge alliances among private actors, donor agencies and non-
governmental organizations to maximize the successful integration of broadband and education.
The benefits of collaboration are clear. In Afghanistan, for example, the Ministry of Education (MoE)
and the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT) are collaborating on a project
to improve both the education and ICT sectors.37 Beginning in September 2008, the MoE and MoCIT
launched a “One Laptop per Child” (OLPC) project in a public-private partnership with the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID), Roshan, a mobile operator in Afghanistan, and
Paiwastoon, a local information technology company. The MoE distributes the laptops to schools, and
the MoCIT ensures the quality of the content, as well as maintaining the technology. By March 2010,
more than 3,700 laptops had been distributed in Afghanistan through the OLPC project.38
Since extending connectivity often involves multiple players from the government, as well as private
sector providers, the ITU toolkit also provides a useful checklist of issues for policymakers and regulators
to consider as they work to develop a broadband and education initiative (see Box 2.9).
Box 2.9. ITU School Connectivity Checklist

The ITU has developed a checklist of issues that should be considered by policymakers and regulators
when implementing school connectivity initiatives. In particular, the checklist highlights the need for
good collaboration between the relevant stakeholders and tight coordination between school
connectivity programs and the country’s national educational and ICT plans. Some of the other factors
the checklist identifies are that:
       School connectivity plans should be consistent with policies to promote overall ICT connectivity
        within the country;
       School connectivity plans are best coordinated with policies, plans, strategies and programs for

        universal service, as well as broadband and digital and Information Society agendas;
       Close coordination must exist between the ministry responsible for education, the ministry
        responsible for ICTs/broadband, and the telecommunications/ICT regulator, to ensure that
        universal service funds and obligations are formulated within a plan for school connectivity that
        concretely describes the roles of all parties; and
       Private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can play key roles in advancing
        school connectivity, and they should be invited to participate in the development of school
        connectivity plans at an early stage.

Cooperation between ICT regulators and healthcare authorities. The benefits of broadband and ICTs
for healthcare are a more recent development. One of the most important facets of effective and
efficient healthcare is the timely collection and sharing of information among healthcare professionals.
This includes, for example, real-time monitoring of patient data, long-term collection of routine
examinations and tests, and time-critical diagnoses of conditions based on x-rays, MRIs, etc. For public
health, the collection of data can help to identify outbreaks of infectious diseases and long term trends
in the success or failure of public health initiatives. Broadband and ICTs are particularly well-suited to
serving all these tasks with their ability to process and communicate large amounts of data quickly and
efficiently. Because of these benefits, there are many areas in the medical field in which broadband
networks and ICTs are being used to improve health outcomes. E-health initiatives include electronic
records; long distance consultations and diagnoses via video conference; and patient monitoring using
various mobile devices.
As the number of applications grows, ICT regulators and health care authorities will find it useful to work
together to improve both health outcomes and broadband development—as these often have mutually
reinforcing objectives. In fact, governments and regulators are increasingly coming to realize the
benefits of such collaboration. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) National Broadband
Plan, for example, dedicated an entire chapter to e-health and broadband, and specifically
recommended greater cooperation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to “clarify
regulatory requirements and the approval process for converged communications and health care
devices.”39
The effective use of broadband and ICTs for medical or e-health applications and programs will require
coordination between multiple agencies and ministries, potentially including not only communications
and health, but also science, education and finance. ICT regulators need to work closely with these
other agencies to develop mechanisms to enable the healthcare sector to develop creative solutions to
healthcare issues and effectively leverage the benefits of broadband connectivity. Such efforts should
include not only doctors and hospitals, but also institutions that are less directly involved in health care
implementation and administration, such as schools/universities, social service agencies and research
facilities. Some of the important initiatives to be considered may include:
       Subsidies or other financial support for communications networks to link key institutions, such
        as hospitals and universities;
       Setting or identifying standards (a common e-health form, for example) to enable
        interconnection between various stakeholders;

       Developing or updating service rules governing electronic services used to share medical data;
        and
       Provisions regarding privacy of data transmitted via such services.
Cooperation between ICT and banking regulators: m-banking. The financial services world is already
one of the larger users of broadband and ICT services. Huge amounts of money are transferred
electronically every day and all around the world. In the last decade, more and more financial services
have moved on-line, allowing individuals and businesses to conduct their banking services without ever
having to go to an actual bank.
With the rise of mobile wireless services, customers have begun to demand that their financial services
be available not only on computers or at banks, but on their mobile devices, so-called m-banking. The
use of mobile networks for providing financial services can produce enormous benefits, particularly in
those countries without a well-developed or widespread banking system. However, with these benefits
also come challenges that the traditional banking world has not had to confront, especially in the areas
of privacy and security of customer data.
As a result, good coordination between the different agencies involved will be crucial to support a
secure and effective m-banking environment. For example, although financial services are outside the
purview of telecommunications regulations, regulators can encourage the development of the m-
banking market by working with their counterparts in the finance ministry to develop policies that
support new banking and business models and that also recognize the importance of privacy, security
and trust in the new m-banking world. This is likely to require forging new relationships with the
financial services authorities in order to develop a framework that is appropriate for m-Banking
services.40
As they consider how to promote m-banking in the context of broadband development—and especially
in considering how to bring both services to un- or underserved communities—ICT policymakers and
regulators should seek to adopt policies that will increase investment and entry into the mobile
broadband market. Development and expansion of mobile networks leading to increased penetration is
a necessary condition to continue to expand on the success of m-banking services. Similarly, regulators
should enact and enforce rules – directly or in cooperation with competition authorities – to ensure
competitive mobile markets. This is particularly important since first mover advantages and specific
technical/service conditions of m-banking (e.g., lack of interconnectivity of m-banking services41 or
differentiated fees between on-network and off-network transactions) may allow dominant mobile
providers to further strengthen their positions. For example, in August 2010, the Communications
Commission of Kenya (CCK) raised concerns with the competitive effects of certain conditions associated
with Safaricom’s successful M-Pesa service.42 The CCK found that mobile money transfer services have a
significant impact on the competitive landscape in the telecommunications market in Kenya as they
created a “club effect”—since higher rates are charged to non-registered users versus registered users,
more consumers would be motivated to join the less-costly “club.” There are also other benefits to
promoting m-banking since it may be the new operators, seeking to differentiate themselves from the
existing or dominant operators, who may be more willing and able to develop new services quickly.
On the financial side, banking regulators (e.g., central banks, finance ministries or banking regulatory
authorities) will need to be flexible and creative to adapt traditional banking regulations to enable m-
banking. For example, even defining who can be a “bank” (i.e., banks, mobile providers, and retailers)
may need to be addressed so that new players can develop new services, while at the same time
protecting the stability of the financial system as a whole, the integrity of transactions, and the safety of
customers’ deposits.43

                                                     27
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Furthermore, the m-banking sector is still nascent; so there is as yet no common, accepted business
model or set of best practices. In addition, since each country’s financial system is different (more or
less well-developed), it is probably still too early for financial regulators to prescribe specific regulatory
models.44 For example, financial regulators in Afghanistan, the Philippines, West Africa and the
European Union have adopted regulations that enable a role for nonbanks, striking a balance between
service availability and the need to mitigate the risks presented by the involvement of a service provider
that is not subject to full banking regulation.45 On the other hand, a number of countries, such as Kenya
and Cambodia, have not issued e-money regulations, but have nevertheless permitted such nonbank
models on an ad hoc basis through “no objection” letters, conditional approvals or other means.46

2.3.5 Develop Policies for Both Sides of the Broadband Coin:                                  Supply and
        Demand
The experience in high-penetration countries shows that successful broadband diffusion requires that
both supply- and demand-side factors be addressed (see Figure 2.6). While supply-side policies focus on
promoting the build-out of the network infrastructure over which broadband applications and services
can be delivered, the main goal of demand-side policies is to enhance the awareness and adoption of
broadband services so that more people will make use of them.
Figure 2.6. Framework for Government Intervention to Facilitate Broadband Development

The interaction of both supply- and demand-side factors is crucial to achieve the highest penetration
and adoption of broadband. However, these factors do not always appear naturally as market failures
may hinder their development. For instance, broadband diffusion can be limited if the market is not
able to reach the required critical mass that leads to a sustainable growth cycle. More importantly, even
if both types of factors (i.e., supply- and demand-side) are present in an economy, they will not reach
their full potential if they are not coordinated, which may result in slow supply of broadband
infrastructure or in poor demand and uptake once networks are available. For this reason, high
broadband penetration countries have comprehensive broadband policies that coordinate both supply-
and demand-side actions. In addition, most plans that have been introduced – both in developed and
developing countries – incorporate both supply- and demand-side policies. Such complementary
strategies have been defined in addition to market liberalization and regulatory initiatives aimed at

                                                      28
                         Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


    promoting broadband in general, as well as focusing on universal access obligations or special conditions
    that favor projects in high-cost or low-income areas. Universal access obligations and financing are
    briefly addressed in section 2.6 below, and discussed in more detail in Module 5. In assessing the
    strategic options for improving broadband build-out and adoption (supply and demand), it is important
    to remember that many different factors are involved, and no two countries have followed identical
    routes. Nevertheless, it is possible to recognize certain common elements in national broadband
    success stories. In reality, most countries will use a mix of policies, with supply-side policies generally
    focusing on how to stimulate private sector investment in networks, especially in the early years, while
    demand-side policies may be more long-term and focused on how governments can help drive
    broadband demand and adoption.

    2.3.6 Sequence Policies for Maximum Effectiveness
    Different policies are appropriate for different stages of a country’s broadband policy development. As
    part of the overall implementation strategy, it will be very important to ensure that individual strategies
    and programs begin at the appropriate time. For example, it will not make sense to establish digital
    literacy or Internet use programs before users have access to the services they need to learn about.
    Thus, policies and programs must be implemented in a step-wise, complementary fashion, based on the
    specific conditions in the country. This section will address how to sequence policies and programs so
    that they match the country’s needs and progress.
    Based on a 2010 World Bank study of countries that have pursued broadband development policies,
    Table 2.2 provides a conceptual summary of the key policies, regulatory, and programs that those
    countries used to develop their broadband ecosystems and the general stages in which these policies
    were introduced: promote, oversee and universalize.47

The policies and regulatory tools in Table 2.2 support the operation of a competitive, efficient market
and seek to expand access to all. They also include demand-side policies and programs. Many of these
measures would have little or no implications for government budgets. Some could be funded through
contributions from the broadband industry, while others would be self-sustaining from service fees (as
with e-government programs) or cost savings (as with infrastructure sharing).
Most important, every country the World Bank surveyed—even those with state-led approaches—has
sought to create an enabling environment for private investments and market mechanisms to develop
broadband networks. The main variation is that some countries, such as Finland, France, the United
Kingdom, and the United States, have let the market try its hand at building broadband first, while
others, such as Australia, Japan, Korea, and Sweden, have used competition policy in combination with
public-private partnerships and a more active role for the state early in the process.

Today, though, all the countries surveyed have moved firmly toward spurring broadband growth
through a combination of public and private initiatives. Countries such as the United Kingdom and
United States that once shied away from developing national broadband strategies have developed
them. Even Finland, which has long relied on the private sector to build broadband networks, has
developed a USD 265 million broadband plan that includes USD 88 million in public funding. The
government will support the construction of faster, more widespread networks.

Promote: Jump-starting broadband development
Many developing countries have low broadband penetration and are in the initial stage of market
development. These countries may wish to focus initially on policies that promote the broadband
market. Promotional policies can encourage the supply side, such as inducing investment in the
broadband network, and the demand side, such as raising citizen awareness about broadband benefits
and easing subscription barriers.
Policies that focus on building, extending or upgrading broadband networks are often the first things
policymakers consider when they have decided to promote broadband development. There are a
number of initiatives that governments can take in order to spur broadband network development.
Some of the most important policies are summarized here and are discussed in more detail in section
2.4.1:
       Reduce entry regulations to facilitate competition.
       Use spectrum frequency policies to facilitate wireless service.
       Provide government support for national backbone construction.
       Take aggressive steps to reduce providers’ investment costs.
In conjunction with early policies to encourage the build out of broadband networks, policymakers may
also see the need to raise the awareness of and stimulate demand for broadband services, particularly
among those populations least likely to be broadband users. This can help to ensure that as broadband
services are introduced, there are users willing and able to utilize them. Some of the most important
demand stimulation policies are summarized here and discussed in more detail in section 2.5:
       Promote digital literacy.
       Distribute low-cost devices and terminals.
       Have government serve as an anchor tenant.
       Develop online content and local media.
       Encourage small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to use broadband and e-commerce.

Oversee: Facilitate competition-led growth through consistent oversight
Once the basic broadband building blocks of supply and demand have been addressed, policy
development may turn to ensuring that private investment and competition can continue to flourish and
users’ rights are protected. In this stage, the basic aim of government intervention is to foster service
development under a competitive market structure. Even countries with the least government market
intervention have implemented competition policies and achieved broadband diffusion. This explains
why policies that facilitate competition are the most important, and thus must be implemented
consistently and compellingly from the initial to maturity stages of market development. Policies that
may be pursued in this regard involve supporting as much as possible new entrants competing with the

incumbent; encouraging both facility- and service-based competition and regulating unfair business
practices with regard to both competitors and consumers. Such policies are described in more detail in
section 2.4.1.

Universalize: Focus on widespread diffusion as broadband market grows
A goal for many countries is to “universalize” broadband; to make broadband services available to as
many people as possible so as to maximize the economic and social benefits that broadband can bring.
A farsighted policymaker would envision nationwide diffusion of broadband from the outset and pursue
that goal through specific long-term plans. In many ways, policies to universalize broadband are often
extensions of policies adopted earlier for telephony, but may require changes to national laws,
regulations and funding, such as by defining broadband as part of a country’s universal service
obligation. Such policies can seek to expand universal service programs to include broadband and
provide financial support for network rollout in rural and underserved areas. Universalization policies
can include digital inclusion programs that go beyond simply educating potential users by providing
subsidies for low-income households to purchase broadband devices or even subscriptions, and building
Internet access centers in remote areas and schools. Section 2.6.2 discusses these policies and how to
fund them in more detail.


2.4 Building Infrastructure: Promoting the Supply of Broadband
Most developing countries have not yet seen their broadband networks penetrate more than a few
percent of their populations. Hence, governments can play a key role in promoting and accelerating the
growth of the broadband market. Promoting the build-out of broadband networks throughout a
country will likely require governments to pursue multiple strategies, depending on local circumstances.
As each country has its own unique history, regulatory structure/framework, economic conditions, social
goals/expectations and political processes, the path a country follows to improve broadband networks
and services will necessarily have to reflect its specific advantages and disadvantages. This section
addresses the issues that policymakers and developers may face in promoting broadband network
development. It identifies the various components of a nationwide broadband network and identifies
the issues and policy approaches to address the challenges associated with promoting the buildout of
broadband networks and services.

2.4.1 Core Policies to Promote the Buildout of Broadband Networks
As countries seek to build frameworks and strategies to support the development of broadband
networks and services, it is important to identify the policies that can help drive the development
process. Although the specific policies adopted in each country will differ depending on the unique
circumstances each faces, some general policy approaches may be applicable across the world. This
section describes these general policy approaches and identifies some of the specific policies previously
used to promote broadband buildout in many countries. Section 2.4.2 describes specific policies that
are applicable to the different levels of the broadband supply chain.
As an overall consideration, it is generally accepted that the private sector should be the primary driver
of broadband development in most cases. Particularly when government debt is high and resources are
limited, sufficient public money may not be available for broadband infrastructure spending.
Consequently, policymakers and regulators must consider how best to attract and encourage private
sector involvement and investment in broadband. This, in turn, will require governments to do an
honest evaluation of the extent to which their country represents—or can be made into—a profitable
market opportunity for private sector investors and operators. Questions to be answered may include:

                                                   32
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Are companies willing to invest? If not, why not? Will such companies drive the broadband market
forward on their own or will they need help? What government strategies, policies and regulations can
foster and support private sector initiatives and what policies may hold back investment? This is the
approach that many countries have taken; they have attempted to facilitate and, where possible,
accelerate, broadband rollout through regulatory measures or policy changes rather than more direct
forms of intervention such as investment.
There will be instances, however, in which purely private sector-led approaches will not be sufficient for
broadband to develop. In those cases—due to factors such as historical market structure, geography or
low population density, for example—private sector players will be unwilling to invest capital where
they perceive that they will get a low (or no) return on their investment. For these areas, it will be
necessary for the government to develop policies and strategies designed to address competitive and
investment challenges. Such intervention can take various forms as discussed below, and are
summarized in Table 2.3. For a more comprehensive view of the various policies and programs for
promoting the build-out and uptake of broadband, see Practice Note 2.3.

in Developing Countries


STEP 1: Reduce Barriers to Entry
The first step in stimulating competition and encouraging the private sector to build out broadband
networks is to reduce the barriers to entering the broadband market. Often legacy regulations can
explicitly prevent new entrants or discourage investors by placing a complicated or onerous regulatory
burden on them. Broadband development can be stimulated by lowering or removing such barriers and
allowing greater competition to flourish.
Civil works are the biggest fixed and sunk cost in broadband network construction. They account for
more than two-thirds of the cost of fiber optic networks (see Figure 2.7)48 and wireless networks.49 They
also play a major role in increasing the cost of network deployment for new service providers as well as
incumbents. Such costs can thus be a major barrier to entry for potential new entrants.

                                                                 12%



Government policy support is essential for new market entrants to compete effectively with dominant
incumbents. This is because economies of scale and network externalities play significant roles in the
success of communications providers. Institutionalized consideration for new entrants will significantly
increase their motivation. Korea illustrates the importance of direct and infrastructure-based
competition in the development process. In contrast to the cautious deployment of broadband in a
number of countries, the Korean government has encouraged intense competition between broadband
providers. Thus Korea’s success can be attributed to the power of government direction and market
competition working in parallel.
In fact, the emergence of disruptive competitors was one of the key enablers of rapid broadband
development in both Korea and Japan.50 Powerful competitors joining the initial stage of market
development drastically increased broadband penetration, with affordable prices achieved through


                                                       34
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


aggressive price cuts. Thus, it is crucial that government make the best of regulatory policies so that
powerful competitors, even if not disruptive, can compete on a level playing field with the incumbent.
Competition policy is ideal when networks and services compete with each other at full capacity. But
due to practical limitations—such as limited investment, subscriber lock-in, and subscriber networks
being bottleneck facilities—competition policy is likely to focus more on networks or services. Whether
to focus on facility- or service-based competition depends on which is more appropriate for new
providers to become and stay competitive in a short period. The decision may depend on country
conditions, including the size of the communications network, the status of competition, and the
structure of regulation. Another influential factor is whether alternative networks (cable broadband,
wireless broadband, and so on) cover the entire country.
Facility-based competition makes providers compete in the retail market while also constructing a
network. It brings competition to network improvement by expanding investment. But it can also result
in redundant investments. Service-based competition allows new providers to use the network of the
dominant facilities operator. This cuts the time to market for new entrants and reduces upfront
investment. But it can also depress long-term investments by the dominant facility operator and delay
network upgrades. Furthermore, new providers might lack incentives to engage in network
construction. But service-based competition can also create many opportunities if new providers enter
the market smoothly, attract subscribers at the initial stage, and facilitate network investment with their
profits.
Comparing the experiences in Korea and France is instructive. In Korea, facility-based competition was
intense from the initial stage of the broadband market due to deregulation and the development of
cable TV networks, so services were diffused quickly. But by the time the market reached maturity,
depending only on facility-based competition was considered insufficient, so service-based competition
was adopted through local loop unbundling. In France, by contrast, cable TV network development was
relatively weak due to the development of satellite broadcasting. Further, cable TV providers, also
serving as communications service providers, had little desire to start broadband businesses. Hence,
France adopted a service-based competition regime from the initial stage to facilitate the deployment of
services. And the country has succeeded in encouraging service providers to increase investments,
improve networks, and engage in facility-based competition.
Constructing a backbone network covering the entire country is a top priority for many developing
countries, especially where such networks are limited to urban centers or a few intercity routes. But
deliberations are needed on which competition policy they should choose. For those without an
alternative network covering the entire country, it is typically more effective to adopt both service- and
facility-based competition rather than applying nationwide facility-based competition policies. However,
in large cities with sufficient demand, facility-based competition in the subscriber network may be more
effective.
For areas facing economic challenges in constructing an alternative network, it is reasonable to
implement aggressive service-based policies as well as facility-based policies that encourage
construction of a wireless alternative network through the allocation and award of ample spectrum. For
areas where even the dominant incumbent does not own a fixed line network, competition must be
expanded through policies allowing nondiscriminatory entry of competitors for government-supported
network construction.
Governments can consider a number of reforms to address these issues as discussed in the sections
below.



                                                    35
                        Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Remove limits on the number of network licenses. In many countries that have nominally “liberalized”
their network markets, there is a formal or informal limit on the number of licenses issued.51 There is
little economic justification for such a limit, however, since many types of networks do not require
scarce resources. This is particularly true for wireline networks, which do not use radio spectrum.
Experience from around the world indicates that markets can successfully support multiple network
operators in most cases. Experience also indicates that where multiple licenses have been issued,
operators are willing to invest a substantial amount of financial resources in network infrastructure.
Ease access to rights-of-way. Most of the cost of constructing wireline networks lies in the civil works.
By lowering the barriers to and cost of accessing and the rights of way associated with public
infrastructure and lands (e.g., roads, railways, pipelines, or electricity transmission lines), governments
can significantly increase incentives for private investment in broadband networks at all levels of the
supply chain. Such incentives can be achieved in several ways, but primarily by making rights-of-way
readily available to network developers at low cost and simplifying the legal process and limiting the
fees that can be charged by local authorities for granting rights-of-way. The United States, for example,
has had a policy since 2004 that assists telecommunications providers seeking access to rights-of-way on
federal lands.52
Facilitate access to government infrastructure. Networks are often built along existing infrastructure
networks such as roads, railways, pipelines, or electricity transmission lines. Governments can provide
direct access to existing infrastructure which it owns through state-owned enterprises. For example, the
railway company could partner with one or more operators to build fiber-optic cable network along the
railway lines. This approach was used very successfully around the world to develop extensive backbone
networks at relatively low cost. In January 2011, for example, Serbian Railways and PTT Srbija agreed to
jointly construct telecommunications infrastructure along Serbian Railway’s corridors, totaling 2,031
km.53
Governments can also specifically provide for network development in the design and construction of
other types of infrastructure. For example, by pre-installing ducting when new roads are built and then
leasing these ducts to operators wishing to lay networks, governments can significantly reduce
telecommunications operators’ costs because adding communications equipment (such as cables) to
other infrastructure projects is relatively inexpensive (see Figure 2.8).

Including broadband in land use planning efforts may also promote build-out and reduce costs. For
example, requiring all new housing and building developments to include broadband infrastructure,
particularly fiber cables, alongside other utility requirements, including electricity and water can help to

                                                             36
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


lower long-term costs by ensuring that broadband infrastructure is laid at the outset; as such, avoiding
the higher costs associated with retrofitting.
National connectivity can also be enhanced by allowing the owners of electricity transmission networks,
pipelines, and railway networks to act as wholesale bandwidth providers. Such companies have a major
cost advantage in the development of fiber-optic backbone networks, for example. In practice, many
infrastructure companies have already laid fiber-optic cables as part of their internal communications
systems, and many of these cables have substantial unused capacity. Kenya Power & Lighting Company
Limited (KPLC), for example, an electrical utility, is leasing dark fiber running along its backbone to
service providers.54 In Norway, the fiber backbone of Ventelo spans the entire railway infrastructure,
covering 17,000 km. Ventelo is the second largest wholesale provider in Norway offering dark fiber and
collocation services.55 By encouraging these (usually state-owned) networks to establish operating
companies to run the fiber assets and by licensing them, they can be brought into the formal
telecommunications market as providers of backbone capacity. This has been successful in some Sub-
Saharan African countries, such as Uganda and Zambia, but not in others, such as Ghana. Whether
infrastructure companies are successful in becoming commercial backbone network operators appears
to depend on differences in the institutional environment (that is, whether the company is given
sufficient political incentives and the regulatory freedom) and in managerial capacity, rather than on the
technical characteristics of the networks.
Promote open access to existing networks. Network operators and service providers wishing to enter
the downstream market (that is, building access networks and offering services to customers) must
either build their own backbone network or access the network of another operator. In many cases,
potential new entrants and investors may see the costs of constructing an entirely new broadband
infrastructure as prohibitive, and prefer to lease or otherwise use capacity on an existing network. In
those cases, the terms under which operators can obtain access to the networks of other operators will
have a significant impact on the success of their business and will influence whether effective
competition in the downstream market develops. At the same time, the demand created by these
downstream operators will affect the financial viability of the backbone networks, since they are the
entities that generate traffic and revenues on the networks. By promoting effective competition in the
downstream market, governments will help stimulate backbone network development.
The role of the regulator is crucial, since the regulator often defines and enforces the terms of access.
The decision about whether to directly regulate the terms of access to infrastructure has a major effect
on the investment incentives. Under the traditional model of liberalization followed in Europe, in which
the incumbent operator dominated the market, the priority for the regulator was to provide access to
these operators’ networks for companies entering the markets since this was seen as being crucial to
the development of competition. Subsequently, as competition has emerged, regulators have been
required to develop systems for determining which operators should be regulated and how.
In the European Union, this system is based on the framework of general competition regulation that set
out how regulatory authorities determine whether or not competition is functioning effectively and
what remedies should be applied where it is not. In the developing world (for example, most countries
in Sub-Saharan Africa), such frameworks often do not exist. Regulators will therefore need to develop
alternative sets of guidelines to govern how access to the infrastructure of private operators in
competitive markets is regulated. This will involve a tradeoff between supporting the development of
competition in the downstream market and maintaining the incentives to invest in upstream
infrastructure. In areas of a country where public support is provided for backbone infrastructure, this
tradeoff is relatively straightforward, since one of the conditions of public support will be the provision

of wholesale services on regulated terms. In other areas of the country and in other parts of the
infrastructure, the tradeoff may be more difficult to determine.
Promote infrastructure sharing. Many governments have sought to promote greater deployment of
both wireline and wireless networks by encouraging or even requiring competing providers to share
infrastructure. In most cases, infrastructure sharing has been instituted in areas where it was concluded
that competing physical infrastructures were not economically viable (such as in rural or remote areas)
or where the construction of competing infrastructures could prove unacceptable for social or political
reasons (too much civil works disruption or too many wireless towers at prime locations). Module 3
further addresses how countries are implementing infrastructure sharing policies for wireline broadband
providers.
Infrastructure sharing can be broken down into two categories: active and passive (see Figure 2.9).
Figure 2.9. Passive and Active Infrastructure Sharing
                   • Access to rights-of-way, poles, ducts, trenches, sewers and towers.
                   • Benefits include reduced roll-out costs, deployment times and operating costs, as
                     well as less environmental stress due to less digging or placement of antennas on
    Passive          towers, buildings or poles.
    Sharing
                  • Parts of the network (usually of the dominant/SMP operator) must be available to
                    competitors at regulated or wholesale rates.
     Active       • May include local loop unbundling, bitstream or wholesale access and/or resale.

Infrastructure sharing has advantages for both wireline and wireless network operators. By sharing
network infrastructure, builders of networks can significantly reduce costs and make investment in them
more commercially viable. This is particularly relevant for fiber networks in urban areas where the cost
of laying new fibers is high or in rural areas where the revenues generated by such networks are low. In
some cases, operators have a commercial incentive to enter into these sharing arrangements. For
example, in Nigeria, where there has been extensive fiber-optic cable network rollout, operators have
entered into a variety of network-sharing agreements aimed at reducing costs and improving quality of
supply. In addition, operators may also be required to install multiple fibers in their cables, even if they
only need one. These additional “dark” (unused) fibers may not be used initially, but are held in reserve
for future use by an existing operator or new entrant. This may be a very cost-efficient way to manage
fiber networks because installation (and the associated civil works costs) only needs to be done once as
opposed to multiple rounds of digging to install multiple fibers.
With wireless networks, particularly in low-density areas where the economics may not support multiple
competing infrastructures, carriers can share cell towers and some backhaul facilities as a way of
reducing network build-out costs and bringing competition to such areas more quickly. Such
arrangements have slowly been gaining acceptance in both developing and developed countries,
particularly as carriers seek to manage costs when expanding their networks or upgrading their services
to support higher speed broadband.56
For example, several countries in the European Union promote infrastructure sharing among mobile
operators to reduce the cost and increase the coverage of mobile broadband networks. As a result,

                                                    38
                         Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


many operators in European countries have reached agreements to share 3G and 4G networks. For
instance, Telefonica and Vodafone have agreed to share their mobile networks in four European
countries, including Spain, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom to improve their mobile
broadband coverage in these countries.57 In Sweden, Tele2 and Telenor agreed to form a joint venture to
deploy a nationwide 4G LTE (long-term evolution) network. The agreement includes the sharing of
active network infrastructure, such as the RANs (radio access networks) and of spectrum in the 2600
MHz and 900 MHz bands.58 The operators expect to provide access to mobile broadband to 99 percent
of the population at speeds of up to 80Mbps in rural areas and 150 Mbps in urban areas by 2013.59 In
France, the regulator has taken a further step and required mobile operators to present a plan to share
their mobile networks and provide coverage to 95 percent of the population. If the plan does not meet
the regulators’ expectations, the regulator will mandate operators to share their mobile broadband
infrastructure to achieve the coverage goal.60 The combination of different infrastructure-sharing
obligations on the incumbent operator and the promotion of mobile broadband networks in countries
such as Spain have resulted in significant increases in mobile broadband coverage and service adoption
(see Practice Note 2.4).

Despite the advantages of infrastructure sharing, governments should exercise a degree of caution
when implementing such measures. One concern is that such arrangements are difficult to enforce if the
parties are not willing to undertake enforcement on a commercial basis. Though requirements to share
facilities are already included in many operators’ licenses, they are rarely implemented or enforced if
the operators are unwilling to enter into the arrangements. In Bahrain, for example, the regulatory
framework established when the market was liberalized, required the incumbent operator, Batelco, to
share its surplus fiber and duct space with new entrants on regulated terms. Despite ongoing efforts by
the regulator to enforce such arrangements, this policy has had limited success, and entrants have
opted instead to develop their own wireless-based backbone infrastructure. The regulatory authority in
Bahrain is now revisiting the legal and regulatory framework that provides competitors with access to
Batelco’s infrastructure. It has also introduced more detailed rules on network sharing (see Box 2.10).
Box 2.10. Network Sharing in Bahrain
Article 3(c) 13 of the Telecommunications Law of The Kingdom of Bahrain gives the regulatory authority
the right to require operators to share infrastructure. The details of this requirement are given in
guidelines issued in 2008.Telecommunications operators in Bahrain are “required to adopt joint
infrastructure installation methods when more than one provider wishes to lay telecommunications
infrastructure at the same location and within a timeframe not exceeding one year” (Section 1.11 [a]).
The operators are required to share the costs of such joint network construction on a pro rata basis.
The article goes further in encouraging infrastructure sharing through the following provisions:
     If operators are unable to reach a commercial agreement on a joint project, they are required to
         go to the regulatory body for “mediation and/or a binding decision.”
         Operators are not permitted to undertake fiber network development in a particular area if a
          fiber network has been constructed in the same area within the past 12 months.
         Operators are required to install at least 20 percent reserve area in their ducts for future use by
          other operators.

       Operators are prevented from using spare ducts for themselves or blocking other operators
        from obtaining access to them.

Law.

A second reason for caution lies in the concern that facilities sharing may help sustain collusive
agreements between competing operators. This has been a major issue in Europe, where mobile
operators seeking to share mobile infrastructure faced resistance from the European Commission.61 The
European Court of First Instance, however, subsequently ruled in favor of the operators.62 In many
developing countries, with their increasingly competitive telecommunications markets, competition-
related issues may be of less immediate concern, particularly when balanced against the need for new
infrastructure investment. Policy makers may consider that the risk of collusion is outweighed by the
benefits of infrastructure development in rural and otherwise unprofitable areas. Additionally, rules
requiring active infrastructure sharing may curb incentives to invest in networks—incumbents may opt
against network upgrades since they must share their infrastructure with competitors while new
entrants may opt against deploying their own networks in order to continue reselling capacity from the
incumbent.

STEP 2: Facilitate Enhanced Competition and Investment
In the context of a private sector-led approach to broadband development, it is recognized that allowing
competition to flourish will usually lead to greater deployment and efficiencies in network build-out.
Once policies have been established to encourage new players to enter the market, government
policymakers must also ensure that laws and regulations support fair competition and continued
investment. In fact, a key lesson from the countries surveyed in the World Bank’s Building Broadband
report is that competition is critical to successful broadband market promotion.63 Each country studied
used different mechanisms to spur competition and promote broadband market growth. Some focused
primarily on facilities-based competition, while others focused more generally on increasing the level of
competition at the service level. The presence of established, competitive telecommunications
operators in many countries has also contributed to broadband market development.
In the long-term, liberalization and promotion of competition among facilities is also the best way to
guarantee lower costs. For example, the initiation of the Southern and East Africa Cable System
(SEACOM) network that links Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, and Tanzania resulted in
Kenya Data Networks (KDN), a Kenyan data services provider, announcing that it would reduce its
Internet prices by up to 90 percent.64 However, liberalization may be difficult in some developing
countries, particularly those with small populations that are geographically isolated, or are small island
developing states (SIDS)65 with limited access to multiple sources for connectivity. Module 7 discusses
the challenges faced by these unique countries. Specific countries may exhibit features that make
developing competitive markets in certain segments of the supply chain particularly difficult.
For countries seeking to improve the competitive nature of their broadband markets, several strategies
can help, as discussed below.
Remove constraints on network providers. Some countries, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa, impose
constraints on the activities of both backbone network operators and the users of those networks.
Constraints include restrictions on the sale of network services and requirements to purchase backbone
network services from specific operators, usually the state-owned incumbent operator. Removing
these restrictions would allow operators to buy services from and sell services to whichever operator



                                                   40
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


they wished. By doing so, traffic could be consolidated, providing an incentive to upgrade networks to
fiber-optic cables and thereby reduce average costs and improve quality of service.
From the moment a new service provider enters a market, the dominant incumbent usually devises
strategies to maintain its dominance, while the entrant struggles to increase its market share as quickly
as possible. As market volatility decreases and competition intensifies, traditional regulatory issues for
fixed line telephony— such as interconnection, facilities access, and sharing of passive infrastructure—
are likely to emerge in more complicated forms for broadband. In addition, broadband facilitation leads
to the convergence of communications and broadcasting and blurs their borders, making regulatory
issues even more complex. Thus special efforts are needed to enhance regulators’ ability to respond to
such challenges.
Improve the regulation of interconnecting networks. One of the key constraints on the development of
network services in many developing countries is difficulty in enforcing contracts and service-level
agreements. To address such issues, the regulatory authority could improve the situation by:
       Establishing clear regulations on interconnection at the backbone level;
       Amending licenses to increase the enforceability of such rules, if necessary;
       Setting out effective quality controls and clear dispute resolution procedures; and
       Collecting accurate quality of service information to facilitate market functionality and dispute
        resolution.
Governments might, for example, reach a regional agreement on principles of open-access regulation or
on the way in which a specific type of multi-country network is regulated. One example of this type of
approach is the telecommunications-related commitments that countries make when joining the World
Trade Organization. These commitments have introduced a limited degree of cross-country
harmonization in the way in which the telecommunications sector is regulated. Further agreements of
this type could be established at the regional level.
By entering into a regional regulation agreement, governments may be able to provide additional
assurance that investors will not face excessive political risk originating at the national level. However,
regional approaches to the governance of the telecommunications sector have proven very difficult to
implement in practice. Even in the European Union, where a strong move toward harmonization of
sector regulation in the context of general economic and institutional integration has take place,
telecommunications sector regulation remains the responsibility of national regulatory authorities,
albeit within an overall regulatory framework defined at the European level.
Because regional approaches to regulatory capacity building and technical assistance in dealing with
backbone networks are likely to be easier to achieve than complete regional regulatory harmonization,
they may be a more effective way of improving the quality of regulation. Examples of the former
approach include developing regional benchmarking data on prices and quality of service for backbone
network services, standardizing reference interconnection offers (RIOs), and standardizing license terms
and conditions. Existing regional associations of regulatory authorities in Sub-Saharan Africa, for
example, provide a potential basis for such regional approaches to regulating backbone networks.
Provide regulatory certainty. Governments should seek to provide as much certainty as possible
regarding their regulatory approaches to broadband buildout. This is particularly true with spectrum
and licensing issues. Such certainty will give operators and investors confidence in making investments
in wireless network infrastructure. The ministry and/or regulator will need to state clearly, for example,
what their policies and plans are for identifying and reallocating spectrum for wireless broadband,

                                                    41
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


establish clear technical and service rules that will govern the service and establish clear, transparent
and equal license terms. Operators need to know that spectrum is available, in which bands, or when
more is coming. In order to develop good business cases, they also need to know under what terms
spectrum will be released, if there will be coverage or universal service obligations, etc. With a clear and
fair framework in place, investment likely will flow into the marketplace. Conversely, it will be hard for
investors and network operators to commit to a commercial deployment in those markets where the
regulatory and licensing framework is not clear.
Consider risk guarantees and insurance. Companies operating in a risky environment are likely to place
a premium on scalability and reversibility in their network infrastructure investment decisions.
Scalability means that network investments take place in small increments, rather than large one-off
expenditures. Scalable investments allow operators to expand their networks as demand develops,
hence reducing the risk that networks are over dimensioned. Reversibility reflects the ability of a
network operator to reverse investments and sell or reuse capital equipment if necessary.
Some types of network investments are more reversible than others. Microwave and satellite
transmission equipment, for example, can be moved and used in another part of the network if
necessary. The majority of the capital cost of a fiber network lies in civil works, such as construction of
trenches and installation of ducts, which cannot be moved once built. Investment in such networks is
largely irreversible (sometimes referred to as “sunk costs”). In uncertain political and regulatory
environments, operators are likely to favor more flexible investment in wireless network technology
over fiber-optic networks. The risk of investment in fiber-optic cable networks could be mitigated,
however, through the use of financial instruments such as partial risk guarantees and political risk
insurance.66
Reduce commercial risk through demand aggregation. Two key risks faced by entrants into any market
are the risk that demand does not develop as anticipated and that the cost of obtaining customers turns
out to be higher than anticipated. These risks can significantly raise the economic cost of an investment
and create a disincentive for operators to invest in infrastructure, particularly in physical assets that may
constitute a sunk cost. One way that governments can reduce these risks is to act as a central purchaser
of services on behalf of all public institutions at all levels (including, for example, schools, health centers,
and local government). By doing this, operators effectively deal with a single large customer rather than
multiple smaller customers, hence reducing commercial risks. Such a strategy was undertaken on a large
scale in the Republic of Korea, where the government promoted the rollout of high-speed backbone
infrastructure by acting as a single purchaser of broadband connectivity on behalf of public institutions,
hence reducing operators’ risk of investment. A comparable approach was adopted by the government
of Ireland with respect to submarine fiber infrastructure. Both cases are described in Box 2.11.
Box 2.11. Examples of Infrastructure Development through Demand Aggregation
Republic of Korea
The government of Korea provided financing for the development of the country’s broadband
infrastructure in the form of a prepayment for the provision of broadband services to public institutions.
Between 1995 and 1997, the government provided $0.2 billion toward the overall $2.2 billion cost of
building an optical fiber network. The remaining funding was provided by the private sector, mainly
Korea Telecom. The second phase, between 1998 and 2000, focused on the access network, and the
government contributed $0.3 billion of the total required investment of $7.3 billion. The final phase,
between 2001 and 2005, involved the upgrading of the entire network. In this phase, the government
contributed $0.4 billion toward a total cost of $24 billion. In exchange for this upfront payment,
operators were required to provide broadband services to public institutions for an extended period.


                                                      42
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


The government’s financing was effectively a prepayment for services that, although representing only a
small percentage of the total investment cost, provided the private sector with sufficient incentive to
develop its networks.
It is significant that the Korean initiative was done in the context of an overall policy promoting
broadband that included full market liberalization to establish infrastructure competition among
operators and demand-side stimulation through initiatives such as ICT literacy training, free broadband
access to all schools, 11 e-government projects, and support for the provision of inexpensive personal
computers for low-income households. The result of this combined policy has been an explosion of
network investment and usage of broadband services. All cities, towns, and villages are now connected
by high-speed networks and the cost of broadband services is low.
Ireland
In 1999, Ireland’s Industrial Development Authority, under the Ministry of Public Enterprise, entered
into a public private partnership (PPP) with Global Crossing under which the latter would build a fiber-
optic ring that would provide subsidized international connectivity to Ireland’s rapidly expanding
telecommunications operators, ISPs, and ICT firms.
Global Crossing developed, owned, and operated the infrastructure. The government purchased the
capacity in bulk and resold it to all operators on an open-access and uniformly subsidized pricing
structure. By acting as an “anchor tenant,” the government provided risk reduction sufficient enough to
allow the private company to invest. At the same time, by on-selling the capacity at uniform and
nondiscriminatory rates, this structure supported the development of the downstream market through
ensuring that both small and large operators had access to inexpensive international capacity.

World Bank, August 2008, p. 43.

Because companies in some developing countries have had difficulty in collecting revenues from public
institutions for utility services such as water and electricity, an issue to consider in relation to
commercial risk is the extent to which the credit risk associated with the public sector as a customer
offsets the commercial advantages of bulk purchase of backbone services. Use of prepayment and
escrow mechanisms can reduce this credit risk.
Improve quality of service. One ongoing issue in the provision of local broadband access is the problem
of quality of service. A significant difference often exists between advertised speeds and actual speeds
achieved by users (see Figure 2.10) in both the wireline and wireless contexts. The problem is that the
advertised speeds are usually based on the theoretical capability of the technology or standard. In
reality, however, numerous factors make such speeds very difficult or even impossible to achieve,
including network congestion or (for wireless networks) radio interference.

In an effort to manage network quality, many providers are moving away from unlimited broadband
packages and adopting so-called “fair use policies” in order to control and regulate traffic. One practice
is the use of data caps where providers establish a threshold on the amount of data that can be
downloaded per month. Once the cap is exceeded, the subscriber either must purchase additional
download volume, or the subscriber’s speed is reduced or in the worst scenario, service is terminated
for that month. Some operators establish different caps for domestic and international traffic. Another
practice is controlling the use of high-bandwidth applications or access to traffic-intensive sites through
restrictions or degrading service. This practice has been banned in some countries as a violation of
network neutrality. Providers have been known to “throttle” service by limiting the subscriber’s
bandwidth when they have exceeded data caps or try to access traffic-intensive sites.
These network management practices have been contentious since they are often co vered by the “small
print” of customer contracts and many users are not aware of them. In an effort to alleviate consumer
concerns about service quality, some governments monitor and compile reports on service quality. The
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) in Bahrain, for example, publishes data on wireline
broadband performance.67 The TRA measures upload and download speeds for different broadband
packages, DNS response (time taken in milliseconds to translate a domain name to its IP address) and
ping (send an echo request to a server to test latency). In other countries, although governments do not
publish quality of service reports, they offer sites consumers can go to in order to check their speeds.68

STEP 3: Address anti-competitive behavior
Even if all the policies discussed above are implemented, it is still possible that competition can be
stymied. In many cases, this is due to the presence of large, vertically integrated (often former
monopoly) providers that are dominant across markets and use their power to thwart new entrants and
suppress fair competition. In some cases, regulators have tried for years to curtail such behavior, but

                                                    44
                    Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


without success. In such extreme cases, governments must look beyond purely regulatory remedies to
the underlying structure of such companies to see if they are distorting market forces. If so,
policymakers may consider ways to break up the company to promote greater and fairer competition in
the market.
 As detailed in Module 3, vertical integration refers to instances where a single firm controls multiple
levels of the supply chain and is able to realize both greater economies of scale and lower costs of
production. Although in a competitive market, vertical integration can result in lower retail prices and
better, more varied services, it can create barriers to entry in markets where certain operators are
dominant.69 Where needed, regulators may seek to impose various obligations on dominant operators
in order to promote competition, including (see Module 3 for a detailed analysis on these obligations):
      Accounting separation: Typically requires the dominant and vertically integrated operator to
       maintain separate records for its upstream and downstream costs and revenues in order to
       allow the regulator to set wholesale prices for the regulated upstream services. The records are
       typically subject to independent audit and may also be made publicly available. Although the
       operator must make its costs transparent, under this remedy it is able to continue benefiting
       from the operational efficiencies of vertical integration. This remedy is prevalent in many
       countries and less intrusive than functional or structural separation.
      Functional separation: If accounting separation does not sufficiently curb anti-competitive
       behavior, a regulator may require the dominant provider to establish a new business division—
       separate from its other divisions—to manage the network and provide wholesale services to all
       retail service providers on a non-discrimination basis. In many cases, other regulatory
       obligations are used as a complement to functional separation, such as LLU and/or providing
       bitstream access. (See Box 2.12 for an overview of functional separation and broadband uptake
       in the United Kingdom.)
      Structural separation: Involves full disaggregation of the vertically integrated operator’s
       wholesale and retail divisions into separate, individual companies, each with its own ownership
       and management structure. All benefits associated with vertical integration are eliminated.70
       Structural separation is extremely difficult to reverse and can dramatically affect the market,
       such as by increasing regulatory uncertainty and impacting infrastructure investment.
       Additionally, it is difficult to allocate the separated firms’ assets and liabilities in order to ensure
       the ongoing viability of both entities.71 As a result, regulatory authorities rarely impose
       structural separation as a remedy, and only after other regulatory interventions have failed.
Box 2.12. Functional separation and broadband uptake in the United Kingdom
British Telecom (BT), the incumbent operator in the United Kingdom, proposed to the regulator to
functionally separate its network division in 2005 after the regulator’s review of the market. The main
obligations undertaken by BT were as follows:
   •   Establish a new and operationally separated division (Openreach), staffed with British Telecom’s
       employees responsible for network operations. Management was to be completely independent
       from BT and the compensation system was to be based on the success of this division only;
   •   Provide services under the obligation of equivalence of inputs. Therefore, the new division had
       to provide to competitors the same services and products it offers to British Telecom under the
       same conditions, including prices, and with the same information systems and processes
       provided to British Telecom; and
   •   Create an independent body, the Equality of Access Board, to monitor compliance with these

                                                     45
                       Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


        obligations.
Since these undertakings were adopted and BT’s functional separation was implemented, competition in
the broadband market boomed. In 2005, BT had 37 percent of market share. By 2008, its market share
was reduced to 25 percent, with more than 20 operators offering broadband over Openreach services.
Broadband uptake increased substantially, fuelled by competing operators using BT’s wholesale
services. By 2008, more than half of broadband access was provided by competing operators over BT’s
infrastructure (Figure 2.11).

The experience in the United Kingdom shows that functional separation is not a substitute for other
regulatory obligations but a complement that is imposed in addition to other obligations. For instance,
functional separation cannot succeed in eliminating the bottleneck in the domestic step of the supply
chain without the simultaneous mandate of local loop unbundling (LLU) and bitstream obligations that
help eliminate the bottleneck in the local connection step (see below for a further description of these
obligations). Indeed, LLU and bitstream obligations are currently the most important source of
competition in the United Kingdom.
LLU and bitstream obligations existed before functional separation was in place but their use was limited
due to British Telecom’s constraints (see Figure 2.12). It was only because functional separation
eliminated both bottlenecks (domestic and local connection) simultaneously that broadband
competition could be fostered in the United Kingdom’s market.

2.4.2 Enabling Policies to Eliminate Bottlenecks in the Broadband Supply
        Chain
Broadband networks are not simple things; they consist of multiple components, all of which must work
together in order for broadband services to be delivered to end users in the most efficient and effective
way possible. For purposes of analysis and policy development, the broadband supply chain can be
broken down into four discrete parts or levels:
    1. International connectivity: The country’s connection to the rest of the world; provided by fiber
       optic (usually submarine) cable or satellite.
    2. Domestic backbone: Traffic carried between fixed aggregation points within a network;
       provided by fiber optic cable, microwave or satellite.
    3. Metropolitan and backhaul: Connection between the backbone and local networks or cell site
       to network; provided by fiber optic, microwave or cable.
    4. Last mile: Link between the customer and the network; provided by fiber, xDSL, cable or
       wireless.
The most common market failure on the supply side is the absence of competition due to the historic
monopolist provision of telecommunications services. However, there can be other market failures, such
as lack of economies of scale or threshold market failures that impede the deployment of broadband
infrastructure in rural areas. In order to be most effective, competition must be present throughout the
different levels of the broadband supply chain (see Box 2.13). If not, bottlenecks arise and the benefits
of broadband diffusion are severely reduced. For instance, if domestic and local levels are competitive,
but access to international connectivity is limited or too expensive because only one provider of
submarine cable exists, broadband prices will remain high and diffusion will not achieve its potential.
The same can happen if all other levels in the supply chain are competitive, but local connectivity is
limited to one single operator. As such, it is important to develop enabling policies to eliminate
bottlenecks across the broadband supply chain.

High-penetration countries have been successful because they have addressed competition market
failures throughout the supply chain. However, the particular conditions of each specific broadband
market may give rise to different bottlenecks and thus require different policy approaches. Not all
countries have identified the same bottlenecks in the supply chain, nor have they adopted the same
competition policies to ensure competition. However, it is possible to identify two main approaches to
competition policies: inter-platform competition and intra-platform competition. The first consists of
ensuring competition among different network platforms with limited access to the incumbent’s
infrastructure by alternative operators. The second one, intra-platform competition, consists of
establishing access obligations on the incumbent’s network to allow alternative operators to gain
economies of scale before incurring the high fixed costs of network deployment. Some countries, such
as the United States, put the emphasis on inter-platform competition, whereas others, such as the
European Union countries, stress intra-platform competition through unbundling of the local loop (LLU)
and other obligations (see section 2.4.1).72 Nevertheless, the goal of both policy approaches is the same:
to increase competitive conditions and achieve sustainable competition in the long term. Nor are the
two approaches mutually exclusive. Most countries that have achieved high broadband diffusion, such
as Canada, Denmark, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, have combined both approaches
throughout the supply chain.
Multiple policy initiatives are needed to effectively create this enabling environment for infrastructure
competition. They can be divided into four groups: (i) removing regulatory obstacles; (ii) reducing the
cost of investment; (iii) removing political and commercial risks; and (iv) promoting effective
competition in the downstream market.
The following sections discuss each step in the broadband supply chain and policies that can help
promote greater deployment of broadband networks at each step.

                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Promoting International Connectivity
In order to provide the physical connections between widely separated broadband resources and
consumers, countries must establish international links (gateways) to connect to the world’s Internet
and telephone networks. The technologies providing long haul transmission, such as fiber optic cable
and satellites, typically have very high investment costs. While initial “sunk” costs are high, they have
very low incremental costs to accommodate additional users. These technologies also enable carriers to
activate additional capacity on an incremental, graduated basis as demand grows.
As detailed in Module 5, the vast majority of international telecommunications traffic is carried by
undersea cable systems—more than 95 percent according to some estimates.73 This reflects the
advantages of fiber optic cable in terms of bandwidth and latency compared to satellite. Undersea fiber
optic cables can transmit data at speeds measured in Tbit/s, while even the newest communications
satellites offer speeds below 1 Gbit/s as well as higher latency. As of early 2011, there were more than
120 major submarine cable systems, with another 25 planned to enter service by 2015.74 Nevertheless,
for many developing countries, international connectivity continues to be a bottleneck in the
development of broadband connectivity.
First, submarine cables are quite expensive to deploy, with costs that routinely reach into hundreds of
millions of U.S. dollars. As such, many are financed by consortiums of operators rather than a single
investor, such as the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy), which has landing points in nine
countries and connects to several additional landlocked countries and is funded by 16 African and
international shareholders, all of whom are telecommunications operators and service providers.
These huge costs of deploying undersea fiber optic and satellite networks present a challenge for many
developing countries, particularly land-locked countries that lack coastal regions to support a landing
station for undersea cable. The transit costs to tap into undersea cables can be significant as national
and regional fiber backbones may not be available to tap into the undersea cable (although this is
becoming less of an issue over time as landlocked countries complete some type of fiber connection to
the international cables through neighboring countries). Even where landlocked countries are able to
negotiate a virtual coastline so that they own and operate a cable landing station in a neighboring
country’s territory, they are dependent on the neighboring country to provide reliable and reasonable
prices for transit.
Many SIDS, mainly in the Pacific Ocean, face a connectivity challenge since they are distant from
undersea fiber routes and facilities-based competition in the international connectivity markets may not
be economically supportable, especially those that generate small amounts of traffic. Regulatory
restrictions or high costs may restrict service providers from accessing undersea cables. As a result,
such countries often have to rely on the use of alternative technologies, such as satellites that often
carry a higher price premium.
Second, capacity on these networks tends to be owned by a few carriers and wholesale arrangements
are not always optimum for smaller players. Likewise, a few global IP carriers dominate wholesale
access to the Internet and smaller ISPs are forced to pay one-way interconnection charges. Submarine
cables connect to domestic backhaul networks at a cable termination station, which is—but may not
be—the same facility as the cable landing station (i.e., where the cable makes landfall). Because all
operators in a market, particularly new entrants, may not have the resources to own and operate a
cable landing station, the owners of such stations, generally the incumbent operators in newly
liberalized markets, may be required to provide access to the station, and therefore to the cable, on
reasonable terms to competing service providers. Limited access to landing stations can have a chilling
effect on the diffusion and take-up of broadband services. Conversely, limited opportunities or


                                                   49
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


burdensome regulations related to cable landing can discourage interest in that market among cable
operators, again creating a connectivity bottleneck.
Despite the constraints, the most efficient way to lower costs and keep pace with demand is through
liberalization and promotion of competition among facilities that provide international connectivity, in
particular international gateways, submarine cables, and landing stations. As such, it is important to
ensure that there is more than one international carrier and international gateway, and where possible,
redundant international cables and other facilities linking a country to competitive global
communication networks.
For countries without a well-functioning international connectivity market, targeted ex ante regulation
may be required to address market failure.75 Governments and regulators may need to implement
competitive policies with respect to issues such as submarine cable landing stations, open access, and
infrastructure sharing to eliminate such bottlenecks (see section 2.4.1).
In addition, countries such as India76 and Colombia have adopted various obligations on international
gateways, landing stations and submarine cable systems. In Colombia, for example, after conducting a
review of wholesale inputs for broadband Internet access, the regulator found that cable landing
stations constituted essential facilities and required landing station operators to provide access to their
facilities on non-discriminatory terms and to publish a reference access offer.77
Self-regulation can also be a tool for reducing costs and increasing access to facilities required for
international connectivity. Consortium agreements for submarine cable systems, for example, are
progressively including non-discrimination and open access clauses whereby third parties are
guaranteed access to facilities and capacity at comparable terms to those offered to the facilities’
owners or subsidiaries. For instance, the Eastern African Submarine Cable System (EASSy), which runs
from South Africa to Sudan with connections to all countries along its route, includes such safeguards.
Launched in 2010, EASSy allows any consortium member to sell capacity in any market in the region to
licensed operators on non-discriminatory terms and conditions.78

Building a Domestic Backbone
The second level of the broadband supply chain is the national backbone network, which is essential for
broadband connectivity since it provides the link from international gateways to local markets, as well as
domestic connectivity between major cities and towns. These links require large capacities because their
function is to aggregate traffic from different areas of the country and then carry it on to the next node
or city. Historically, such links were provided by satellite or microwave systems, but in the last decade,
fiber-optic cables have come to provide the vast majority of backbone links due to significant
improvements in capacity and reliability, coupled with lower long-term maintenance costs.79
Countries face several challenges in seeking to develop and promote national backbone networks. The
first relates to technology. The choice of a national backbone strategy is highly dependent on a country’s
size and topography, regulatory environment and broadband market size. Different technologies are
used for backbone connectivity, such as fiber, satellite, and microwave (see Module 5 for more
information on the individual technologies). In reviewing the different technologies it is important to
bear in mind that the selection of the appropriate backbone connectivity option often depends on the
distance to be covered and the forecasted capacity requirements. Fiber optic cable is typically perceived
as the optimum solution for national backbone connectivity given its high capacity and upgradeability.
As a result, different mixes of technologies will be employed and private investors and policymakers will
need to examine the tradeoffs between bandwidth needs, CAPEX, operating expenses (OPEX),
upgradeability and regulatory impacts, among others. Nevertheless, fiber optic cable is typically


                                                    50
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


perceived as the optimum solution for national backbone connectivity given its high capacity and
upgradeability.
A second major consideration is cost. Building backbone networks is very capital intensive; requiring
significant investments. In countries with large physical distances to cover (and/or low population
densities in some parts of the country), this fixed cost may difficult for private companies to justify.
Most of the cost of constructing wireline networks lies in the civil works. These costs represent a major
fixed and sunk investment, and a real risk to network operators in the face of uncertain demand.
Beyond the absolute cost, such networks also account for a significant portion of the costs of building a
full-fledged broadband network.
A key lesson from a World Bank study on backbone networks in Sub-Saharan Africa is that many
countries do not provide incentives for private investment and competition in backbone networks.80 In
many cases, in fact, there are direct disincentives against competition. In order to defray the costs of
deploying and operating a backbone network, investors and operators seek to load as much traffic onto
the backbone as possible. This is often accomplished by reselling capacity to downstream providers on a
wholesale, non-discriminatory basis. This also helps to establish competition across multiple tiers of
service.81
Approaches to promote backbone development
Policymakers considering ways to build out broadband backbones will have to address many complex
issues, but they also have a range of policy options available to them. From a policy perspective,
promoting private investment in backbone networks, can help to reduce the overall financial burden on
the public sector of ensuring widespread and affordable broadband availability. Encouraging
investment in and effective competition among backbone networks also allows market forces to aggre-
gate traffic onto higher-capacity networks, thus reducing costs and stimulating downstream investment
and competition among ISPs sand other data users. The policy of promoting infrastructure competition
to support the development of backbone networks is consistent with the experience of developed
countries going back many years. For example, in a 2006 report, the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) observed that “opening markets to facilities competition and the
rapid development of technology [has] resulted in highly competitive backbone markets in most OECD
countries. The development of geographically dispersed Internet exchange points (IXPs) in larger
countries has further assisted the development of a competitive market.”82 In the same report, the
OECD observed a similar effect in developing countries: “[t]he same competitive forces that have driven
down the cost of telecommunication are now at work with broadband access to the Internet. From early
2004 to mid-2005, average broadband prices fell 75 [percent] in India. For example, a 256 [kilobits per
second] xDSL connection with 400 [m]megabytes of data transfer included, is available from Bharat
Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) for less than USD 6 per month.”83
Governments with high broadband penetration and adoption have intervened in this section of the
broadband supply chain mainly by subsidizing the construction of or connection to backhaul networks
and by rolling out backbone networks to connect public institutions throughout the country. For
instance, in Canada the government has subsidized the connection of rural areas to backhaul networks.
Chile has financed the extension of broadband connectivity to rural and isolated areas through an ad
hoc public fund to avoid distorting the market and to crowd-in private investment (see Box 2.13). In
Iceland and Luxembourg, the government has built a network connecting public institutions, such as
research centers and government offices. In Japan, the government promotes the roll-out of fiber optic
networks to regions without broadband connectivity.84

Box 2.13. Extending connectivity to rural and isolated areas in Chile
Contrary to other countries, Chile did not establish a universal service fund to extend the coverage of
telecommunications networks to underserved areas. Instead, it created an ad hoc fund, the Fondo de
Desarrollo de las Telecomunicaciones (FDT), financed with public funds (from both the federal
government and the regions). No specific contribution from operators is related to the funding of the
FDT. Indeed, in Chile there is no universal service obligation for telecommunications operators. The
rationale for this is not to distort the telecommunications market with a tax on an operator’s profits.
The current fund was created for a 10-year period and is anchored in the Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications. Initially, the FDT was restricted to financing projects that extended public
telephony in underserved rural and low-income areas. However, in 2001 the regulation of the FDT was
modified to allow for funding a broader set of projects, including the extension of broadband
connectivity and the use of ICTs among the population in target areas. The fund is administered by a
board comprised of the representatives from several ministries (including the Ministry of Transport and
Telecommunications, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of the Treasury, and the Ministry of
Planning and Cooperation), as well as representatives of the Chilean regions.
Projects of the FDT
The initial mission of the FDT was to provide public telephony to 6,000 underserved localities. However,
as this objective was achieved and Internet became more important to society, the FDT changed its
focus to provide Internet access and other telecommunications services, including radio and television
broadcasting, in underserved areas.
Following the adoption of the 2007-2012 ICT national strategy, the FDT substantially increased its
importance as a policy tool to expand broadband connectivity to isolated and rural areas. The fund
increased its budget significantly, which allowed it to finance a larger number of projects and to set
more ambitious goals, such as providing rural broadband connectivity to the entire rural population of
the country. The FDT has been used to provide funding to private operators to develop connectivity and
infocenters projects, among others. For all the projects, subsidies are distributed through competitive
bidding (using a reverse auction model). Some of the projects related to broadband that have been
funded by the FDT include:
       Infocenters for rural areas (2002-2009). The FDT offered subsidies to install Internet centers
        (infocenters) in rural areas. Infocenters comprise several PCs and Internet connections. E-
        training sessions are also conducted in these centers. The purpose of the infocenters is both to
        increase access to the Internet in rural areas and to educate the population on the use of the
        Internet. From 2003 to 2004, the fund awarded subsidies of US$ 4.9 million for 294 Internet
        centers in rural areas. The FDT has continued providing funds for infocenter projects, awarding
        additional funds in 2007.
       Extension of Internet connectivity to rural schools (2005). The FDT offered subsidies to connect
        1,000 rural schools to the Internet. Subsidies amounted to US$6.5 million.
       Deployment of fiber optic networks to connect isolated areas (2007). The FDT offered subsidies
        for more than US$4 billion to extend fiber-optic networks and provide broadband connectivity
        to isolated areas.
       Broadband connectivity to the rural population (2008). FDT offered subsidies for USDS70 million
        to provide connectivity of at least 1 Mbps to 3 million people in rural areas (40 percent of the
        Chilean population) and boost ICT use among agrarian and touristic industries in those areas.

Governments also have other means to stimulate the deployment of backbone networks, including:
borrowing from multi- and bi-lateral agencies; encouraging operator build-out; promoting open access
and facilities sharing. These topics are discussed in more detail in Module 5.
The backbone policy development process is discussed in more detail in the following section, but can
be summarized in the policy “road map” shown in Figure 2.14.

Assess the Costs and Benefits of Support to the Development of Backbone Networks. A key step in
implementing the backbone policy framework is an assessment of costs and benefits. Estimating the
value of the benefits is challenging for two reasons. The first reason relates to defining the benefits of
backbone networks. As one element of the broadband supply chain, backbone networks, on their own,
do not deliver the final product (that is, broadband connectivity) to customers. If backbone policy is not
placed within the overall context of broadband policy, it is unlikely to be effective in increasing
connectivity to end users. However, by doing so, it is difficult to attribute causality directly to the


                                                      53
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


backbone policy, since the benefits could be equally ascribed to policy actions taken on international
connectivity or access networks.
The second reason relates to uncertainty surrounding future broadband development in many
developing countries. Since the economic benefits arise from lower prices and greater consumption of
broadband connectivity, any attempt to estimate the benefits of backbone policy will require a forecast
of broadband take-up following policy implementation.
Notwithstanding these challenges, it is possible to undertake a basic analysis of the costs and benefits of
an overall policy designed to boost broadband connectivity. The starting point of this analysis would be
an assumption that the government undertakes a comprehensive approach, aimed at all the major
potential bottlenecks in the broadband market. Potential benefits of this type of broadband policy lie in
the additional consumer surplus that would be generated by meeting increased demand for broadband
connectivity and the long-term boost to economic growth that might accrue from increased broadband
connectivity. There are few robust estimates of the parameters required for such calculations so there
would be a considerable margin of error surrounding any such estimate of the benefits. Estimating the
costs of broadband policy initiatives, however, is likely to be more straightforward since these are based
on defined actions by the government to which cost estimates can be attached.
In practice, decisions on public expenditure are rarely based only on cost-benefit analysis, and political
priorities often have a greater impact on the allocation of public resources. In such circumstances, or
where an accurate estimate of the benefits of public support to broadband connectivity is not available,
an analysis of the costs of the different policy options would still be useful, as it would allow policy
makers to make decisions on the basis of information on the relative costs of each potential course of
action.
Determine the Institutional Implications of Backbone Network Policy Recommendations. An
important issue to consider in designing the appropriate policy framework for promoting backbone
networks is the implications for the institutions that govern the sector, typically the ministry responsible
for of communications and the regulatory authority. The policy options outlined here vary both in the
burden they place on these institutions and on the extent that their success depends on their being able
to perform their functions. For example, issuing new licenses typically does not require institutional
capacity beyond that which already exists in most countries. However, designing complex consortium
structures with regulated terms of access places a much larger burden on a government or regulatory
authority. Given the limited capacity of many regulatory institutions in some developing countries, the
dependence of the success of the policy options on the regulatory authority is an important factor to
take into account in designing the overall backbone policy framework.
The challenges faced by regulators in implementing backbone network policies can be divided into three
categories. The first relates to the technical difficulty associated with implementation of the policy. For
example, defining standard quality of service criteria for backbone services in order to improve the
functioning of the market is less technically demanding than developing complex consortia-based invest-
ment projects. The second is an institutional challenge related to the capacity of public institutions to
make and enforce decisions relating to the sector. This capacity is determined by a number of factors,
such as the legal framework that defines the institution’s powers, the financial resources of the
institution, and the availability of skilled staff in the institution. The third challenge relates to the
political economy of the ICT sector. Some policy decisions may act directly counter to the interests of
one or more parties in the market or the government. For example, in countries where backbone
services are monopolized by an incumbent operator, liberalizing the wholesale market may adversely
affect the profits of the incumbent, particularly in the short term. Liberalization may therefore meet
significant institutional resistance, thus making other policy options easier to implement.

Box 2.14. Wholesale Licensing to Promote Backbone Development
One way of encouraging investment in backbone networks is to issue “carrier” (wholesale-only) licenses.
Such licensees would be permitted to build backbone networks and then sell capacity to other
operators, such as mobile operators or ISPs. The advantage of this approach is that it encourages
investment and competition specifically in the backbone segment of the market. It also avoids problems
of discrimination by the backbone network among retail operators. Such carrier networks are a
common feature of backbone network markets in developed countries in which there are several
companies that have built networks and provide services on a purely wholesale basis to other operators.
The potential opportunity for these types of operators is shown in Kenya, where KDN has developed
1,900 kilometers of fiber network infrastructure, and in Nigeria, where there are more than 20 licensed
fixed operators, including two national carriers and seven national long-distance operators developing
high-capacity backbone networks.

“Middle Mile” and Metropolitan Connectivity
The next level in the broadband supply chain consists of the links needed to connect smaller towns and
villages to the backbone network and provide links in and around metropolitan areas. These links are
often referred to as the “middle mile” because they exist between the backbone and the local access
networks, and often serve to connect rural areas to the backbone networks. As with backbone
networks, these links can be provided by a number of technologies, including satellite and microwave
networks, but fiber optic lines are increasingly being used because of their higher capacity. This part of
the broadband supply chain also includes so-called metropolitan area networks (MANs), which are often
established in and around major cities to link high-traffic business users and the links used to transport
traffic from wireless base stations to an aggregation point in the network, such as a mobile telephone
switching office or other network node (also known as “backhaul).
The middle mile can often be forgotten by policymakers, who may want to focus on backbone or last
mile projects. But building out just those two levels of the network will be ineffective since a bottleneck
will exist between the two that will either lead to slow speeds (too much capacity trying to fit onto too
small bandwidth) or high costs (lack of competition on middle mile routes), or both. Hence, policies to
address middle mile and backhaul problems, such as promotion of facilities-based competition or open
access requirements, are just as important as they are for other parts of the network.
Numerous governments have plans to provide broadband to rural areas through the stimulation of
middle mile, regional networks or links. For instance, the Norwegian government has a program to
subsidize the roll out of broadband infrastructures in areas with no existing infrastructure in place. The
goal of the government is to connect 99 percent of the population through fixed broadband coverage.85
Similarly, Sweden has a national program that provides funds to municipalities to deploy broadband
networks and connect these metropolitan networks with the national backbone network. Despite
having almost a third of the population living in rural areas and being a very low population-density
country, Sweden has achieved one of the highest broadband coverage rates in rural areas. More
importantly, such coverage is mostly based on fiber networks, providing similar high speeds as those
offered in urban areas (see Box 2.15).
Developing countries are beginning to focus on backhaul networks as a means to increase broadband
deployment. South Africa, for example, established a state-owned, fiber-based infrastructure provider,
Broadband Infraco, to provide national backhaul connections on a wholesale basis.86 In Brazil, the
government struck an agreement with five fixed-line operators to build out broadband backhaul

                                                     55

networks to 3,439 unserved municipalities in exchange for being relieved of obligations to install 8,000
dial-up facilities.87 Numerous other governments have plans to provide broadband to rural areas. For
instance, the Norwegian government has a program to subsidize the roll out of broadband
infrastructures in areas with no existing infrastructure in place. The goal is to connect 99 percent of the
population through fixed broadband coverage.88 Similarly, Sweden has a national program that provides
funds to municipalities to deploy broadband networks and connect these metropolitan networks with
the national backbone network. Despite having almost a third of the population living in rural areas and
being a very low population-density country, Sweden has achieved one of the highest broadband
coverage rates in rural areas (see Box 2.15).
Box 2.15. Targeting the rural access gap in Sweden without distorting the market
The Swedish government established as a goal in its national broadband strategy that all households and
businesses should have access to broadband infrastructure. Indeed, Sweden considers broadband as an
essential infrastructure for economic development. Although the government lets the private sector
take the initiative on the expansion of the market, it believes that the ultimate responsibility to ensure
access to broadband in all parts of the country rests with the State. The Swedish government
established a program to fund the deployment of broadband networks in those areas where private
investment was absent. The government regularly monitors broadband infrastructure and publishes
maps with current infrastructure deployments. The purpose of the Swedish fund is to stimulate
broadband infrastructure roll-out in rural areas, especially low populated areas, where private
investment is not present because of economies of scale or threshold market failures. The plan provides
funds for the different steps of the domestic supply chain where network infrastructure is needed:
domestic backbone, regional network, local network and access network.
The funds can be executed by local municipalities, which are allowed to build regional and local fiber
networks. However, in order to ensure that private investment is not crowded out, the Swedish
government established the following conditions:
       The funds must be used in areas with no private operators present;
       Municipalities must conduct a procurement process with open access to private investors in
        order to crowd in the private sector;
       The network must be open-access for its lifetime with de facto structural separation between
        the infrastructure provider and the service provider (i.e., any private investor can use the
        infrastructure to provide broadband services); and
       Fiber networks must be able to allow for high-capacity transmissions, including multimedia
        applications.
As a result of these measures, Sweden has achieved one of the lowest urban/rural gaps in the European
Union despite having one of the lowest population densities in the region. Indeed, as of 2008 only 1.6
percent of the population remained without broadband access. Moreover, the rural population has
access to similar speed levels as the urban population do thanks to the emphasis on high-bandwidth
infrastructure, such as fiber networks. Indeed, Sweden has the second highest penetration of FTTH of
the OECD countries.

From a policy perspective, the issues associated with promoting the development of the middle mile are
often similar to those involved with backbone development, namely promoting buildout in areas that
may not otherwise attract private sector investment or where competition is limited. Government

                                                     56
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


initiatives related to the middle mile often revolve around connecting rural areas that are unserved or
underserved and in which market forces have not been able to economically support broadband
network development. In today’s fiscal environment, where government spending is constrained and
private companies may be hesitant to make large investments, governments will have to balance the
need to promote increased network coverage with the reality that multiple, competing infrastructures
are not likely to be economically efficient in some areas. Other ways to drive availability—as a first
step—must be considered. Recognizing the importance of backhaul for mobile broadband in India, for
example, the Telecommunications Regulatory of India (TRAI) recommended to the Ministry of
Communications that license conditions should be amended in order to allow service providers to share
their backhaul links, noting that such sharing should be permitted using either wireless or fiber optic
links.89 TRAI maintained that, particularly where traffic is low in rural and remote areas, backhaul
sharing would boost coverage, reduce maintenance efforts, and lower costs. For a more detailed
discussion of infrastructure sharing, see Module 3.

Local Connectivity—the “Last Mile”
Broadband local access networks, sometimes known at the “last mile” or “local loop” refer to the links
between the network and the end user. This is the last link in the overall broadband supply chain, and is
the most common bottleneck in that chain. As a result, local access issues have been the subject of
much attention in recent years as countries have attempted to ensure that their citizens have access to
broadband networks—largely through trying to eliminate unserved and underserved broadband areas.
The issues in building out networks to end users largely mirror those at other points in the supply
chain—promoting greater competition and addressing market failure/monopoly issues—but there are
specific problems and challenges that policymakers and regulators must address as they attempt to
promote greater broadband development at the local level.
In addition, although there are some common elements, the challenges and solutions to local access
issues are slightly different in a wireline as opposed to a wireless context. This is due to the economics
of the technologies involved, their different technological bases as well as the different regulatory
regimes they have traditionally operated under. The following sections discuss the policy issues
associated with wireline and wireless access networks in detail.
Wireline Access Technologies. A number of wireline and wireless broadband technologies are used
today to support local access networks, including cable television, fiber, xDSL, wireless and/or satellite
links (see Module 5 for a complete description of these technologies). DSL is the dominant means of
broadband provision today, but cable broadband providers hold significant market share in some
countries and FTTP is now being rolled out in many countries. In addition, certain other options are
being used for wireline broadband access such as Ethernet-based Local Area Networks (LAN) and
Broadband over Powerline (BPL).
Although the availability of many different broadband access options increases consumer choice,
stimulates inter-modal competition, enhances quality and innovation and is generally associated with
lower retail prices; most areas will not be able to use all these options for historical, technical, economic,
regulatory or financial reasons. As governments seek ways to promote broadband development, they
will need to recognize the strengths and limitations that their existing level of infrastructure
development and market situation provides—both for its upgrade possibilities as well as in developing
appropriate incentive and/or competition policies. Policymakers seeking to promote the development of
and enhance competition in the last mile face a series of challenges. First, local access networks in most
countries were built by (former) monopoly incumbent providers, which were often state-owned.
Market liberalization has taken place in many countries—which at least gives alternative providers the


                                                     57
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


legal right to exist—but such efforts have been limited in their effectiveness in many cases because the
historically dominant providers often exercise their incumbent power to stifle competition. This can
take the form of drawn-out challenges to legal and regulatory frameworks as well as anti-competitive
conduct designed to hobble new entrants’ ability to compete. Another significant problem for
policymakers is that the local loop is the most costly and difficult part of the network to replicate by
alternative operators. Civil works represent even a higher share of costs (from 50 percent to 80 percent)
in the local part of the network than in backbone or middle mile applications. Wiring customer premises,
especially at apartment buildings, is also a relevant cost for local network deployment.90 Together these
issues create a market condition where the legal/regulatory situation may not be a “level playing field,”
where investment costs are high and returns on investment not clear. Policymakers and regulators must
tackle each of these issues if they wish to promote sustainable broadband development.
Governments have adopted varying approaches to promoting competition in the local loop based on
their own unique markets. As a result, the degree and extent of ex ante regulation of the access
network, particularly on the wireline side, has varied significantly, ranging from a light-handed,
deregulatory approach towards more extensive restrictions and obligations.91 Many countries,
particularly in Europe for example, in an effort to prevent the large incumbent providers from leveraging
their market power, have adopted ex ante regulations focused on preventing high prices and low quality
of service. Such regulations may also include rules relating to “open access;” sharing of passive
infrastructure or more intensive obligations requiring the sharing of active network elements, including
sharing access node switches or unbundling the local loop.92 A wide range of both developed and
developing countries have implemented such approaches, including Denmark, France, Japan, Korea
(Rep.), the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, South Africa and the United Kingdom.93
Further, although such open access requirements began with legacy wireline networks (i.e., the old
PSTN), they are now also being applied to fiber broadband networks in some countries. France, for
example, has set up extensive regulations governing how fiber should be deployed in the country;
defining different approaches for urban and non-urban areas.94 Other countries, however, are taking a
different approach. Germany, for example, is pursuing a more ex post approach to last mile fiber
regulation. The Federal Network Agency decided in January 2011 that in the future, only ex post controls
would be imposed for new fiber loops from Telekom Deutschland GmbH.95
One of the main policies being used to promote retail competition in wireline networks is Local Loop
Unbundling (LLU), as detailed in Module 3. Regulators may use LLU where facilities-based competition is
limited or to induce price competition between facilities-based and services-based competitors. While
LLU enables faster market entry by new competitors since they do not have to build out their own
infrastructure, LLU can also discourage new infrastructure investment by the incumbent operator.
Many countries have required the incumbent wireline operators (which are often the former monopoly
providers) to provide wholesale access to its exchanges and the local loop network to enable existing
competitors and new market entrants to resell these services to end users without having to build their
own networks. LLU obligations generally involve full unbundling (incumbent must offer wholesale
access to the entire copper local loop); line sharing (incumbent provides voice telephony over the
copper local loop while competitors provide DSL over the same line); and/or bitstream access
(incumbent sells DSL on a wholesale basis to competitors).
Most European and some OECD Asian economies now have laws on LLU, with New Zealand and
Switzerland both having put policies in place since 2008. Other countries, like the United States, have
considered, but not mandated LLU or have not yet developed a policy, like Mexico.
Where implemented, LLU obligations have proven quite effective at increasing competition and
reducing prices, especially in countries where inter-platform competition (i.e., existing competing

                                                   58
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


networks, such as cable) was not present or had limited coverage. Even in countries with existing
competitive networks, LLU obligations have reduced prices and increased competition. On the other
hand, countries where LLU obligations have not been implemented tend to have higher prices than
those that have imposed such obligations. For instance, according to the OECD, the average price per
Mbit/s in the United States is more than twice as high as in Japan, as of September 2011.96 The price of
Mbit/s in Switzerland in 2006, before it established LLU obligations, was 19 times more expensive than
in Japan and 5 times more expensive than in France.97 The combination of LLU obligations with other
access obligations has also proven successful in increasing inter-platform competition through the
ladder of investment (see Box 2.16).
Box 2.16. Increasing competition through unbundling of the local loop and the ladder of investment
LLU obligations are intended to facilitate competition among service providers. They are especially
relevant where no infrastructure-based competition (e.g., competitive cable networks) exists because
the local loop acts as a bottleneck for the development of competition. In the European Union, LLU is
seen as part of what is called the “investment ladder”.98
The investment ladder allows for the introduction of competition in the broadband market through a set
of obligations imposed on the incumbent’s network. Each of the obligations in this set is designed to be
a “rung” of the investment ladder; imposing a higher level of investment for the alternative operator. As
the operator increases its market share and generates economies of scale, it climbs the rungs of the
ladder, extending its infrastructure and investment commitment. Ideally, the alternative operator
“climbs up the ladder” and ultimately deploys an end-to-end network that allows for infrastructure-
based competition in the market.
France
France has seen the effectiveness of the investment ladder approach. There was no competition to the
wireline networks because there was little cable coverage (around 25 percent of population); therefore,
LLU obligations were crucial to introducing competition in the broadband market.99 France established
the three rungs of the ladder of investment, allowing alternative operators to use the incumbent
operator’s network to gain market share. This resulted in a substantial increase in broadband
competition, despite the lack of infrastructure-based competition. About half of broadband connections
in France were achieved through the use of these obligations by alternative operators (Figure 2.15).
Figure 2.15. Ladder of investment in wireline networks in France




As the operators gained market share, they climbed the rungs of the ladder of investment, from resale
to bitstream, and later, from bitstream to share unbundling and full unbundling. The last step was the
deployment of end-to-end networks. As of today alternative operators, such as Iliad, are FTTH
deployment in France; forcing the incumbent operator, France Telecom, to roll out its own FTTH
network.100 This does not mean, however, that alternative operators will always deploy a full end-to-end


                                                   59

network with national coverage. Usually, they climb the investment ladder regionally, and there are
areas, such as rural areas, where low demand or profitability requires them to stay in the bitstream
rung.
The Netherlands
LLU has even been successful in countries with effective inter-platform competition. For example, the
Netherlands had extensive cable infrastructure in place when broadband surged, with cable operators
leading the broadband market early on—in 2002, there were nearly one million cable lines, representing
about 80 percent of the market. However, the national incumbent telecommunications operator, which
could benefit from economies of scale, began leading the wireline broadband race. The introduction of
LLU obligations allowed other DSL operators to enter the market and increase competitive conditions.
By 2005, even though cable operators had reduced their market share to 40 percent, alternative
operators using LLU had almost 16 percent of the market, containing the incumbent’s operator growth
in market share.101 Indeed, a study conducted by the Dutch regulator OPTA concluded that if the Dutch
market had only two infrastructure operators, it was unlikely that competition would be as effective as it
had been so far.102
The combination of multi-platform competition of cable and DSL networks and intra-platform
competition through LLU obligations has been very effective in reducing prices and increasing
broadband penetration. By 2007, the Netherlands had one of the lowest prices of the OECD and its
penetration was one of the highest in the world.103

Wireless Access Technologies. Wireless technologies have become the primary local access solution for
many developing countries (see Module 1). Because the deployment of wireline access solutions has
historically been quite slow in many countries, particularly in rural areas, mobile voice networks—largely
funded by private investment—have been deployed to offer services to developing country users that
had no access before. And now, because of advances in technology, this model appears set to be
repeated in the broadband market.
Technological innovations offer the near-term opportunity for widespread broadband wireless access to
the Internet. As discussed in detail in Module 5, with the introduction of 3G and 4G technologies,
wireless networks are expected to compete directly against, and be substitutes for, wireline broadband
within the next decade. In Austria, in fact, the regulator (RTR) determined in 2009 that DSL, cable
modem, and mobile broadband connections for residential consumers are substitutes at the retail
level.104 A 3G technology called Long Term Evolution (LTE) is now being deployed around the world in
several frequency bands. The first deployment was by TeliaSonera when it simultaneously launched
networks in Stockholm, Sweden, and Oslo, Norway, at the end of 2009 using the 2.6 GHz frequency
band. Verizon’s LTE network launch in the United States in December 2010 is noteworthy for using the
700 MHz frequency band. Going forward, the next generation of wireless access technologies (so-called
4G) promises even greater speed and broadband capability. The ITU has been working on standards for
the next generation of wireless systems for a number of years. One of the most significant requirements
is peak data rates of 100 Mbit/s for high mobility and 1 Gbit/s for low mobility. In January 2012, the ITU
announced that two technologies met the requirements for IMT-Advanced: LTE-Advanced and WiMAX-
Advanced. Deployment of these technologies is expected over the next several years.
To their credit, policymakers and regulators around the world have embraced the potential for wireless
to contribute to larger economic (growth) and social (universal access) goals through its ability to serve
unserved areas and provide competition in the local access market. They have made spectrum

available, authorized multiple licenses and generally provided the regulatory and investment conditions
in which wireless was able to thrive.
In fact, many countries have already identified wireless as an integral part of their national broadband
initiatives (see Practice Note 2.5).

As governments seek to promote broadband in the local access market, however, a number of
challenges specific to wireless will need to be confronted, including lack of adequate spectrum resources
to support broadband networks and inflexible regulatory regimes that limit service providers’ ability to
offer new services or that restrain market forces. To increase the coverage of wireless broadband
networks, governments have pursued numerous policies, the most important of which are: providing
additional spectrum for wireless broadband networks, allowing a flexible use of the spectrum, and
introducing spectrum trading. Some governments have also established obligations on wireless
providers as part of the licensing process in order to speed deployment and ensure coverage of rural
areas. The following sections explore some of the challenges governments face as they seek to promote
wireless broadband and identify potential solutions that can speed wireless broadband development.
Allocate Additional Spectrum. As policymakers and regulators consider ways to promote wireless
broadband, it will be important for spectrum policies to consider the expected increases in data traffic
that wireless services will generate, both as a result of increasing numbers of subscribers and the use of
more data-intensive services and applications.105 With subscribers using wireless networks for more of
their broadband needs, throughput requirements will increase significantly in the “last mile” wireless
link (and also for backhaul and backbone connectivity). To support this expected increase in demand,
more spectrum will likely be needed, especially in urban areas. To address this need, regulators are
implementing policies that promote the most efficient and effective use of spectrum resources,
including allocating unused spectrum for broadband use and freeing up underutilized spectrum bands. .
Internationally, multiple bands have been allocated by the ITU for fixed and mobile use that could be
used to provide broadband services. These international allocations are designed to promote
harmonization to the greatest extent possible and encourage manufacturers to build equipment for
these bands in order to promote economies of scale and scope. Governments looking to add spectrum
for broadband uses can consult with the ITU and its Table of Frequency Allocations to help them identify
those bands that might be most suitable in their countries.

Spectrum use varies from country to country, and so, the process of finding spectrum for broadband use
will differ accordingly. In many developed countries, for example, the spectrum is often very intensively
used. This makes finding spectrum for broadband uses particularly difficult, as oftentimes existing users
must be moved out to clear the way for new uses (sometimes known as “refarming”). In many
developing countries, by contrast, the spectrum may be less intensively used, making it easier to find
available spectrum that can be repurposed for wireless broadband use.
Most OECD countries have awarded spectrum for 3G and 4G services or are preparing to award it. In
European countries, 3G bands were awarded in the early 2000s. Other countries, such as the United
States, Canada, and numerous countries in Latin America did not auction 3G spectrum until much later,
but permitted operators to use 2G spectrum for 3G services. Countries are also moving towards
providing 4G spectrum, which allows higher broadband potential than 3G does. Following the transition
to digital television, countries are looking at 700 MHz and 800 MHz as a potential band for 4G
technologies. In addition, most countries have also awarded broadband wireless access (BWA) spectrum
to provide WiMAX-type technologies, including Korea, France, Germany and Sweden.106
So, the first step in finding additional spectrum for wireless broadband use is to take stock of the
existing spectrum situation in the country. This may be as simple as inventorying existing spectrum
bands and identifying unused spectrum, or it may entail a much more difficult analysis of inventorying
spectrum, determining how intensively various bands are being used, and making
political/social/economic value judgments as to what spectrum could be most easily or effectively
transferred to wireless broadband use. Such processes are often the subject of a public consultation,
subject to any national security or defense interests, if government-used spectrum is involved.
For many countries that have or are developing national broadband plans, a spectrum inventory process
is often an important part in the overall plan. In the United States, for example, the executive branch
made it a priority to find additional spectrum for broadband.107 As part of its national broadband plan,
the FCC subsequently recommended identifying 500 MHz to be made available for advanced broadband
uses.108 Other parts of the U.S. government, meanwhile, have begun a process to identify what
spectrum might be transitioned to broadband use.109

                                                    62
                      Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Of course, all of this takes time. From start to finish, the process will last many months at the fastest, but
more realistically may take several years depending on how intensively a country’s spectrum is used,
how many incumbent users might be displaced and the length of any public consultations or
proceedings that are required. In addition, these efforts are often characterized by intense political
pressure on regulators and policymakers from all sides—those not wishing to move or who want to be
compensated, and those anxious to have access to the spectrum as soon as possible in order to build
new networks or serve existing customers better. When government agencies are the current spectrum
holders, this process can be even more politically-charged and challenging. Therefore, given the rapid
diffusion of data-enabled mobile devices, the increasingly bandwidth-hungry nature of the services and
applications being developed, and the rapid uptake of such devices and services by users across all
socio-economic groups, the process of identifying and transitioning spectrum for broadband use should
be started as soon as possible.
An important consideration for spectrum policy is which frequencies should be allocated for broadband
services and how. The critical choice is whether countries want to maximize their upfront earnings
through spectrum sales but reduce potential investments, or if they want to shift maximum financial
resources to investments that will expand the market and hence long-term revenues. In Japan, for
example, the incumbent and market entrants did not pay for spectrum when securing licenses to
provide wireless services—allowing the companies to maximize infrastructure investments.
The move toward digital television is providing an opportunity to use the parts of the spectrum freed by
this move for wireless broadband services. Digital television services are far more spectrally efficient
than analog television systems, so the digital switchover frees up spectrum in those bands. This
spectrum—the so-called digital dividend—could be used for a range of services, but broadband has
been gaining wide support. The United States and Germany concluded the process to award digital
dividend spectrum in the 700 and 800 MHz band in 2010.110 The United States saw initial deployments of
wireless broadband services in this spectrum at the end of 2010.111 Sweden completed its 800 MHz
auction of the digital dividend in March 2011 with three winners bidding a total of SEK 2.054 billion (USD
325 million).112 France held its combined 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz auction in December 2011, raising a total
of EUR 2.64 billion (USD 3.45 billion).113 Other European countries are planning to award digital dividend
spectrum within the next year, including Switzerland and the United Kingdom.114
Once spectrum is allocated, there are additional policy and regulatory considerations to consider. In
general, these relate to overall spectrum policy and extend to specific requirements that may be placed
on the terms and conditions of a license. For example, to encourage competition, some government
impose spectrum “caps” on the total amount of spectrum an individual operator can have or the
amount of spectrum that an operator may have in particular bands or the amount of spectrum it can
acquire in a particular auction. These spectrum caps are designed to prevent the hoarding of spectrum
by incumbent operators with greater resources and to promote competition by bringing new entrants
into the market. These types of spectrum caps are not typically static and as services developed, and
the needs associated with wireless broadband increase, such caps may be relaxed or lifted in order to
allow existing carriers ability to obtain additional spectrum to provide advanced services. In Brazil, for
example, the government relaxed its spectrum cap rules when it assigned 3G spectrum.115 In addition, it
also set a band specific cap for 4G bands, specifically the 2.5 GHz band and the 3.5 GHz, recently.116
Flexible Allocations. A second major tool for promoting wireless broadband development is for
governments to allow flexible use of spectrum. Depending on individual circumstance and timing,
flexibility may be applied to both current and future commercial assignments, with the objective of
facilitating technological evolution and promoting the development of advanced services. Flexibility in
this context is often called technology and/or service neutrality.

Around the world, spectrum management is moving away from traditional administration, which
involved allocating spectrum to specific uses, toward more flexible, open spectrum management
regimes. To optimize the performance of markets and establish a level playing field for all operators,
spectrum management needs to increase the role of market forces in allocating spectrum among uses,
assigning it to users, and pricing its use. That may involve a number of arrangements. Some economies
use auctions as a market mechanism to assign spectrum (e.g., Germany, Hong Kong, China, Singapore,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. At the same time, countries such as Australia and New
Zealand are developing markets for tradable spectrum rights. Several countries are also opening parts of
the spectrum to unlicensed use, an approach that has encouraged the growth of Wi-Fi networking
worldwide. Furthermore, countries are allowing more flexibility in the use of the spectrum. In Europe,
countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Portugal eliminated technology restrictions for 2G
spectrum.117 Countries such as Australia, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom allow
secondary markets and plan to move forward towards spectrum trading.118
Earlier spectrum allocation defined one set of frequencies for one service (i.e., voice, data [including
broadband], or broadcasting). Traditional classifications allowed regulators to levy different fees, use
different assignment mechanisms, and impose different conditions on different types of spectrum
licenses. For example, most countries have assigned broadcasting spectrum for free through
administrative licensing, and since the 1990s have assigned telecommunications spectrum through
market mechanisms. The terms and conditions associated with a specific service are often embedded in
a service provider’s license.
Now, however, new technologies enable multiple services to be provided over one network, or allow
multiple services to be provided using the same spectrum. As a result, the old, very narrowly defined
allocations of spectrum to specific uses is rapidly fading away; being replaced with more generic and
flexible allocations that allow providers to best match their network and services to market demand.119
Wireless broadband extends this concept by expanding potential uses of spectrum—and changing the
value of the resource and challenging assumptions about allocating spectrum for specific uses. If there
is no longer any difference between these types of spectrum, the old regulatory asymmetries that
defined very narrow services cannot stand.120 Instead, spectrum assignments will need to be—and are
increasingly becoming—flexible.
What does this mean for policymakers and regulators? Governments around the world adhere to
general guidelines set out in the radio spectrum management frameworks such as those of the ITU.
These guidelines provide member countries with some flexibility in allocating spectrum bands for one or
more uses. Now, with broadband possible over wireless networks, it might be necessary for a review of
these guidelines to align them with emerging technological and market developments. Such a review
will ensure the continued benefits of global spectrum coordination and harmonization, while allowing
greater flexibility and more efficient utilization.
Technology neutrality. The move towards more flexible spectrum allocations reflects, and is derived
from, advanced technologies that break down the historical barriers between telecommunications
services. As policymakers and regulators consider how best to harness and exploit these new
technologies to promote broadband growth, it will be very important not to overly constrain what the
technology can do and operators can offer. Governments should seek to provide wireless operators as
much flexibility as possible to meet the demands of the market.
The first element in ensuring a flexible environment is to promote technology neutrality. Even as some
countries have moved toward technology-neutral spectrum management, others continue to define
which technologies service providers should use in a given band. In India, cellular networks must use
either the global system for mobile (GSM) or the code division multiple access (CDMA) standard. Now,

                                                  64
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


with advanced wireless systems such as 3G networks and broadband wireless, countries are defining
specific broadband wireless or 3G technologies for use in specific bands, such as the 2.5 GHz band,
where both of these technology families lay claim. However, the EU, by contrast, is making its spectrum
more flexible. In 2009, it issued a Directive relaxing the requirement to use only GSM technology in the
900 MHz band.121 It will now be up to the individual EU governments to implement the directive.
France, for example, has issued guidelines to its overseas markets on a framework to allow the use of
UMTS not only in the 900 MHz band, but also in the 1.8 and 2.1 GHz bands.122 Now, advanced
technologies can be deployed based on user demand and operator choice. This should make it much
easier for operators to upgrade to new services as technology advances.
Changes in technology are also important to consider when allocating new spectrum or considering how
to promote greater flexibility in existing spectrum. One of the starkest examples relates to
developments in 3G technology. Because 3G cellular systems appeared some years after second-
generation (2G) systems, many countries gave them new bands in which to operate. The most common
was the 2.1 GHz, and more recently the 2.5-2.6 GHz band. Many service providers spent a great deal of
money to acquire this spectrum. But 3G technologies are now available for commercial deployment in
the bands used by 2G systems. This development is creating debates about fairness in these countries.
Service providers that paid large sums to acquire spectrum in the 2.1 GHz band for 3G services now have
to devalue their spectrum holdings and face higher capital costs because lower 2G frequencies have
better propagation characteristics. For instance, one Australian 2G operator estimates that it would
reduce its capital costs by 40 percent by using the lower frequencies.123
The change in the valuation of 2.1 GHz spectrum is an important example of changes in the market and
technology and their implications. The ITU’s 1992 World Radiocommunication Conference defined the
2.1 GHz band for 3G services. Eight years later, at the conference in 2000, the 800, 900, and 1,800 MHz
bands were defined for 3G services, and by 2006 manufacturers were beginning to develop wideband
code division multiple access (WCDMA) and code division multiple access, evolution, data-optimized
(CDMA EV-DO) technology in these bands. Similarly, the 2.5 GHz band was originally marked for
technologies including 3G and beyond. But the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference added
WiMAX to the list of 3G international mobile telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) technologies, thus
allowing regulators to attempt to avoid tying spectrum bands to specific technologies. In fact, the ITU
has dropped the term “IMT-2000” now in favor of the broader term “IMT,” which is now used in all ITU
Recommendations.
Regulatory symmetry requires that spectrum assignments be technology-neutral to promote investment
and growth. Otherwise, countries might lose investments and lag behind in growth simply because of
their spectrum regimes. For example, 3G services have yet to take off in China, partly because the
country delayed spectrum assignment until its indigenous time division synchronous code division
multiple access (TD-SDCMA) standard was finalized and ready for deployment.
Service neutrality. In contrast to technology flexibility, which addresses only what technology an
operator can use, service flexibility refers to exactly what services an operator may provide. In the past,
as noted above, operators were limited to providing only the services that specifically defined in their
license (e.g., voice or video, but not both). But with the transition to digital technology and better
processing capabilities, advanced systems are now capable of transmitting all kinds of services. Thus,
wireless operators can now provide voice, high-speed data services and video over their networks.
Service and licensing terms now must be modified to allow the operators to realize the benefits of this
flexibility.
Spectrum management is moving towards more open, flexible models. The ideal situation for spectrum
management would likely be one where regulators do not specify which services are offered over a

                                                    65
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


specific band of spectrum or which technology is used to offer them. Instead, regulators focus on
promoting competition and ensuring that spectrum users are following certain guidelines—such as
noninterference in each others’ operations. Flexible-use rules are becoming increasingly common,
particularly in the context of discussions about the digital dividend. Many countries are pursuing service-
neutral spectrum allocations.124 For example, the U.S. FCC allows service providers to use the 700 MHz
spectrum for:
        [F]lexible fixed, mobile, and broadcast uses, including fixed and mobile wireless commercial
        services (including FDD- and TDD-based services); fixed and mobile wireless uses for private,
        internal radio needs; and mobile and other digital new broadcast operations. These uses may
                                                                                            125
        include two-way interactive, cellular, and mobile television broadcasting services.
In the United Kingdom, Ofcom’s 2007 statement on the digital dividend outlined how the agency
decided that it would give “users the freedom to decide how spectrum is used and clear incentives to
use it efficiently.” 126 It envisions the uses of this spectrum to be wireless broadband, mobile television,
digital terrestrial television, and local television, but does not limit its applications. Ofcom expects that
this approach will enable the introduction of innovative technologies and services, increase competition,
and provide “a significant contribution to the United Kingdom, as the overall benefit from the use of the
digital dividend is estimated to be GBP 5 billion to GBP 10 billion (USD 9.8 to USD 19.6 billion equivalent)
of added benefit to the economy over 20 years.”127
For the ultimate in flexibility, some regulators are actively organizing the spectrum as a “commons,”
expanding on the idea and success of unlicensed spectrum. Supporters argue that a commons regime
creates incentives to innovate and develop spectrally efficient technologies such as smart radios, which
automatically detect and use vacant spectrum. Further, these efficient technologies reduce spectrum
scarcity by creating more efficient systems such as mesh networks. Commons regimes do not place
restrictions on the network bandwidth assigned to specific networks— allowing networks based on new
ultra-wideband technologies, for instance, to provide high-speed connections not otherwise possible.
Indeed, a similar mechanism has already worked in many countries with unlicensed bands in the 2.4 GHz
and 5 GHz spectrums. Aside from simple rules limiting the maximum transmitter power or defining the
rights and responsibilities of spectrum users in terms of interference, there are no technology or service
limitations.128 This open band has been credited with spawning Wi-Fi technology. Wi-Fi was among the
earliest wireless technologies supporting wireless triple play. Similar outcomes are possible in an open
and flexible environment for spectrum use.
Moving to these more flexible spectrum use regimes will enable broadband by supporting the
development of new technologies, the entry of smaller or new service providers, and more efficient
spectrum use. Efforts to link revisions to the spectrum management regime thus can be linked to moves
toward a converged regulatory regime.
Greater Use of Market Mechanisms Can Promote Broadband. Markets can usually act faster than
governments to match supply and demand for spectrum services. As a result, governments are
increasingly seeking to rely more on market forces to help them meet wireless (broadband) needs. The
move to market mechanisms is evidenced by two important trends: assigning spectrum to operators
using a competitive process and charging market-based prices for acquiring or using spectrum. Having a
competitive, transparent means of assignment also gives service providers greater access to spectrum.
In conjunction with a regime that allows flexible use of spectrum, such competitive assignment enables
new models of service provision.
Spectrum trading is another important development. Implemented in countries such as Australia and
New Zealand, this approach allows later entrants to a market to purchase spectrum use rights from

                                                     66
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


existing licensees, thereby reducing constraints on the timing of their market entry. In the absence of
secondary market mechanisms through spectrum trading, new service providers would have to wait for
government-administrated assignment, which may slow the rollout of new services and reduce the
potential for competitive service provision.
Despite the important advantages of moving toward more flexible arrangements for spectrum
assignment and a greater role for market forces, there are also risks that in a poorly regulated
environment, some firms could establish or reinforce market power by controlling key high-value
spectrum bands. Thus, it is critical to ensure that the outcome of moving toward market mechanisms is
an increase in market competition, supporting the introduction of new services and providers. Moving
toward market-based assignment, pricing, and use will allow new service providers to access spectrum
competitively, allowing them to provide innovative services over wireless networks.129
Coverage Obligations. Another way in which governments can promote wireless broadband availability
throughout a country is to establish coverage obligations at the time of initial licensing. In fact, most
licenses include specific coverage obligations in their terms and conditions. Denmark, for example, has
established coverage requirements for the 800 MHz band digital dividend licenses to be auctioned in
May 2012.130 The coverage obligation in Denmark is pursuant to the government’s objective of ensuring
universal access to a broadband connection of at least 100Mbps by 2020. As such, the coverage
obligation on 800MHz licenses carry will be aimed at providing mobile broadband to areas where
broadband is not currently available. In such areas, licensees will be required to cover 99.8 percent of
households and enterprises and provide 98 percent outdoor coverage (excluding forests) with a mobile
broadband service of at least 10Mbps by the end of 2014. The coverage obligation can be met by using
frequencies governed by the license or other frequencies available to the licensee.
License requirements tied to coverage obligations, however, must be carefully considered.
Requirements that are too easy to meet run the risk of not significantly expanding broadband coverage.
Conversely, overly strict requirements are unlikely to be met, and could result in either no interest in a
license (meaning nothing would get built) or lower payments if the license is awarded through an
auction.


2.5 Encouraging Adoption: Promoting Demand for Broadband
As discussed in Module 1, the broadband ecosystem involves more than just the physical networks; it
also includes applications, services, and users. Policymakers have thus begun to realize that simply
focusing on building networks may be necessary to promote broadband development, but it is not
sufficient. As a result, demand stimulation is becoming an important part of broadband development
strategies and policies across the world. Addressing demand-side issues is important because
constructing networks and providing services entails significant costs and risks for investors, particularly
if they are unsure if there is an audience for their products. To help reduce such risks, government may
need to assist broadband development by raising public awareness of and stimulating demand for these
services.
In general terms, demand for broadband services, applications and content is thriving and may not
appear to need a large amount of government effort to spur adoption by those who have broadband
access. Broadband use is clearly growing quickly and is heavily driven by private sector content and, to a
lesser but important extent, user-generated content. In 2010, for example, 40 percent of all consumer
Internet traffic was video131 which was 1.6 times the video traffic of the previous year and mostly
comprised of private sector-created or user-generated video.132 In addition, with the first availability of
broadband services, demand (measured by subscriber growth, for example) may be initially very high—

                                                    67
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


reflecting pent-up demand among users who previously had no broadband access. In such cases,
governments may decide that there is no need for demand stimulation. In Kenya, for example, at the
end of September 2010, broadband subscriptions increased to 84,726 subscribers from 18,626 in the
previous quarter (a growth rate of over 450 percent) without any specific attempts by the government
at demand-side stimulation.133 Nevertheless, in most high-penetration countries, governments have
sought to complement supply-side policies that focus on building infrastructure with demand-side
efforts that seek to drive demand for broadband access and services.
Policies to promote demand will need to be tied to the development of the broadband market. In the
early stages of broadband market development, policies may need to focus on educating population at
large of the benefits of broadband and educating them in how to use it (digital literacy). As time passes,
however, demand growth can be expected to slow as the potential pool of users evolves from motivated
early adopters to potential users that do not necessarily understand all that broadband has to offer and
may be concerned with the potential threats to privacy and data security. This is when government
policies to stimulate demand may have the most beneficial impact by targeting potential users, such as
elderly persons and those in disadvantaged groups, who may not be able to afford or are not aware of
the benefits offered by broadband.134. By educating users through digital literacy programs,
governments can help drive adoption to a broader user base and educate them at the same time. Such
programs may become increasingly important in order to avoid the social and economic inequities
associated with broadband “haves” and “have nots.”
The role of government in stimulating demand will vary by country. In some countries, with more
technically literate populations, there may be less need for direct government intervention. The appeal
of social networking and video streaming as an entertainment source may be more self evident than
more mundane uses such as e-government or multimedia mail. In such cases, demand will be driven by
attractive offerings made available by private sector developers. In other cases, however, basic
illiteracy, lack of understanding of what the Internet can do, or cost may require governments to step in
to help fill out and aggregate demand particularly among at-risk groups. Policies to support digital
inclusion will be an important leveler to ensure that broadband can bring benefits to all segments of the
population.

2.5.1 A Model of Demand Facilitation
Demand facilitation or stimulation refers to efforts to boost the adoption and use of broadband
networks and services. Such efforts typically address three broad categories of issues: awareness,
affordability, and attractiveness (see Figure 2.17). In order to drive broadband adoption and use,
policies must address these three categories, especially targeting those populations that are generally
less likely to adopt and use broadband Internet services. Mechanisms to address awareness include
improving digital literacy, and encouraging the use of broadband in education and small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), while affordability efforts focus on costs of both hardware and services, and
attractiveness initiatives include promotion of services, applications and local content as well as delivery
of government services over the Internet (e-government). E-literacy and e-skills, in particular, are vital
for broadband diffusion to succeed. Recognizing this, governments with high penetration and adoption
have been very active in trying to raise e-literacy.

Bank (June 2010).

Demand facilitation strategies can be included in top-down national plans, can originate from grass-
roots efforts or can involve the public and private sectors, as well as civil society.135 The scope of such
strategies may be targeted at one particular obstacle to access, such as the high cost of connections or
computer ownership, or may be broader, resulting in more comprehensive programs that attempt to
address multiple barriers.136 The Dominican Republic, for example, established legislation to address not
only the financing mechanisms needed to achieve broadband, but also the deployment of infrastructure
and the acquisition and installation of terminal equipment such as computers, smartphones and other
devices that enable consumers to use a broadband connection.137 Demand facilitation may also involve
packaging broadband with applications that appeal to specific sectors of the economy or groups within
society.    These three main categories—or pillars—of facilitating broadband adoption are discussed
below.

2.5.2 Awareness
Awareness of the benefits of broadband is an important first step in building demand for broadband
services. Despite relatively rapid deployment and uptake among some segments of the population,
broadband is still unknown or not fully understood by many potential users, particularly in developing
countries and particularly among specific populations in both developed and developing countries.
Quite often, those lacking basic awareness of broadband tend to be those living in remote areas and/or
members of a historically disadvantaged group, such as the elderly, women, people lacking formal
education, people with disabilities, and the unemployed. These groups need to be included in plans to
enhance digital literacy in order to allow them to benefit from broadband and broader ICT services and
applications. Some of the reasons why people do not use broadband are discussed in section 2.2.3 of
this module.
As policymakers seek to extend the use of broadband to more users, they will need to consider the full
range of barriers to adoption and use and develop appropriate policies to address them. Given the
diversity of issues and the different needs of the different populations, it is likely that a range of

                                                      69
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


programs and initiatives will need to be developed. This is particularly critical given that as the average
level of broadband penetration in a country grows, the social and economic costs of being excluded
from access also increase.
In order for people to successfully use broadband, they must have the necessary interest and
competency. This is sometimes referred to as digital literacy, which has been defined as “using digital
technology, communications tools, and/or networks to access, manage, integrate, evaluate, and create
information in order to function in a knowledge society.”138 Digital literacy ideally makes users aware of
and capable of accessing broadband applications and services. This, in turn, widens the information
available to them, provides new ways of learning and creates new employment opportunities.
There are several challenges to improving digital literacy. First, some studies suggest that most people
learn about ICTs informally through their own initiatives and assistance from friends, family and
colleagues, rather than through formal education or training. As a result, motivating people to continue
to learn on their own is essential in order for them to adapt to the constant evolution in broadband
services and applications without having to always resort to more formal (and expensive) training.
Second, although training is important, it does not necessarily build peoples’ understanding of how
broadband and associated technologies can transform their lives. This risks the creation of a “value
divide” in terms of the people who have broadband, but who widely diverge in their ability to derive
value from it. Programs must find ways to show people how broadband can be integrated into, and
improve, their personal and business lives. Finally, as broadband spreads to other platforms,
particularly mobile phones in developing countries, the notion of digital literacy, which has typically
been associated with learning on PCs, must be adapted to entail familiarity with using applications and
services delivered via various mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. As further detailed in
Module 6, there are several elements to consider when adopting formal training initiatives:
       Basic Digital Literacy: Basic digital literacy skills may be taught as part of general educational
        programs. The extent of such need varies depending on the level of sophistication of the ICT
        sector and overall educational background of a country’s inhabitants, but may encompass basic
        literacy (the ability to read and write); computer literacy (knowledge of how to use a computer
        keyboard and mouse); and online literacy (ability to use online resources and services). Basic
        (and some advanced) skills are increasingly offered to students as part of their regular education
        curriculum, while adults or other potential user groups can obtain skills through community
        learning centers or similar institutions. In addition, basic skills development may be needed by
        those who have been bypassed in the acquisition of ICT skills through formal primary and
        secondary education—either because they did not complete schooling or because ICT training
        was not available. See Module 6 for further details on promoting digital literacy through the
        education system, community access centers to enhance digital literacy and advanced training
        for broadband development.
       Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): One particular group that governments may wish to
        focus on for purposes of demand stimulation is SMEs. Such companies may not have ICT
        expertise or knowledge of how broadband can benefit their business functions. An Internet
        presence supported by broadband can help SMEs by providing them with the ability to reach
        new customers, interact with a wider range of potential partners, and tap a wide range of
        resources to support their business. Concentrating on SMEs may also have important “pass
        through” effects, allowing governments to reach their employees at the same time. SMEs are
        also likely to find e-government programs particularly helpful in interacting more efficiently with
        the government, whether to apply for permits, file taxes or supply/obtain government services.
        To help SMEs use broadband networks and services most effectively, governments have

                                                    70
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


        adopted a variety of innovative outreach programs. See Module 6 for details on how countries
        have included SMEs in demand-side policies.
       Privacy and Security: As policymakers and private sector service providers consider ways to
        increase broadband use and promote online participation in personal, professional and
        governmental activities, privacy and security concerns will have to be addressed. Many
        potential users may be afraid of using broadband services for reasons related to privacy, security
        or identity theft. While consumer privacy and data protection is not a novel subject, broadband
        diffusion and technology innovation compound the potential risks of the collection, use,
        protection, retention, and disposal of a wide range of personal information. Increased data
        processing and storage capabilities, advances in online profiling, and the aggregation of online
        and offline information are allowing a diverse set of entities to gather, maintain and share a
        wide array of consumer information and data.
To address such issues, countries will likely need to revise their existing laws and regulations regarding
privacy and data protection to ensure that they are relevant and applicable in the broadband context.
This will require frameworks that strike the appropriate balance between the benefits to citizens and
consumers of new and innovative technologies and the risks such technologies may create to their
privacy and personal data. To date, two broad approaches towards personal data protection have been
adopted around the world. Many countries, such as EU member states and many Latin American
countries have opted for a rights-based approach to personal data protection. Under this system,
personal data protection is regulated as a fundamental right139 that applies to all personal data,
irrespective of the type of data.140 By contrast, countries such as the United States have mostly relied on
“broad self-regulation and targeted sectoral legislation to provide consumers with data privacy
protection.”141 Recent developments seem to be merging the two approaches, with the European
Commission and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission proposing many common changes and upgrades to
privacy protection in the wake of rapid technological developments associated with broadband services
and the Internet.142 This includes placing emphasis on informed consent, increasing the transparency of
data collection, raising awareness, and increasing responsibility of data controllers (i.e., privacy by
design).143 See Module 6 for further information on how training efforts can promote demand for
broadband by alleviating concerns over data privacy.

2.5.3 Affordability
Another significant barrier to greater broadband use for many potential users is cost. In identifying
demand-side barriers to broadband adoption, policymakers around the world have identified
affordability as one of the main reasons that people do not use broadband services where they are
available. The Pew Internet and American Life Project and the U.S. Department of Commerce, for
example, have found that lack of affordability is one of the central reasons cited by those in the United
States who do not subscribe to broadband at home.144
If a broadband access infrastructure is in place, users must be able to afford all costs associated with the
broadband service. Two factors are important here: the ability to afford the hardware (e.g., personal
computers, laptop/netbook computers, and smartphones) necessary to access the network, and the
ability to pay for network access (e.g., recurring monthly service charges). The issue is that some users
simply cannot afford either the upfront costs of equipment or the ongoing costs of broadband access
plans.145 In many developing countries, as well as among the low income populations in developed
nations, the costs associated with hardware and network access are often substantial relative to income
levels. While potential users may have acquired the necessary digital literacy skills, they may be
hampered from making effective use of broadband services without affordable connections, services

and devices. In addition, issues of affordability are often more pronounced in developing countries than
in more developed nations. Research by Ovum in 2010, for example, showed that prices for broadband
services are up to three times higher in 15 emerging markets than in developed countries, despite lower
wage levels in the emerging markets.146 Therefore, governments may opt to focus on providing support
to consumers who cannot otherwise afford these costs, including through assistance to purchase
broadband-enabled equipment (computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.), initial installation (up-front
costs), or ongoing network access (subscription) fees. As described further in Module 6, such support
may be provided in a number of ways, including by:
       Subsidizing equipment and service providers, who in turn offer discounted prices to target
        population groups at less than prevailing prices;
       Providing subsidies directly to target users for the specific purpose of helping them pay for
        broadband; and
       Including broadband access in lump-sum income support to households.147

Equipment Affordability
The realization that demand for communications services, including broadband, does not generally
increase if citizens do not have access to a personal computer (PC) or other broadband-enabled device
has spurred policymakers around the world to introduce measures to facilitate ownership of devices or
computers. In fact, most policies that target affordability have focused on reducing the price of access
devices. The range of broadband devices is expanding and includes more traditional means of access,
such as PCs and laptops, as well as smartphones and tablets.
There are numerous examples of innovative programs that have been successful in getting such devices
into the hands of prospective users. As discussed in more detail in Module 6, countries have introduced
a variety of programs to subsidize the purchase of broadband-enabled devices. Some countries provide
tax breaks for individuals and businesses to purchase PCs by allowing pretax income to be used or
establishing a tax rebate for these purchases. In France, for example, students receive a 50 percent tax
refund for the costs of PCs, which has resulted in a surge of mobile broadband/netbook bundles offered
to students by 3G mobile operators (see Box 2.17). As addressed in Module 6, some countries, such as
Italy and Korea, have also subsidized broadband connections.148 In the case of Korea, subsidies focused
on SMEs.149 However, for many people in developing countries, even discounted devices may be
prohibitively expensive. 150
Box 2.17. Country examples to make broadband hardware more affordable
       France: In France, the government offered a 50 percent tax refund to students buying a PC.
        Seeing a potential market untapped, mobile operators have been taking advantage of the
        government subsidy and have designed mobile broadband offerings to target students. For
        instance, Orange offers mobile broadband bundled with netbooks low-cost models to students
        with specific discounts. The addition of the government tax refund and other programs to
        facilitate PC access to students has made these offerings very attractive to the targeted group.
        For instance, Orange take up rate of the initial netbook bundle offering was above 50 percent.
       Netherlands: The Dutch government enacted a similar tax break that effectively reduced the
        cost of buying personal computers by 40 percent. Under the program, which ran from 1997
        through August 2004, Dutch workers could buy home PCs with pretax euros if the devices were
        also used for business. Employers deducted the purchase from pretax wages. The benefit could
        be claimed to buy a new computer every three years.

       United Kingdom: The UK’s Home Access Programme addressed the needs of children in state-
        maintained education without online access at home. In February 2009, the government began
        a pilot across the regions of Oldham and Suffolk where local authorities began targeting families
        with children who could not afford home broadband access. Packages were offered that
        provided computers and one year of internet access. The program was so successful that it ran
        out of funding in May 2009. A national version of the program launched in late 2009, but was
        wound down as a result of budget cutbacks across the UK government in 2010. The final
        program applications were accepted in November 2010. At that time, the agency administering
        the program noted that more than 250,000 families had benefited from increased access to
        technology at home, and 8,000 children with disabilities received technology tailored to their
        specific needs. The town of Milton Keynes has an active subsidy program with a wide range of
        options for low-income residents.151 “Loaner” computers are available for ₤1.5/month and
        users can get a free laptop with a two-year subscription.

Despite such initiatives, computers for personal use are still very rare throughout many developing
countries. Mobile phones, however, have taken the world by storm, with an average global mobile
penetration rate in 2011 of 87 percent, with 79 percent penetration in developing countries.152 In
recent years, mobile service providers have begun to offer broadband services in addition to voice
telephony and narrowband data services. It is also becoming increasingly common for operators to
offer discounted up-front prices for smartphones and other mobile devices to customers who sign up for
a one- or two-year mobile broadband service contract. The mobile phone subsidization business model
is not without its detractors, and the practice is illegal in some countries due to concerns that consumers
may be paying more for the device over the course of the contract than if the device were purchased
up-front, as well as concerns that subscribers with an operator-subsidized device is “locked in” to that
operator’s network and cannot easily switch service providers.

Broadband Access Affordability
In addition to the costs of purchasing a broadband-enabled device, lack of demand for broadband
among low-income users is also often due to the recurring costs of the broadband access service. In
order to make broadband access more affordable, many governments have opted to subsidize
subscriptions for low-income households. See Module 6 for more information on country initiatives that
provide reduced rates for broadband access services for targeted populations.
Where it is not feasible to provide subsidies for broadband access, or in addition to such subsidies,
governments may also consider using community centers to provide low- or no-cost access to
broadband services. Establishing locations where users are able to share broadband access is an
important tool to enable broadband adoption and drive demand for otherwise willing and skilled
persons who lack the financial means to purchase devices or pay long term (contract) access charges.
Module 6 further addresses how countries are incorporating publicly funded community centers and
for-profit Internet cafes into plans to help drive broadband demand, as well as increase access to
broadband services and applications.

2.5.4 Attractiveness
Even after addressing the issues associated with awareness and affordability, barriers may still exist to
greater broadband use. In order to generate demand for broadband, consumers must not only be
aware of and able to afford broadband, but they must also see the relevance and attractiveness of it.
Many people simply see no need for the Internet or broadband access, or do not use the Internet
because of concerns over privacy or data security. Such issues must be addressed for broadband to be
fully adopted throughout a country.
Attractiveness is facilitated by ensuring that the market provides sufficient choice and diversity of
services, applications and content to appeal to all consumers. Actions to boost broadband demand are
generally aimed at both consumers and businesses to encourage them to produce and consume
content, services and applications.153 This section identifies how governments and the private sector
can encourage demand for broadband through the promotion of services, applications and content that
people and businesses find compelling and valuable and want to use.

Services to Drive Broadband Demand
Services refer to the basic connectivity function of providing access to the Internet, as well as value-
added features that broadband operators include with the broadband subscription and that meet
specific quality guidelines. Within the broadband ecosystem, the availability of services is an important
factor that can help drive demand. The success of policies that encourage the development of new
services will, of course, be affected by the attractiveness and affordability of the service offerings. As
further detailed in Module 6, there are a variety of services available that can help drive broadband
demand, including:
       Internet access: The way that a broadband Internet subscription is provided can impact
        attractiveness and will depend on the technology as well as regulatory and business
        considerations. This includes whether the broadband subscription can be purchased on its own
        or requires a subscription to an underlying transport technology. For example, in the case of
        digital DSL, a telephone line is required. Subscribers have typically been obligated to pay a
        monthly rental for the telephone line in addition to the broadband subscription even if they do
        not use the telephone line for anything else but broadband. This adds to costs and may require
        an extra bill, discouraging users from taking up the service. Some operators include the
        telephone line with the broadband subscription so there is no separate bill. In a few countries,
        the cost of the physical broadband connection is billed separately from Internet access. In other
        words, the user needs to pay one bill for a broadband connection and another bill to an ISP for
        Internet access. Other factors to consider are data or usage caps that limit the amount of data
        that a subscriber can use in a month. Some operators distinguish between domestic and
        international use by having no cap or a higher cap for traffic to domestic sites, and a low cap for
        access to sites hosted abroad. One issue with caps is that users often do not understand the
        relation between volume and their usage needs. Users can easily underestimate how much
        data they will use, particularly if they access a lot of video services or use peer-to-peer
        download services (some of which may run in the background). This makes it difficult for them
        to know which package to select when choosing amongst different data plans. Some operators
        cap usage through time rather than data volume, such as a monthly subscription of 20 hours.
       Voice services: Voice telephony continues to be a popular service, if not the most popular
        service worldwide. A growing number of broadband operators offer Voice over Broadband
        (VoB) service, which is a managed service (unlike VoIP, which is generally considered an “over
        the top” application).154 VoB provides the same quality as a traditional fixed telephone and

                                                    74
                 Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


    often provides other value-added features such as call waiting, voice mail and speed dialing, as
    well as the ability for users to monitor these features online via the provider’s web site. The
    price structure for VoB is often made attractive by including unlimited national calls for a flat
    rate or even including free national calls with the broadband service subscription. Since the
    service works through the broadband modem, users do not need to be connected to the
    Internet nor do they even need a separate Internet subscription.
   Video services: IP-based routing allows video services to be provided over a variety of networks.
    This has allowed broadband operators to provide Internet protocol television (IPTV) or video on
    demand (VoD) services. These services allow end users to access Internet-only video
    programming, such as video clip sites or to select a favorite movie or show for viewing on
    demand. The ability to provide IPTV and/or VoD can make operators’ broadband services more
    attractive, especially when other features are included such as access to special programming
    not available elsewhere. However, there may be a number of regulatory considerations with
    these video services, such as requiring a specific type of IPTV license or adherence to copyright
    laws or other content regulations.155
   Bundling multiple services: IP-based technology and digitization of information and media
    allow a single network to offer voice, data and video services in a single bundle, which often
    reduces the total cost of the service (that is, the bundled prices is less than the cost of buying
    the same services individually) and the benefit of receiving just one bill. Bundling should be
    encouraged due to these benefits, although regulators may want to ensure that consumers
    maintain the option to select only one service and not be obligated to purchase additional
    services. In order to enable service bundling, regulators should ensure that licensing rules
    permit service providers to offer a variety of services.
   Government services: Aside from the more well-known commercial information and
    communications services available over the Internet, government services can also serve as a
    demand driver for broadband. Generally, such government services include: 1) making
    government information available online; 2) conducting online transactions with the
    government; and 3) participating in the political process online. Although these may not be the
    main drivers of broadband demand, government services can contribute to the overall
    usefulness of the Internet and make interacting with the government much easier.
   Health services: E-health involves a variety of services and tools provided by both the public
    and private sectors, including electronic health records (EHRs) and telemedicine. Broadband
    healthcare services and applications have the potential to lower costs and lead to better health
    outcomes. For example, broadband capabilities are essential to medical evaluation and other
    medical applications that use imaging extensively. High-definition video consultations allow
    rural patients and immobile patients to be seen by specialists in a timely manner when urgent
    diagnosis is needed and a specialist is not able to travel to where the patients are located.
    Other e-health services and applications include digital patient records; remote monitoring,
    where caregivers monitor key vital signs from a remote location, such as for diabetes or
    congestive heart failure patients; and access to medical information materials and advice.156
    With the explosion of mobile devices in low-income nations and the relative lack of wireline
    broadband penetration, mobile-health (m-health) is establishing a new frontier in health care in
    those countries.157
   Financial services. Online banking has evolved considerably, with the Internet becoming an
    integral part of the delivery of banking services around the world. It is generally recognized that


                                                75
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


        e-banking services can provide speedier, faster, and more reliable services to customers, and
        thus also improve relationships with customers. Although many types of Internet connections
        have online banking capabilities (for example, some m-banking transactions are conducted with
        narrowband SMS messages), high-speed connectivity is essential for more advanced e-banking
        activities. Delivering financial services to low-income users through e-banking can also offer the
        potential to dramatically decrease operational costs, improve the quality of financial
        information, allow for “video chats” with bank representatives and make banking for low-
        income users more profitable and less risky for mainstream financial institutions.158 For these
        markets in particular, mobile money services that allow users to make payments and
        remittances, access existing bank accounts, conduct financial transactions, engage in commerce,
        and transfer balances have proved to be of particular importance, including in Afghanistan,
        Bangladesh, Kenya, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa.159

Applications to Drive Broadband Demand
Applications are function-specific software programs that use a broadband connection to deliver
content to users. As with services, broadband-enabled applications can spur adoption of broadband
access by increasing the value of broadband. Applications add value to broadband, as they provide tools
and services that are tangible and useful for both consumers and businesses. The range of new
applications that has been developed over the last decade is tremendous. New and innovative
applications improve business efficiency and productivity, as well as provide new ways to personally
interact through social networking applications. The dynamic nature of application development is clear
in the various “app stores” that have sprung up around the various mobile device platforms, which now
have hundreds of thousands of “apps” with downloads that are already into the tens of billions only a
few years after their inception. See Module 1 for details on various social media applications, as well as
further understanding of their importance in promoting broadband uptake.
Importantly, most of the development for applications has taken place in and been driven by the private
sector. Given the success of such efforts, government action may not be necessary to promote the
development of more innovative applications. However, countries may need to revise their laws and
regulations regarding intellectual property and privacy, for example, to protect those who develop and
use such applications. Other content-related issues may also appear in the application development
context.

Content to Drive Broadband Demand
Content is linked to applications and services and generally refers to the information viewed, created
and shared. Useful content is an essential underlying element of broadband adoption. In particular, the
development of local content is important as broadband Internet access becomes more widely available
in countries where there are relatively few websites offered in countries’ dominant or native language.
Policymakers can play a key role in promoting local content, as well as digital content generally, as
outlined below. For further details on creating compelling and local content, see Module 3 and Module
6.
Promoting Local Content. Native English speakers currently account for the majority of Internet users
around the world; thus, most web content is in English.160 Although English continues to dominate, the
number of Internet users in China is quickly rising and is expected to exceed the number of English
language users in the next five years.161 Despite this shift, a significant obstacle to Internet and
broadband use by non-English speakers is the scarcity of content in their own languages. Policymakers
are expected to increase efforts to ensure that local, relevant and interesting content is produced in
order to increase the demand for broadband services in their countries. In addition to direct grants for

                                                   76
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


the production of local content, governments can support the development of local content and
applications in other ways, such as the development of standardized keyboards, character sets and
character encoding. This type of indirect intervention would impact on the content available by enabling
users to create content in their own languages.162 Additionally, translation and standardization of
operating systems into local languages can help to facilitate the development of local applications that
are relevant and comprehensible to local users.163
Governments can also play an important role in developing local content and local applications by
directly creating local content and local applications in the form of e-government applications as
described above. As policymakers seek to drive demand and enhance the development of (local)
content, several legal and regulatory issues arise, generally around the issues of freedom of expression,
content regulation and intellectual property rights. The laws and rules that regulate content in the
offline world have been gradually applied to and adapted for online content, even as the pace of
innovation online threatens to perpetually render them obsolete. Online content can be produced by
traditional methods or generated collaboratively by the users themselves—it can be a song played by an
Internet radio station, a viral video in an embedded YouTube clip, a blog post, or a news article
published by a news website. The creativity that broadband services make possible will increasingly run
up against a legal/regulatory regime that was developed in the days of printed books and film
cameras—both of which are rapidly being superseded by their digital counterparts (e-readers and digital
cameras).
Policies to promote freedom of expression. One of the fundamental rights of persons is the right to
freedom of opinion and expression, which includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and
to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.164
Content regulation, including surveillance and monitoring of Internet use, needs to take into account the
standards set by international human rights law, and have regard to the unique nature of the Internet. A
recent report by the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of
Opinion and Expression of the United Nations’ Human Rights Council notes that any restriction by a
state of the right to freedom of expression must meet the strict criteria under international human
rights law.165 The report concludes that there should be as little restriction as possible to the flow of
information via the Internet, except in few, exceptional, and limited circumstances prescribed by
international human rights law. It also stresses that the full guarantee of the right to freedom of
expression must be the norm, and any limitation considered as an exception, and that this principle
should never be reversed.166 With faster speeds, and in particular faster upload speeds, broadband can
facilitate collaboration as well as access to information. As more and more Internet users employ the
web, not just to consume but also to share, the Internet can become a virtual town square for citizen
participation. By the same token, restrictions on Internet use, the censorship of certain information or
even restrictions on access posed by “net neutrality” concerns can cut off this vital avenue for citizen
engagement. Governments will need to strike a balance between the legitimate need to restrict illegal
content and the rights of users to participate freely and lawfully in cyberspace.
Content Regulation. Countries have different social, cultural, and moral traditions. These traditions
generally are enforced by legislation that prohibits the display or dissemination of certain types of
content. Governments have legitimate reasons to regulate content: protection of minors, prevention of
vices and national security, to name a few. There will inevitably be tensions as countries attempt to
strike the right balance between the regulation of content on the Internet and the protection of
fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and information, which are strongly enabled by
broadband. The widespread access to the world’s information and entertainment sources made
possible by broadband-enabled Internet will make such restrictions more difficult to enforce. Rather


                                                   77
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


than pursuing policies that could be seen as censorship, there are other options that achieve the goal of
restricting certain types of content. For example, the movie and videogame industries, among others,
voluntarily rate their content in order to help consumers identify content appropriate for themselves
and their families. The Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), an international nonprofit organization,
administers a program whereby websites rate their content in terms of language, violence, sexual
content, etc., in response to a standard questionnaire.167 In addition, commercial vendors have
developed PC applications that employ keyword-based filtering to allow parents to control the kinds of
websites their children can visit. Similarly, the development of industry codes of practice relating to
online content may be another viable alternative to government regulation. However, a growing
number of countries are implementing Internet controls of ever-increasing sophistication, including
monitoring and filtering.168
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Compared to the limited bandwidth networks of the past,
broadband’s inherent capacity to transmit large amounts of information has made it easier to share all
types of copyrighted works, including songs, books, and videos. And as the software to find, copy and
share such works has gotten better and easier to use, the problems associated with the illegal sharing
and use of copyrighted works has become a major issue. IPR refer mainly to the rights of those persons
or entities that hold copyrights, patents, or trademarks. Copyright holders successfully litigated against
the first generation of filesharing networks, including services such as Napster that operated based on a
centralized index. Victory in court meant taking down the central index, effectively shutting down the
network. Users soon started sharing files using new peer-to-peer technologies such as BitTorrent, which
because of their decentralized nature, are much harder to shut down than first-generation filesharing
networks.169 Countries have sought to combat such new illegal filesharing applications through various
regulatory tools, including so-called graduated response or “three-strike” laws that involve giving two
warnings to online copyright infringers, resulting in loss of broadband Internet access with the third
infringement, as well as the potential for fines or criminal prosecution.


2.6 Financing Broadband Development
In the past 20 years, markets have liberalized, competition has increased and the private sector has
been the primary vehicle for financing telecommunications projects, especially in profitable areas.
Nonetheless, in many developing countries, there are still significant barriers to entry and legacy
dominant carriers continue to control markets and distort competition. Thus, the government’s primary
role has been two-fold: to develop policies that support and encourage private sector investment while
also seeking more effective ways to regulate dominant carriers and promote competition.
Today, most countries emphasize competition and a significant role for private sector investment to
spur the growth of their broadband markets. In developed countries, and some developing countries,
the majority of the private investment comes from within the country itself. In the least financially
endowed countries, however, private investment may also come from foreign sources. Governments
seeking to promote broadband development in their countries should bear in mind that investors and
companies around the world may be looking for opportunities to invest in good projects wherever they
are located. Thus, attracting foreign private investment—through appropriate incentives, a clear
regulatory and legal environment, and a good development plan—may be important components for
filling out a broadband strategy.
Where governments choose to finance broadband networks, they should avoid replacing private
investment or substituting for the normal operation of market mechanisms. Rather, governments
should facilitate and support private sector investment and be capable of developing, promoting and


                                                   78
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


implementing timely policies based on a thorough understanding of the market.170 Thus, an essential
element in effectively deploying broadband is the ability to find an appropriate financing model in which
government oversight and intervention is focused mainly on funding and financing only those initiatives
targeted at actual or expected market failures in the availability of broadband network and driving the
early adoption of broadband services.
In addition to private sector investment and direct funding by governments, several other options exist
for countries to finance broadband deployment, including government grants or subsidies to both
private and public entities and partnerships where private funding is matched by government. The
sections below briefly address the main ways governments can support the financing of broadband
development.

2.6.1 Government Support to Enhance Private Investment
The 2004 Report of the Task Force on Financial Mechanisms for ICT for Development (ICT4D), notes that
the engine of ICT development and finance over the past two decades has been private sector
investment, including foreign direct investment (FDI) by an increasingly diverse and competitive array of
multinational and regional ICT sector corporations.171 Such companies target and provide service to
profitable, high revenue customers, neighborhoods, and regions, often to the detriment of those areas
that are less commercially viable. This is the result of the tendency to see profitability and return on
investment as drivers for investment in a private investment environment.
In addition to the purely economic decisions involved, private investment also depends heavily on the
regulatory climate. The government’s challenge is to put in place the necessary policy measures and
regulatory framework to allow and encourage the deployment and financing of broadband networks as
widely as possible, and thus ensure that not only high value users receive high quality services, but that
the benefits of broadband can be spread throughout all populations and areas.
The OECD, based on a survey of broadband policies in member states, identified particular policy
initiatives that may promote broadband investments, including policies to:
    •   Improve access to passive infrastructure (conduit, poles, and ducts) and to co-ordinate civil
        works as an effective means to encourage investment.
    •   Ensure access to rights of way in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.
    •   Encourage and promote the installation of open-access to passive infrastructure when public
        works are undertaken.
    •   Allow municipalities or utilities to enter telecommunication markets. Where there are concerns
        about market distortion, policymakers could limit municipal participation to basic investments
        (e.g. the provision of dark fiber networks under open access rules).
    •   Provide greater access to spectrum (which is a significant market barrier to wireless broadband
        provision) and to adopt more market mechanisms to promote more efficient spectrum use.172
These policies have been used by numerous countries to spur the build-out of broadband networks. In
Korea (Rep.), for example, thanks to greater market liberalization over the past decade, a number of
new service providers entered the telecommunications market and began to fund and deploy fiber-
based networks. Many advanced broadband networks are now available and the country has an
impressive number of users.
In Africa, wireless broadband licenses have been granted by governments since 2004, allowing mobile
operators to roll out networks capable of supporting high speed data. Although uptake was initially

                                                   79
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


slow, several factors have led to a growing number of African operators boosting investments for 3G or
4G, including: (i) more affordable international and backhaul capacity; (ii) increasing competition in the
mobile sector; (iii) greater demand for more advanced services (e.g., through the launch of e-health and
e-education projects relying on mobile as well as other technologies); (iv) slower growth in voice
subscribers and revenues; and (v) the lack of wireline networks on the continent.173
In some cases, private investors may also look to multilateral investment banks to assist in financing,
particularly where potential investments are perceived as higher risk, or where difficult liquidity
conditions and uncertain economic prospects are seen as additional risk factors. Such conditions
decrease the possibility of solely private financing and/or raise the costs of financing. In such cases,
investment banks have become involved in broadband projects. The European Investment Bank (EIB),
for example, is already lending an average of EUR 2bn each year to support broadband projects. The EIB
develops and finances pilot projects and innovative funding schemes.

2.6.2 Fiscal Support to Facilitate Broadband
There will be cases where regulatory reform and private sector investment still do not permit a
government to reach its broadband development goals. In those cases, policymakers may turn to fiscal
support to fill broadband development gaps. Fiscal support comprises assistance provided by the
government to a company or its customers in the form of cash subsidies, in-kind grants, tax breaks,
capital contributions, risk bearing, or other fiscal resources.174

Economic Justification of Fiscal Support
Fiscal resources are limited and face competing demands from many sectors. As a result, policymakers
considering providing more direct support for broadband development must carefully analyze the
expected costs and benefits of providing that support. First, a persuasive case must be made that the
benefits of supporting broadband development are likely to outweigh the cost to be incurred by all
participating private and public sector entities, as seen from the viewpoint of the economy as a whole.
Fiscal support should not be provided for components of the broadband strategy that will leave the
economy worse off than without it. Second, if a component is overall desirable for the economy, it must
be determined how much fiscal support should be provided.
Fiscal support often involves the direct use of government money. Subsidizing investment requires cash
outlays up front that will never be recovered. Subsidizing broadband use may involve payments made
over a long period of time, possibly for the lifetime of the strategy. Investing equity in PPPs involves
cash contributions up front that may be recovered in the long run (e.g., as dividends) to the extent that
the ventures are commercially successful. Long-term debt financing comprises cash outlays that may be
recovered over the years, provided the beneficiaries do not default on repayment obligations.
Fiscal support that does not involve direct use of government money also has a cost. Giving investors
free use of spectrum for last mile access has an opportunity cost related to the revenues that the
government could obtain from the sale of spectrum licenses for profitable business use. Preferential
taxation (e.g., income tax holidays, custom duty exemptions) implies fiscal revenues foregone. On-
lending international development loans and credits reduce funding available from these sources for
other initiatives in the same country.175 Regulatory risk (e.g., changes in the pricing rules) can be
mitigated through government guarantees, which create contingent liabilities. The government can pick
up part of the commercial risk of an uncertain market outlook for new investments by committing to
future purchases, which may result in obligations unrelated to actual need.

Estimating costs and benefits
In order to determine whether to move ahead with some form of fiscal support for broadband
development, the costs and benefits must be determined. The economic costs and benefits of a
component of the broadband strategy are valued to reflect real scarcities of goods and services.
Financial analysis values costs and benefits at market prices. Both economic and financial analyses
compare the situations with and without the component. Sunk costs are not taken into account.
The principles for estimating economic and financial costs and benefits are well known, but applying
these principles in practice is subject to assumptions on market and technology development. This can
be a challenge, especially when some players (e.g. incumbent operators) have more detailed
information and analytical capabilities than others (e.g. government authorities, new entrants). To some
extent, this limitation can be overcome by using the calculus of costs and benefits to provide guidance
on fiscal support but relying primarily on market mechanisms (e.g. minimum subsidy auctions) to reach
the final decisions on support awards.
When costs and benefits can be measured in monetary terms, economic costs and benefits can be
derived from financial costs and benefits. Transfers from one part of the economy to another, such as
sales taxes or custom duties, are excluded from the cost stream. Prices that are distorted by market
interventions, such as unskilled labor, foreign exchange, capital, and the radio spectrum, are adjusted to
reflect their real scarcity in the economy. External costs (e.g., business losses resulting from digging up
streets to install fiber) should be quantified, to the greatest extent possible.
Benefits can be harder to calculate. Starting from the financial analysis of network and service
providers, economic benefits can be estimated by adding consumer and producer surpluses to the
revenue streams. For example, U.S. consumers have been increasingly willing to spend more money for
fixed broadband connectivity than they are actually paying. This resulted in a consumer surplus of about
USD 32 billion in 2008, up 58 percent from about USD 20 billion in 2005. Higher speed is expected to
add a further USD six billion to existing customers. The study underestimated the wider economic
impact of broadband, as it excluded business users and wireless access.176
Comparing costs and benefits
The net present value (NPV) of the expected benefits is the discounted monetary value of benefits
minus costs over time. For the government, valuing costs and benefits to reflect real scarcities in the
economy, an economic NPV>0 means the project would have a positive effect on the country's welfare.
For a private company, valuing costs and benefits at market prices, NPV>0 means the project could be
commercially viable. This analysis can be applied to the broadband strategy as a whole as well as to
each major separable component.
Projects that have negative economic NPV should not be supported. Projects that have positive
financial NPV do not need support. Components that have positive economic NPV but negative financial
NPV would be good for the economy, but are unlikely to be undertaken as a business. Fiscal support of
these components would be justified, up to a maximum support equal to the absolute value of the
(negative) financial NPV. This is the amount of support that would make the component just viable
commercially. Support above this level would not be justified.

Types of Fiscal Support
Private investment should be protected
Where government does decide on providing some type of fiscal support, the re-creation of monopolies
with public support is a fundamental concern to many governments around the world, as is avoiding

                                                    81
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


contributing to established carriers’ dominance and displacing private investment. The EU supports the
construction of broadband infrastructure and Internet take-up through both rural development and
structural funds, and has clarified the application of state aid rules on use of public funds for broadband
deployment through EC’s Community Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation to rapid
deployment of broadband network (“State Aid Guidelines”).177               The State Aid Guidelines were
specifically drafted to address concerns relating to public support, and contain safeguards to ensure that
any broadband infrastructure funded with public money does not favor existing operators, including
provisions that a company receiving public monies must provide effective open access to its competitors
to allow them to compete in an equal, non-discriminatory way. Although the State Aid Guidelines focus
on the role of public authorities in fostering the deployment of such networks in unprofitable areas (i.e.,
areas where private operators do not have the commercial incentives to invest), they clearly note that
state aid should not replace or “crowd out” private investment. Instead, public funds should
complement private operators’ investments and thereby achieve higher and faster broadband
coverage.178 Box 2.18 provides an overview of the EU experience with the State Aid Guidelines.
Box 2.18. EU Experience with State Aid for Financing Broadband
  In the context of market reform, good practice in financing universal access projects using public
  financing other than funds in international jurisdictions includes the practice of setting out rules or
  guidelines on the provision of public funding for universal service and access. The EU State Aid
  Guidelines for funding broadband assist in bringing UAS through the presence of clear rules that:
         Facilitate NGA and broadband investments from public funds in order to bring broadband
          connectivity to underserved areas.
         Enable the rapid deployment of broadband and especially NGA networks, thus avoiding the
          creation of a new digital divide.
         Due to the conditions laid down for the granting of state aid (such as open access, open
          tenders) allow the maintenance of competition, which will in turn contribute to ensuring
          better and more broadband services.
         Although historically funding decisions could be made on a case by case basis in the EU, in
          light of the significant level of investments, it has been recognized that a level of certainty is
          required for all stakeholders, hence the need for the Guidelines.

Direct Government Intervention
Market-based investments should be the mainstay for broadband deployment, but some degree of
direct government funding may be required to enable and complement the market, particularly in areas
that are not considered economically viable by private operators. The form of this more direct
intervention will vary from country to country. In many countries, subsidies are used to underpin
private sector investment.
Some governments have effectively used subsidies and other financial incentives to spur broadband
deployment. Canada, Korea, Germany, Greece, Malaysia, Portugal, Singapore, the United Kingdom and
the United States have all announced and are implementing substantial direct government funding for
network infrastructure development. In some countries (e.g., the United States, United Kingdom,
Canada, Germany, Portugal and Finland) measures to expand broadband access and to bolster
connection speeds have been included in the country’s planned economic stimulus packages.179 In

                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


2011, the European Commission announced a EUR 9.2 billion program to support investment in
broadband networks and pan-European digital services. The plan will be backed by the selling of
European “project bonds” under the “Connecting Europe Facility,” and is expected to stimulate
additional private and public investment of up to EUR 50 billion in broadband network buildout.180 Most
of these plans seek to speed up existing links to build faster wireline and wireless next generation
networks. Countries are spending public funding for rolling out high-speed networks to areas that are
underserved or unserved by commercial ISPs. In other countries, however, the debate over public
financing is not over how much to contribute to broadband efforts, but rather how to cut budgets in line
with the economic realities of 2011. In such a context, funding for broadband may assume lesser
importance compared to other, more important, social and economic goals. Consequently, the focus on
finding private sector-led solutions is likely to increase.
The case of the United Kingdom is instructive. The government had set a goal in 2009 of ensuring 100
percent access to next generation broadband, and had planned to support the roll-out of fiber-based
broadband and other next generation technologies via a tax on telephone lines.181 BT subsequently
started initiatives to roll-out fiber broadband to most of the United Kingdom by 2015. However, BT has
made clear that on its own, it will not push beyond 66 percent fiber coverage, and that public sector
support of some form will be required to go beyond that, be it at a national level via a central
government administered funding support mechanism or by regional funds and local partnerships to
boost coverage in particular areas.182 Within this context, BT has announced it plans to roll-out
superfast fiber broadband to unprofitable areas with the help of European funding. The European
Regional Development Fund’s (ERDF) Convergence program is investing GBP 53.5m, or just over 40
percent of the total funding, with BT providing the remaining GBP 78.5 million.183
A few governments are pushing the build-out of broadband networks through direct investment by a
government-backed company specifically tasked with building new networks. In most, if not all cases,
these government-led efforts will deliver only wholesale services that service providers can then use to
offer retail services. In April 2009, for example, the Australian government announced that it would
commit AUD 43 billion (USD 30 billion) to building a National Broadband Network (NBN) across
Australia, with wireline services reaching 93 percent of the population and the other 7 percent to be
served by wireless or satellite broadband networks. In March 2011, Qatar announced a similar plan for
a fiber-to-the-home network to reach 95 percent of the population by 2015, with a government-backed
company focusing on supplying the passive infrastructure for the network.184 In Africa, a USD 7.7 million
contract to build a wireless Internet facility was awarded to Korea Telecom in 2007 by the Rwandan
government. This marked the entry of wireless broadband technology in Africa.185 In the next three
years, the Rwandan government is aiming to provide access to high-speed Internet to more than four
million Rwandans through the wireless Internet facility and the Kigali Metropolitan Network project.

Subsidies as an Instrument of Fiscal Support
As detailed in Module 4, subsidies are the most commonly used instrument to support universal
broadband development, and are often used to ensure universal access in key sectors, including
electricity, water supply and sanitation services.186 Since such services are generally considered
essential to a productive, robust economy and society, subsidies are often used to target certain
populations or areas where the costs of supplying the service are not fully recovered from the revenues
raised by selling it. Subsidies may be financed by government budgets, user surcharges, international
grants, and other sources. A central agency or financial institution, a specialized fund, or other
mechanism may be used to collect and distribute the subsidies.



                                                   83
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


Good subsidy practice entails creating well-designed funding mechanisms that are transparently
managed and effectively target the desired beneficiaries. Such practices include ensuring that all
participants—the government, operators and customers—contribute to financing the services. While
the government subsidizes start-up costs, the service providers should also invest their own resources
into infrastructure build-out and customers should pay for at least the basic maintenance costs of
service. An increasingly popular way to support the build-out of broadband to unserved and
underserved areas using the lowest subsidy possible is by requiring service providers to compete for
funds (often referred to as “least-cost subsidies”). The use of a public tender process to award subsidies
generally results in lower costs to the government, mobilization of substantial private investment, and
enhanced transparency as compared with traditional public sector funding of infrastructure
investments.
However, competition among firms for subsidies is likely to succeed only when certain critical factors
have been met related to demand, supply and the enabling environment. On the demand side,
competition for subsidies to extend broadband is likely to work well only if users are willing to pay at
least as much as is needed to keep the service running after initial investment and start-up. On the
supply side, the main concern is whether there are enough qualified providers competing for the
subsidies since the least-cost subsidy model works best when several firms compete for each subsidized
project. An important aspect of creating an enabling environment is to ensure that subsidies are used to
narrow gaps between the market and development needs and do not serve as a substitute for the
market or to compensate for regulatory distortions of the market. As such, a transparent, stable and
credible legal, regulatory and general business framework is needed for prospective service providers to
make reasonable estimates of costs and revenues and assess the risks they are being asked to assume.
The processes for successfully using least-cost subsidies to award funding for universal access
broadband projects are addressed further in Module 4.

Public Private Partnership (PPP) Models
Apart from implementing policies and regulations to ensure competition (between networks or
services), the public sector can promote broadband development by sharing financial, technical or
operational risks with the private sector. Indeed, experience has shown that in some cases, purely
private sector-led development, or direct government or subsidy funding may not be sufficient to reach
certain areas, provide certain services or provide ongoing public funding, even with “smart subsidies.” 187
Within this context, many countries are now adopting approaches that combine public and private
sector skills and resources, as well as combining public financing with some form of matching funding
from private investors. This helps to reduce investment risk while also recognizing that market
participation is essential to financial sustainability of projects. PPPs are also increasingly being
considered as a solution for ICT development, including for broadband backbones and the supply of
transmission bandwidth sufficient to catalyze advanced broadband applications.
In Africa, for example, much attention has been given in recent years to the funding and financing of
projects aimed at bringing more affordable broadband connectivity to the continent by means of
submarine cables, regional fiber-optic backbones, and satellites. Such projects have generally been
financed through a mixture of public and private sector funding. Alcatel-Lucent, for example, signed a
turnkey contract in 2010 valued at over USD 500 million with Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), a newly
formed consortium composed of 20 parties (operators and governments) linking Cape Town in South
Africa to Penmarch in France via a submarine cable network.188 This new system, with 40 Gbit/s
capability, will span over 17,000 km and will deliver broadband communications to and from the African
continent and Europe.


                                                    84

In Finland, the main objective of the December 2008 plan for 2009-2015 is to ensure that more than 99
percent of the population in permanent places of residence, as well as businesses and public
administration offices, are no further than two km from a 100 Mbit/s fiber-optic or cable network. The
government expects telecommunications operators to increase the rate of coverage to 94 percent by
2015, depending on market conditions, while public finances will be used to extend services to sparsely
populated areas where commercial projects may not be viable, bringing coverage to the target of 99
percent. The plan stipulates that where public financial intervention is required, it should be in the form
of public-private partnerships, with federal funding only being allocated to projects deemed not viable
for 100 percent private investment. The plan limits such interventions, providing that the federal
subsidy amount cannot exceed one-third of the total project cost, with additional EU and municipal
support capped at another one-third, thereby requiring private participants to invest at least one-third
of the cost.189
Spain has relied greatly on inputs from the private sector through PPPs.190 Of the public funds used, EUR
31 million were structural funds and EUR 53 million were in zero-interest public credits. Operators
invested about EUR 280 million. The funded projects use Asymmetric DSL (ADSL), WiMAX, and satellite
technologies depending on geography, roll-out dates and available technologies. The government set
the minimum download speed at 256 kbit/s and prices were capped at a “reasonable fee.”
Malaysia’s 2006 MyICMS strategy also set out a number of goals for broadband services, as well as
strategies to achieve such goals.191 The government is funding a fiber optic network under a public-
private partnership with Telekom Malaysia that is aimed at connecting about 2.2 million urban
households by 2012. Under the terms of the Agreement, government committed to investing MYR 2.4
billion (USD 700 million) in the project over 10 years, with Telekom Malaysia committing to covering the
remaining costs. In 2010 Telekom Malaysia (TM) launched its next-generation high-speed broadband
service and included a relaunch of TM’s IPTV offering.

Local efforts, bottom-up networks
Broadband development financing is not limited to national or regional governments, however. There
are also interesting examples of how local efforts have resulted in the financing of bottom-up
broadband networks. The Universal Access and Service Module of the infoDev ICT Regulation Toolkit
(Module 4), for example, notes that the emergence of municipal broadband networks provides an
additional source of financing, from local governments, for ICT service development.192 The toolkit
highlights the Pirai municipal network in Brazil as a successful initiative that was based on the needs of
the municipal authority and included e-government, education and public access, with a range of
application support and development activities. The project established numerous broadband access
nodes that allowed all local government offices and most of the public schools, libraries, and general
public access points to be connected. Initially, all financing was provided by the municipal government.
A commercial enterprise was later established, but continues to be funded and supported by the
municipality.193
Municipalities in some European countries (such as the Netherlands and Italy) have also taken the lead
in orchestrating broadband initiatives in their region (see Box 2.19).194 A 2010 study argues that this has
been due to the fact that incumbent cable and telecommunication carriers have been uncertain about
the prospects of NGA networks in certain areas, that there is an increasing demand for broadband
services, in particular double- and triple-play services as well as higher network capacity in both urban
and rural areas, and that local (and national) governments perceive broadband networks as a means of
reducing the digital divide and stimulating economic development of regions. This, the study claims,
has led municipalities to become major investors in NGA networks.195 The French government, for


                                                    85

example, has helped local authorities play a greater role in developing broadband infrastructure through
the Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC, a government-owned bank), which provides concessional
loans to municipalities for broadband development.196
Box 2.19. Municipal Broadband Initiatives
In Italy, Terrecablate Siena is an example of a publicly owned carrier, which participated in the
Terrecablate consortium (“Societá Terrecablate Reti e Servizi S.r.l.” was created in 2005 and comprised
of the Province of Siena, 36 municipalities and three mountain communities of the Province of Siena).
The project is funded with public money and aims at maximizing access to connectivity within rural
areas.
In the Netherlands, the Draadloos Groningen (Wireless Groningen) Foundation signed an agreement in
2009 with Unwired Holding to deploy and manage a citywide wireless broadband network. The business
model used is the “anchor tenant” model whereby the anchor tenants (large organizations within a city)
fund the network and use it for their own applications. The Foundation’s members are the municipality
of Groningen, the Hanzehogeschool Groningen, the University of Groningen and the University Medical
Center. These four members of the foundation are also the initial anchor tenants. Each of them are
contributing EUR one million over a four-year period, which is aimed at guaranteeing financial support
for the network in its start-up phase, and a commitment to use it for as many purposes as possible.
Noorderpoort College and the Groningen police have also signed up to use the citywide network.
Draadloos Groningen and Unwired Holding will begin selling access to the network to other
governmental and commercial organizations, as well as to individuals.
In the United Kingdom, the government is taking a new approach to delivering connectivity in rural and
hard-to-reach areas where the market is unlikely to provide service. Where local authorities have
superfast broadband as a development priority, Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) will work with the local
government to coordinate projects and financing. Such collaboration will be the foundation for the
government’s USD 859 million investment commitment until 2015.

Universal Access and Service Funds (UASF) for Broadband
In the past, many countries defined their USFs in a way that gave priority to providing voice telephony
(traditionally provided over wireline) services to unserved or underserved regions. Recently, however, a
number of countries have revised their definitions and scope of the funds to include broadband, mobile
telephony, or Internet access. For example, the EU and the United States are adding resources to
existing rural development funds or USFs to accommodate broadband.197 Other countries are
contracting commercial providers to build the network with service obligations through a competitive
bidding process (e.g., France, Ireland, Japan and Singapore). In addition, according to a 2010 World
Bank study, the availability of new, lower cost broadband-enabled technologies allows countries to
adopt more ambitious UAS policies without necessarily incurring higher costs or continuous subsidies.198
Countries are increasingly considering turning broadband into a USO and reforming their universal
service policies in order to expand broadband access to unserved areas. According to a 2011 ITU report,
over 40 countries now include broadband in their universal service or universal access definitions.199

Examples of countries that have revised their USO policies to include broadband are provided in Module
4.
As addressed in Module 3, the financing of UAS has gone through various stages, ranging from cross-
subsidies that finance non-profitable areas under a monopolistic scenario to the creation of UASFs
financed by operator levies that support projects in more competitive markets. There is also a range of
other solutions between these two points. Historically, first-generation funding projects have been
primarily top-down (e.g., Colombia and Peru), with the fund defining the locations and requirements.
However, in the last few years, bottom-up projects have been tried in Chile and other countries. In Sub-
Saharan Africa, the tendency has been towards top-down projects, primarily allocated through
competitive processes such as least-cost subsidy bids.
The infoDev ICT Regulation Toolkit also illustrates how so-called “second generation” UASFs are today
applying their resources to the financing of Internet Points of Presence (POPs) in rural districts,
telecenters and cyber cafés, school connectivity and other ICT initiatives. Uganda is one of the first
countries to establish a more comprehensive USF, and many of its latest initiatives are through
technology-neutral competitions, which are increasingly being won by mobile operators. However,
there are some legitimate and understandable concerns regarding UASF in many countries around the
world, fuelled mostly by a few unfortunate examples of mismanagement and lack of transparency. Also,
there have been concerns raised over the complexity of establishing and managing a UASF. Negotiating
UAS contributions for all operators, which are viewed as equitable and accepted as fair, is not easy.200
Policymakers have also found that mechanisms need to be put in place to make funds accessible to a
wider range of telecommunications service providers. Limiting access only to a specific category of
licensee or to licensed operators, for example, can create barriers that continue to support existing
conditions (i.e., the expansion of wireline networks to provide universal service/access) and discourage
the implementation of new technologies to provide service in unserved or underserved areas. In
addition, the development and presentation of project proposals for UASF consideration should not be
restricted only to the fund authority or to telecommunications providers, but instead should be open to
all entities with an interest in contributing to the fulfillment of universal service/access. A system where
multiple parties can submit project proposals allows all interested parties to contribute to achieving USO
objectives. Having multiple sources for project proposals can provide a more realistic vision of the
needs and conditions of the market, such as what type of service is required by localities and which
technology is best suited, and are more likely to result in creative and resourceful project solutions. This
has become even more relevant in a broadband context as USO objectives expand to include
deployment of a variety of advanced technologies and services that includes fixed line and wireless
broadband, multi-service platforms permitting full access to all functions and features of telephony,
Internet, data transmission, e-commerce, e-government, multimedia entertainment, and interactive

Comparing Alternative Instruments
Not all fiscal support instruments are equally effective. They differ primarily in terms of accuracy, and
also regarding transparency, targeting, cost, and sustainability.201 Figure 2.18 illustrates which
instruments of fiscal support can help overcome each type of obstacles to broadband development (i.e.,
their effectiveness in addressing specific impediments to broadband development).202 For example,
subsidizing investment is particularly effective at reducing investors’ costs and also can help overcome
financial market failures. Alternatively, subsidizing use of broadband is an effective way to increase
revenues by making service affordable to people that otherwise would not buy the service; however, it
can also enhance competition among firms to provide the service and reduces commercial risk by

building up demand that otherwise would materialize at some point in the future as incomes rise and
costs decline. The choice of instrument can be further narrowed by considering the transparency of the
instruments' cost and their ability to effectively target specified categories of beneficiaries.203

Best Practices for Effectively Managing and Reviewing the Flow of Funds
Whether funds flow through a UASF, or other public financing body such as PPPs or municipal-led
projects, a number of key principles are applicable to ensure effective management of the flow of funds
to projects aimed at achieving universal broadband access, as described in Module 4.
          Effective management: Transparency, accountability and efficiency are the necessary elements
           to ensuring that the flow of funds is effectively managed. Transparency of procedures can be
           enhanced through a manual or handbook for recipients of public financing that detail rules
           related to procurement, accounting standards, project selection criteria and other procedures.
           Accountability seeks to ensure that operations are transparent and generally rely on periodic
           reporting by service providers, as well as annual independent audits and reports on the UASF, as
           applicable. Establishing an efficient management structure involves providing the fund manager
           with the flexibility and autonomy needed to respond quickly to market realities while ensuring
           that there is sufficient oversight, evaluation and review.

                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


       Review processes: UAS programs should be reviewed in terms of strategy and management on a
        regular basis by an independent entity (with relevant expertise in the fields of UAS, project
        finance, and operational management). Where public funds are used to subsidize broadband
        deployment, evaluations of UAS projects generally consider a number of elements including
        whether the specific targets in a UAS or NBP were met; identifying the impact that the projects
        have had on deployment and uptake of broadband services; whether the financial commitments
        needed to meet objectives were sufficient or whether additional funding is needed; and
        strategic options for future development of the UAS program to further meet UAS goals.


2.7 Measurement, Monitoring and Evaluation: Checking Progress
2.7.1 Why Measure Performance?
A country that adopts a broadband strategy will do so to achieve certain objectives such as increasing
the productivity of its economy through greater use of knowledge and accelerating economic growth by
increasing the use of broadband applications and services. In relation to the overall development
strategy, there will be an interest in ensuring that both government funds and private investment are
utilized as efficiently as possible, and that negative effects such as exacerbation of the broadband divide
are minimized.
Policymakers seeking to promote broadband development need mechanisms to ensure that their
objectives are being achieved and to identify if mid-term corrections and refinements to policies and
programs are needed. Broadband indicators are also needed for analysis, for example to examine
trends and the link between broadband adoption and social and economic development. They are also
important for monitoring license compliance in areas such as coverage and quality. In short, they need
to measure progress and identify successes and failures. This is not possible unless regular progress
monitoring is conducted. Ideally, the indicators most appropriate for the selected objectives are built
into the design of the programs from the beginning, and the necessary resources for data collection and
analysis are allocated from the start. When indicators are an afterthought, they tend to be more
difficult to collect and use.
The objectives of broadband strategies adopted by different countries will differ. The conditions
affecting the fit of the indicators will also differ from country to country. Therefore, the specific
indicators appropriate for a particular country, the frequency of data collection and reporting, the
geographical unit of analysis, etc. will differ from country to country as well. Consequently, this section
provides a range of options rather than a single prescription.

2.7.2 What to Measure?
This section identifies fixed and wireless broadband indicators that are likely to be of most interest to
policy makers. It focuses on indicators related to users’ access to and adoption of broadband, rather
than wholesale and backbone markets.204 The areas covered include availability, demand, quality and
pricing (see Figure 2.19). The focus here is on key indicators, but there are additional measurements
that could be useful for monitoring and analysis. These might include, for example, monetary-based
statistics such as broadband revenues. The Partnership on Measuring ICTs for Development
(Partnership)205, a coalition of intergovernmental agencies has produced a methodological manual
identifying core ICT statistics including several broadband indicators.206 This provides a useful list of key
broadband indicators based on definitions with international consensus.

Availability (Supply)
Availability refers to the ability to access wireline and wireless broadband networks and services.
Different modes of providing broadband exist; therefore, different indicators of availability are needed
for each of the modes. In the case of wireline systems, availability can be measured by the percentage
of households passed. This is a conventional measure in the cable industry that can be extended to fiber
and DSL as well. The indicator reflects the number of copper (telephone), coaxial (cable television) or
fiber optic lines accessible by a premise, regardless of whether users actually subscribe to the
broadband service.207 It may also be useful to distinguish between the type of technology, such as DSL,
cable modem and fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP). This provides an idea of the relative importance of each
to broadband development as well as the degree of intermodal competition between technologies. It
may also be useful to provide a breakdown of subscriptions by speed ranges and geographic area.
These considerations are becoming increasingly important as countries seek to deploy minimum speed
broadband services to unserved and underserved populations.
In the case of wireless, the obvious indicator of availability is signal coverage. This can be measured in
terms of population or area. The ITU has developed a definition for wireless broadband coverage in the
form of 3G/4G network coverage, though the data are not reported for most countries.208 Parallel
definitions for fixed wireless, satellite and wireline coverage do not exist within the ITU definitions.
However, several countries in the OECD report these data using definitions developed either by national
governments or by industry organizations.209 They may be adapted by countries wishing to develop
comprehensive coverage indicators.

Adoption (Demand)
While supply side indicators give a general idea of high-speed Internet availability, they do not reflect
concrete adoption or usage. Thus, policymakers need to also find reliable ways to measure how many
people and businesses are actually using the networks that have been put in place. Measuring the
uptake/adoption of wireline and wireless technologies, however, is significantly more difficult than
measuring the supply.210 While coverage measures the theoretical ability to access broadband services,
the number of subscribed connections measures actual demand for the service. Subscriptions should be
minimally broken down by wireline and wireless broadband and preferably additional categories to
allow for deeper analysis.
Measuring adoption rates is important because a number of countries have begun to use the
percentage of households with broadband access as a key metric in their broadband goals (see Table

                                                    90
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


2.4. Without appropriate measurement programs, there is no way to judge if these goals are being met.
As a result, and also to help them compare their progress to other countries, a growing number of
countries are measuring broadband access by households and businesses through surveys typically
carried out by the national statistical offices. These demand side surveys also typically include a number
of indicators on use, which can illuminate factors contributing to broadband take-up.

In measuring broadband adoption, it is important to recognize that there are a number of
methodological limitations that can make comparisons between countries or with benchmarks difficult
or misleading. Determining the number of wireless broadband subscriptions, in particular, presents
several methodological challenges. First, different countries may define wireless broadband according
to different speeds. Second, the line between fixed and mobile broadband is not always clear. For
example, in some countries there is a legal rather than technical restraint on nationwide roaming for
some wireless broadband networks. Even with this restriction, users can move with their mobile
handset or data card within a limited area so the distinction between fixed and mobile is not so clear. A
third consideration is that countries approach the use of wireless broadband on laptops via data cards
differently than use via mobile handsets. Some countries only consider the former to be mobile
broadband and consequently include it in their overall broadband counts, while smartphone broadband
use can go uncounted, which could lead to undercounting of actual broadband use—especially with the
advent of 4G technologies.
Another major issue with measuring wireless broadband is that users may have the theoretical ability to
access mobile broadband services if they have an appropriate device (and data payment plan), but they
may not actually make use of the available services. Counting this theoretical availability can
significantly overstate the take-up of wireless broadband services in a country. Therefore, it is
important to distinguish between active and inactive data subscriptions. The OECD has defined active
wireless subscriptions as access to the Internet in the previous three months or the use of a separate
data subscription.211 However, even activity is a blurred concept since some countries count access to
any high-speed service such as video chat, mobile television, etc. and users may not be accessing the
Internet.

Regulators in a number of countries publish broadband subscription data, highlighting trends and
making comparisons. The Turkish Information Communications and Technology Authority, for example,
contrasts the availability of different broadband subscriptions with the European Union and also
provides a breakdown of speeds over ADSL, the most prevalent wireline broadband technology in the
country (Figure 2.20).

Quality
In order to use or fully utilize certain applications, certain performance parameters must be met by the
broadband connection. Two of the most important are latency (the amount of time it takes for a packet
to travel between sender and receiver) and speed, which can be monitored for both fixed and wireless
networks. Other broadband performance metrics include signal quality, availability (“uptime”),
complaint ratios and service activation and restoration times. Technical means exist to measure these
aspects at various points in the link between the end user and the server providing the application. Such
information is important to both policymakers—to ensure that the broadband networks and services
being supplied are up to industry standards—and to consumers—who can use such information to
decide which service will provide them with the highest quality. Many consumer complaints hinge on
differences between advertised and actual speeds.212
In Bahrain, for example, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority publishes quarterly reports
measuring average download and upload speeds and DNS and latency times (Figure 2.21).213 In the
absence of regular monitoring some regulators publish links on their web sites to third party
applications for measuring speed and other quality aspects.214

Overall quality can also be affected depending on how far apart the user is from the information being
accessed. When a user is accessing ICT resources that are provided by their own ISP, service can be
quite good since everything is on one network. If the information is located in a server on a different
network in a different part of the country, however, there are more links that must be made, and hence
more opportunities for quality to degrade. Finally, if a user is trying to access information on a server in
a far-off country, quality can suffer further as more variables are introduced into the transmission link.
Measuring for each of these cases yields diagnostic information useful for regulators, operators and
consumers, and can help to identify weak links in the broadband supply chain. For example, the Info-
communications Development Authority of Singapore establishes different latency parameters
depending on whether Internet traffic is national or international.215

Pricing
As noted in section 2.2.3, price impacts adoption rates; services (or devices) that are too expensive will
not be subscribed to or used and adoption rates will suffer. Thus, governments have an incentive to try
to ensure that prices are as affordable as possible and to track whether their efforts to keep costs down
are succeeding. In particular, a government that launches a broadband initiative using public resources
will want the service to be affordable to the intended beneficiaries. One could argue that prices need
not be monitored in the case of purely private supply, where no public resources have been expended.
However, when broadband is seen as an essential public utility, or where prices are high due to market
failure, governments may want to monitor pricing. Concerns about this issue have prompted several
countries, such as India and the United States, to include “affordable” broadband access as a key factor
or goal in their broadband initiatives.216
Competitive broadband markets typically have multiple tariffs with varying levels of bandwidth, data
download caps and discounts. This presents methodological challenges in terms of compiling
comparative broadband tariff indicators across technologies. Baskets of monthly services are often used

                                                                    93
                     Module 2. Policy Approaches to Promoting Broadband Development


as a common measure of price trends that factor in caps and speeds. The key components include the
monthly price of broadband service, the corresponding speed and if applicable, the cap and prices for
exceeding the cap. Capped versus unlimited packages pose comparison problems, but can be mitigated
somewhat by comparing price per advertised Mbit/s. Another issue is that some broadband
technologies require an underlying subscription to the transport service. For example in the case of DSL,
most operators require a subscription to a fixed telephone line, while some mobile broadband plans
require an underlying voice subscription.
Efforts to define pricing models that can fairly and effectively compare prices across countries are
ongoing. The Partnership, for example, has defined a core indicator for wireline broadband prices. The
core fixed broadband tariff indicator is based on entry-level prices for plans providing at least 256 kbit/s
download speed. Mobile broadband pricing is a bit more difficult to compare since prices tend to vary
by the volume of data downloaded per month (a “tiered” pricing scheme). In addition, comparisons can
be complicated since some operators do not guarantee advertised speeds and apply various restrictions
(capping data or reducing data speeds) or charge additional fees if the user exceeds his/her contracted
data limits.
An example comparing wireline and mobile broadband monthly prices for selected economies is shown
in Table 2.5. The example illustrates the various ways of looking at broadband pricing and highlights
comparability issues. One notable aspect is the differences between entry-level prices, speeds and
affordability (in terms of price as a percentage of per capita income). For example, although an entry-
level fixed broadband package in Turkey is almost twice as much as in Brazil, the Turkish tariff is a
slightly better value since the download speed is twice as fast as in Brazil. Similarly, although the entry-
level price for fixed broadband in Brazil is more than twice that of Vietnam, it is much more affordable in
Brazil than Vietnam (although the value of the Vietnamese package is ten times more).

Code Indicator                                    Description
Infrastructure and access
A4      Fixed (wired) broadband Internet         Fixed broadband Internet subscriptions refer to entities (e.g.
        subscriptions per 100 inhabitants        businesses, individuals) subscribing to paid high-speed access
                                                 to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection). High-speed
                                                 access is defined as being at least 256 kbit/s, in one or both
                                                 directions. Fixed broadband Internet includes cable modem,
                                                 DSL, fiber and other fixed broadband technology (such as
                                                 satellite broadband Internet, Ethernet LANs, fixed wireless
                                                 access, Wireless Local Area Network and WiMAX). Subscribers
                                                 to data communications access (including the Internet) via
                                                 mobile cellular networks are excluded.
A5      Mobile broadband subscriptions per Mobile broadband subscriptions are subscriptions to mobile
        100 inhabitants                          cellular networks with access to data communications (e.g.
                                                 the Internet) at broadband speeds (defined as greater than or
                                                 equal to 256 kbit/s in one or both directions) such as WCDMA,
                                                 HSDPA, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) and LTE.
A8      Fixed broadband Internet access tariffs Fixed broadband Internet access tariffs represent the least
        per month                                expensive broadband entry plan converted to US$ for a
                                                 minimum 256 kbit/s connection. Monthly charges do not
                                                 include installation fees nor modem rentals. Affordability
                                                 measure can be derived using the tariff as a percentage of
                                                 monthly per capita income

2.7.3 How to Measure?
An effective policy evaluation plan will specify not just the elements to be measured, but also how the
data should be collected to ensure its integrity and validity. Government agencies responsible for
broadband policy should consult internationally comparable indicators and identify those most suitable
for monitoring and evaluation. Based on their mandate to regulate and monitor the sector, best
practice suggests that national regulatory agencies should gather data (numbers of subscriptions, for
example) directly from operators. Ideally, the regulator should consult and cooperate with national
statistical agencies that have the technical skills to produce demand side statistics through household
and enterprise surveys that may ask about broadband possession or use of different ICT services within
households and businesses (or by individuals). Broadband operators play a key role, both as providers
and consumers of the data.
The entities best positioned to provide supply-side data are the network builders and owners. It is
common for provisions mandating the reporting of data to the government or the regulatory agency to
be included in statutes governing the industry or in licenses or concession contracts. Irrespective of
legal provisions, the principal challenge will be to ensure the regular and timely reporting of the
required indicators based on adherence to agreed-upon standard definitions and procedures.
Most governments do not monitor their country’s broadband development in a vacuum. They typically
need data from other countries to put their nation’s high-speed market evolution in perspective and
benchmark it with other countries. Brazil for instance compared its broadband penetration and forecast
evolution to Argentina, Chile, China, Mexico and Turkey (Figure 2.22).

There are a number of international sources that harmonize and disseminate statistics for different
countries. The ITU has been the traditional repository of supply-side data on telecommunications and
now on ICTs, and also collects some demand-side data. Similarly, the OECD collects and disseminates a
number of broadband indicators for its member countries as does EUROSTAT, the statistical arm of the
European Union. All these organizations make the data available online (Table 2.7). The Economic and
Social Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) also recently launched a broadband
indicator site for its members.217 In addition, several private sector entities publish broadband statistics
on mobile broadband subscriptions218 as well as average download speeds and other quality metrics.219

2.7.4 How can measurement data be used?
Collecting data is a crucial step in informing broadband development policy, but its real importance lies
in how that data is then used to fine tune policies and strategies. All stakeholders must have access to,
and be confident in, the data so that they can use it to inform their investment and policy/regulatory
decisions. All projects and initiatives involve judgments and trade-offs made in conditions of imperfect
information, so transparent, reliable feedback is essential. Not only does transparency enhance
accountability, it also allows better information to flow through to decision makers, allowing them to
improve policies and implementation through mid-course corrections. Transparency is particularly
important when public funds, loans, credits or other (financial) incentives are involved.
Public and stakeholder participation in policy formulation and implementation is critical for the long-
term success of broadband development initiatives. Thus, for governments considering how to
effectively build and refine their policies and strategies, getting the collected data into the hands of
those stakeholders is critical. How can the data be made available? First, the data must be produced
using proper procedures, standard definitions and in a timely manner, as discussed in section 2.7.2.
Second, the data must be made widely available in formats that allow further analysis.
A number of governments have made it a priority to make information available for use by the public,
operators and academics. The government of the Republic of Korea, for example, has won wide
recognition as an ICT development success story. There is a profusion of information made available by
the Korean government, both through Statistics Korea,220 the national statistics office, and the Korea
Communications Commission,221 the national regulatory agency. Officials responsible for measuring
broadband development progress not only collect comprehensive data, they are also at the cutting-edge
of discussions on the definition of indicators, the methodologies for their measurement, and
interpretation.222 The United States FCC has developed a broadband coverage map, which is available
online, that shows where (wired) broadband networks are available in the country.223 Germany has a
similar mapping function that shows broadband speeds available across the country,224 and has also
created an infrastructure “atlas” that shows the passive infrastructure (from telecommunications,
electricity, water and gas line providers) that could be used to help further buildout broadband
networks.225 Such efforts can help identify those areas where broadband development still lags and
those resources that could be used to help close the broadband development gap.

 In a technical sense, public goods are non-rivalrous (i.e., one person’s use does not diminish another person’s
ability to use it) and non-excludable (people cannot be stopped from using it). Examples include free over-the-air
radio and television and national defense. However, some argue that broadband is not a pure public good as
broadband access is excludable as demonstrated by the unevenness of broadband deployment, even within the
same country. Some may also argue that broadband is not a public good since it is also rivalrous —one person’s
use can diminish another’s use if the network is congested. Robert Atkinson, Network Policy and Economic, Paper
Presented at the 2010 Telecommunications Policy Research Conference (TPRC) (Oct. 2010), available at

  It is worth noting that this is changing. The commercial success of mobile operators in Africa, the increase in
traffic arising from a growing customer base, and the shift in strategy from an exclusive focus on voice to one that
includes broadband mean that network operators are now considering investment in fiber-optic networks that
once would have been considered too risky.

  For small island developing states (SIDS), obtaining submarine cable connectivity has been a mixture of
geography, history and luck. Investment in a submarine cable depends on traffic which is itself a function of the
number of people and the intensity of use. SIDS have very small populations and modest levels of teledensity and
Internet usage making it challenging to obtain submarine cable connectivity. See Ewan Sutherland,
Telecommunications in Small Island Developing States, 37th Research Conference On Communication, Information
And Internet Policy, George Mason University School of Law, p. 8 (Sept. 2009).

  Local loop unbundling (ULL) is the obligation imposed to the incumbent operator to provide access to the local
loop or last mile of its network (i.e., the connecting network between the termination point of the subscriber
premises and the main distribution framework of equivalent facility of the incumbent’s fixed network). LLU
obligations can be full or shared. Full LLU allows the use of the full frequency spectrum of fixed network. Shared
LLU only authorize access to the non-voice frequencies of the fixed network.

  For example, the various specific mobile allocations, such as land mobile, have now given way to simply
“mobile.”
120
   Further, the provision of data or even voice over traditional or alternative wireless networks was not a major
disruption. However, the trend around the world has been for regulators to see the provision of video services
over wireless networks as a problem. The introduction of mobile television and video broadcasting over
“telecommunications” networks, for example, has led to significant hand wringing among many regulators. The
primary cause for this is the stricter control governments seek over media and broadcasting than
telecommunications. Even many countries that have adopted multiple play-friendly regulations are still
maintaining older distinctions.

   Operators can upgrade CDMA2000 networks in the 800 MHz band to datacentric CDMA2000 EV-DO networks.
This has happened in 28 countries (for example, Brazil, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Morocco) to date. Further, even
the GSM evolution to 3G, WCDMA, is now available in the 900 MHz band. Australia, Finland, France, and the
United Kingdom have plans to deploy (or have already deployed) WCDMA in this band.

    For example, the U.S. Federal Communication Commission’s Part 15 rules on how “intentional, unintentional, or
incidental radiator may be operated without an individual license” states: “Emanations from the device shall be
suppressed as much as practicable, but in no case shall the emanations exceed the levels specified in these rules...
Parties responsible for equipment compliance should note that the limits specified in this Part will not prevent
harmful interference under all circumstances.” As such, manufacturers and users of device s using the unlicensed
spectrum have a responsibility to reduce their harmful emissions as much as possible and minimize the possibility
of interference with other devices. On the other hand, users of the devices have no right to be protected from
harmful interference from another device. See http://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/rules/ (last visited January 27, 2011).

   The central piece of legislation relating to data protection in the European Union is Directive 95/46/EC, on the
protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. In
addition, Directive 2002/58/EC, concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the
electronic communications sector (“e-Privacy Directive”), regulates areas which were not sufficiently covered by
Directive 95/46/EC, such as confidentiality, billing and traffic data, rules on spam, etc. This Directive was
subsequently amended by Directive 2009/136/EC of 25 November 2009 to, among other things, enhance privacy
and data protection of Internet users.

   “Voice over Broadband” (VoB) is a managed service using IP that provides the same quality as a traditional
wireline telephone as well as providing users with their own number and a ringing telephone. In addition, VoB
often provides other value-added features such as call waiting, voice mail, and speed dialing, as well as the ability
for users to monitor these features online via the provider’s web site.

   Although the deployment of national backbones are important goals of some broadband plans, the indicators to
measure developments in these areas have not been identified or defined by the international statistical
community and the data are not widely available. Nevertheless, perusal of plans from some countries can help to
identify relevant indicators. For example India’s proposed broadband plan calls for the construction of a national
fiber optic backbone throughout the country. This might be measured by indicators such as the number of
localities served by the national fiber optic backbone and kilometers of fiber backbone in the network. See:

indicators at the regional and international levels. It provides an open framework for developing a coherent and
structured approach to advancing the development of ICT indicators globally, and in particular in developing
countries. Partners include EUROSTAT, ITU, OECD, UNCTAD, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, the UN Regional
Commissions (UNECLAC, UNESCWA, UNESCAP, and UNECA), United Nations Department of Economic and Social
Affairs (UNDESA), and the World Bank. See: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/partnership/index.html

   Subscription data, for example, are not precisely comparable across countries because household sizes can
vary. In addition, there will be significant duplication if fixed and wireless broadband subscriptions are simply
aggregated for an overall access figure, since some users may have a fixed and a wireless connection, or even more
than one wireless connection (e.g., a phone and a data modem for a computer).

LAW AND REGULATION FOR A
   BROADBAND WORLD
     MODULE THREE
3.1 Introduction
The first experience of broadband by commercial and personal users was a
telecommunications standard Integrated Services Digital Network-Broadband or simply
ISDN-B. The standard was adopted by the CCITT (International Telegraph and Telephone
Consultative Committee) of the ITU in 1988 for the transmission of voice, video, data and
other network services at speeds up of 144Kbps. The peak sub-broadband speed of ISDN
was 128Kbps. As mentioned in chapter one (http://broadbandtoolkit.org/1.2)“the term
broadband is generally understood to mean a dedicated or “always-on” connection to the
Internet with speeds faster than dial-up.”

ISDN-B offered a digital subscriber line (DSL) service over the top of a baseband analogue
signal, but from the late 1980s onwards higher speed DSL communication technologies
became available. Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) seen as ideal for residential customers who were
assumed to need more bandwidth for Internet download than upload, whereas Symmetric
Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) was seen as more suited to the symmetrical needs of large
companies sending and receiving files a regular basis between their various office locations.
By the late 1990s in some markets, personal telephone connections into the home using the
digital subscriber line (DSL) standard had already reached 1.5Mbps, something that only a
few years earlier had not been available outside of commercial enterprise markets such as
the banking and financial sectors. (See Module 5.7.1 Wireline Access Technologies for a
broader discussion.)

By 2008 the ITU-R (International Telecommunications Union-Radio communications sector)
had endorsed the 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) mobile cellular standard named IMT-
Advanced (International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced) with potential peak
download speeds of 1Gbps for pedestrian usage and 100Mbps for use in moving vehicles.
Using fibre-to-the-home 1Gbps is already available to households in numerous markets
around the world.

NGN Broadband

The most advanced networks have already reached the next generation network (NGN)
phase, meaning they are end-to-end IP high-speed broadband networks. Compared with
144Kbps the technology and the markets for broadband have changed beyond all
recognition. Yet in the 1990s and 2000s there were very mixed views from within the
industry to these developments. The first was a disbelief that anyone could want or need
high-speed broadband at all. As speeds increased so did the upper limit of what many
observers thought was necessary to download Internet TV programmes (IPTV), movies,
upload videos and photographs, etc. As it turned out, markets proved the doubters wrong:
Internet users who moved to higher speeds never went back. The idea that the demand for
speed was dependent upon, or derived from, the demand for content and applications was
                                                                                            2
not quite right. Users wanted speed for its own sake, just as users want access to
telephones even if they do not always use them. It shows that while technological advances
can drive markets, so markets can drive technological advances. What economists call latent
demand is often untapped and unrealized in markets where there is little competition
because monopolists and dominant incumbent service providers have little incentive to
invest in more modern technologies. This is a key issue for regulators wanting to see more
broadband roll-out in developing economies.

The second reaction came from the more traditional telecommunications community who
doubted that Internet protocol, or simply IP, would ever be able to deliver the ‘carrier grade’
quality of service that was expected and demanded of telecoms companies. The digital
workhorse of the 1990s was the ATM (Asymmetric Transfer Mode) switch which could easily
handle digitalized traffic using many different packet-switched protocols, such as Frame
Relay for commercial data users and X.25 for email users, over traditional telephone circuits.
The reality turned out to be different. New releases of IP routing algorithms became more
reliable and routing equipment better able to handle higher capacity traffic. This allowed
new entrants into telecoms markets the option of adopting next generation network (NGN)
architectures and technologies giving them much lower operating costs than incumbents.
For example, in the US incumbent telecoms providers were forced into accelerating the
depreciation of their ATMs and associated network equipment. For policy makers and
regulators this has opened up an entirely new era of issues, because they have to decide
upon whether and how to license these ‘disruptive’ new entrants—disruptive in the sense
they are employing technologies that change the face of telecoms services and service
delivery. This underscores the importance of the interconnectedness of technologies with
markets and with policy/regulation.

Interconnectedness
                                                                                             3
Equally important is the interconnectedness of networks, and probably of greater
importance than the more familiar concept of convergence. Ever since the digitalization of
telecoms the issue of convergence has arisen because different traffic streams, such as voice,
video and data can be transmitted down the same transmission networks, known as
multiplexing. However, when networks deployed IP, it meant that different traffic streams
could cross between networks and that is fundamentally important from a commercial
perspective because it gives rise to the possibility of by-pass. By-pass was a rising
phenomenon in international telecommunications in the early 1990s as international
carriers, striving to become more competitive, re-routed their overseas traffic from high-
cost routes to lower-cost routes to arbitrage international accounting and settlement rates.
Call-back was a related form of by-pass, again substituting or ‘arbitraging’ lower for higher
cost routes. With the spread of the Internet and applications such as Skype, Yahoo
Messenger, WhatsApp and many others, users can place phone calls, video calls, text
messages and by-pass the incumbent carriers. These were the forerunners of Over-the-Top
(OTT) applications, such as downloading content from third party access providers, for
example TV shows over YouTube or movies from Bit Torrent.

Interconnectedness of networks raises new challenges for policy-makers and regulators
because it means a proliferation of the means of access to networks. In principle, any user
can access any network from any other, but local carrier and content licensing conditions
that were introduced many years ago may not be consistent with this growing reality. Often
carriers which were granted exclusive licences to provide access or content services now
find themselves by-passed. Their options are to adapt to the new market realities and
compete aggressively or to partner with overseas service providers and provide the
localization of content and distribution channels. Alternatively, they may decide to lobby for
restrictions on these new entrants and if they are partly owned by government they may
have powerful political support. For policy-makers there may be legal obligations involved
and in some cases the best way forward may be to compensate a carrier for giving up its
exclusive rights, for example over international telephony. Policymakers and regulators
should always keep in mind the ultimate purpose of licensing and regulation: If policies and
regulations encourage innovation and diversity of service options for users, the overall value
of the market is likely to grow even if some segments, such as voice revenues, decline. A
more competitive and diverse market is attractive to other sectors of the economy, such as
new media, advertising, online retail, mobile payments and banking services, not to mention
the market for user access devices such as smartphones and tablets.

For many years the industry has talked of convergence to describe the above as information
services (data), communication services (telecoms) and technologies (IT) come closer
together as ICTs. However, it remains the case that just because these services can be
delivered (multiplexed) down the same pipes does not necessarily imply there is commercial
synergy between them as businesses. The skills required to run a telecoms network are
                                                                                            4
vastly different from those needed to create a successful TV station, and the financial
profiles are totally different. Investment in telecoms is lumpy over time with long periods of
revenue growth to be accumulated for the next round of investment. A TV station lives or
dies by how fresh its programming is on a daily basis and the purchase of new content from
the studios is a continuous process. Carriers will look to complement different services, such
as telecoms and IPTV, and will leverage their subscriber and billing base to market these
complementary services, but they are equally likely to run up against the problem of
cannibalization. This arises when the marketing of one product or service comes at the
expense of another. For example, rolling out broadband may cannibalize the leased line
business, and offering bundled Internet services may cannibalize voice revenues. These are
essentially commercial decisions for the carriers, not for the regulator, but often permission
to do any of this requires new licences or regulatory approvals. It is the interconnectedness
of networks that creates the competitive impetus for all of this.

About this Module

Interconnectedness is throwing up a number of issues that were previously beyond the
domain of a telecoms regulator. Issues such as data privacy and cyber security, for example,
have become concerns for policy-makers and often require coordinated approaches across
different regulatory bodies. Where this includes telecoms and broadcasting a number of
jurisdictions, including the UK, Hong Kong, Nigeria and Thailand have decided to merge the
regulators. Whether convergence of technologies leads naturally to the convergence of
regulation is a question to be examined further below. So this module deals not only with
issues the telecoms regulator traditionally has to deal with, such as licensing and spectrum
management, but also with related issues that arise due to the interconnectedness of
networks.

       Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World
3.2 Licensing and Authorization Frameworks1
Licensing is authorization to build a network and/or to offer services of different kinds over
a network. The arguments behind licensing usually relate to the need to regulate the
activities of operators and service providers for the public good, such as quality of service
and customer care, protection against price gouging and unfair or anti-competitive practices.
Licensing arrangements are a way to ration scarce resources, but in cases where resources
are not scarce other mechanisms may be used, such as authorizations, class licences that
cover a variety of services to different devices, or simple registration.2 For example, in the
1990s Hong Kong issued paging licences on-demand as long as there was spectrum available.

An Adaptable Licensing Framework Needed

In a pre-digital, pre-IP and pre-NGN era the costs of building and operating a network were
very high giving rise to claims, not always justified, that a telecoms network was close to
being a ‘natural monopoly’. A natural monopoly occurs when the unit or average costs of
output fall as output rises across the entire market until all demand is satisfied. Under these
circumstances, no new entrant could be more efficient at serving even a select portion of
the market. In reality, there are almost always segments of the market where a specialized
new entrant can serve more efficiently and in a more innovative way. In a world of digital
telecommunications and IP networks new entrants can choose to come into the market
using NGN systems with significantly lower operating costs. If there are any natural
monopoly elements left they are likely to be found in long-distance traffic networks, but
even here if non-telecom entities such as electricity utilities and rail networks are licensed
to lease their long-haul cable or microwave capacity to new entrants, competition is
possible. Licensing and authorization therefore need to take into account the changing
economic realities that arise from new technology paradigms.

An important first step policy-makers and regulators can take towards a competitive
telecommunications market is to make the licensing regime responsive to the emergence of
new technologies that make new entry commercially feasible. Responsiveness to change
requires a flexible licensing regime. There have been several different approaches to
reforming the licensing process. One approach is to separate telecom activities into a tiered
stack with infrastructure at the bottom, service delivery in the middle and applications and
content as the top layers of the stack and issue different classes of license for each layer. For

example, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) issues
licences according to the following categories:

                                               Figure 3.2




In the case of neighbouring Singapore, facilities-based and services-based licences are also
issued, but the third layer consists of individual licences and class licences. In Africa, Kenya
has a similar approach (see Toolkit Broadband in Kenya Case Study) but with twelve licence
categories embracing ancillary sectors such as contractors, vendors and even business
process outsourcers under a Unified Licensing regime.3 One of the problems with this
segmented approach is that the lines of delineation between networks, services, apps and
content begin to crumble. For example, cloud computing service providers may offer
Infrastructure-as-a-Platform (IaaP) with more and more content accessible through apps;
the licensing framework ceases to reflect the way in which facilities and services are offered.

An alternative approach to meet the needs of NGNs is the issuing of a multi-service general
licence which enumerates the specific types of services the operator can provide. The most
flexible form of general licence is a service and technology-neutral unified licence which
permits entry to any field of service the operator wishes to invest in. This was an approach
pioneered by India.4 The most radical approach is to replace licences altogether with
registrations, but this may require codes of practice to ensure good behaviour by operators
and service providers.

Issuing Licences

In some jurisdictions, licenses have to be approved by the legislature. While this process
may ensure a thorough vetting of the application, it can also mean lengthy delays and the
involvement of policy-makers who are not specialists in the field. It is also a process that
lends itself to lobbying. A better option is to remove the specifics of licensing conditions as

                                                                                                  7
applied to each operator from the legislative process and place them in licences issued by
the telecoms regulator, even if final approval or endorsement lies with a higher authority.
Legislation can then focus upon the overall principles of licensing in the sense of creating a
template which the regulator can use.

Transparency and Investment

What is fundamentally important is that the terms and conditions of any licence are
absolutely transparent and, ideally, available for all to see on the regulator’s website. Both
users and competitors should have the right to know what are the terms and conditions of
service. Users need to know for the protection of consumer rights, and competitors need to
know so every operator has equal access to commercially non-sensitive information. Where
information is commercially sensitive, for example in the cost accounting data upon which a
Reference Offer of Interconnection (ROI) is agreed by the incumbent operator, then the
regulator needs to have a copy so that they can determine whether there is discrimination
in case a dispute emerges between operators.

Unfortunately not all licences are given out on a transparent basis. Where corruption or
cronyism is involved licences are seen as rewards and favours, with the inevitable
consequence being that users and the economy-as-a-whole are denied the full benefits of
competition. This will make the economy less appealing to investors, especially to investors
in carrier services who see the market as being rigged, but also to investors in sectors that
are heavily reliant upon broadband communications networking such as financial
institutions, trading companies, business process outsourcers, call centres, and other
companies that are part of the global supply chain of multinationals. A World Bank study of
investment in telecoms in the Asia Pacific region in 2004 found that regulatory uncertainty
was the No.1 deterrent to investors in telecoms,5 while the availability of high quality and
affordable telecommunications services is regularly cited as among the top three factors
that attract overseas investment, along with the rule of law and good transportation
systems. A good example from North Africa of transparent regulation was Morocco’s
creation of an independent Agence Nationale de Réglementation des Télécommunications
(ANRT) in 1998. (See Toolkit Broadband in Morocco Case Study.

Ex-Ante, Ex-Post and Incentive Regulation

In many cases the conditions of the licence as they apply to different operators will depend
upon whether the operator in question has been designated as dominant in any given
market, such as in voice termination or in leased circuits. Dominance is usually measured by
market share of users or by the share of total revenues. A widely used measure, for example

5
    See http://trpc.biz/wp-content/uploads/2004_07_Telecom_in_EAP_Telecom_Note.pdf

                                                                                                 8
is the Hirschman-Herfindahl index (HHI) which is constructed by the sum of the squares of
the market shares of each operator, so in an evenly competitive market of 4 players each
with 25% of the market HHI = 252 +252 +252 +252 = 2,500. A number larger than this is
indicative of a more concentrated market, but this is a rather static measure that in itself
does not explain market behaviour.6 A more refined measure is significant market power or
simply SMP. This estimates how far a single operator can increase profitability by changing
the price it charges for its services. In a highly competitive market, it will lose customers
when it hikes its prices, and if it lowers its prices competitors will match it. Traditionally,
where an operator has been designated as dominant, some regulatory restrictions apply; for
example, an incumbent operator could be required to submit proposals of tariff changes to
the regulator for approval. This is regulation before the event or ex ante regulation.
However, as competitors establish a firm foothold in the market there has been a change
towards regulation after the event or ex post regulation. This is appropriate when it cannot
be assumed that the dominant operator is abusing its market position. It is often referred to
as ‘light-handed’ or ‘light-touch’ regulation. Just as the threat of competition may be
sufficient to deter the dominant operator from acting in an anti-competitive manner, so the
threat of regulation may achieve the same result. If it does not, then regulation is called for.

A half-way house between ex-ante and ex-post regulation arises when competition has been
introduced but is not yet well established. A good practice widely used in the US and in the
UK in the 1980s came to be known as incentive regulation or economic regulation. The
regulator would develop a formula to govern when and by how much the incumbent could
change tariffs in a way that rewarded the operator for becoming more efficient. One such
formula used in the UK was the price cap which allowed British Telecom (BT) to raise its
prices by RPI-X, the retail price index minus X% where X is determined by the regulator. So if
the rate of retail price inflation was 8% and X was set at 5%, the operator had an incentive
to increase efficiency by over 3% to make more profit. The formula referenced a basket of
services and within the basket there were individual sub-caps to allow BT to rebalance
prices between services. X was adjusted every 3 to 5 years. This example is not to suggest
that a price-cap formula is the best solution for all circumstances; it is simply a good solution
if it works under local circumstances. The key point is that this was an inventive way to
apply solid economic principles to a regulatory problem, combining longer-term regulatory
flexibility with short term financial clarity for the investors. It is just one of several options.

Maintaining a Competitive Market

Competitive markets can become less competitive when companies exit the market and
when mergers and acquisitions (M&A) reduce the number of network and service suppliers.

                                                                                                      9
It is therefore important that the regulator is given powers by the legislature to evaluate
potential M&As. This means imposing a requirement on the companies concerned or on the
acquiring company to notify the regulator and seek guidance. In some cases this function
may be carried out by a separate competition or monopolies commission. A good practice is
for the regulator to give advanced advice to the parties concerned to smooth the process.
This avoids undue delays, but identifies early on any substantial issues that may need
addressing. The regulator can either aim to avoid a company becoming dominant as a result
of an M&A by imposing conditions such as the disposal of assets, or can require certain
behavioural guarantees such as equal access to network facilities and directory databases in
exchange for ex post regulatory oversight. These steps may require changes to the terms
and conditions of the licence before the M&A is given the green light.

3.2.1 Technology and Service Neutral
Section 3.2 emphasized the need for the licensing and authorization framework to keep
pace with changes in the technological landscape because new technologies and standards
can give rise to new market opportunities. The traditional problem is that licences issued
many years previously may specify the technology or the standard to be used. This was
often true by default in the case of wireless cellular telephony. If the CDMA standard was
used then an allocation within the 800 MHz band was assigned by licence, and if the
standard was GSM an allocation within the 900 MHz band was assigned, and so on. With 3G
and 4G standards now available innovation in frequency usage enables mobile network
operators (MNOs) to use a range of different spectrum bands including 900MHz, 1.8GHz,
2.1GHz, 2.5/2.6GHz, etc.

Promising changes in spectrum use are arising from the so-called digital dividend as
frequencies used by analogue radio and TV broadcasts in the VHF and UHF bands are freed
up with the shift to digital radio and terrestrial TV or DTT. The 700MHz band especially is
seen as having excellent propagation characteristics that could mean much wider area
coverage by cellular and other wireless technologies for the same or less investment. This
will pose a challenge and an opportunity for policy-makers and regulators. The challenge will
be how to allocate these frequencies between the claims of competing services. The
opportunity will be to assign these frequencies to new services and to meet the needs of
populations in more remote and rural areas. This will be discussed further in section 3.3.
The point at this stage is that although regulation through licensing may be needed to ration
a scarce resource such as radio spectrum, if the licensing process itself is to become ‘f uture-
proof’ it needs to take a step back from specifying exactly which technologies and standards
are to be used. For example, allowing 3G services to be offered over 2G assigned
frequencies—a process known as spectrum refarming—is a step in this direction. UMTS900
networks have already been deployed by AIS in Thailand, by Digitel in Venezuela and by
DNA in Finland.

                                                                                             10
No amount of licensing or regulation can predict which technologies and standards will be
successful in the market. Some will come and go quite quickly. Paging for example, is not
used today but was a popular and conveniently cheap method of text communication in the
1990s, before it was pushed aside by lower cellphone prices. Some standards will enter the
market but fail to gain widespread adoption. Local Multipoint Distribution Service
microwave or LMDS was a case in point, and the WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access) may be another. Licensing policies need to be adaptable to
accommodate these market experiments because no amount of regulatory foresight can
predict the outcomes and, as in the case of WiMax, although it may not be adopted in its
mobile version it can nevertheless play a role as a substitute for digital subscriber line (DSL)
in some markets. Also a new entrant choosing the standard is more likely to develop a
sustainable business plan if the licensing conditions permit it to migrate to an alternative
technology (DSL) or wireless standard (4G) as it discovers the market need. This is what is
meant by technology neutral regulation: it leaves the choice up to the investor to test the
market.

Apps and Services

So far neutrality has been discussed in terms of technology and standards, and in terms of
medium, fixed or wireless. Ultimately neutrality is about different services requiring
different media and technologies. For example, most standalone MNOs are required to
lease backhaul from fixed-line carriers, but they would be in a much stronger competitive
position if they could invest singly or jointly (through facilities sharing) in their own lines. If
needs be, their license conditions could restrict the usage of those lines to their own
business so they do not compete for the retail business of the fixed line carriers; however,
even that solution may be considered second-best to outright competition. Certainly unified
or converged carriers offering both fixed and mobile services (triple play, including Internet)
have a cost advantage in this regard. An alternative solution is to licence independent
broadband wholesalers which encourages more cost-effective competition at the retail level.

A new dimension to technology and service-neutral regulation has arisen with the spread of
web-based applications that can be accessed through a range of fixed line and wireless
network devices, such as smartphones. As many of these apps are OTT and therefore
potentially by-pass the tariffs of the licensed carriers’ networks, carriers are tempted to
restrict the bandwidth made available to their download, either by throttling bandwidth,
outright blocking or by levying additional charges on their users. This is the net neutrality
issue which is also referenced in module 3.7. It is a point of argument whether regulation
that tries to preserve equal access to services for consumers is straying too far into the
commercial pricing decisions of operators. In Hong Kong, for example, the regulator took
the view that while operators could introduce tiered pricing schemes for consumers to
choose from, they could not discriminate against the supply of different apps or content. In

                                                                                               11
other words, once a consumer has established and paid for their chosen level of demand in
terms of total broadband capacity they can use per month at the basic fee or in terms of bit
rate speeds, they are entitled to access any apps and content up to their chosen limits.

3.2.2 New Authorization Options and Their Implications for Broadband
Regulation of the media and regulation of telecommunications networks and services have
traditionally been separate domains of government. The spread of broadband, the
convergence of technologies and the search for business synergies between publishing,
broadcasting, IPTV and the delivery of content over the Internet has prompted several
countries to converge their telecoms and broadcast regulation agencies, although it should
be noted that this does not imply that the regulations have fully converged. For example,
the FCC in the US was created in 1934 and manages the regulation of both telecoms and
broadcast in separate departments. A useful ‘Environment Scan’ conducted by the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in 2011 cited the Australian
Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) as finding that:

        Even in converged legislative frameworks that adopt an industry-agnostic approach
        to carriage regulation, at this point in the evolution of converged regulatory models,
        when it comes to content, sector-specific media regulatory measures still generally
        apply.7

However, these changes are bound to impact upon the way in which new authorizations will
be made. Modules 3.2 and 3.2.1 have highlighted the important development of
technology-neutral and service-neutral licensing regimes and the challenge of keeping the
licensing structures relevant to developments in the marketplace. The innovation of
multiservice and general licensing was noted, but even these approaches can have their red
tape. The multiservice approach, for example, may require different licences for different
categories of service and cross-ownership rules may restrict the licences available. In an
ideal world, all services would be open to all comers, but in reality markets often support
only two or three profitable ventures,8 raising fears of dominance or, possibly, of collusion.
For this reason, easing the licensing requirements for service providers and content
distribution networks (CDNs) may prove an effective countervailing power within the
market.

  In 1976 Bruce Henderson, the founder of Boston Consulting Group, argued empirical data seemed to show
that as markets matured three companies would come to dominate in the ratio of approximately 4:2:1. The
marginal company (number three or four) would be hard pressed to remain profitable. This very often seems
to be the case in telecom markets. See ‘BCG Classics Revisited: The Rule of Three and Four’

Much of the content today is likely to come from overseas, through broadband, through the
Internet and through CDNs. Policy-makers and regulators are therefore faced with
additional decisions to make: should they confine licensing and regulation to domestic-
based service providers and permit open access to external services? Or, should they
attempt to impose domestic conditions upon external services? If so, how? For example, in
some jurisdictions, overseas service providers are required to register an official presence in
the country. Vietnam has proposed this, but only as a point of official contact and not, it
seems, as a means to carry liability in the case of a dispute.

The arguments for regulation usually relate to the need to screen out unacceptable apps
and content. This is clearly a decision that has to be taken at the national level, but a good
guideline is that if there are to be regulations and restrictions they should meet two
conditions. Firstly, what is regulated and restricted should be a fair reflection of what is legal
and illegal in local law, otherwise there is a danger of arbitrariness, lack of policy
transparency and even of due process. Secondly, regulations and restrictions should be
proportional to the threats or dangers involved. For example, content that glorifies or
promotes hatred and violence is far more harmful than content that makes parody and
criticism. An additional important element to consider is the intention of the content. For
example, content that makes a damaging untrue statement about a person may be
deliberate libel or it may be an unintended error. Proportionality in the application of law
should be able to draw the distinction and apply that in the remedy, in this case an apology
and/or a takedown rather than a prosecution.

3.2.3 Disputes Resolution Procedures
Moving from an incumbent monopoly towards an open entry and free market in
telecommunications is a process that from time to time inevitably generates disputes
between the regulator and the operators, between different operators and between
operators and customers.9 Disputes with regulators are most frequent when licensing
conditions are being imposed such as steps to curb anti-competitive behaviour, the
imposition of price controls, and the granting of permissions to market new services.
Disputes between operators are more likely to centre around competition issues, such as
discrimination in the cost of interconnection or in providing access to unbundled network
elements (UNEs) – see Module 3.6 – and claims of misrepresentation arising during
combative marketing campaigns. Billing, quality of service and waiting lists are the types of
issues most likely to arise between customers and operators.

Dispute resolution procedures usually take one of two forms: either official government
channels such as the regulator, a statutory arbitration court, an appeal to a minister or to
the Supreme Court, or through unofficial channels – also referred to as alternative disputes
resolution (ADR) – involving a voluntary process and an arms-length arbitration panel.
Consumer councils often play an important role representing user interests, but they do not
always enjoy an official status. Sometimes, as in Thailand, the regulator’s office h elps to
create a consumer protection agency.

Where disputes arise over a regulator’s decision it is best practice to establish some kind of
telecoms tribunal, in Hong Kong called the Telecoms Appeal Board,10 to ensure
transparency. But the appeal will be confined to examining whether the regulator followed
due process and not a challenge to the regulator’s statutory powers to make a judgement.
Like many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong has also established an ADR mechanism called the
Customer Complaint Settlement Scheme (CCSS) similar to Australia, New Zealand and the
United Kingdom to help resolve disputes between operators and users.11 In 2013, Hong
Kong’s six mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) agreed to join the scheme which
already covered fixed and mobile network operators.12 The importance of ADRs is they can
provide fast and also less costly solutions to relatively small disputes without taking away
the legal rights of the parties concerned.

Other approaches to dispute resolution include judicial or semi-judicial tribunals that adopt
court-like procedures. For example, India has placed the procedure in the hands of an
independent Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) presided over by
a retired high court judge. In his assessment of the dispute resolution in India and influences
upon it from around the world, R.U.S.Prasad notes the importance of Malaysia’s ap proach,
although in the latter case the tribunal’s chairman, also a retired high court judge, is subject
to appointment and possible dismissal by the minister.13 In the US, where the role of
litigation is more accepted as part of commercial life, the decisions of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) are generally regarded as final. However, law judges are
involved during hearings leading up the final decision of the Commissioner, and FCC rulings
are frequently subject to Court of Appeal challenges.

      Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World
3.3 Spectrum Management
In the fixed line world the original ISDN-B definition of broadband was 144 Kbps; that is a bit
rate or in other words the size (byte) over a period of one second of a video or audio stream
download or upload. Modern broadband wireless access (BWA) networks and devices
operate at bitrates that now run into Mbps and, under laboratory conditions, even Gbps.

Bit Rates and Frequencies

Although there is no direct relationship between bitrates and radio frequencies or Hertz
(“wave cycles per second”) it is the case that higher frequencies with shorter wavelengths
occupy broader bands of spectrum. So, for example, 1.8GHz is twice the spectrum of
900MHz. By allocating higher frequencies to services such as public land mobile networks
(PLMN) there is additional spectrum available for more operators and therefore more
competition in the market. Because they are broader and shorter, the higher frequencies,
(above 1GHz) are well adapted for densely populated urban areas, but offer less coverage
for wider suburban and rural areas. This can be an important commercial issue because it
means that lower frequencies offer lower costs in terms of base stations, towers and
backhaul coverage to operators who are looking at less densely populated markets. As a
consequence in a spectrum auction mobile network operators (MNOs) may bid more for
these lower band frequencies than for the higher ones, although historically the opposite
has been true because MNOs first targeted urban markets. Ultimately, 10MHz, 15MHz or
20MHz of bandwidth is the same whatever the frequency; what really matters is the
technical capacity of the network equipment and of the access devices operating at these
frequencies. An example of this is the development of broadband satellite services for fast
Internet access and HDTV.

Policy Aims

What are the aims of policy? This question has to be the first thing to consider from a
regulator’s perspective when deciding the allocation and assignment of spectrum for
broadband services. Different policy aims require different regulatory objectives. For
example, if the policy aim is to stimulate service innovation, then the regulatory objective
could be to increase the supply of unlicensed spectrum and/or to facilitate spectrum sharing.
If the primary aim of policy is to ensure greater competition and consumer choice, then the
regulatory objective will be to assign spectrum to new entrants and maybe to facilitate the
entry of mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) – see Box 3.1.




                                                                                              16
                                               Box 3.1
                                               MVNOs

A Mobile Network Operator (MNO) has market power by virtue of owning radio spectrum
and a network. By contrast, a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) is dependent upon
an MNO for both to provide services such as voice, SMS and data to end-users.14 MVNOs do
have full control over their branding, marketing, billing and customer care operations,15 and
compete by providing flexible plans, tailored services, loyalty programs etc. With the advent
of broadband and smartphones a new range of possibilities is opening up, including m-
payment services and specialized apps and content for targeted markets.

Broadband has encouraged MNOs to shift from charging high wholesale prices to MVNOs to
selling ‘buckets’ of bandwidth. In some cases they take a revenue share from MNVOs who
create new markets, such as the MNVO in the US that has started a retail portal that sells
almost any brand of smartphone.16 In other cases the MVNO is an affiliated company
operating in an overseas market – see below for the example of the Philippines. Basically,
broadband is giving MVNOs a new lease of life. The first MVNO was launched in 1999 by
Virgin Mobile (UK) and as of late 2012 there were over 630 licensed MVNOs worldwide. 17

PLDT and Remittances

MVNOs tend to focus on customer maintenance rather than customer acquisition, bundling
value-added services (VAS) with a suit of other product offerings such as remittance and e-
commerce. The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Corporation (PLDT), which links its
MNVO services overseas with other offerings catered to Filipino migrant workers, is a good
example. These include a remittance service called Smart Pinoy Remit and an e-commerce
website called Smart Pinoy Store. The Smart Pinoy store allows Filipinos working overseas to
purchase groceries, gift cheques, flowers and other items online to be sent to their families
back home or pay for their family’s PLDT landline or Smart post-paid bills. Through
agreements with different MNOs, PLDT has been able to launch its MVNO services in Hong
Kong, Singapore, Guam, Taiwan, Macau, Malaysia and the UK and has plans to launch in the
Middle East, North America, Africa and other parts of Europe.

Brazil and MVNO Regulation

Brazil is a good illustration of how targeted regulation can open up a market for MVNO
entry. Brazil is the largest mobile market in Latin America with more than 260 million
subscriptions in 2011 of which 80% are pre-paid, and a penetration rate of over 130% as of

April 2013.18 The Brazil market is highly competitive with the four biggest mobile network
operators (Vivo, TIM, Claro, and Oi) holding close to a quarter of the market each. 19

In 2010, the telecom regulator Anatel approved regulations that would create two types of
MVNOs.20 The first is where an agent (‘credential’ model or credenciado de red virtual) of a
mobile operator, with ANATEL’s approval, reaches a commercial agreement with an
institutional customer such as a bank, a retail chain store or a football club. By falling
outside the definition of a public telecommunications service this is an encouragement to
non-telecom players. The second is the traditional MVNO (‘authorized’ model or autorizado
de red virtual).

The first two MVNOs, Porto Seguro Conecta and fixed-line operator Sermatel (Datora
Telecom), were approved in 2011 and launched in 2012. Porto Seguro Conecta is operated
by Porto Seguro, an insurance company. Its initial service offering focuses on Machine-to-
Machine (M2M) communication providing vehicle tracking services owned by its insurance
customers. The two MVNO licence holders have partnered with the TIM network.21 As of
March 2013, Porto Seguro reported having 41,377 subscribers and Datora 1,000, while four
more MVNOs have announced their entry and three more are in the planning process.22
Maybe not all will survive but by opening the market to MVNOs ANATEL has succeeded in
stimulating investment in services competition and innovation.

MVNOs and Regulators

MNVOs offer regulators a way to increase competition at the retail level and innovative
services that can cater for market minorities. They offer MNOs a way to raise more revenue
from networks that have spare capacity. In China in 2012 the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology (MIIT) announced a two-year MVNO trial plan as a way to attract
more private capital into its telecommunications market.23 Unlike MNO VANS (value-added
network services) operators, VAS operators have little or no direct control over the network,
its capabilities and performance. Therefore many of the regulations regarding QoS applying
to MNOs are not necessarily applied to MVNOs. On the other hand, MVNOs do control their
own billing systems, so regulations safeguarding consumers can apply. Although wholesale
pricing is usually left to commercial negotiations, if the ministry wishes to positively
encourage MVNO entry there may be a case for regulation, but care needs to be taken that
it does not remove the incentive for the MNOs to share their networks.

If the policy aim is to raise revenue for the treasury, then the regulatory objective will be to
design an auction in a way that maximizes the bidding prices. If the policy aim seeks to
achieve is mix of the two then the regulatory objective may be to reserve some of the
spectrum to be auctioned for new entrants only. A successful auction will then allow a new
entrant into the market but maybe at the expense of raising less revenue than if the entire
spectrum were open to all bidders.

The means of achieving regulatory objectives will vary. Auctions have become popular
among regulators who look for market solutions, and are tending to replace the traditional
‘beauty contest’ approach by which regulators pick and choose the winners. One big
disadvantage of the beauty contest approach is its lack of transparency, making it vulnerable
to corrupt practices. But not all spectrum will be assigned by a market mechanism. Many
public services, such as public protection and disaster risk (PPDR) services used by the police
and first responders such as fire and ambulance services, are assigned spectrum by
administrative means, also known as ‘command and control’. In many countries the armed
services also control large swathes of spectrum, as do utility companies running facilities
such as seaports, airports, electricity grids, roads and rail networks. Increasingly regulators
are looking for ways to increase the efficiency with which these legacy assignments are used
so they can free up spectrum for new broadband services. The use of ‘administrative
spectrum pricing’ or ASP (sometimes called ‘administrative incentive spectrum pricing’) is
one way to do this by assigning a price usually based upon some notion of the ‘opportunity
cost’ of using the spectrum for some other purpose. Another way is to carry out an
efficiency audit using radio engineers to make an assessment.

                    Hong Kong Approves Administered Incentive Pricing

Statement published 19 June 2007: Executive Summary

This Statement follows Ofcom’s consultation on the future pricing of spectrum used for
terrestrial broadcasting. It sets out our intentions in respect of:
 implementing charging for spectrum used for digital terrestrial broadcasting of television
    and radio; and
 extending the current charging regime for analogue commercial sound broadcasting to
    the spectrum used by the BBC for its radio services.

Ofcom’s decision

In July 2006, we consulted on proposals to implement administered incentive pricing (AIP)
for spectrum used for terrestrial broadcasting. We did so on the principle that one of the
best ways of ensuring that the opportunity costs of spectrum are fully and accurately
reflected by decision-makers is for those opportunity costs to be reflected in prices that
have to be paid to hold spectrum.


                                                                                              19
The consultation produced a number of responses, which this Statement outlines and which
we have considered fully. Our overall conclusions are that:
   it is right that broadcasting use of spectrum should be subject to appropriate charges in
    future, in the same way as almost all other uses are or will be;
   the right time to introduce charging for spectrum used for digital broadcasting – both
    television and radio – is the end of 2014;
   the right time to extend the existing charging regime for commercial analogue radio
    spectrum to that used by the BBC is 2008;
   before introducing any charges, we will consider carefully any potential effects on
    broadcasting output, and the right options to address or mitigate them.

Preventing Radio Interference

Given the new focus upon broadband wireless the starting point for all spectrum
management policy making and regulation remains the recommendations of the ITU’s
World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC), held every three to four years. The topics
are set six years in advance and the final agenda around three years in advance. This gives
time for the Study Groups and technical standards bodies to make their recommendations.

The only mandatory requirement for ITU membership is a commitment to avoid radio
interference with neighbouring countries. All else is about the adoption by national
regulatory authorities (NRAs) of WRC and ITU recommendations on policies, standards, etc.

The avoidance of radio interference clearly should always be the number one consideration
and in light of new ‘intelligent’ technologies, an interesting reaffirmation of this came in the
US from the FCC’s 2012 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for broadband satellite
services. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski explained: “We’re proposing to modernize,
streamline, or eliminate hundreds of rules or subsections governing satellite services.
Among the changes, this Notice includes a shift in the focus of the r ules from a ‘tell us how
you built it’ approach to a ‘tell us how you will avoid interference’ approach. ” 24

Harmonization

An issue of growing significance for NRAs are efforts to achieve harmonization of spectrum
allocation across neighbouring countries to gain economies of scale in the equipment
standards used across the region and to facilitate roaming. Roaming was previously a voice
service on mobile phones, but that is changing as broadband data roaming services using
smartphones, tablet computers, etc., become more popular. Important past initiatives by
the ITU have included the ‘Harmonization of the ICT Policies in Sub-Sahara Africa’ (HIPSSA)
with EU support25 and a joint programme with the Caribbean Community and Common
Market (CARICOM) named ‘Enhancing Competitiveness in the Caribbean through the
Harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and Regulatory Procedures’ (HIPCAR). 26 Both
these programmes have now concluded.

In Asia, the ASEAN group of nations is also working towards harmonization, including freeing
up the spectrum in the VHF and UHF bands through the switch from analogue to digital
terrestrial TV (DTT), known as the digital dividend. Asia somewhat lags behind other regions
in making progress towards harmonization as the paper ‘The Digital Dividend in Asia’
explains.27 One of the most influential organizations in the region promoting a common
approach towards the digital dividend is the Asia Pacific Telecommunity or APT based in
Bangkok.28 However, as each ASEAN country has its own legacy of spectrum allocations
which include military and government as well as commercial bands, harmonization is not
easy to accomplish. ASEAN has its own general policy document for the harmonization of
ICT developments within South East Asia—the 2010 Masterplan on ASEAN Connectivity: One
Vision, One Identity, One Community (MPAC) 29—with a roadmap called the ASEAN ICT

Spectrum Scarcity Debate

Alongside the rising demand for spectrum for broadband services there has been an
accompanying debate over whether or not there is a spectrum supply shortage. The
arguments consist of several different points. There is a straightforward view that demand
has outstripped supply, especially with the rise of social media and video streaming, massive
multiplayer online gaming (MMOG), etc. Equipment vendors and operators typically argue
this point.

There is another view that too many operators are not using their spectrum fully and
efficiently and if they did so there would be little or no shortage. This view was put forward
in a report by two CitiGroup researchers in 2011 who argued that in their estimation in the
US only about 35.7% of spectrum set aside for wireless communications was being used for
that purpose.32 Those with spare spectrum, they argued, lacked the capital to invest in
networks, while those with networks lacked the additional spectrum to expand their
services. Others have pointed out that at least some of the spectrum held in reserve by
operators is not necessarily inefficient but rather good investment management, ready to
take advantage of emerging new technologies and standards. It is also the case that under-
used spectrum can be held by non-telecom bodies such as the armed forces, the emergency
services, public utilities such as power and transportation companies, etc.

In the US the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) takes the view that there will be a
shortage as demand outpaces supply unless more spectrum is released as part of the 2010
National Broadband Plan. The FCC also considers that a lot of spectrum is being under-
utilized and that smart regulation should find a market solution to this problem. The FCC
“needs to create new incentives for incumbent licensees to yield to next-generation users”33
and proposes ‘incentive auctions’ as one way to do this. In an incentive auction the licensee
who gives up the spectrum to the highest bidder either keeps the revenue and pays a
commission to the FCC for running the auction, or shares the revenue with the FCC. The
reason why incentive auctions may be necessary is because historically the cost and time of

clearing entire bands of spectrum from previous occupants and reallocating them are too
high and takes too long, sometimes beyond 10 years.34

Allocating additional spectrum is one issue; how to assign it to users is another. The most
valuable spectrum below 1GHz has been assigned by methods such as ‘command and
control’, ‘beauty contest’ and increasingly through market auctions, but an alternative
approach is to release spectrum for free as a public commons. This already happens in many
frequency bands as unlicensed spectrum, but a public commons approach implies higher
emissions and therefore the need for some form of regulation. These issues are discussed in
the next modules.

Conclusion

Making judgements about the future supply and demand for radio spectrum is precisely that,
a judgement, and one that will require continuous revisiting. On the supply side, new
technologies are rapidly increasing the efficiency of frequency usage, yet which technologies
will succeed in the marketplace can never be known with certainty. On the demand side,
service innovations and changes in user preferences also happen quite quickly, especially
over broadband wireless networks. Given this reality, regulation needs to become smarter,
that is to say: it needs to mimic market incentives as far as possible; it needs to be
transparent so that investors and users can plan ahead; and, it needs to become more
flexible to take account of changing conditions and requirements. The rest of this section of
module 3 will further explore these issues.

3.3.1 Spectrum Licensing Regimes
The growing demand for spectrum for broadband covers a range of wireless technologies
and standards. Each category lends itself to different regulatory approaches.

Low-powered short-to-medium range communications

The broadband era is seeing the coming of the ‘Internet of things’. Every object, whether it
is a device such as a mobile phone, a TV or a refrigerator, a vehicle or even a piece of
clothing, can be connected to the Internet or directly to another object by short-range radio
using Internet Protocol. Different technologies, such as Bluetooth and Zigbee, have been
developed to provide the communications standards. The spread of these machine-to-
machine (M2M) communications will grow exponentially and are becoming the central
component of smart cities. Already smart cars send system alerts to mobile phones and

computers. Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) schemes, as used in Singapore, deduct payments
from stored value cards displayed on vehicle windscreens each time the vehicle passes
under a gantry. Hundreds of millions of electricity meters, water meters, early warning
sensors ready to detect earth tremors or fires are operational; because the power emission
from these devices is extremely low and radio interference is not an issue the frequencies
do not need to be licensed.

Along with these developments there will be an increasing level of innovation surrounding
the ‘Internet of things’. New devices and new services will emerge and in some cases this
may call for a raising of the limits on power emissions. In such cases, an alternative to
licensing is to allow industry to adopt its own codes of conduct with respect to frequency
sharing and frequency hopping, but the regulator needs to be reassured that this is
technically possible and presents no risk to public health. It is important that regulators have
access to the independent technical expertise necessary to make these judgements, for
example, by establishing a Radio Advisory Committee or by bringing in a consultant.

Mass wireless communications

The licensing of MNOs (mobile network operators) to build PLMNs (public land mobile
networks) has traditionally followed the contours of the technology standards being used,
but this is starting to change. 2G standards typically used 800MHz (CDMA) and 900MHz
(GSM) bands, while UMTS standards for 3G used a variety of bands for W-CDMA, notably
2100MHz (Band l) and 900MHz (Band Vlll) in most of Europe, Africa and Asia, 1900MHz
(Band ll) and 850MHz (Band V) in the Americas, 1700MHz (Band lll) in the USA, etc., while
WiMax, a different standard, is typically allocated 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz frequencies
and WiFi 2.4GHz. The equipment itself can be manufactured to be tuned into whatever
frequencies are allocated, and licences were linked directly to these allocations.

With the arrival of 4G LTE and LTE Advanced and Mobile WiMax a new stage has been
reached in spectrum management. On the one hand, these standards are meeting the
demands for greater bandwidth or frequency capacity driven by the growing demand for
bandwidth-hungry applications. This puts regulators under pressure to find additional
spectrum. On the other hand, the digital dividend which frees up large amounts of
bandwidth from analogue radio and TV in the VHF and UHF bands offers regulators a once-
in-a lifetime opportunity to re-allocate 150MHz or more spectrum. In addition, regulators
are searching for spectrum that is either unused or under-used in other frequencies. The
result is an opportunity for 4G MNOs to occupy and operate from a variety of frequencies as
suits local circumstances and increasingly regulators are starting to look towards multi-
frequency auctions called, somewhat clumsily, Combinatorial Clock Auctions or CCA




                                                                                             24
auctions where bidders can combine ranges of frequencies from different bands.35
Frequency aggregation techniques (discussed later) are an advanced method by which
MNOs can use these frequencies in combination.

With all these changes regulators need to revisit their licensing regimes to allow MNOs
greater flexibility in their use of frequencies from different bands, because licensing that
links an MNO’s network to a specific band simply will not work in this situation. This is
discussed further under 3.3.3 Allocation and Assignment.

Flexibility has arisen in another aspect of licensing of MNOs where they need to buy or build
backhaul capacity to manage the growing demands of traffic across their cellular networks.
Leasing backhaul capacity from a fixed-line incumbent can be very costly while the lack of
such capacity threatens the quality of service that can be offered to the public. Regulators
would seem to have at least six options to choose from to relieve this bottleneck problem.

First, where the incumbent fixed line operator also has a licence to provide wireless mobile
services a unified licence can be issued to replace the separate licences and thereby
encourage greater network integration or fixed-mobile convergence. India was the first
jurisdiction to introduce this innovation. However, this does not solve the problem if the
incumbent is permitted to discriminate against competing MNOs. Equal access is an
important part of maintaining free and fair competition. A second option is to licence MNOs
to build their own fixed-line or microwave backhaul networks but limit the use either to
own-services or to wholesale services; the latter of these options has the virtue of
introducing greater competition into the wholesale market. A third option is to allow MNOs
to share backhaul facilities such as towers, as well as to share cell sites and thereby spread
the costs. A fourth option is to licence a separate wholesale network provider who can serve
the entire market in competition with incumbent fixed-line operators. A fifth option is to
licence non-telecom entities such as utility companies to lease their own fixed-line or
microwave capacity to MNOs. A sixth option is to allocate spectrum to WiFi, which can be
used to offload data traffic from congested cellular networks. In addition, public-private
partnership (PPP) arrangements can sometimes help in each of these cases where there is a
need to reduce operational and capital risk, but as one former finance minister warned
there is a danger of them escaping “both the discipline of effective state (i.e. Treasury)
control and the discipline of the marketplace.”36 PPP may be especially helpful in areas

which are serving national policy interests such as providing access to rural and remote
locations.

Long-distance terrestrial backbone and backhaul microwave technologies

Licensing non-telecom companies such as national rail and road systems and energy grids to
lease their long-haul capacity is an obvious step towards greater capacity for MNOs and for
competition in the wholesale market. Licensing to permit facilities sharing such as towers,
ducts and leased circuits is another way to solve the bottleneck problem and is being
adopted in many countries.

Extra-terrestrial satellite microwave

Broadband satellite services currently offer fast internet connections to many areas that are
not served by terrestrial connections. They will become even more important in the coming
era of ‘connected TVs’, television sets with Internet connectivity enabling viewers to
download movies, watch live sports, view videos, play MMORPG, etc. In many low income
countries these developments may seem an age away, but in the metropolitan centres of
countries that are well integrated into the global economy these are the new consumer
products of the present day. In many rural areas, mountainous landlocked countries and
remote small island economies, satellite remains the only way to gain access.

Traditionally, C-band satellites requiring receiver dishes several feet in diameter were used
mostly for broadcast services, and as a back-up for telecom services. L-band is used for GPS
and more and more devices use GPS. Ku-band satellites offer higher bandwidth and a
narrower footprint and are widely used by Vsat transceivers to provide commercial access
mainly to data services. Now Ka-band satellites, which operate at speeds 100 times faster
than Ku-band, are offering high-speed broadband Internet access to areas previously
unreachable, although attenuation problems often arise on these higher bands due to
tropical rainfall. Many countries cannot afford a satellite of their own, but they can licence
local service providers who lease satellite channels. Licences need the flexibility to take
advantage of technologies such as dynamic frequency allocation that can supply different
levels of service to different locations.

Licensing and Innovation

Flexible licensing policies can help unlock innovation. With the coming of the ‘Internet -of-
things’ and the real possibility of smart cities that can, among other things, help address the
issue of energy consumption, carbon emissions and climate change, the role of licensing has
extended beyond its initial aims of imposing strict operational requirements upon service
providers, and even beyond the aim of making competition work. It is now addressing the
issue of how to stimulate and facilitate innovation in the use of spectrum and in the
provision of new services. This affects the competitive advantage of an economy and helps
                                                                                             26
to create jobs and revenues: regulation, technologies and markets are all interconnected,
each affecting the other. The demands of the market spur on technology innovations such
as cognitive radio for spectrum sharing, intelligent antennae for better radio coverage, and
spectrum aggregation techniques for a more efficient use of available spectrum. The
changing role of licensing is therefore an important facilitator of this virtuous cycle and
necessary to encourage investment in these new network services. (See also Kim, Kelly and
Raja (2010) ‘Building Broadband: Strategies and Policies for the Developing World’
http://www.infodev.org/en/Article.454.html)

3.3.2 Flexible-Use Technical and Service Rules
The management of radio spectrum is an area of policy and regulation that has greatly
expanded in recent years. This module is focused upon broadband which, in the early years
of wireless telecommunications, was more or less synonymous with the higher shorter
frequencies. For example, 1GHz is a band of spectrum twice as broad as 500MHz. The
disadvantage of the limited propagation characteristics of shorter frequencies was offset by
the fact that broadband cellular services, notably 3G and beyond, were focused upon dense
clusters of customers in urban areas. Dual-band handsets allowed handoff to lower
frequencies when users roamed from urban to suburban and rural areas. In more recent
years another dimension has become important, the vastly increased bitrates cellular and
other wireless networks and devices can now handle.

In addition to these two dimensions – the propagation effects that determine coverage and
the uplink and downlink speeds that determine traffic loads – there have been a multitude
of other technological advances. These include: cognitive radio (CR), which is software-
defined radio (SDR) that allows devices to detect other users to avoid radio interference;
intelligent antennae and the use of multiple antennae or MIMO (multiple-input and
multiple-output), which give radio signals greater sight around obstructions; and, spectrum
or frequency aggregation techniques, which allow service providers to operate across
several different spectrum bands simultaneously. This increases the efficient use of under-
utilized or isolated frequencies which may have resulted from an earlier fragmentation of
frequency assignments. Figure 3.4 below illustrates the principle of spectrum aggregation.

Efficiency and Innovation

Rapid technological advances in network capabilities and a growing demand for broadband
access (network availability) and usage (network capacity) are starting to throw up major
challenges for regulators. There is only so much spectrum available, so using it efficiently
has become an issue of prime concern. Promoting innovation is one way to do this. It is also
a way to raise the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy-in-general, create jobs
and new services. The regulator’s job is becoming much broader in its scope than before.

As the number of services that can be offered across BWA networks has multiplied,
regulators often took to licensing networks and services separately in recognition that some
services would be provided by MVNOs (mobile virtual network operators) or by third parties
such as content aggregators and application service providers. This distinction is now more
complex with the interconnectedness of the Internet because many services can be
provided from outside the country OTT (over-the-top of the network). Technically,
everything from making telephone calls to downloading movies to installing apps on a
smartphone or a tablet can be done OTT without a licensing regime in sight. While these
developments are more advanced in the most developed economies of the world, they are
rapidly establishing themselves as global trends and they make many of the old regulations
look outdated, which means they can become obstacles, or in some cases irrelevant,
impossible to apply or enforce.

A good example of innovation is the growing interest in ‘white space’ or ‘TV devices’. These
are transceivers that either use SDR or cognitive radio, or consult a master database, to

                                                                                                 28
detect frequencies that are not being used by others and are available for use to provide
‘white space’ service such as ‘super WiFi’ (also known as White-Fi and as the IEEE
802.22/IEEE 802.11af standard for Wireless Regional Area Network or WRAN). Their name
comes from their use of the unused or ‘white spaces’ between TV channels in the UHF
700MHz frequency band and as and when analogue TV shifts to digital terrestrial TV
broadcasting (DTT) these frequencies become available for re-allocation. However, to make
unlicensed use of these frequencies there needs to be agreement with the regulator and a
set of acceptable standards in place to ensure non-interference with primary users, namely
radio and TV broadcasters.

                                           Box 3.3
                           TV Devices: White Spaces - Super WiFi

IEEE 802.22/802.11af WiFi standards have a wide area range that can provide local
community hotspots offering free Internet access far beyond ordinary WiFi. In addition,
local operators could offer local apps and services but if business revenues are generated a
licensing regime is likely to follow.

In the US, the FCC has already allocated spectrum for white space ‘super WiFI’ services in
the 700MHz “digital dividend” band. Although one way for white space devices to a void
interference with other users of shared spectrum is to scan the frequencies with CR, the
method remains in its early stages and the preference in the US is to license companies to
run databases of users which can be scanned at regular intervals.

As of 2013, trials have been ongoing in Canada, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Japan,
Korea, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Tanzania with some trials
commencing in South America. In South Africa, for example, in Cape Town Google is
collaborating with a number of international wireless vendors and local educational
research bodies to offer Internet access on a trial basis to 10 schools. Using white space
radio devices across 400MHz of fragmented TV spectrum that supports up to 15 broadcast
channels, the school furthest away from the transmitter (6 kilometers) is still able to receive
6Mbps when the signal is uncontested allowing the school for the first time to download
computer programme and anti-virus upgrades. In the highly urbanized environment of Cape
Town, Google is demonstrating the value of its database that instructs white space devices
which frequencies are available without causing interference to TV broadcasting and other
users. (http://gigaom.com/2013/07/03/inside-googles-innovative-african-broadband-trial/)
In the northern and rural province of Limpopo, Microsoft in partnership with the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, the University of Limpopo and a local network contractor,
is demonstrating how WSDs can provide broadband coverage to a population thinly spread
over a wide area. (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/Press/2013/Jul13/07-

Spectrum Markets

The push towards market-oriented solutions is most evident in the use of auctions. Since
the first auction in 1993 in the US they have become a frequently used instrument in the
regulator’s toolkit. However, auctions do not always produce the desired resul ts. This is
sometimes due to the way they are designed and conducted, sometimes to a lack of
investor confidence in the market, and sometimes to the opposite, over-bidding by
investors. General economic conditions play a large part in investor perceptions, and
changes in markets and in coming technologies also have an impact. So just as regulation
impacts upon technological innovation and markets, so they impact upon regulation and, in
this case, one answer is to allow secondary markets to operate which have the advantage of
allowing market conditions rather than regulation determine the most efficient use of the
spectrum. Allowing spectrum trading can be less time consuming and less expensive of
regulatory resources. Also secondary trading markets can be operated as online spectrum
exchanges run by independent third party specialists, subject to regulatory oversight.

                                               Box 3.4
                                         Spectrum Trading

In 1989 New Zealand became the first country to introduce a property rights approach to
spectrum by establishing a management rights regime, mainly for cellular and data line
services. The radio licensing regime remained a ‘command and control’ system but
spectrum mangers were given the right to privately negotiate between themselves trades in
spectrum. The trades had to be centrally registered. In the US, the FCC has been
experimenting with “flexible licences” since the 1990s.

Markets thrive upon liquidity and volume which means spectrum trading has been most
successful in public land mobile networks. Trades can take different forms. They can be
geographical:




         http://spectrumbridge.blogspot.sg/2010/02/new-spectrum-solutions-allowed-by-fccs.html

They can be outright transfers or leases or shared arrangements:




                                                                                                 30
           http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/simplify/statement/statement.pdf

The sharing could be a simultaneous joint use of network resources, for example an MVNO,
or time-sharing:




            http://spectrumbridge.blogspot.sg/2010/02/new-spectrum-solutions-allowed-by-fccs.html

Countries that are encouraging trading include Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US,
Guatemala and El Salvador. All of the EU member states and Norway are required to enable
spectrum trading under the Common Regulatory Framework (CRF). In Asia, Hong Kong is
considering it, and India’s 12th Five-Year Plan (2012-17) also includes a provision for
spectrum trading but there is a debate as to whether the market is mature enough.

Globally, trading has been rather slow to take off. For example, in Australia where trading
has been encouraged, between 1998-2009 on average less than 8% of licences to use
spectrum were traded annually. There are a number of possible reasons. Initial assignments
may have proven relatively efficient, or the incentives to hoard under-used spectrum may
outweigh the gains from selling or leasing it, or possibly the transaction costs of engaging in
secondary markets are be too high or there is insufficient access to information about
spectrum for sale. The need to examine the reasons and look at new ways to facilitate
trading is stated in the FCC’s 2010 National Broadband Plan.37



If spectrum trading is assigned by market forces, then an even more radical approach is
spectrum liberalization or allocation by market forces. Liberalization means an operator who
37
     http://www.broadband.gov/download-plan/ chpt 5, p.15
                                                                                                      31
buys spectrum on a secondary market can change its use, for example, from BWA to digital
TV. This may undermine harmonization of allocation across country borders and disrupt
roaming services. The GSMA defines liberalization in a slightly narrower sense, as applying
when different technologies are used to provide cellular mobile services in different
frequency bands, such as “UMTS or HSPA could be deployed in spectrum bands where
traditionally GSM, CDMA or TDMA has been used.”38 The main issue is radio interference
that may require masking controls over emissions or protection for receivers. This
interpretation of liberalization is virtually equivalent to a technology neutral approach.

In practical terms a hybrid approach is being tried. In the EU a Radio Spectrum Policy
Programme was agreed by the European Parliament in 201239 which requires all Member
States within five years to allocate at least 1200MHz of spectrum to mobile services and to
create harmonized bands within which liberalization in the use of technologies and the
services offered can flourish. So, for example, advanced high-speed Internet mobile services
can be offered in the same bands as first-generation IP mobile network services.

Over time it may well be that intelligent systems using SDR, CR and spectrum hopping
techniques will overcome many of the problems of radio interference and the boundaries of
liberalization will spread across a wider range of bands. For unlicensed spectrum,
liberalization is already a reality since anyone can use the spectrum for any innovative idea
that they come up with. The white spaces example above is a case in point.

3.3.3 Allocation and Assignment
The upcoming challenge facing all telecom regulators is the need to ensure sufficient
spectrum for the exponential growth in demand for BWA services. An important part of the
supply-issue will be to provide BWA to rural and remote areas where the costs of service
provision may not be covered by customer revenues. The first part of the problem will be to
find ways to increase the spectrum available. The second part will be to consider ways in
which more flexible licensing of services to under-served areas can help in meeting demand.

Finding sufficient spectrum is an allocation issue. Following the recommendations of the
WRC is the first step towards providing BWA either as UMTS 3G services or IMTS-Advanced
4G services for two reasons. First, by adopting international and regional spectrum
standards the cost of procuring network equipment and mobile devices is lowered. Second,
it promotes mobile roaming services. The work of the ITU and other regional bodies in
promoting cross-country harmonization of spectrum allocations is referenced in Module 3.3
above.

Finding the spectrum will possibly involve re-farming spectrum from earlier uses. For
example, as 2G mobile services run down so frequencies can be re-allocated to 3G or even
to 4G services. This is what the GSMA refers to as liberalization as discussed in Module 3.3.2.
It may also involve reallocation of spectrum freed up by the digital dividend, also discussed
in Module 3.3.2.

It is also possible to reassign frequencies from under-used to in-demand services. The
regulator can seek ways to encourage public and private entities such as utility companies,
the armed forces and emergency services, government agencies, etc., to yield up some of
their frequencies. One way is by a ‘command and control’ method, but this can be a blunt
instrument leading to disputes over how to audit the efficient use of spectrum. Another way
is to introduce some form of spectrum pricing which may encourage cost savings and the
return of unused frequencies. In the US, the FCC is advancing a third way, which is an
‘incentive auction’ as described in Module 3.3.

the FCC in 2013 is experimenting with a third way which is an ‘incentive auction’ as
described in Module 3.3.

A policy to bridge the digital divide and support universal BWA to people in rural and
remote areas is taking universal access to the next level, a level appropriate to next
generation ICTs. This is where the argument for allocating part of the digital dividend in the
UHF 700MHz band becomes compelling. The propagation qualities of this band are ideally
suited to providing wide-area coverage over more sparsely populated regions of a country.
When accompanied by other measures, such as the liberal use of unlicensed spectrum for
local initiatives such as super WiFi and with licence conditions that encourage the sharing of
infrastructure and of spectrum, a new momentum towards interconnectedness can be
created.

Assignment by Auction

Spectrum auctions are now a well-established part of the regulators’ toolkit. By the end of
2012, the only continent that had not organized an auction was Africa, although Ghana,
Nigeria and South Africa each had plans to do so.40 In South America, auctions have either
taken place, in Chile and Columbia, or are planned for BWA in most countries. In the Asia-
Pacific region, Australia was the first to announce an auction in 1998 and since then more
than 30 auctions have taken place or are planned in at least 9 countries. In Central Asia
auctions have not yet been used. In Eastern and Western Europe the majority of countries
have used auctions and plan to do so in the future.

spectrum-auction-overview.html
                                                                                                     33
Auctions of 2G and UMTS 3G licences were confined to single bands of frequencies but with
IMT-Advanced 4G standards and the growing pressure upon regulators to find additional
bands and to re-farm and reassign existing frequencies, auctions are tending towards multi-
band. 4G operators are also pressurizing for wider bandwidths to be made available as
contiguous blocks, for example 2x25MHz, to cater for the growth of data traffic. A further
complication is the demand for FDD (frequency division duplexing) and TDD (time division
duplexing) in markets where the TD-LTE and WiMax standards are being used such as Brazil,
in much of Asia and the US.

The danger of multi-band auctions is that some carriers may end up with stranded
frequencies. There are different ways to overcome that problem. If a traditional
simultaneous multiple round ascending auction (SMRA) is used, the frequencies can be
arranged into contiguous bandwidths before the bidding begins. In an increasing number of
cases the combinatorial clock auction (CCA) is being used, for example in Austria, Denmark,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK, and as of 2013 Australia, Canada and
Singapore had plans to use it . In the CCA auction one round of bidding determines how
much spectrum is bid for by each contestant, and a final round determines which
contiguous blocks of frequencies match those bids. The regulator makes the final decision
based upon the combination that maximizes the sum of the bids, which may mean that
some blocks do not go to the highest individual bidder as Table 3.1 illustrates.

                                           Table 3.1
                          Hypothetical Combinatorial Clock Auction (CCA)

In this hypothetical case the regulator maximizes value (27) by assigning lot A not to the
highest bidder 1 but to the second highest 2.41

But auctions may not always be appropriate and even where they are they require
resources in terms of expertise to design and conduct the auction. For example, they are not
appropriate for frequencies that are to be assigned to emergency services or essential
government functions. Their outcomes are subject to many variables, including the current
state of investor confidence in the economy, and unless spectrum caps are introduced or
spectrum set aside for new entrants, the bidding can be dominated by powerful incumbents
who may be motivated in part by hoarding. If excessive prices are bid and if subsequent

                                                                                                      34
competition in the market is not sufficiently strong higher prices can hurt consumers, either
through higher tariffs or by lack of investment in infrastructure.

In theory spectrum trading should be able to correct any incorrect valuations that were bid
in the auction, but trading has its own problems to resolve as seen in Module 3.3.2. In some
cases, for example in Singapore, the regulator stipulates that trading will not be allowed
until the bidders have met their performance targets, such as network coverage. This is to
prevent speculative bidding for spectrum that the bidder has no intention of using but
wants to resell later at a higher price.

As a general rule, auctions have an important part to play if the aim of policy is to ensure
transparency in the assignment of frequencies to competitive companies and to achieve an
efficient use of spectrum. But the resources required by the regulator to ensure that the
auction itself is efficient are often in scarce supply. An easier way to ensure competitive
bidding is through a ‘beauty contest’ which can require bidders to state their non -monetary
targets such as coverage, quality and scope of services, but this does less to guarantee
efficiency and may end up as a windfall for the chosen winners. The simplest procedure is
through administrative assignments, which are low cost and fast but also least transparent
and still leave open to dispute what the price of spectrum should be. There are therefore
two parameters to consider. The first is efficient spectrum pricing which is where the market
is important. The second, which is the most important of all for the industry and consumers,
is competition. Getting the second one right will tend to correct over time any mistakes
made in the first one.

3.3.4 Licence Renewal
Although granting licences in perpetuity is not unknown, most spectrum licences have a
finite life, typically around 15 years in the case of mobile cellular licences. Many of the
original 900MHz 2G cellular licences issued in the 1990s either have or are coming up for
renewal, and the same will soon apply to many 1800MHz UMTS 3G licences and some in
2.1GHz. Commercial sector broadcast spectrum licences are another category where the
issue of renewal often has substantial implications for investment, although whereas most
of the investment in telecoms is in the network most of the investment in broadcasting is in
the production and purchase of content.

A number of important issues surround the question of how to renew licences. Where the
performance of an MNO has proved satisfactory there is a strong case to renew. One
indicator will be the number of subscribers on the network who will be inconvenienced if
they have to change their operator, their billing details and their telephone numbers. As an
MNO upgrades from 2G to variants of 3G and then on to 4G, substantial investments are put
at risk, and uncertainty over renewal can remove the incentive to put in more money.
Legally, if the original licences stipulated that there was no guarantee of automatic renewal
                                                                                           35
the regulator is probably safeguarded against appeals to the courts, but legal challenges
have become part of the process. In the face of objections from incumbents, the regulator
does have a legitimate responsibility to ensure a competitive market and to ensure that
additional efficiencies are squeezed out of existing spectrum use and automatic renewal
may not be consistent with that aim.

In many cases, for example in the US, there is a “renewal expectancy” for cellular licences
subject to the fulfillment of certain targets.42 Portugal and the UK have gone for renewal
and it is the presumption in Canada. In Australia the regulator has taken the opposite view
that all renewable spectrum will be auctioned. In Germany and France renewal has also
been assured, but with the regulators taking back some of the spectrum for administrative
reassignment to allow for new entrants and further competition. The Netherlands regulator
extended the period for renewal by a few years and then committed the frequencies to
auction with spectrum caps imposed to allow for new entrants. Under the EU’s Commo n
Regulatory Framework (CRF) and its recent Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP) NRAs
are required to include competition policy in their policy decisions, which means NRAs must
at least consider the option of reassigning spectrum to new entrants, although not
necessarily by auction. In New Zealand MNOs were given the opportunity to renew some of
the spectrum if they agreed the regulator’s new administered incentive pricing (AIP) and if
not all the spectrum would go to auction.

                                             Box 3.5
                                 Administered Incentive Pricing

Charging for unauctioned spectrum needs to use a form of ‘shadow pricing’ to mimic the
market if it isn’t to be completely arbitrary. The ideal way is to find a measure of what price
the spectrum would be worth in the next most profitable employment, known as the
‘opportunity cost’. If the AIP is significantly below that level then the incentive to use the
spectrum more efficiently will be weak. One method is the Optimum Deprival Value (ODV)
or ‘least cost alternative’ model which answers the question: if the present asset was
removed what is the least cost system that could provide current level of service?
Alternatively, if the MNO were denied the additional spectrum, what would be the
additional cost of squeezing out the additional level of service from the existing spectrum or
of adding more base stations? By awarding the additional spectrum these extra costs are
avoided and therefore represent the value of the additional spectrum.

The Best Alternative Use (BAU) method measures the value other users will place upon the
spectrum based upon a modeling of their likely costs and revenues. Used in combination,
BAU can be used to set the price within a lower and upper range approximated by ODV.

The Hong Kong regulator adopted a hybrid approach in 2013 by offering to renew some of
the spectrum and auction the rest with additional spectrum for new entrants, although this
was hotly contested by the incumbents. As in Ireland and some other jurisdictions, Hong
Kong also regularly imposes performance bonds when issuing new licences, related to
geographical coverage within a specified timeframe, usually up to 3 years.

When mergers and acquisitions (M&A) take place, if the regulator fears that competition
will be reduced it is common practice to impose conditions such as surrendering some of
the spectrum of one of the operators involved. This happens in the EU and in North America.
Another method of encouraging competition is to encourage the merged operators to allow
MNVOs into the market, although this is usually not specified in the conditions of the licence.

3.3.5 Unlicensed Spectrum and a Spectrum Commons
The rapid changes overtaking broadband wireless services affect both licensed and
unlicensed spectrum, and a key component of this is the phenomenal rise in M2M
communications. Until the Internet-of-things, unlicensed spectrum applications were mostly
associated with microwave ovens, radio car keys, Bluetooth connections and various
industrial uses. Now the Internet-of-things connects potentially all devices and has given rise
to the concept of ‘smart’ as in smart cities, smartphones, smart networks, smartcards in
devices, etc. What is smart? In this context it refers to the use of algorithmic-driven
software applications, such as sensors and alarm systems that automatically connect alerts
to command centres, electricity meters that automatically monitor and regulate
consumption, vehicles that can be tracked-and-traced through GPS systems, public bus
stops that are connected to oncoming buses to inform waiting passengers of times and
routes, home appliances that can be switched on and off remotely. Some forecasts suggest
cellular M2M connections may reach 300 million people? by 2015.43

In most cases these applications are used by businesses and utilities as a means of delivering
a service and cutting costs and not to generate a revenue, and as such they are usually not
subject to a licence. They may, however, require to be registered on a database of users if
there is any likelihood of radio interference, excessive power emission or a sharing of
spectrum with other users. This arises especially in the case of the white space/TV devices
as discussed in Module 3.3.2

Spectrum Commons

Unlicensed spectrum implies spectrum sharing among users. For short range devices this
will not normally cause interference, but advocates of a spectrum commons argue that it is
entirely possible to open up swathes of spectrum for common usage and manage the issues
of interference and emission levels collectively. This view is the opposite of the view that all
spectrum should be sold to property rights owners who can then own or trade spectrum as
they do land according to market principles. There has been an extensive debate, especially
in the US, as to what conditions may be required to make a public commons approach
manageable in the future.

                                                 Box 3.6
                                     Public Commons Conditions

Two diametrically opposed approaches to the spectrum management are the property
rights or exclusive licence approach and the public commons approach. 44 They both stand in
opposition to the traditional approach of ‘command and control’, but in practice most
regulators use all three approaches for different parts of the spectrum. A paper in 2005 by
William Lehr (MIT, USA) and Jon Crowcroft (Cambridge, UK) set out the following conditions
that might be necessary to make the commons approach manageable:45

* No transmit-only devices – a receiver function provides a control loop
* Power restrictions
* Common channel signaling (and/or use of single out-of-band signaling channel)
* Congestion rules
* Rule enforcement mechanism
* Rules consistent with security and privacy

In contrast to the property rights approach, which is governed by market principles such as
secondary trading, the commons approach needs to be governed by protocols or an
etiquette. If the protocol fails this gives rise to selfish behaviour and an inefficient use of
spectrum or what has been called the ‘Tragedy of the Commons’. Advocates of the
commons approach point to the emergence of new technologies such as UWB, spread
spectrum techniques, mesh networks, smart antennae, MIMO, CR and SDR which offer
intelligent networking (including ‘ad hoc’ and PAN networks) and dynamic frequency

   Two names that are famously associated with these opposing approaches are economist, the late Ronald H.
Coase (University of Chicago) who advocated property-rights and Lawrence Lessig (Harvard University) who
advocates a spectrum commons. See Coase (1959) ‘The Federal Communications Commission’ Journal of
Literature and Economics, and Lessig (2001) The Future of Ideas: http://www.the-future-of-

selection, and suggest that regulation could be ultimately distilled down to a minimum of
certifying the conformity of equipment standards. Writing from the property rights
perspective, a paper in 2007 by Jerry Brito (George Mason University, US) on the contrary
reiterates the views of Ronald Coase that because the regulator has no direct knowledge of
market costs and revenues there will be no incentive for the regulator to provide the same
level of rule-making and rule-enforcement that private owners would undertake between
themselves.46

Regulators need practical approaches that are suitable for different bands of spectrum.
What is important is that regulators are fully conversant with the options that are available
to them.



Unlicensed Spectrum for Underserved Areas

Besides the issues of interference and spectrum sharing, unlicensed spectrum has a role to
play in addressing the issue of universal access in sparsely populated areas. There is often
little commercial incentive for MNOs and ISPs to provide services to these areas, yet there
may be community groups, NGOs, local enthusiasts and village entrepreneurs more than
willing to put time, money and energy into building local networks based upon white space
and other technologies. Licensing spectrum at a price may kill off these initiatives. This is
another example of where regulation needs to be flexible to achieve the objectives of
innovation in access and in services.

3.3.6 Re-farming and the Digital Dividend
As the previous Modules have stressed, regulators today are facing the challenges of finding
new spectrum from old uses. For BWA this is assisted in part by the expiry of many 2G
licences issued in the 1990s, but if these networks still service many subscribers then the
opportunity to refarm the spectrum is limited. One answer to this problem has been to set
trigger points, so when 2G users fall below certain numbers part of the spectrum becomes
available for refarming. The refarming in this context will usually imply the incumbent is
allowed to migrate users to a UMTS standard and does not imply a reassignment of the
spectrum to another MNO.

By far the biggest opportunity for regulators, what has been called a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity is the digital dividend as reviewed in Module 3.3.2. In some cases as much as
150MHz or over could be available for reassignment as analogue TV switches off and digital
TV switches on, but the transition period may take a decade to complete. The biggest hurdle

is the percentage of the population who are unable to change their TV sets to digital. Many
families may not be able to afford the cost which means government has to make a decision
whether to subsidize lower income groups and possibly provide assistance to broadcasters
to switch over their transmission equipment. The cost of doing this would need to be
weighed in the balance against the gains from auctioning swathes of 700MHz of frequencies.

      Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World

3.4 IP-based Interconnection
Interconnection for Internet traffic over IP networks operates according to a different set of
rules from telephony. However an increasing proportion of telephone traffic is carried over
IP-enabled carrier networks. There are now many different operators offering network
capacity to send, transit and terminate traffic, ranging from traditional telecom carriers to
third party vendors, from Internet Access Providers (retail) to Internet Backbone Access
(wholesale) carriers, from content distribution networks (CDNs) to utilities with spare
capacity to wholesale. The commercial terms and ways in which interconnection is offered
varies considerable. For example, carriers traditionally interconnect at network Points of
Interconnection (POIs) whereas CDNs and cloud computing service companies interconnect
in data centres, and Internet Access Providers at Internet Exchanges. Nevertheless, despite
its origins and the fact that Internet traffic was never subject to the same regulatory regime
as telecoms, certain common practices have emerged.

From its beginnings telecoms was a state-regulated industry, often part of a Post &
Telecoms Department, later to be incorporated as a state-owned telecom enterprise (SOTE).
Interconnection at the international level was mandated, and under ITU guidelines an
accounting rate and a settlement rate system between international carriers was
established. With market liberalization came competing networks and the need for
interconnection. Often regulators required the incumbent to register a ROI (Reference
Interconnection Offer) to ensure equal treatment among carriers. No such system has ever
existed for Internet traffic.

University research funding from the US Department of Defence in the 1950s and 1960s and
early trials by universities to establish a network of peering devices using IP/TCP protocol
matured in the 1980s and 1990s into the first commercial services by Internet companies.
These early developments connected computer networks. These were later connected
indirectly using capacity from carriers to transit traffic between IT devices such as
computers and terminals. As Internet services, for example e-mail, became mass market
products for business users and residential customers, access was increasingly over telecom
systems. The spread of the World Wide Web in the 1990s created a platform for the
exchange of documents and then for the development of down-loadable and up-loadable
content and applications.

The Internet had become big business, posing ever growing demands for network capacity
on the telecom industry. This posed both a threat and an opportunity for carriers, and most
of the dominant ISPs that emerged from the competition were subsidiaries of the carriers.
Often by charging high wholesale prices to all ISPs, telecom companies could squeeze the
                                                                                            41
profit margins of independent ISPs without breaking any equal access regulations. The
market power of the carriers lies in their ownership of the backbone networks over which IP
packets have to travel irrespective of the route they take, and although the use of least-cost
routing will save some money, that only works if there is a competitive wholesale market.

ICAIS (International Charging Arrangements for Internet Services)

It is slightly ironic that the big dispute over IP interconnection that arose in the 1990s, and
which still echoes to this day, for example, it resurfaced at the 2012 ITU WCIT-12 in Dubai,
was not between ISPs and telecom companies as such but largely between the telecom
companies that own most of the ISPs. Overlaying the dispute was the fact that the Internet
originated in the USA. In 1995, the US government decommissioned the US National Science
Foundation Network (NSFNET) which had been the backbone for most IP traffic in the US
and handed over interconnection to four Network Access Points (NAPs). Since then other
entities have arisen, some serving academia as education and research networks, others
commercial networks including specialist Internet Backbone Access providers. Academia
peering arrangements are not difficult to agree, but for commercial service providers
peering arrangements are all about market power. The basic rule is that smaller ISPs either
cannot peer with larger ISPs in which case they have to find ways to aggregate their traffic
to reach critical mass, or reach special agreements with carriers, or pay premium rates for
interconnection.

Internationally the same rules apply, but the larger ISPs have for historical reasons been in
the USA, and later to a lesser extent in Europe. There is no accounting rate or settlement
rate procedure for ISPs and the de facto position is that the major US carriers have always
been free to charge the full cost of the international links to ISPs outside the US. In the
1990s there were intense arguments between carriers and even between states over this
apparent inequality. For example, in 2000 Telstra’s Managing Director of Global Wholesale
Business claimed that up to “70% of an Australian ISP’s costs are due to the international
segment to the US.” 47 In reality the issue is an old one: regulated rates versus market rates.

The way markets work is that imbalances between supply and demand will be reflected in
prices, and high prices should act as an incentive to remove the supply bottlenecks. In this
case the bottleneck was outside the USA where domestic IP traffic, in the absence of a local
Internet Exchange Point (IXP), had no option but to route through the US. To justify the
expense of a local IXP there needs be a critical volume of IP traffic. All markets thrive on
liquidity, and in this case the liquidity in the Internet market means traffic volume. Unless
there are structural impediments to the growth of local Internet traffic, such as a monopoly
provider, the market mechanism should result in more local IXPs. This should result in more
balanced flows of international traffic which in turn should allow more ISPs to enter into

peering arrangements with their US and European corresponding networks. The spread of
IXPs seems to be exactly what is happening as explored in section 3.4.1.

3.4.1 Internet Interconnection and IXPs in Developing Countries
To be cost-effective, interconnection between circuit-switched TDM (Time-Division
Multiplexing) telecom networks requires points of interconnection (POI) that minimise route
distances. For price arbitrage reasons service providers may choose a more round-about
routing of traffic, but technically the more direct the routing the more efficient it is and the
less latency involved. In a packet-switched world of Internet Protocol (IP), a different set of
principles operate. Because different packets of the same transmission are routed over
different networks there is no single POI. ISPs do not always own their own networks and
there is no guarantee of the quality of the networks over which the packets will route. So
unless the network was ‘managed’ and its quality assured, Internet traffic from its earliest
days was only ‘best effort’. Investment in broadband in recent years means network quality
has generally improved and with more sophisticated routing algorithms ‘best effort’ is now
often of very high quality. For example, over-the-top (OTT) voice and video services like
Skype and Yahoo Messenger, Facebook and Google that are transmitted internationally over
broadband networks can be crystal clear with minimal latency. In addition, a range of
specialist managed Internet networks have arisen such as CDNs that guarantee quality of
delivery.

ISPs come in three tiers: Tier One ISPs are usually affiliated with a licensed carrier having
direct access to an international network, although some of the larger Internet-based
companies have begun to build their own networks. For example, Google is ranked third in
the carriage of global traffic behind Level 3 and Global Crossing. Tier Two ISPs own or have
direct access to local networks and may serve a regional market but require IP transit for
international routing. Tier Three carriers have to lease lines and peer with larger ISPs, in
some cases as paid peering, to achieve end-to-end delivery of traffic or IP transit. The larger
ISPs also provide the connecting networks for IP transit which are known as Autonomous
Systems (AS) and are assigned an Autonomous System Number (ASN). The ASN identifies
them as using the appropriate routing protocol for IP transit traffic, also known as the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). When using IP transit, ISPs provide and receive from each
other routings to facilitate traffic to and from the customers of the ISPs involved.

Unless the ISP is affiliated to a licenced carrier there is no guarantee of interconnection.
Large carriers such as incumbents may reject interconnection with smaller providers for
commercial reasons, not technical or regulatory reasons. Alternatively they may impose
draconian interconnection charges or high prices for leased lines resulting in profits squeeze
of independent ISPs. The lack of domestic interconnection forces ISPs to route their
domestic traffic through Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) or to pay for peering to send traffic
overseas. Their traffic becomes transit IP traffic which they have to ‘trombone’, that is send
                                                                                             43
over several different networks before it reaches its destination. Naturally, this adds to its
cost and to the latency problem.

In the 1990s, IXPs were typically in the US and it is still the case that many countries route
much of their domestic traffic through the US. According to Packet Clearing House (PCH), as
of May 2013, about half of the world’s 199 countries are without IXPs’48 By contrast, only
four European countries are without IXPs, while in Asia Pacific the countries without IXPs
are largely Pacific Islands. Most South American countries have IXPs, but there are fewer in
Central America and the Caribbean islands. “At present only the British Virgin Islands, Haiti,
Grenada, St Maarten, Curacao and Dominica have IXPs. In conjunction with the Caribbean
Telecommunications Union, PCH is currently assisting several other Caribbean countries,
including Barbados, Jamaica and St Kitts and Nevis in establishing local IXPs.” (See Toolkit
Broadband in St Kitts and Nevis: Case Study. ) Mexico is the only OECD member country not
to have an IXP.49 In Africa there are upwards of 20 or more countries with IXPs, but most are
small and serve only very localized markets.50 According to one source, 85% of Africa’s

major hub, but at least 16 East African and Southern African countries also use the KIXP in
Kenya. (See Box 3.7 and also the Toolkit Broadband in Kenya Case Study.) One report also
suggests that Nigeria’s IXPN is preparing to provide peering for West African countries. 52 In
North Africa and the Middle East, Egypt has three IXPs in Cairo, and others countries with
IXPs include Lebanon, Israel, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and a state-run IXP in Saudi
Arabia. However, the region remains under-served as does Central Asia where, as of the first
half of 2013, only Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Uzbekistan had established IXPs.53

                                     The Success of IXPs in Kenya

Kenya has two IXPs: the first , known as Kenya IXP (KIXP), opened in Nairobi in 2000 and the
second in Mombasa in 2010. They were set up with the assistance aid from CISCO and
UNESCO, and are operated by the Telecommunications Service Providers Association of
Kenya (TESPOK) which is a non-profit organization representing ISPs and telecom service
providers.54 KIXP operates a Multi-Lateral Peering Agreement (MLPA) whereby ISPs are
required to interconnect free of charge, but each pays a usage fee to KIXP.

The success of these IXPs is in evidence from a number of measures. By April 2013,
membership of KIXP had reached 30, up from 25 in April 2012 and included the mobile and
fixed line operators, an educational network called KENET, the National Bank of Kenya, and
government agencies such as the Kenyan Revenue Authority (KRA). Aggregate traffic
throughput has jumped from 64kbit/s at opening in 2000 to over 1Gbit/s today. One
estimate of the cost savings to Kenyan ISPs from not having to pay the cost of international
transit and trombone is $1.44 million per year.55 ISPs from other African countries are
starting to use Kenya’s IXPs; 56% of the ASNs routed through KIXP in the six months to
January 2012 were from 16 foreign countries.

Cache and the Digital Economy

The most important step up in usage came after the installation of a Google Global Cache
(GGC) in April 2011. Traffic volumes rose more than ten-fold within the year, the lion’s

portion of it was streamed video, for example from YouTube, as latency dropped by 20% on
top of the initial fall in latency when the KIXP was first opened from 1,200-2,000
milliseconds (via satellite) to 60-80 milliseconds. 56 The caching capability builds a
foundation for local content generation and distribution at affordable prices. Improved
latency also bolsters the IXPs capability to become the driver of growth in cloud computing
in Kenya.

Conditions for Success

Despite the success of KIPX, it almost faltered in 2000 when it had to close business pending
a decision by the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK) to grant a licence to operate
a telecommunication service. This followed a complaint by Telkom Kenya that its monopoly
over international traffic was being violated.57 KIPX argued it only directly handled domestic
traffic (see the Toolkit Kenya Case Study) and the decision to grant a licence has served
Kenya well.



3.4.2 The Economics of IXPs and Wholesale Charging
Having to trombone traffic adds to cost and to latency, from between 200 to 900
milliseconds in the case of African ISPs.58 In the early years the cost factor was the most
important consideration for two reasons. Firstly, the cost of international circuits was high
and US carriers in particular required overseas ISPs to pay for the full cost of the circuits. By
contrast, among carriers transmitting telecom traffic, including packet data such as frame
relay, the ITU-approved accounting rate system was used in splitting the costs 50:50
between transmitting and receiving carriers. The settlement rate system could vary the split
ratio in certain cases; for example the split between Hong Kong and Mainland China before
Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 favoured the Mainland. However,
Internet traffic never became part of the accounting rate system, and in the US for
regulatory purposes the Internet was defined as an information service rather than a
telecommunications service.

The second reason is that in the early years the main Internet service was email for which
latency is less of a problem. By contrast, a service such as search is highly sensitive to delays.
A study in 2009 found that a two second delay on Microsoft’s Bing search engine caused the

number of queries to drop by 1.8% and revenue by 4.3%, and a 400 millisecond slowdown
caused a fall of 0.59% of queries through Google.59

Since the collapse of the dot.com bubble in 2000, international circuit costs in submarine
cables have dropped to a fraction of their former price, a trend that was reinforced as cable
capacity soared following the recovery in financial markets in the mid-2000s. The trend was
uneven. In some regions both cable capacity and satellite services remain limited and costs
relatively high, such as in the Pacific Islands; in other regions the changes are more recent,
as in Africa where new cables are now coming online.60 Reduced international prices have
had a major impact upon the cost of Internet traffic. An OECD assessment of the voice-
equivalent cost of Internet transit traffic in 2013 is “USD 0.0000008 per minute – five orders
of magnitude lower than typical voice rates.”61 However, as the report also points out, local
access charges levied by telecom companies consistently seem to account for between 30%-
40% of total international transit costs.62

At the same time, Internet businesses have undergone a complete transformation to create
a digital economy, everything from search to e-commerce, from social media to e-
Government, from online video content to online gaming. In 2011, it was estimated that the
Internet-based digital economy contributed 3-4% GDP to the G-8 nations plus Brazil,
China, India, South Korea and Sweden.63

If a flourishing local Internet can generate so much local economic activity and contribute so
much to social welfare, for policy-makers and regulators these statistics are just too
important to be ignored. The danger is that smaller ISPs can be easily hindered from
reinvesting in their business due to high wholesale prices and profits squeeze and the local
Internet economy will suffer. There may be a need for regulatory intervention if wholesale
charges are clearly discriminatory against ISPs not affiliated to the telco. However, this can
be a difficult policy to pursue because a telco may also squeeze its own ISP so that
downstream margins are sacrificed to maintain upstream margins and market dominance.
In fact most IXPs have not come about through regulatory intervention but by voluntarily
market agreements.

In some cases the state itself establishes an IXP, which can be motivated by the need to
address market failure, but the motives could be more political. Much more often IXPs are
established either as non-profit entities, sometimes by universities or NGOs or associations
of ISPs, or as commercial businesses. Most IXPs in the US are commercial, most in Europe,
Latin America and Africa are non-profit and there is more of a mix in Asia. For example
most commercial IXPs are in Australia, China (including Hong Kong), Japan and Singapore
and non-profit IXPs are mostly in India, Nepal and the Philippines.

The commercial IXPs usually co-locate ISPs in data centres, with various charging schemes
including charging for ports or capacity usage, rack space, connection fees and/or a range of
management and security services. They can be carrier-related or carrier-neutral, co-
location neutral or ISP-specific. The non-profit IXPs are usually dedicated operations which
only charge cost-recovery fees and facilitate peering between members, likely to be at no
charge between ISPs, although in some cases it can be paid peering if the balance of traffic
is too one-sided. A study by the OECD covering 86% of the world’s Internet carriers in 96
countries found that 99.51% of peering agreements were made by “handshake”. 64 Peering
arrangements can be single-hop, bilateral or multilateral, and occasionally the latter can be
a condition of joining an IXP, as it is to join Kenya’s KIXP or in Chile where peering is
mandatory.65

What is common to all of these arrangements is that, even where peering is mandatory, the
terms and conditions are not. Regulators have seen the advantages in leaving developments
to voluntary agreements between ISPs and other parts of the Internet ecosystem such as
CDNs, major content producers, Internet search and social media companies, OTT service
providers, etc. The over-riding reason why this has been the right way to do things is
because these are all fast-moving and rapidly developing businesses with a need to innovate
and experiment with what works best for them. Regulation that addresses market failure
might justify mandatory peering if there is a real fear that the ISP attached to the incumbent
can prevent new entrants from entering the market. There is little evidence to suggest that
discrimination is sustainable as substitutes emerge for network connectivity and Internet
access and for the delivery of apps and content. These substitutes include mobile networks,
satellite networks, CDNs, WiFi networks, IP ‘connected’ TVs, etc. In a developing country
where these substitutes may still be in a nascent stage, market failure could be a barrier to
growth in the digital economy; the work-around market failure is to reform regulations to
facilitate new entrants into the Internet ecosystem.

3.4.3 Future Charging Arrangements and Developments of IXPs
When Internet companies such as Yahoo! and Google and major content distribution
networks (CDNs) such as Akamai, Amazon and Limelight invest in a local server to cache
content from overseas the stimulus to the local IXPs is immediate.66 This is especially
significant for developing countries where international connectivity remains a problem,
because a cache connected to an IXP reduces latency and thereby encourages local demand
and usage. In the example from Kenya (see Box 3.7) following the installation of a Google
Global Cache in April 2011 traffic at the KIXP rose from just over 100 Megabits every second
to well over 1 Gigabits every second in just over two months, most of this accounted for by
YouTube downloads.67 This in turn can create a market and act as a stimulus to local
developers of apps for entertainment and for practical use, such as financial and locational
apps for use on mobile phones, and to producers of content. In this way a digital economy
gets built up.

As the digital economy grows, so will the number and type of parties connecting to IXPs. In
Europe between 2008 and 2010 the percentage of connections to IXPs from content
providers increased from 85% to 96.3%, by VoIP providers from 36.8% to 48.1%, by
enterprises such as airlines and banks from 30% to 46.2%, by search engines from 25% to
48% and by governments from 50% to 77.8%.68 For developing countries, these are trends
to take note of as IXPs have an important role in triggering and accelerating the local digital
economy.

P2P, OTT and Cloud

While peering or P2P delivery of Internet traffic was the major growth trend of the late
1990s, it has been overtaken by direct download of apps and video content which comes
OTT of the fixed and public land mobile networks (PLMNS). A particularly important part of
this development is the growing use of cloud computing. Many email servers, for example,
are now based in the cloud where emails are stored and retrieved by users instead of being
downloaded and stored in computer hard drives. Cloud computing has given rise to a whole
new generation of cloud-based services, such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-
Service (PaaS), Application-as-a-Service (AaaS) and even Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
Specialist cloud service providers have joined CDNs, content creators, application service
providers and others in locating in an ever increasing numbers of data centres and countries

66
   A study by Atlas Internet Observatory in 2009 found that the top five ‘pure play’ CDNs accounted for nearly
10% of Internet traffic – see Labovitz, et al, Atlas Internet Observatory, 2009 Annual Report p.15 at

broadband infrastructures and appropriate personal privacy and data protection laws in
place to safeguard the international transfer of commercially sensitive data between
jurisdictions have a competitive advantage.

Charging in an NGN Internet World

More of all of these services are being accessed by mobile wireless devices such as
smartphones and tablet computers over PLMNS and WiFi networks. These trends have
important implications for the business models of the traditional telecom providers; their
pricing models in particular are being redesigned. The idea of charging by-the-second or by-
the-minute of usage does not work in an Internet world. Charging by capacity makes more
sense and as voice traffic declines as a revenue earner, and as OTT substitutes such as social
media chat services and texting become ever more popular, telecom companies are moving
towards bundled voice and data services. Bundles are frequently offered at flat rate charges,
sometimes with tiered flat rates: each tier with its own capacity ceiling.

The old model of charging termination fees to networks for the delivery of their traffic also
comes into question in an Internet environment, for two reasons. First, because there are
now many ways for users to access the Internet. Second, as networks upgrade to
broadband, telecom companies may be tempted to charge both sides of the market—the
providers of services over the Internet and the users—in what is called a ‘two-sided market’.
This goes the nub of the net neutrality issue. (See Module 3.7)

In practice most carriers, fixed line and mobile wireless, will make the transition cautiously,
not wanting to cannibalise their existing lines of business, such as call services, too early as
long as they continue to generate revenues. But as they invest more in all-IP NGNs their
billing arrangements are likely to come closer to the charging mechanisms between ISPs,
which are mostly Sender-Keeps-All (SKA) – also called Bill-and-Keep (BAK). Where
interconnection charges are levied, for example where the balance of traffic is very uneven,
it is likely to be capacity-based charging as the marginal costs of sending a packet are very
close to zero.

       Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World

3.5 Regulation versus investment debate
There are at least two reasons why regulators and policy makers are concerned about the
source of investment necessary for broadband: universal access is needed to close the
digital divide, and broadband is crucial to a digital economy. These two concepts combine
into the over-arching concept of inclusive economic and social growth.

There are four primary sources of investment funds. First, network investment by the
incumbents; second, by new entrants including domestic and foreign service providers; third,
public funding; and fourth, by financial investors using leveraged buyouts of poorly
performing companies by venture capitalists. It is usual to view telecoms markets according
to geographical segments, namely the local loop, the metropolitan area, national long
distance and international. But a service-based typology might instead look at ‘basic’ fixed
and mobile voice and text-related services, broadband and Internet related services,
content and broadcast services such as IPTV, and enterprise managed network services.

                                                  Box 3.8
                                          Broadband in Japan

During the time when Japan was working towards achieving its national target of eliminating
all broadband zero areas (= make broadband service available to all the households
nationwide) by the end of FY2010 (March 2011),69 the five types of role-sharing between
private and public sectors were identified, based on builders and operators of broadband
facilities.

Type 1: Broadband facility is built and operated by the private sector. Since broadband
should be deployed on a commercial basis in principle, this type 1 is the correct basic model.

Type 2: This type 2 is the same as type 1 in that both building and operation are conducted
by the private sector. There may be some areas where the operator is not sure if there exits
enough demand and thus cannot make the business decision to start broadband service in
the area. In this situation, neighborhood communities or local governments can prepare a
list of potential broadband service subscribers and hand this over to the operator.




69
  The national target was set in both (1) the New IT Reform Strategy, which was formed 2006 by IT Strategic
Headquarters (headed by the Prime Minister) and (2) the Digital Divide Elimination Strategy, which was
formed in 2008 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.


                                                                                                              51
Type 3: This type 3 is also the same as type 1 in that both building and operation are
conducted by the private sector. However, central or local government partially subsidizes
the broadband facilities installation cost and this makes much easier for the operator to
start broadband service.

Type 4: Local government builds broadband facilities, then a telecommunications operator
provides broadband service. This means that the operator does not have to prepare initial
investment of broadband facility. In many cases, local government rents the facilities to the
operator on IRU contract (see page 51). Under the typical IRU, the operator can use the
facility for 10 years for free of charge, but it has to provide the service for the period and
maintain the facility at its expense.

Type 5: Local government builds broadband facilities and operates them.

In order to eliminate Broadband Zero Areas, Type 3 and Type 4 were important and the
Government of Japan prepared several promotion schemes, which included
grants/subsidies for local governments and interest aid, debt guarantees and tax breaks for
telecom operators.

3.5.1 Local, National and international Networks
The Local Loop

The major costs of building an extension to the traditional local loop arise less from the cost
of the equipment and more from having to seek planning permission and the labour costs of
road digging, ducting, wiring and cabling, installing distribution cabinets outside buildings
and main distribution frames (MDFs) in the telecom rooms of multi-tenanted buildings. The
local loop is therefore not easy to replicate using traditional methods, and for this reason
regulators should examine ways to reduce the costs. Measures can include infrastructure
sharing, simplify the procedures and lower the cost of issuing of permissions, review
regulations governing rights of way and access to buildings.

Over recent years, subscribers have been signing up in larger numbers to networks using
broadband wireless known as fixed-wireless access (FWA) for the house and office
telephone. FWA offers a means for non-fixed line service providers to enter the local market.
Another technology standard that has been used in some markets, Indonesia and Malaysia
for example, to provide fixed-wireless broadband access is WiMax.

The most compelling competition for local loop providers has come from mobile network
operators (MNOs) and the rapid deployment of 2.5G and 3G networks has spread
broadband wireless access (BWA) to many metropolitan, smaller urban areas and many
rural areas in most countries. As a result, in the world today there are many more mobile
users than fixed line subscribers. This has changed the local landscape for regulation. When
the fixed line phone was of paramount importance, regulators were faced with a choice of
either supporting the continuation of a monopoly by the incumbent operator or unbundling
the local loop. Unbundling was incorporated into the laws and regulations of the US, most of
Europe, Australia and India among others. It is done by mandating the right of a new entrant
to connect to the incumbent’s local access network at one of three places: at the roadside
distribution point or MDF, on the customer-side of the MDF in the incumbent’s exchange
building or central office, or on the network-side of the MDF. The last of these three is called
co-location and minimizes the need for the new entrant to build their own local access
network.

Unbundling is always a hotly contested issue because unlike other forms of interconnection,
it involves the incumbent surrendering the use of its own lines to a competitor. There is less
controversy when the facility to be unbundled is an essential ‘unbundled network element’
(UNE)70 such as a bottleneck facility or an essential service, such as a numbers registry. The

70
     Defined in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 of the USA

                                                                                             53
advantage of local loop unbundling is that it gives the new entrant an immediate footing in
the market, but achieving long-term competition on a sustainable basis may require the
new entrant to invest in their own network. One way to encourage this is to place a sunset
clause on unbundling after which local loop interconnection becomes unregulated and
subject to commercial agreement. This was done successfully in Hong Kong.

Figure 3.7 illustrates pre-NGN architectural and commercial options for local loop
unbundling. The first horizontal illustration shows a circuit from the customer to a
subscriber line unit (SLU) which identifies the call as either voice or data, routing the first
through the switched network and the latter to an Internet service provider (ISP1, ISP2 or
ISP3 in the Figure) and out into the public Internet, or possibly via ISP3 to a private Intranet.
In the second scenario, the new entrant has collocated their digital subscriber line access
modem (DSLAM) and the call from the customer now transverses a splitter (S) which routes
voice traffic to the old switch and data traffic to the digital ATM switch of either the
incumbent (ATM 1) or the new entrant (ATM 2) according to the customer’s preferences.
From the ATM data is passed to an ISP and then to the Internet or to an Intranet.




                                                                                               54

                                   Local Loop Unbundling Options




In the third scenario, the new entrant interconnects at or near the customer’s premises. In
the figure it is assumed that voice traffic will still transit by way of the incumbent, but this
need not be the case. Scenario 3 requires the new entrant to build a network out towards
the edge of the local service area, so its total investment will be higher, but it becomes less
dependent upon the incumbent carrier for the quality of network services.

In the case of NGN networks unbundling, where this has arisen, poses a different set of
issues .71 In part this is because the architecture is very different. An NGN uses an
architecture of a dual fibre backbone ring, for example Metro-Ethernet, for broadband
transmission of high speed data, and sub-loops of fibre to serve local buildings, running the
fibre-to-the-Curb (FTTC) or fibre-to-the-building (FTTB). This does away with the need for
many exchange buildings or central offices, while digital switches are replaced by Gigabit
routers located at strategic nodes around the core network. Subscriber line electronics
which identify the individual needs and preferences of subscribers, such as their choice of
bandwidths and services such as IPTV, are moved to the edge of the network closer to end

71
  For example, in the UK one study has found that unbundling the broadband local loop does not increase
penetration rates but rather increases the quality of service. See Mattia Nardotto, Tommaso Valletti and
Franck Verhoven (2102) ‘ Unbundling the incumbent: Evidence from UK broadband’
http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/public/ndbad83/frank/Papers/LLU%20first%20draft.pdf



                                                                                                           55
users while still being controlled from the centre. Because optical fibre does not conduct
electricity an NGN network operator must also invest in their own parallel power grid. At the
subscriber end this means unlike the conventional PSTN telephone, a house or office
telephone that works off the Internet needs to have its own source of power, which could of
course be the telecom company if it is also a power company.

Six out of 10 broadband lines in the USA were Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) with fibre optic
FTTx and FTTH accounting for 16.7% of the market in 2012.72 This tells us that fibre, and
NGNs at the core, is establishing a foothold in the market, and many developing countries
have an opportunity to leapfrog straight into it as a more efficient telecoms platform that
supports the digital economy.

Metropolitan Networks

New entrants without any legacy networks can move straight to an NGN whereas an
incumbent needs to shift over in phases, often using a hybrid of fibre cables and copper
wiring. In many cases, the shift requires the write-down of fixed capital assets using
accelerated depreciation accounting. For example, an ATM switch may have many years of
service left in it, but to achieve a more competitive cost base the incumbent has to replace it.
Instead of depreciating the ATM over a period of 15 or 20 years, depreciation will be
compressed into maybe 3-5 years. This could cause a problem with regulatory estimates of
costs used for financial assessments and price control measures because costs will appear to
have increased and this may need to be reviewed by the regulator.

The pressure to accelerate depreciation comes from competition. The arguments that
competition will depress the revenues of the incumbent, making it more difficult to commit
capital for investment, are not convincing. To become commercially successful on a
sustainable basis incumbents have to go through a period of adjustment, even if that means
issuing debt to finance change. Without competition, investment in new technology is
bound to be slower and the benefits to the digital economy delayed.

One of the conditions for effective competition in metropolitan areas is tariff rebalancing.
Traditionally, tariffs for international and long distance traffic were high and often cross-
subsidized local call charges. Competition and new ways to communicate, especially over
the Internet, have brought long distance tariffs down but without much increasing local
tariffs because competition for mobile operators has changed the landscape. The revenues
for the future in any case will not be coming from traditional voice traffic, but rather from
the demand for broadband access and broadband services such as IPTV, movies-on-demand,
and in the corporate sector, cloud computing services. Once the process of competition
begins it tends to take on its own momentum, but for markets still dominated by

incumbents, regulators have to ask themselves what will make the market attractive to
investment from new entrants and frame policies accordingly. When that happens, the local
digital economy has a chance to grow.

Closely associated with the growth of a digital economy is the spread of BWA which creates
a demand for smartphones, tablet computers and other smart devices. This in turn creates
an avalanche of data traffic that often networks cannot easily handle. Regulators can assist
the industry and subscribers by placing sufficient radio spectrum on the market and by
removing obstacles to lower prices for backhaul capacity. For example, MNOs should be
allowed access to the capacity of the fixed line networks, some thought should be given to
licensing MNOs to build their own backhaul networks and, following the regulations in India
for example, to sharing facilities.

National Long Distance

For geographically large countries a domestic backbone network is an essential facility for
linking centres of population and until it exists a country cannot effectively address issues of
universal access and the digital divide. It should therefore be a priority objective of policy
and regulation.

A range of technologies are available, from landlines to satellite, from long-distance
microwave to coastal submarine cables.

For example, there is now more than 25,000 km of coastal cable now linking the 18,000
islands of the Indonesian archipelago.73 Figure 3.8 maps Indonesia’s Palapa ring.

Although it may be difficult for new entrants to achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by
the incumbent, the very act of connecting up towns and villages countrywide is the surest
way to bring the benefits of a digital economy to these areas. That is an economic
development issue, and development will generate traffic revenues for the future. It
therefore makes good sense for regulators to remove as many barriers to entry as possible.

There are well known ways to do this. Allowing utility companies to lease their spare
network capacity to new telecom companies is one step. Promoting the sharing of facilities
like telecom towers and power generators is another. Requiring incumbents to adopt open
access policies is another, as well as regulating both their leased line and interconnection
policies. Allowing unrestricted access to the Internet and to OTT services such as voice and
text is yet another.

The ultimate objective is to create national NGN high speed broadband networks that offer
ubiquitous coverage. A typical core network transmission technology is GPON (Gigabit
Passive Optical Network) which consists of dark fibres until they are lit using DWDM or
dense wave division multiplexing. Economies of scale play a role here and governments
often see advantages to the national economy of some public subsidy. In Australia, AUD43
billion has been set aside for a network to be built by Telstra on an open access basis. In
Malaysia, Ringgit 2.4 billion will be used to subsidize Telekom Malaysia’s High Speed
Broadband Network (HSBN) again on an open access basis. In Singapore, SGD1 billion of
public funds are being invested in a consortium (NetCo) to build the GPON and an
independent wholesaler (OpCo) to operate the network. The incumbent SingTel will retain
the right to compete separately.

                                                  Dark Fibre

Optical fibre that has not been lit is dark fibre. Originally this term applied to the unlit
capacity of carriers but now it also applies to capacity that is leased to other parties who
light it up for their own use. It is not uncommon in the US, for example, for local exchange
carriers or LECs to swap capacity with carriers in other districts so as to extend their
coverage to areas they previously could not reach. Utility companies, such as railways, road
highway networks and electricity grids, will often have spare capacity in their long-distance
fibre systems which can be leased out as dark fibre. On the demand side, besides carriers
looking for the bandwidth there are multi-site corporate businesses, data centres,
universities and government departments looking to lease fibre connections to form closed-
user group wide area networks (WANs). For example, in Brazil the government-funded Rede

Nacional de Ensino e Pesquisa (RNP) colleges and universities network uses leased dark
fibre.74

The quantity of dark fibre has grown exponentially, especially within oceanic submarine
cable networks. The cost of laying of a cable on land or in the sea is literally a sunk cost
which to all intents and purposes is invariant to the strands of fibre in the cable. Unlit fibre is
cheap, so it makes economic sense to pack in many fibres. The expense arises when the
electronic components are added and the fibre is lit. Increasingly DWDM or dense
wavelength division multiplexing is used to transmit light signals along different frequencies
or ‘colours’ of the spectrum, but because of the risk of interference between the light paths
the dark fibre that is leased is often ‘managed’ in the sense that a ‘coarse’ WDW (CWDW)
light path of 20nm (1 nanometre = one billionth of a metre) is maintained as a guard band.



International Connectivity

No sector of the market has seen a more dramatic increase in capacity and fall in prices than
international submarine cables. This originally came about in the late 1990s as “irrational
exuberance” in response to the dot.com bubble when the industry regularly over-estimated
the rate of growth of Internet traffic.75 Investment became detached from the facts on the
ground, or on the seabed, and gave rise to a number of online secondary capacity markets
in the spirit of the Internet revolution. Prices collapsed following the bursting of the bubble
from 2000 onwards and changed the landscape of the international carrier market. Some
major players went into receivership, many global carriers partially withdrew from all but
their most important regional markets, and when they ventured back in the late-2000s it
was often to lease rather than buy or build their own capacity.

From the mid-2000s new cables of terabit capacity began to appear. Some of these are
consortium cables involving carriers from the countries with landing stations who buy
‘indefeasible rights of usage’ (IRUs) giving them the right to a certain capacity within the
cable. Traditionally consortia were very conservative about IRUs but because of the supply
overhang they have become more open to leasing to third parties. Part of this new wave of
investment has come from carriers in developing countries, for example from Indian carriers
Tata and Reliant in the Asia-Pacific. The bandwidths are humungous, but often less than 10
per cent of capacity is actually lit, but as CDNs spread throughout the world and data
centres spring up with the rise of cloud computing the demand will grow.76 In areas
previously underserved capacity is rising. In Africa it now stands at over 22 terabytes for the

The original drivers of demand used to be international voice calls and commercial data
traffic. That has changed. Many voice calls now go by OTT voice, video and text services
such as Skype and Yahoo Messenger and commercial data traffic by Extranets. The driver
today is principally the resurgence of Internet traffic, notably media video streaming and
data traffic in the cloud between data centres. For example, according to the Cisco Internet
traffic forecast for 2012, “51% of all Internet traffic will cross content delivery networks in
2017 globally, up from 34% in 2012.”

Other notable metrics from the Cisco forecast are that “IP traffic is growing fastest in the
Middle East and Africa, followed by Asia Pacific. Traffic in the Middle East and Africa will
grow at a CAGR of 38% between 2012 and 2017” and that “In 2017, global IP traffic will
reach 1.4 zettabytes per year, or 120.6 exabytes per month. Global IP traffic will reach
1.0 zettabytes per year or 83.8 exabytes per month in 2015.”81 These figures, even if only
partially accurate,82 spell the transformation of international telecommunications.
Regulators have to be aware of them, have to prepare their markets to sustain the carriage
of this data into and out of their jurisdictions. No one single landing station, satellite earth
station or international gateway will be adequate to provide the quality of service and the
redundancy required to make the economy competitive. Ways must be found to allow
investment, competition and diversity into the market for international traffic.

3.6 Opening Vertically-Integrated Markets
In vertically integrated companies, the management has upstream and downstream control
of the procurement, production, distribution/marketing and sales processes.

3.6.1 Benefits and Costs of Vertical Integration
Economic Theories

Economists have different theories as to why firms vertically integrate. A common theme is
economies of scale which can result in lower prices for the consumers. The Chicago School
of thought argues that if management is rational then it will only choose vertical integration
if the economic incentives support that way of doing business. This has been termed
internalize complementary efficiencies, the implication being that most forms of regulation
will simply distort the incentives and force the firm to operate at a sub-optimal level. They
go on to point out that in technologically fast-changing industries, monopolies rarely survive
for long.

The New Institutional school, closely associated with the original work of Chicago economist
Ronald Coase 83 and with University of California economist Oliver Williamson, suggests that
vertical integration gives firms access to information along different points of the supply
chain and across different markets that would otherwise not be easily available to them.
The alternative would be incurring transactions costs of dealing with different suppliers,
wholesalers or retailers. Vertical integration can save on these costs. By contrast, the older
Institutional School takes its original inspiration from the work of nineteenth century
American economist and sociologist Thorstein Veblen and later from the work of economist
John Kenneth Galbraith. It points to the personal incentives and psychological motivations
of managers preferring to manage larger than smaller corporations.

In reality all these theories can be correct to some degree. For example, the Chicago School
would see the case studies of the Institutional School as examples of managers not doing
what is in the best interests of their companies. This would mean they are not acting
rationally in terms of the firm, while on the other hand the Institutionalists would see them
acting rationally in their own terms. What all these schools of thought have in common is
that they do not just describe how firms come to be large and vertically integrated, but why

  His seminal work The Nature of the Firm was publish in Economica, November 1937 when at the London
School of Economics, see http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x/pdf

                                                                                                       62
they do so, what motivates their management, and why they remain integrated or why they
may choose not to.

Regulators

Why is this important to regulators? Two reasons. First, because regulators have to take into
account the possibility that the firms are using their control of the supply chain to
discriminate in terms of price, quality and timeliness of supply of upstream products and
services to downstream competitors. This can result in ‘profits squeeze’ for competing retail
service providers forcing them to withdraw from the market. If vertical integration
undermines competition then investment, innovation and consumer welfare will suffer.
Second, regulators need to understand how economic incentives influence the behaviour of
the firm. Regulation that is poorly designed may do more damage than good. For example,
policies that try to cap the profits of a dominant vertically-integrated company may simply
result in that company shifting its investments from its regulated to its unregulated lines of
business. Or, a price-cap that is linked to the rate of inflation and designed to encourage a
firm to cut costs if it wants to boost profits (see Module 3.2) may result in the firm meeting
its demand targets and then under-investing in efficiency-enhancing capital expenditure
while it waits for the next round of price-cap adjustment. This example is given by Cave and
Doyle who suggest the regulator “offer firms a menu of increasing investment levels,
associated with progressively lower allowable rates of return.”84

The opposite problem of ‘gold-plating’ arises when rate-of-return regulation allows the firm
the same rate-of-profit whatever its level of investment. This is also known as the Averch-
Johnson effect.85 In the United States, where anti-trust rulings by the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) are regularly tested in the law courts, economic
arguments have become compelling, or as Judge Richard Posner, a leading anti-trust
economist and jurist put it “an economics-based approach has won in antitrust.”86 For this
reason, regulators need to have a good understanding of what drives and motivates the
companies under regulation.

3.6.2 Remedies to Anti-Competitive Conduct by a Vertically-Integrated
Operator
Anti-Competitive Behaviour

Anti-competitive behaviour can arise from many different situations. Some example are
collusion between equal competitors, or ‘price-leadership’ when unequal competitors
prefer the easy life of living under the shadow of the incumbent who fixes the price.
Different causes of anti-competitive behaviour call for different remedies. Anti-competitive
behaviour that arises from an operator exploiting the advantages of vertical integration has
many historical precedents.

Remedies a regulator can use include the following:

 Open the doors to new entrants and assist them in establishing a foothold in the market,
  for example, by unbundling the local loop, by regulating interconnection agreements, by
  allowing them to share facilities, by introducing number portability, etc.
 Encourage the adopting of new technologies, including Internet-based services that can
  offer consumers a real choice
 Require the regulated operator to offer equal access to competitors, if necessary along
  with incentives to comply
 Enforce separations if other measures are ineffective, either accounting, functional or
  structure separation
 Use a public subsidy for an independent network construction company and/or
  wholesale operator with an equal access obligation

There is no question that competition from new entrants using the most up-to-date and
cost-effective technologies associated with all-IP broadband NGNs is the most effective way
to combat anti-competitive behaviour by vertically-integrated incumbents. The important
caveat is that policy-makers must support competition, if necessary by revising the terms
and conditions of the incumbent’s licence and the telecommunications laws under which it
is issued. This process may require a compensation agreement to cover the loss of exclusive
rights conveyed by the licence. Compensation can be in the form of cash, as was the case
when the Hong Kong policy maker took back the exclusive international telecoms licence
from Hong Kong Telecommunications to open up the market. Alternatively, the new licence
can give the incumbent access to markets it could not previously enter. When AT&T in the
US was broken up (‘divested’) through structural separation in 1980s into seven
independent Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) otherwise known as Incumbent
Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), it was given the right for the first time to compete in call
international markets.


                                                                                           64
Separations

Separations are a radical step for a regulator to take. In the UK in the 1990s, British Telecom
(BT) voluntarily agreed to a functional or operational separation of its various business units
in order not to lose the economies of scale that come from sharing some of its overheads
and investment in R&D, including vital strategic business information. The restructuring was
approved on an ex post basis, meaning that regulator agreed to a light-handed touch to see
how well the new structure worked. See Figure 3.10 for BT’s new structure.

                                         Figure 3.10
                                BT’s Functional Restructuring




No one has more detailed information about operational costs, markets and investments
than the operators themselves, and this places regulators in a difficult position. To be
effective the regulator needs the full compliance and cooperation of the regulated operator.
This cooperation can come at a cost if the regulated operator manages to ‘capture’ the
regulator, meaning the regulator becomes beholden. If the incumbent operator has close
ties with high-level policy makers, which is quite likely, then the issue of transparency
becomes very important.

Regulators who examine the case for separations need the cost accounting information of
the operator to determine what would be the most cost-efficient means of separation. For
example, if the wireless cellular operation is part of a competitive market but the fixed line
PSTN is not, then the argument for an accounting or financial separation may be sufficient
to ensure mobile prices are not cross-subsidized from fixed line rentals and usage charges.
But that may not be sufficient if, for example, backhaul is provided to the mobile business
unit but not for competitors on an equal basis, unless the competitors are also full service
operators.




                                                                                             65

                            Costs, Prices and Vertical Integration

Vertical integration is not by its nature transparent. Even an incumbent operator may not
know the true cost of its many activities simply because under the traditional regime of
monopoly pricing it never needed to know them. The traditional way an incumbent set
prices was to allocate or distribute costs across a range of services based upon what the
market would bear. In more competitive markets, where the elasticity of demand will be
higher, the prices would be lower, while in more captive markets where the elasticity of
demand will be lower, the prices would be higher. This is also known as Ramsey pricing.

The following Figure, from the World Bank’s Telecommunications Handbook summarises the
different cost allocation methods available to operators and regulators alike.

Figure 3.11




From the bottom-up the Figure illustrates the following:

1.   Stand-alone costs when there is one output or service and all the costs must be covered
     in the sales price.

2.   Fully Distributed/Allocated Costs (FDC/FAC): when there are two or more service
     outputs, for example local, long distance and international voice services, the costs of
     any of them consists of an apportionment of common costs, e.g., property taxes, and of
     joint costs, e.g., the cost of the switch used for both services, such that all common and
     joint costs are covered by each of the services in combination, plus the fixed costs
                                                                                             66
       specific to that service, such as the costs of the cable landing station or satellite station,
       plus the incremental costs associated with that service, such as the total of marginal
       costs of switching or routing traffic.

3.     Total Service Long-Run/Long-Run Average Incremental Cost (TSLRIC/LRAIC) with
       uniform mark-up: the same as FDC/FAC with two exceptions. Costs are forward-looking
       (not historical) based upon new technologies, and the allocation of common and joint
       costs is done on some defined proportionality basis, such as the percentage volumes of
       traffic or revenues.

4.     Total Service Long-Run Incremental Cost (TSLRIC) with mark-up: the same as
       TSLRIC/LRAIC except mark-ups distinguish between common and joint costs shared by
       services, and residual costs that arise even at zero output, sometimes referred to as
       “keeping the lights on.”

5.     Total Service Long-Run Incremental Cost (TSLRIC): the same as TSLRIC/LRAIC except
       that the allocation of common and joint costs only includes those that are genuinely
       common or joint costs of the services under consideration.

6.     Total Service Long-Run/Long-Run Average Incremental Cost (TSLRIC/LRAIC): same
       forward-looking costs as above without the mark-up, so only incremental (variable)
       direct costs and a proportion of fixed costs are included.

7.     Long-Run Incremental Cost (TSLRIC): only forward-looking incremental (variable) direct
       costs are involved.

An example of regulatory costs accounting is the emphasis the FCC placed upon ‘modularity’ or open
access following the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC ruled that vertically-integrated
RBOCs or Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) would be required to offer various ‘unbundled
network elements’ (UNEs) as separate modules to local competitors at a cost-based price. For
example, access to the registry of residential and business telephone numbers. This was to ensure
that if the LECs offered interconnection to their competitors they did not force them to pay for
network elements they did not need. The FCC used a methodology called total element long run
incremental cost (TELRIC) to determine an appropriate price of UNEs.87



Going Vertical: Mergers & Acquisitions

Vertical integration works well for firms with a relatively narrow-range of products, but as
the range get wider the challenges of management coordination grow and the efficiencies
get called into question. If the products and services are complimentary then the

87
     http://www.techopedia.com/definition/26165/unbundled-network-element-une

                                                                                                   67
advantages of becoming big probably outweigh the disadvantages. However, if the product
range is diverse, includes substitutes or competing services, and results in the need for a
variety of different investment and marketing strategies, then big can spell trouble. For
example, the merger of a telecoms and a cable or IPTV business may seem to be a case of
convergence, but the investment profiles and management skills required by each are
entirely different. For these reasons, in some some industries mergers and acquisitions
(M&As) may end up destroying more value than they create. In other cases, such as when
an incumbent acquires an innovative start-up which has recently entered the market, the
big question is whether what is being acquired are the inventors and innovators behind the
start-up or just the intellectual property. Whether M&As add value or destroy value is
something that can only be tested in the marketplace; for regulators that is not the issue,
rather it is whether there is or is not a high probability competition, and therefore
innovation and customer choice, will be reduced.

This presents regulators with a range of issues. First, is a vertically integrated telecoms
company dominant because it is efficient or because it is abusing its market power and
discriminating against weaker competitors? Second, when an M&A is proposed, will it
significantly reduce competition in the market, or will it increase efficiency and present
consumers with better value services? Third, even without discriminatory behaviour, is the
vertically-integrated company in any way ‘dominant’ and if so does it wield ‘significant
market power’ (SMP) such that it can independently influence market prices for itself and its
competitors? Dominance is only a measure of potential market power. Whether the
company exploits that power in anti-competitive ways is a judgment call by the regulator
who has to decide whether to regulate ex-ante (on the presumption of anti-competitive
behaviour) or ex-post (on the basis of observation and assessment) – see module 3.2.

These are essentially economic issues, but there are also issues of political power and social
influence. Cross-ownership rules are designed to curtail the concentration of power in too
few hands and are usually part of an M&A assessment process. There are further issues,
such as a concentration of foreign ownership if a country identifies some of its telecom
services as national economic or security concerns. But it is important that trade
commitments made under the WTO are honoured to achieve the greatest possible benefits
from investment in open markets. The telecoms regulator may not be the final arbiter on
whether an M&A is allowed to proceed, but where the merged companies involved a
telecoms operator the view of the regulator on the possible outcome is important.

Vertical Value Chains

Over recent decades in the supply chain for the fast-growing mobile sector of telecoms
equipment there has been something of a tug-of-war between the vendors who
manufacture the handsets and the operators who connect them to their networks. Although
vendors may decide to sell their handsets through retail outlets the bulk of their sales is
                                                                                            68
often to the carriers. Through bulk purchases of handsets the carriers get important
discounts which they can pass onto their subscribers, adding their own discounts to attract
new customers in cases where the mobile services markets are highly competitive. But there
is also competition between the vendors and the operators to determine which of them
secures the larger share of the value along the supply chain.

Branding, designs (‘form factors’) and operating systems have been the key areas of
competing demands. Vendors want to their name as the band. As with other products,
better known branded handsets sell at a premium over lesser brands. But equally, operators
such as Vodafone and DoCoMo and Hutchison’s “3” benefit from name recognition if the
handset carries their brand. Bulk-buying has sometimes swung the balance of branding
power towards the carriers, especially those who won licences to pioneer the next
generation of mobile services, such as 3G. With branding power (the logo on the phone)
often went the power to dictate the designs or ‘form factor’ of the phones, such a flip -tops,
slide phones, swivel phones, touch screens, their colours and shapes. But the power of
operators tends to diminish as the carrier market itself becomes more competitive. Their
power is further eroded if they are unable to dominate the market by ‘locking’ the handsets
they connect to the network so that only their SIM cards can be used in those phones. This
erosion can arise from regulation which outlaws the practice, or by customers shifting to the
unlocked services of their competitors which may happen, for example, when cheaper
phones are bought in increasing numbers by lower-income and often pre-paid users.

Apple is a vendor that has traditionally locked its phones and made agreements with
carriers to keep them locked. The iPhone, launched in 2008, is widely accepted to have been
a game-changer for the industry. For the public its brand name and designs were major
attractions, in particular its touch-screen features, but behind both was Apple’s innovative
iOS operating system. Operating systems (OS) determine which apps can be run, their
screen appearance as well how to navigation a phone’s many functions, which are
themselves apps. Like the now defunct Symbian OS used by Nokia, Ericsson and others, they
may be owned by a consortium of vendors, or like iOS they may be vendor-specific, or like
Google’s Android OS they may be owned by one vendor but freely available to all. They
constitute a vital part of the intellectual property of handset manufacturers and, where they
are under a commercial licence, an important source of royalty revenue.

The outstanding feature of the handset market today is how fast the technologies develop,
the apps develop, the form factors change. This has resulted in market leaders of yesteryear
falling behind or even exiting the market. It has resulted in component manufacturers and
original engineering and manufacturing (OEM) companies entering into alliances with one
or other of the major vendors, or in some cases, such as HTC vying to become a major
vendor in its own right by selling direct to large carriers, for example, in China. This
underscores how quickly the balance of market power can shift horizontally between

                                                                                           69
vendors and vertically between vendors and carriers. After the iPhone kick-started a radical
shift towards smartphones, Apple held enormous market power, for a short time
catapulting the company into being the largest in the world by value. Apple could more or
less dictate terms to the carriers it selected to market the iPhone, with previously unheard
of commercial agreements which included the carriers to guarantee a local subsidy to
iPhone retail prices and even a revenue-sharing agreement. That power was derived from
the strength of consumer demand for, and loyalty towards, each new iPhone release. 88

But the market has never ceased moving on, seeing new vendors including social networks
like Facebook moving into the mobile market. In many ways it is appropriate that this is the
case. The very last part of the traditional telecommunications market to face competition
and to see innovation was the telephone receiver. Only in the 1980s was there widespread
opening of the consumer premises equipment (CPE) markets, which began with non-black
plastic telephone designs, and then telephones with additional functions such as stored
numbers, call holding, recall, etc., which could be bought in supermarkets at low prices. The
OS of mobile handsets has set new standards of innovation because they are linked to the
Internet. For regulators, the issues raised are many, but they mostly revolve around
competition and consumer protection issues to be with pricing, locking, blocking of apps
and net neutrality.

 Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World


3.7 Net Neutrality

The common understanding of net neutrality is a regulatory stance against any form of
discrimination by telecom networks against users of the Internet, whether as suppliers of
services and content or as consumers. On the supply side, this implies that Internet
companies should not be charged for delivering their products to end users unless they have
come to a commercial agreement with the network. For example, to act as a local billing
agent or as a content distribution network (CDN). On the demand side, this implies that
customers should not experience any blocking of sites that has not been sanctioned in law,
nor any throttling or quality degradation of the bandwidth that they are entitled to, nor
charged discriminatory fees. What is normally permitted is a layered tier of bandwidth
prices for customers to choose from and each customer can choose their preferred package.
It is relevant to note that when consumers buy access devices, such as tablet computers,
they come at different prices according to the speed of the networks they can access, thus
equality of consumer choice seems to be consistent with different price levels for different
levels of service.

On top of this, regulators usually recognize that telecom companies, most of whom are also
Internet service providers (ISPs), have the right to manage their networks in the most cost-
efficient manner to ensure quality of service obligations. The quality of service standards for
available access to a network stands ideally stand at over 99%. For example, the Infocomm
Development Agency (IDA) in Singapore requires 99.85% for the narrowband and 99.9% for
broadband,89 while in Chile the standards for narrowband are set at 97% in urban areas and
90% in rural areas.90 By contrast, in the 1990s, Internet traffic was seen as ‘best effort’
unless it was sent over a public or private managed network. In the broadband era, the
public expect consistently high access rates, although the speeds will differ widely from
market to market. The quality of service is vital also to the success of the digital economy.

The issues at stake are principally two-fold. First, whether the network operator is using the
need for quality-of-service network management as a cover for bandwidth throttling or
degradation of some services such as peer-to-peer communications. Second, whether they
should have the right to charge fees to Internet companies for the use of their networks as a
way, as they will argue, to raise the funds required to invest in new network capacity. To
confront these issues regulators need to examine their own policy goals.

3.7.1 Goals of Net Neutrality

In 2011, a study by the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC)
found that the blocking of voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) and peer-to-peer traffic by
telecom operators and Internet service providers was a common practice. In 2013, the EU
Commission announced it would proceed to require all telecom carriers to observe net
neutrality, meaning no throttling, no degradation of Internet services and unrestricted
access to Internet content providers by users without discrimination between low and high
volume users. What is permitted is the practice of charging users different prices for
different bandwidth packages.

In many developing economies there are no effective regulations and the incumbent
operator pretty much does as it pleases. For example, a study of the Union of the Comoros
off the East Coast of Africa reveals that Comores Telecom (CT), which holds a monopoly in
both fixed-lines and mobile telephony, and acts as the sole Internet Service Provider (ISP), is
threatened with declining international call revenues from competing OTT voice services
such as Skype and Viber.91 Its strategy has been to deliberately degrade the quality of the
internet service it provides to its subscribers, on both fixed and mobile networks. By
increasing the latency, or delay, in internet traffic, it makes VoIP effectively unusable. This
has proved to be a highly controversial policy because it also affects other legal internet
services, such as webmail or instant messaging used by Comorian citizens. Clearly, this is not
a sustainable long-term solution for CT or for the Union of the Comoros.

In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused cable TV operator and
Internet service provider Comcast of selectively blocking connections to peer-to-peer (P2P)
applications. Comcast was found guilty, but a ruling by the Court of Appeals in 2010 found
that the Commission did not have legal jurisdiction over the Internet services of Comcast.
Subsequently, the FCC published in 2010 an Open Internet Report & Order, guidelines to
keep the free and open nature of the Internet, around the three basic principles of
transparency, no blocking and no unreasonable discrimination. But beyond these guidelines
there is no legislation or formal regulations for Internet neutrality.

Besides the commercial interests of the carriers and the Internet companies involved, there
are opposing camps of the ‘deregulationists’ including property rights advocates versus
supporters of the ‘open access’ and ‘commons’ approach. For property rights advocates,
carriers should retain a right to manage their networks to their own best advantage with
minimal interference from regulators. This argument works best when there is well
established competition for consumers to choose from. Consumer advocates of the ‘open

access’ approach point to the lack of competition that results from violations of net
neutrality, and to the adverse effects this has upon investment in, and growth of, the digital
economy.92

3.7.2 Regulatory Approaches

The FCC, in considering the Comcast case, issued a consultation paper asking what were
ISPs using traffic management techniques trying to achieve; was it to prioritize latency-
sensitive applications, to avoid network congestion, to block unwanted traffic, to implement
parental controls, or was to gain advantage over competitors. For regulators concerned that
network management may be used as a pretext for discrimination against sources or users
of services over the Internet, the devil lies in the detail. Network management tools can do
blocking, traffic shaping and quality of service functions. Each can be used for discriminatory
and non-discriminatory purposes.

The question asked by the FCC was whether the network management in question was
‘reasonable’, although the definition of ‘reasonable’ is itself open to question. In other
words, the concept of net neutrality in operational terms is often arrived at only after a
judgement has been made on what actual network management practices are reasonable
and unreasonable. There is a huge literature debating the finer points of net neutrality along
these lines, and a useful approach, although not the only one, has been put forward by Scott
Jordan and Arijit Ghosh of the University of California, Irvine.93 They start their analysis using
the three-layered stack of the Internet as compared with the standard seven-layered stack
ISO model traditionally used by telecom engineers. (See Figure 3.12).

They suggest that four criteria could be used by regulators to judge whether or not network
management practices raise red warning flags.

      Where within the network are the network management tools applied: in typical
       Internet design it is assumed that management techniques are applied above the
       transport layer if possible. If they are applied in the transit between the different
       networks (source network and the carrier network) in the routers below the
       transport level this should raise a red flag.
      What type of tool is applied: if network congestion is short or medium term (for
       example, less than one minute) then tools such as traffic shaping and queuing are
       effective, for example at endpoints in the network. The delay occurs at final delivery,
       but for congestion over one minute access control may be required. If this involves
       blocking or termination as opposed to quality of service degradation this should raise
       red flag.
      Who decides which tool should be applied: it may be at the request of the Internet
       source or the end user, but if it is a unilateral decision of the ISP then this should
       raise a red flag.
      When and on what basis is a tool applied: it may be applied to (i) an application, (ii)
       the source/destination, (iii) the service provider, and/or (iv) the payments processor.

                                                                                           74
           Tools applied to traffic on the basis of (ii) or only to traffic based on (iii) should raise
           a red flag.

What is useful about this framework is that it is not deterministic because the red flags are
only alerts that can help regulators. However, this does focus attention on the fact that in an
interconnected world the old distinctions between what were telecoms services and what
are services over the Internet can no longer be a good guide to policy. For the
‘deregulationists’ these red flags will be redundant and for some advocates of ‘open access’
they may not go far enough, but regulators do need some practical points of reference
going forward.

3.7.3 Net Neutrality and Wireless Networks

Under the FCC’s Open Internet Report & Order (2010) “Fixed and mobile broadband
providers must disclose the network management practices, performance characteristics,
and terms and conditions of their broadband services” but excludes mobile from restrictions
on blocking and “unreasonable discrimination”.94 Broadband wireless sector was exempted
because it was seen as a young growth sector. Unlicensed spectrum services are not
covered by the Order.

As noted above, many wireless broadband devices place limits on what services can be
received, for example, Apple’s iPhone does not download Adobe files and restricts the types
of apps that can be downloaded, and certain devices will not stream YouTube. The device
vendors often have partnerships with different telecom networks, with CDNs and even have
their own networks. Mobile networks are often converged with fixed (FMC), and these
crossovers do not lend themselves to universal net neutrality regulations. For regulators the
important issue is to keep the mobile wireless market as competitive as possible so
consumers always have choice.

3.7.4 Governance Issues

Governance of the Internet is fundamental to its openness. The Internet began as an
American creation that has now become part of the everyday life of the modern world. That
means it also becomes part of every country’s national interest. It can only be hoped that a
multi-stakeholder approach does not politicize the Internet which would be detrimental to
the damage the digital economy. Good regulation should guard against that danger.

Two issues in particular have featured significantly in recent debates, and they relate to the
respective roles of states and other stakeholders in Internet governance. The first issue

94
     http://www.fcc.gov/document/preserving-open-internet-broadband-industry-practices-1

                                                                                                      75
concerns the rights of states within their own borders to govern the use of Internet domain
names at the country level. The Domain Name System (DNS) evolved for technical reasons
using Latin script for Top-Level Domain Names (TLDs) such as .cn for China and .com for
company. Later it became possible to use non-Latin scripts such as Cyrillic, Hebrew, Korean,
Thai, etc., which have been adopted by many countries for their country code TLDs or
ccTLDs, also known as Internationalized Domain Names of IDNs.95 Over time search engines
may adapt to these as well, but until they do searching for materials in non-Latin languages
will remain an obstacle. For many states this raises both cultural and political concerns. The
second issue concerns agency. Some Internet issues, such as the DNS and Internet
engineering protocols are handled within internationally recognized bodies, such as Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) but as of 2013 there is no international agency that deals with other issues such
as cyber-security over the Internet. Some states have suggested the ITU could extend its
reach into the area, a suggestion quite vigorously opposed by others, including some other
states and by many in the Internet community itself, who do not see an inter-governmental
telecommunications organization as being the appropriate forum. Whatever the outcome of
this debate, the issues it raises are very real and ways need to be found that are genuinely
multi-stakeholder with no-one claiming to have all the answers. The Internet is a
continuously evolving technology-based mode of communications which is having truly
profound economic and social consequences, and the role of regulators is probably best
described as two-fold: to regulate with a light touch in order to encourage continuing
innovation and the benefits that brings, and encourage the active involvement of all
stakeholders to address the various challenges the spread of the Internet has for society.




95
  “For technical reasons, support for non-Latin scripts was treated as a design and deployment problem whose
solution was intended to minimise change to the domain name resolution infrastructure. This was debated in
the Internet Engineering Task Force more than once, but the general conclusion was always that requiring a
change to every resolver and domain name server, rather than changes on the client side only, would
inhibit deployment and utility. This led to the development of so-called ‘punycode’ that would map Unicode
characters representing characters from many of the world’s scripts into a ASCII characters (and the reverse).”

      Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World
3.8 Security in Cyberspace
All societies are vulnerable in cyberspace due to the growing interconnection of networks,
of people through emails and social media, etc., and increasingly of ‘things’ such as
machines, sensors and consumer goods, through the Internet using cables, Ultra Wideband
(UWB) and other wireless technologies.

The vulnerabilities exist at all levels. For analysis it is useful to think of three levels: high-
level attacks on critical information infrastructure (CII) which can bring parts of a country to
a standstill and are likely to come from a terrorist assault or political cyber-warfare;
cybercrime which can range from industrial scale espionage of state or commercial secrets,
to massive financial theft and fraud, and to so-called ‘white-collar’ crimes such as tax
evasion moving online from offline; and third, crimes against persons such as child abuse,
cyber-bullying, online defamation, etc.


3.8.1 Security of Critical Information Infrastructure
At the highest level, the first recorded cyber-assault on a country’s entire infrastructure was
in Estonia in April 2007 when websites of Parliament, ministries, newspapers, banks and
others were brought to a standstill in distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. Even
more insidious is the malicious use of web robots or ‘bots’. They are very useful in search
engines for tasks such as web spidering, but they can also be used to take remote control of
websites without the owners knowing it, read the files and implant malicious code. Like the
rogue computer Hal in the movie ‘2001’ that takes control of the spaceship, this is a very
power weapon in the wrong hands. Public utilities such as a telecoms and energy networks
could be hijacked, traffic diverted, energy supplies cut off, causing untold economic loss and
loss of life.

CERTS and CTBEX

Although it is not possible to assign precise levels of risk to cyber-security in terms of exact
times and places, with sufficient data is it possible to assign degrees of risk to different areas
of strategic importance and to possible timescales. Using past data on attacks and a
strategic view of network vulnerabilities, some planning and preparation is possible, but
success is entirely dependent upon good detection work based upon intelligence and
information sharing between agencies. It is important, for example, that telecom operators
and Internet service providers notify the regulator or cybercrime agencies of suspected or
actual cyber-attacks.


                                                                                                77
It is equally important for these agencies to work in close collaboration and exchange of
information, first at the national level, and second at the regional and international levels.
To this end, the ITU has been involved in an initiative on cyber-security for telecom
networks through the Cybersecurity Information Exchange Framework or CTBEX.96 It
consists of a set of protocols and standards and a general framework which integrates
different security domains, such as measures for protection, detection, remedies and legal
as illustrated in the Figure 3.13 below.

                                              Figure 3.13

Ministries and regulators need to be part of a national cyber strategy planning process. For
example, the Ministry of Information and Communications in Mauritius with support from
the African Development Bank has developed a holistic approach to cyber-security with a
National Strategic Plan that was created for 2007-2011 and has been revised for 2011-
2014.97 This follows the creation of Police Cybercrime Unit in 2000 and a Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT-mu) in 2008. The Plan transparently identifies areas of

96
     http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/oth/06/48/T06480000010006PDFE.pdf

     http://www.gov.mu/portal/goc/telecomit/file/ICTplan.pdf
                                                                                             78
cyber-security that need strengthening, which is the first step towards reducing risk. It also
outlines the coordinating mechanisms required between agencies.

The creation of CERT-mu is an important step and follows best practice for many countries;
for example, US-CERT is the 24x7 operational arm of the Department of Homeland
Security.98 In East Africa, the Cybersecurity Taskforce of the East African Communications
Organizations (EACO) covering Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda was formed
in 2008. It tasked with setting up national CERTS in each member state. National expertise in
cybercrime issues may reside in several different departments and law enforcement
agencies and in private IT and telecom companies and it is therefore important that national
strategic plans optimize on ways to share information on a timely basis. The following points
can be used to assess how successful organizationally the setting up of cyber-crime agencies
have been.

     1. How many staff have been on cyber training
     2. What outside expertise has been enlisted to grow the capacity of the agency
     3. Has the agency developed its own training programme for use by other agencies
     4. Has the agency developed a database coordinating details of known cyber-attacks
        from all other national sources
     5. Has the agency developed plans to cover: preparedness and prevention; detection
        and response; mitigation and recovery; international cooperation; support both from
        and for the ICT sector

Point 5 is from the EU Action Plan on CIIP.99 Other countries have their variants, for example,
Morocco’s National Cybersecurity Management System has the following five domains:
strategies and policies; implementation and organization; awareness and communication;
compliance and coordination; monitoring and evaluation.100 Telecom and information
ministries and regulators clearly have a major input to make into each of these domains and
expertise in cyber-security is something all ICT agencies need to add to their domain
capacity.

3.8.2 Cyber Crime
The level of cybercrime is difficult to gauge with any precision, but a study in 2012 for the
UK Ministry of Defence by Anderson et al., collates estimates of various cybercrime
categories at the global level, collecting global data where it is available and otherwise
extrapolating from UK data on the basis that UK GDP is 5% of global GDP. Their findings are
summarized in Table 3.2. For the sake of brevity the table presents sub-totals as a

Source: Anderson et al. (2012) ‘Measuring the Costs of Cybercrime’; Notes: figures in boldface based upon
available data, figures in non-boldface extrapolated from UK data based upon size of GDP; costs may include
data on criminal revenues, direct losses, indirect losses and defence costs.


These figures, as the notes accompanying the original table make clear, under-estimate the
real costs to society. What can be said with certainty is that the risks and the costs will
increase over time as societies become more connected, and it will pay society to devote
more resources to reducing the risks, which include public sector assets, private sector
assets and personal assets, from crime on an industrial and global scale.

Since these criminal activities are carried over networks operated for the most part by
telecom companies, there needs to be careful surveillance of suspicious traffic. But the
reality is today that a lot of this activity is conducted from proxy servers and the origins of
the criminals is unknown and could be from any country. The implication seems to be that
detection is more likely of the crime than of the criminal, and although highly professional
cyber detectives with access to cyber forensic laboratories can make progress these skills
and facilities are not widely available in developing economies. This in turn implies that the
focus of policy makers and regulators at the national level is best directed at limiting the
damage through early detection, fast and efficient information sharing, and a focus on alerts
and awareness. It is usually beyond the scope of regulators to track and trace the crimes to
their origins, but regulators can play a vitally important role in creating the ecosystem of
cyber-security.

Law Enforcement and the Proportionality Principle

When it comes to applying the law, regulators need to be cautious about the boundary
between detection and law enforcement. The laws under which regulators work need to
specify very clearly the limits of their responsibilities, such as the circumstances under which
they can seek a search warrant for activities which are illegal under the telecoms laws. The
enforcement of cyber laws is more likely to be the task of the police or customs and excise
officials, and regulators need to avoid becoming embroiled in civil liberty issues.

A good guideline for any regulator or law enforcement agency is proportionality, a
judgement regarding the seriousness of the infringement, whether, for example, it is a
major crime with wide social implications or a minor infraction with little social impact.
Because cyberspace is a relatively new area of governance, and because it crosses
jurisdictions, countries have often been struggling to make laws that are appropriate. And it
must be said that often the law making process is not as well informed as it should be. It is
therefore important for law makers, policy makers and regulators to bear in mind some
simple principles.

      In general, what is legal offline should be legal online, and what is a civil offence as
       opposed to a criminal offense offline should be treated similarly online.

      Extra-jurisdictional applications of national laws need to be very carefully vetted.
       Often what is legal in one country may not be legal in another. For example, an
       Internet posting may be considered fair comment and free speech in one jurisdiction
       but regarded as illegal in another, and yet the posting is available globally.
       Proportionality would suggest that criminalizing behaviour may not be either good
       justice or a good use of legal resources.

      Codes of practice – Intellectual property rights are becoming the subject of
       numerous bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations. The length and enforceability
       of copyright, for example, is often a controversial topic. With Internet hosting
       companies there is a question of who is liable for a posting that breaches copyright.
       The US Millennium Digital Copyright Act of 1998 provides one set of useful
       guidelines. It gives latitude to web hosts who abide by take-down notices in cases
       where someone unbeknownst to them has posted something that breaches
       copyright. The system is not perfect because identifying a particular posting on a site
       the size of Google or Yahoo! or Amazon or Twitter is not so easy, especially where it
       has gone viral, where others have shared it or added their own comments to it. Laws
       should be seen to be workable and proportionate and regulators should not be
       burdened with controversial applications of laws that are not well drafted. The
       regulator’s job is better to ensure the greatest level of transparency on the part of
                                                                                                  81
          companies that operate under a licence, and to promote a sensible, that is to say
          manageable, code of practice which offers incentives, such as immunity from
          prosecution, for doing the right thing alongside obligations to avoid doing the wrong
          thing.

3.8.3 Cyber-Strategies
At the heart of cyber-security lies the issue of detection, that is detection of the event itself
as well, ideally, detection of the offender. That can only come from sharing information, but
there exists an asymmetry between private gains and social losses. As Tyler Moore has
pointed out, by integrating part or all of their operations with the Internet in order to cut
costs companies may substantially increase the risk of cyber-attacks but at the same time
they may not choose to devote sufficient resources to the resulting insecurity. 102

For policy makers and regulators the recommendations are to be prepared to mandate the
sharing of critical cyber information but look for ways to incentivize organizations so it is in
their own interests to share. To take an example from the financial services sector, in
markets where EMV ‘chip and pin’ credit cards are available, banks and bank customers are
offered insurance against card fraud when banks issue and customers use the EMV standard,
but that cover is no longer available for traditional magnetic strip cards. Persuading
organizations to come clean about cyber-attacks on their systems can be more difficult, but
if by sharing information they also gain information and witness risk reduction the incentive
is created. There are numerous other ways in which ministries and regulators can encourage
organizations to cooperate, including inviting them to be part of the CERT expert groups.

A checklist might include the following:

         Information sharing – many parties to cyber-attack do not wish to publicize the fact
          which makes detection and identification of vulnerabilities more difficult. There may
          be a case for mandatory reporting, even if this involves confidentiality issues. A
          telecoms regulator, for example, should be informed immediately of such breaches
          in security and be appraised of remedial measures to safeguard the facility.
         Awareness sharing – many private companies, including vendors, have professional
          expertise in how to manage network security and also how to manage the managers.
          The weakest link may not be a piece of software coding, it may be the staff who
          open a malicious email or visit an entrapment website. Regulators may wish to set

Internet to reduce near-term, measurable costs while raising the risk of catastrophic failure, whose loses will
be primarily borne by society.” Tyler Moore (2010) ‘Introducing the Principle of Cybersecurity; Principles and
Policy Options’ Harvard University: Proceedings of a Workshop on Deterring CyberAttacks

        up their own unit to encourage education campaigns, and create expert groups to
        advise on new threats and new responses.
       Strategic Coordination – to be successful in anticipating and reducing the risk of
        cyber-attacks and cybercrimes national security agencies need to work closely on a
        multi-agency level with each other and with regulators from telecoms, from banking,
        and even from education ministries, etc., on permanent advisory and working group
        levels and with expert advice from the private sector.
       Law enforcement – regulators have their own areas of law enforcement under
        legislation. In many cases they can initiate a legal process, but in the case of cyber-
        crime the role of the regulator is more likely to coordinate with law enforcement
        agencies. The best approach of a telecoms regulator is to broker information sharing
        between licenced companies and cyber security experts.

3.8.4 Securing E-Commerce and a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
E-commerce is a vital part of the digital economy, not least for cross-border trade. To make
it work, confidence is required that the person or company at the other end of the
transaction is genuine, that the delivery of payment and of goods will take place in the way
and time agreed, that the transaction cannot be repudiated once the contract is signed, and
that the laws of the land will protect and safeguard rightful transactions.

Public Key Infrastructure

To meet this challenge the ITU-T (previously the CCITT) adopted the X.509 protocol
proposed by the IEFT (Internet Engineering Task Force). X.509 is an authentication protocol
consistent with IP/TCP and complements X.500, an earlier pre-Internet protocol of the ITU-T
and the ISO (International Standards Organization) designed to allow access to directories of
“distinguished names” meaning access to unique identifiers. The cryptology behind these
standards is for an asymmetric exchange of keys (private and public keys) and symmetric
opening of documents (the same document received as sent). The private key is used to lock
a document and the public key, which is uniquely linked to the user’s private key, is used to
unlock the document. In the public version both keys are issued by a trusted third party
Certification Authority (CA) which provides certificates of authenticity of the link, of the
signature and of the integrity of the document to show it has not been altered or tampered
with in any way. The CA itself refers to a Registration Authority (RA) to validate the identity
of the user and to a Validation Authority (VA) to validate the digital signature which is
applied to the document by a hash key function.

Private keys can be issued to individuals or to corporate bodies or linked to an email address.
A root certificate is issued to govern all subsequent certificates issued on behalf of a given
user. The certificates will include a unique serial number and other information, for example
the range of dates during which the certificate is valid or a ceiling value for a transaction.

                                                                                            83
The recipient of an encrypted document gets the sender’s public key from the CA, and
needs to check the certificate and also check a registry of revoked certificates. A list of the
root certificates are stored on a user’s computer for easy search using Online Certificate
Status Protocol or OCSP by which the browser dynamically checks the CA’s CRL (certificate
revocation list) and updates the computer.

Private PKI

The most widely used private versions of PKI are “light” versions that have been developed
by Internet companies, some of them based upon peering arrangements by-passing an
independent CA. Netscape in the 1990s developed SSL (secure socket layer) protocol
indicated by “https” whereby servers and clients exchange certificates for mutual
authentication.103 Most modern browsers embed copies of root certificates from CAs in
their software and are members of the CA Browser Forum (CABForum) along with the
independent commercial CAs themselves.

Applications of PKI

There are many industrial applications that use variants of the PKI system, for example,
M2M meter-reading systems to ensure authenticity of the reading and of the client.
However as the technologies advance, security concerns advance with them and the
behind-the-scenes fixes become more complex.104 Bogus companies managing to fool RAs
and CAs into issuing of certificates is one such problem and it is the responsibility and
liability of the user to browse certificates for reputable and genuine trading partners.

Consumer Security

At the consumer level, various security devices are available from banks, credit card
companies and third party payment platforms to give confidence to making purchases
online. None of them are perfect, especially over time as the technology advances which,
when in the wrong hands can be used to decrypt encrypted documents, intercept text
messages, hack into computers to steal passwords, etc. Despite efforts in some countries to
promote PKI among the general public, for example the iGov Philippines project,105
consumers in general have shown little interest as the alternatives have fewer overheads for
the scale and frequency of the transactions they usually undertake.

A terminological issue is here worthy of note: e-government is an important way to serve
the citizens of a country and as citizens people have to pay their taxes and claim their
benefits, make appointments and applications, request personal health information, and
generally have access to important public information. Citizens as consumers are engaged in

strictly private activities and online businesses have developed their own security protocols
which may or may not be compatible with PKI. Most governments also tend to follow these
more consumer-friendly Internet compatible protocols but often add their own layer of
security by requiring citizens to pre-register their identities.

PKI Complexity and Mutually Recognized Electronic Identification

Because public authorities have a responsibility to be transparent and protect taxpayers
money they have been the ones to adopt a public key infrastructure. Private corporations
often use other means to secure contracts and payments between themselves, but when
they deal with public authorities they are often required to use PKI where large contracts
are involved. The aims of a PKI system are to ensure at minimum:

          Electronic identification (ID)
          Authenticity of the ID link
          Authenticity of the electronic signature
          Integrity of the document
          Certification of validation of the above
          Legal acceptance of certificates for non-repudiation

To achieve these aims across borders is particularly challenging. For example, private
companies and citizens of the EU stand to benefit if cross-border transactions can use the
same standards PKI system. This is noted in the preamble to the Regulation of the European
Parliament and Council on electronic ID.

           For example, giving the opportunity for a student to enroll electronically in a
           university abroad, to a citizen to submit tax declaration online to another Member
           State or to a patient to access his or her health data online. If there is no such
           mutually recognized electronic identification means, a doctor will not be able to
           access the patient medical data needed to treat him or her and the medical and
           laboratory tests that the patient has already undertaken will have to be repeated.106

Establishing a strong legal environment through a digital signatures act or e-commerce
legislation is therefore of vital important for commercial confidence, especially for foreign
trade. One of the biggest challenges is establishing in which jurisdiction authority resides
and which sets of laws and arbitration principles will apply in cases of disputes. Other major
challenges are to harmonize standards, which is especially difficult when new standards are
being adopted at regular intervals, and making sure new standards are backwards

work-in-progress.

       Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World
3.9 Privacy and Data Protection in an Interconnected Environment
The right to privacy has been a long established principle in many countries, enshrined in
laws and often in the Constitution of a country. For example, of many in Latin America,108 as
habeas data or the right of a citizen to own their own data.

The challenges arise from four major sources. First, in the case of habeas data, the right can
only be exercised after the event when the information has already been made public.
Second, the capacity of the legal system to uphold the rights of the individual and enforce
the law is not always adequate. Third, the laws are often specific to particular sectors, such
as telecommunications, the media, health services, legal services, government agencies and
they do not lay down what lawyers call the general ‘principles of purpose’ that can be
applied across the board. In the absence of such a generic law, regulations governing
consumer protection provide some safeguards. Fourth, laws and regulations enacted before
the Internet era need revision and updating.

The question is how to apply personal data privacy principles to an interconnected digital
world of the Internet. This is especially challenging when information can be gleaned from a
whole range of digital sources such as social media, email servers, websites, blogs, online
purchases, online inquiries, etc., by persons and companies who are often located outside
the jurisdiction in which the citizen resides; when feeds to sites such as Facebook, Twitter
and YouTube can go viral within minutes; when ‘Big Data’ and business analytics can be
used to match and correlate people, ideas, actions, postings, etc., in both text form and in
image. This means that laws prohibiting the identification of individuals may no longer work.

New laws, regulations and codes of practice must aim to balance the interests of individuals
who have a right to privacy with the social benefits of a growing digital economy. In an
interconnected world anything online can be located anywhere on the planet, and with the
rise of cloud computing and PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a Service) and
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) anything online can, in principle, be transferred between
countries. This is not a by-product of the rise of a digital economy, it is the digital economy.

3.9.1 Date Protection and the Principles of Purpose
A key principle of habeas data is the right to own or know and control what information is
being gathered and stored about you and by whom and for what purpose. This right carries

   Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru all have habeas data as a
constitutional right. See International Law News, (Fall, 2012) v.41.4

                                                                                                     87
the implication of the right to demand corrections or possibly even to delete the
information, which is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. Personal information usu ally
refers to information that can be used directly or indirectly to identify a ‘natural’ living
person, although in a digital age there is very little that cannot be used to traced back to a
living person. There is a further issue of who has the right of ownership, if anyone, over
information of a deceased person. This means that the drafting of new laws or regulations
or codes of practice needs to be flexible to changes in technologies and proportionate to the
level of harm that can accrue from inaccurate information or lack of privacy.

By 2013, over 90 countries had some sort of Freedom of Information legislation,109 the
earliest dating back to 1766 in Sweden, but mostly these laws only apply to information held
by the State, not the private sector. In that regard they do not fully enable the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1948 which states:

           No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or
           correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the
           right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

More recently many countries have introduced personal data privacy legalisation which
extends to the private sector. These laws go beyond existing laws on consumer protection
that provide the right of customers to fair contract conditions rather than unreasonable tie-
in contracts, return of impaired goods, protection against price gouging, the right to
itemized billing, and so forth. Consumer protection of this sort has been particularly
prevalent in the telecommunications sector. Under new data protection laws, the data
‘controller’ of the information (the agent of the company collecting the information) as
opposed to the data ‘processor’ (the sub-contractor who may store, transfer or manage the
data) is required to seek the ‘informed consent’ of the individual, either through an opt -in
or an opt-out procedure, and a statement on how the data may be used is necessary, with
the understanding that it cannot be retained once the original purpose for its collection has
been fulfilled. Web-based enterprises are required to state their policy towards ‘cookies’
and offer the user a way to agree to accept them or to disable them.

Balanced against these requirements to protect the individual are certain public safety
requirements. For example, Internet access service providers such as Google and Yahoo!
and social media companies may be required to retain email traffic and postings for up to
two years or more to provide a trail of traceable evidence. Especially after the 9/11 attack
on the World Trade Center in New York, law enforcement agencies have been much more
concerned to have access to digital communications, but this will only be acceptable to the
public if there are strong safeguards in place. This means the public must have faith in the
quality and integrity of the legal process in their country. It also means that the

      For a list, see http://home.broadpark.no/~wkeim/foi-list.htm
                                                                                               88
enforcement of such policies has to cross jurisdictional boundaries and that raises questions
of which laws are enforceable on, for example, a company that has multiple global locations.
The most common legal wrangles tend to be over tax liabilities, but take-down notices,
defamation suits, compliance orders and other legal tussles add up to the need for
international cooperation even when the laws of different countries are not in harmony
with each other. This becomes especially important in cases of national security and serious
crimes such as child abuse and trafficking.

Data Protection Laws

By 2013, some 89 countries had adopted privacy or data protection laws. The European
Data Protection Directive of 1995 was the first pan-European policy document in which the
concepts of personal data protection in a digital world were embodied in legislation. It was
followed by the e-Privacy Directive of 2005, revised 2009, which deals with digital
communications and issues such as the integrity of data traffic, giving users ways to reject
spam and to control cookies. Under the 1995 Directive companies may not move personal
data, for example store data, to jurisdictions that do not have legislation that conforms to
the standards set by Europe. This becomes important with the rise of cloud computing
which technically allows data of any kind to be stored, processed and retrieved from any
Internet location in the world.

A revised EU draft European Data Protection Regulation was proposed in 2012 which will
extend applicability of the Directive to non-EU entities outside the EU when the data
involved concerns EU citizens, will impose an ‘opt-in’ rather than an ‘opt-out’ requirement
to ensure personal rights to data are fully protected, will allow for a ‘right of portability’ and
a ‘right to be forgotten’ which will allow citizens to wipe out the history of their data, and
strict conditions on notification of breaches in data protection and penalties for non-
compliance. A further enhancement of citizen rights are anti-spam regulations, typically a
Do-Not-Call (DNC) register which can also cover Do-Not-Send (DNS) in the case of phone
text messaging, and a proposal in the US for a Do-Not-Track (DNT) web function as part of a
wider package of consumer rights as proposed in the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights
brought before Congress in 2012.110

The US approach to data protection is generally less proscriptive. The Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) has overall responsibility of supervising the enforcement of federal
requirements on different sectors of the economy, such as the way information is collected
and used about customers by telecom companies, confidentiality of health records, inland


110
   According to a Consumer Insights survey by Ovum “an average of 66% of the Internet population across 11
countries would select a “do not track” (DNT) feature if it was easily available…” ‘Little Data: big data’s new
battleground’ http://ovum.com/2013/01/29/little-data-big-datas-new-battleground/

                                                                                                             89
revenue data, etc., and to generally apply consumer protection regulations. But there is no
prevention on the international transfer of data except tax records.

The threat of disrupting cross-border trade from a mismatch between the EU rules-based
approach the more voluntary approach to the private sector in the US was averted in 2000
when the EU approved the US seven ‘Safe Harbor Principles’111 which allow for company
self-certification:

          Notice - Individuals must be informed that their data is being collected and about
           how it will be used.
          Choice - Individuals must have the ability to opt out of the collection and forward
           transfer of the data to third parties.
          Onward Transfer - Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other
           organizations that follow adequate data protection principles.
          Security - Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information.
          Data Integrity - Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose it was collected
           for.
          Access - Individuals must be able to access information held about them, and correct
           or delete it if it is inaccurate.
          Enforcement - There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.

However the emphasis in the US shifted significantly following the 9/11 terrorist attack
towards greater state security and the need to assess and share information and the passing
of the Patriot Act in 2001. This, together with some doubts about how effective self-
certification really is, has kept the harmonization of approaches an open issue.

3.9.2 Cross-border data and cloud computing
One of the earliest set of policy recommendations on cross-border transfers of data arising
from the computerization of business transactions was the OECD 1980 Guidelines on the
Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Information. 112 More recently, the
rise of cloud computing has made it imperative that countries introduce updated personal
data protection legislation that conforms to minimum safeguards, for example, to those
enshrined in the EU Directive. For cloud computing to become a truly global means of data
storage, retrieval, file sharing and data transfers under secure conditions there needs to be
universally acceptable standards that at minimum allow for interoperability, otherwise the
‘clouds’ will remain constrained by economic and political boundaries. As a report from
Cisco in 2009 pointed out “Special consideration must be given to using cloud comput ing to

handle information that is vital to national security, to maintaining public trust and
confidence in government, or to managing certain core government functions such as
foreign relations, maintenance of property rights, law and order, and defense.” 113

There are two approaches to holding companies responsible for safeguarding confidentiality
in cross-border data traffic. The EU approach is geographical, so data is allowed into
countries that are deemed to meet the minimum standards set by the EU Directive. In
reality, this has not stopped data crossing borders into some major economies such as China
and Japan, despite the EU not having determined the adequacy of safeguards in either
country. The alternative approach adopted by APEC and by Canada among others is based
upon accountability. For example, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act of 2012 places
accountability on the shoulders of the ‘data controller’ which is the company that authorizes
the collection of the data even when the actual collection or handling of the data and the
storage and retrieval of the data is undertaken by a subcontracted ‘data processor’. This can
be seen as a more flexible approach that skirts around the country-profiling required by the
EU and keeps the responsibility on the data controller wherever the data is transferred to
and whoever handles it.114 The ultimate market test will be whether international
companies and their clients are willing to trust locating data in countries with the
accountability approach.

Latin America

The need to update and add flexibility to data protection laws is driving the shift in most
Latin American countries from a habeas data approach to a legislative approach, mostly
based upon the EU Directive but largely without the EU rules on data retention which
suggests less of a priority given to cyber-security issues.115 Several factors may account for
this, for example, a public wariness towards state surveillance, a lack of public awareness, a
lack of cyber-crime experience by law enforcement agencies, and a slower pace of
development of private cloud computing as much of the take-up has been e-government.
But as the digital economy of Latin America grows with the spread of broadband access and
traffic the need for more explicit data protection regulations and codes of practice will
emerge. As of 2012, the only countries in Latin America not to have some form of over-
riding personal data protection legislation were Bolivia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Progress towards such protection has being

Protection (RIPD), created in 2003, and now has over 20 member states.116

Asia Pacific

In countries of the Asia Pacific region the situation varies.117 APEC’s Cross Border Privacy
Enforcement Arrangement 118 adopts the accountability approach rather than the
geographical approach which perhaps reflects the emerging status of many of the
economies involved and the need for a flexible regime of data protection to benefit from
the rapid growth of cloud computing and data centre managed storage, retrieval, processing,
security and transit business throughout the region.119 In Asia Pacific countries, such as
Australia and New Zealand, Hong Kong and Singapore, and the Philippines clear cut data
protection laws are in place. In Japan the Act on the Protection of Personal Information
(APPI) provides a degree of protection covering data on employees, while ministries such as
health, education and labour have issued non-legally binding sets of guidelines based upon
APPI. The central administrative authority is the Consumer Affairs Agency. South Korea
enacted the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) in 2011 under the authority of the
Minister of Public Administration and Security (MOPAS) but also has legislation governing
particular sectors, such as financial sector and the IT Network Act administered by the Korea
Communications Commission (KCC). Taiwan revised the Computer Processed Personal Data
Protection Law (CPPL) to become the Personal Data Protection Law (PDLP) effective from
2012, but no separate national data privacy authority has yet been established. Indonesia
brought together different references to data protection and privacy under a Government
Regulation No. 82 of 2012 regarding Provision of Electronic System and Transaction, and also
has sector legislation, for example governing telecoms. Beyond these cases, other countries
of the region have yet to pass general personal data privacy laws or to set up privacy
commissions, relying upon legacy legislation governing telecoms, finance, health and other
sectors. But the Ministry of Industry and Information Technologies (MIIT) in China in 2013
for the first time issued a public consultation of a non-binding code of practice.

Africa and the Middle East

Throughout Africa and the Middle East there is no country that has an all-embracing data
protection policy. In most cases in Africa privacy is a constitutional right and in Malawi,
Namibia, Tanzania and Zambia this includes the right to privacy of communications, but only

Angola, Mauritius and Zimbabwe have enacted a separate data protection act and South
Africa has one pending. In some cases, such as Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa and Zambia,
privacy rights are included in their e-commerce legislation. Most countries in Africa do have
a freedom of information act but none has an independent commission to oversee the
privacy rights of individuals. In most cases there are regulations governing particular sectors,
such as spamming provisions. An important aim of policy makers in Africa should be
towards the harmonization of laws on data and personal privacy as a way of attracting
investment in data centres and in cloud computing services by making it easier and safer to
move data across borders. This was one of the objectives of the ITU’s programme
‘Harmonization of the ICT Policies in Sub-Sahara Africa’ 120

In the Middle East the situation is similar with few instances of separate personal data
privacy laws. Two exceptions are laws governing the Dubai International Financial Centre
and the Qatar Financial Centre which are modelled on the EU Directive. Qatar and Oman
also have e-commerce laws including provisions for digital signatures based upon the UN’s
UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures.121 Historically, separate laws and regulations
governing telecoms include provisions for the protection of customer data and prohibitions
on the illegal interception of communications. Examples in the Middle East include Saudi
Arabia, where the Telecommunications Act also covers Internet services, and Oman and the
UAE where the telecom regulators have issued data privacy policy requirements including
restrictions on unsolicited messaging. The electronic commerce law in Qatar does the same.
But none of these countries have independent privacy commissions. Beyond the Gulf states,
few other Middle Eastern countries have data protection laws. The privacy law in Lebanon,
for example, covers individual persons but not the content of communications.122 It has
been pointed out that the concept of privacy in Middle-Eastern countries is often more a
cultural than a legal concept, referring to the privacy of women and the household rather
than to individuals and information, and often the policy emphasis is more upon blocking
access to information, especially information over the Internet, rather than on protecting
personal data privacy. It is difficult to see how such policies can be consistent with the
growth of a digital economy and transformative technologies such as cloud computing.

3.9.3 Awareness and Alertness
As with cyber-security, so with personal data protection, in an interconnected world there
are no guarantees of privacy. To reduce the risks of unauthorized leaks of personal data, or
more seriously of identity theft, the number one and two issues are awareness and
alertness. The former relies upon frequently available updated information about the

                                                                                                          93
dangers and risks involved and of the need for adequate protection, from laws and
regulations (the ‘rights’) and from the practices used by data controllers (the potential for
‘wrongs’). A good example comes from the frequent changes in the privacy rules of social
media sites and user reactions to them, which is often to switch to other social media.
Where there is a real choice in the market, customers have real market power. Therefore,
one of the aims of an information campaign should be to give meaning to the term
‘informed consent.’

Alertness calls for self-aware and sensible behaviour by users. Often this comes with
experience as for example when a regular user of email has a sixth sense that an incoming
email is malicious and should not be opened or replied to and a web-link should not be
clicked on. On the other hand, fraud, sexual grooming, the release of passwords, all happen
all too often on the Internet because users are not careful or not controlled enough. So both
helpful information and education about sensible behaviour and etiquette on the Internet
are topics that policy makers and regulators can be pro-active about, especially if they work
closely with industry. Activities can include running safety and cyber-security workshops,
seminars and competitions, school and college visits, webinars and websites, and
recruitment of young volunteers to participate in peer-to-peer knowledge-sharing. Making
‘Safer Internet Day’ (SID) a big occasion will help.

Regulators should also take steps to update themselves and keep abreast of fast-moving
software developments, such as Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). As well as advising
users about these advances, regulators can review the adoption of security measures by
data centres and cloud computing service providers. In some industries, such as telecoms
and finance, reporting on their use could be part of a code of practice.

3.9.4 International Enforcement and Policy Cooperation
International cooperation and enforcement of privacy and data infringements can take
place through various mechanisms, including bilateral and multilateral efforts, through more
structured international organizations such as Interpol and through a mutual legal
assistance treaty (MLAT) between countries for the purposes of exchanging data and
information on legal and security issues.123

See the reference to MLAT above. Given the many different approaches and laws reviewed
above, it has been suggested that using the EU Directive as a general guideline is a good way
to ease data transfer issues, but even though this may bring recognition that cross-border
data transfers are acceptable it will not solve all the problems. Law enforcement will still be
necessary, especially when serious crime is involved.



123
      For a list of MLATs see http://www.legislation.gov.hk/table3ti.htm
                                                                                                94
There are several global and regional privacy and data protection organizations in addition
to law enforcement cooperation agencies such as Interpol. The Global Privacy Enforcement
Network 124 was started in 2010 following the adoption in 2007 by the OECD Council of the
Recommendation on Cross-border Cooperation in the Enforcement of Laws Protecting
Privacy125 which provided that

       “[m]ember countries should foster the establishment of an informal network of
       Privacy Enforcement Authorities and other appropriate stakeholders to discuss the
       practical aspects of privacy law enforcement co-operation, share best practices in
       addressing cross-border challenges, work to develop shared enforcement priorities,
       and support joint enforcement initiatives and awareness raisin g campaigns.”

By 2013, GPEN had 27 participating authorities, but none in Africa or the Middle East or
Latin America, and only Australia, New Zealand and South Korea in the Asia Pacific. As with
so many inter-government organizations, GPEN has a website that is restricted entry which
rather misses the point that open access is the way to encourage participation in an
interconnected world. However, countries who are members of the Asia Pacific Privacy
Authorities (APPA) receive regular updates in GPEN activities,126 and invitations to the
annual International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners.

Even where privacy commissioners and national agencies for data protection have not yet
been established, policy makers and regulators should consider establishing liaison points to
support national initiatives in this direction and regular attendance at these security forums.
In other words, policy makers and regulators should themselves practice awareness and
alertness to become more effective as catalysts in society and industry for greater personal
and public safety.

      Module Three: Law and Regulation for a Broadband World
3.10 Content over Broadband
The delivery of content, mostly as video, over broadband is one of the key drivers of
demand for broadband over fixed lines and by wireless. The days of FMS (fixed-mobile-
substitution) are already history as content can now be delivered to multiple devices, from
Internet high definition ‘connected TVs’ to handheld mobile devices of all kinds.

This is both a challenge and an opportunity for telecom companies who mostly own the
networks. By caching content at vantage points within their networks they can become
wholesale content distribution networks (CDNs) offering content service providers a
guaranteed quality of service that may not be available over the Internet. Their billing
relationship with customers and their knowledge of the local market are competitive
advantages to them. They can also deliver their own content and applications, but content
creation and applications innovation is not the traditional core competency of telecom
companies.

Regulators on the other hand face more of a challenge than an opportunity, apart from an
opportunity to get it right. It is to be expected that telecom companies baulk at the idea of
content service providers, independent CDNs or Internet access providers by-passing their
networks by going Over-The-Top (OTT). The only gain for the telecom company is that this
drives the demand for broadband and for higher speeds, for which they can charge
customers a fee. But against that they fear to lose revenues, especially from traditional
voice and SMS services for which OTT provide substitutes. How should regulators react to
the lobbying of telecom companies wanting to preserve their traditional core business? The
net neutrality debate in part already addresses this question, with the consensus of non-
carrier content providers being predictably against the right of telecom companies to block
or throttle or degrade content services which are not their own. This is also likely the
position favoured by most consumers.

The Challenge for Regulators

The challenge for policy makers and regulators is really twofold. How to ensure that there
will be sufficient investment in networks to maintain a steady level of innovation and
upgrade in broadband for society, and what laws and regulations to apply. The first
challenge is best addressed through opening the market to new entrants who are willing to
invest in networks. The fear that network owners will not be able to earn a sufficient rate of
return on their investment is really a fear that they will not be sufficiently adept and flexible
in the market to find new business models that work. Protection of incumbents is the
guaranteed way to make this fear real as rent seeking replaces competition.


                                                                                               96
The second challenge is actually the greater one. Pre-dating the Internet was cable TV as an
alternative to free-to-air (FTA) and Pay-TV broadcasting. The problem for regulators was
that cable was a wired-based medium and not a radio-based medium like broadcasting, so it
was close to being a carrier, and indeed could be adapted to carry telephony and when
upgraded to digital to providing Internet access. It also became a competitor to IPTV
provided by carriers. In different jurisdictions it was handled in different ways. In the US,
where cable, like the Internet, really started, the Communications Act of 1934 applied to
carriers and broadcasters under different parts of the law leaning heavily on the fixed line
and radio distinction, so the powers of the regulator over cable became a question of legal
interpretation for the courts. The courts decided that the law gave the regulator “ancillary”
powers to protect broadcasting and so cable regulations were mostly derived from the
impact cable would have on broadcasting, for example, threatening its advertising revenues.

In one case the court went further and upheld the FCC’s requirement that cable operators
should contribute to local content production through “mandatory origination” to achieve
public service goals not being adequately fulfilled by the broadcasters. A change of stance
by the FCC in 1976 repealed this requirement and replaced it by a new “access”
requirement whereby cable operators had to provide equal access to public, educational
and government services and to lease capacity to unaffiliated third parties. After some legal
wrangling, these conditions were embodied in the 1984 Cable Act.127

                                                Box 3.11
                                 Star TV in Hong Kong, SAR (China)

As in the USA, protection of FTA broadcasters was the initial reaction of the regulator in
Hong Kong to as independent new entrant to broadcasting.

In 1988 a company was formed to launch Star TV, a regional satellite TV broadcasting
service out of Hong Kong. Viewers could receive the signals through a C-band dish attached
to a cable distribution system. Before a broadcasting licence could be issued Star TV was
challenged by the Broadcasting Authority (BA) to prove that it would not compete directly
with local free-to-air broadcasters ATV and TVB and would not diminish their share of the
market and their advertising revenues. Star TV had to reassure the BA that its target market
was regional, not Hong Kong, and it would not be broadcasting in Cantonese, the local
majority Chinese language of Hong Kong. On this basis Star TV was allowed to start regional
operations in 1991.

The same line of reasoning was used in Hong Kong in the early 1990s as in the US with the
regulation of cable TV. Government had licensed FTA broadcasters to provide programmes

                                                                                                        97
for a mass public TV audience and regulations were designed to protect them. But
technologies rapidly outdated this regulatory stance. First came a licence for Wharf Cable TV
which, being a subscription service, was seen as less of a direct competitor to FTA. Then the
incumbent carrier, Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) was permitted to launch a Video-on-Demand
service again as a subscription service. This faltered, but was successfully resurrected in the
2000s as NOW TV, an IPTV service using DSL broadband. At the same time a new entrant
Hong Kong Broadband was licensed to launch a web-based TV service. The 2000s then
witnessed the rapid development of video content over broadband wireless access (BWA)
using 3G and more recently 4G and WiFI to smartphones and tablets. The latest twist to the
story is that with the shift to digital TV the FTA market is now being opened up, although
not before an unsuccessful legal challenge by the larger of the two FTA broadcasters.

The telecom and broadcasting regulators have been merged into the Office of the
Communications Authority (OFCA) and the cross-overs between OTA and over cable, over
broadband, over BWA and over the Web to multiple receiving devices have transformed the
market out of all recognition. In just two decades the challenge of regulating content over
broadband makes the policies and regulations of the early 1990s seem like another era
altogether.

As a consequence the Broadcasting Ordinance has been revised, with the distinctions
between technology means of delivery fading into the background, the key distinctions now
being whether the broadcast is free or subscription, and whether designed for a domestic or
a non-domestic audience as these are the criteria that most closely reflect the impact of TV
on Hong Kong society. Where the broadcast or the distribution originates in Hong Kong
these services require a licence and the Ordinance tries to protect licensed services by
outlawing a class of decoders designed to break the encryption of signals, but this is another
area in which technologies make the law difficult to apply in a comprehensive manner. And
with more OTT content becoming available, even decoders tend to become part of history.

Other forms of regulatory oversight include ownership restrictions on disqualified persons
or parties, cross-ownership restrictions to maintain competition and diversity of
programming and opinion, separations accounting between affiliated companies, and codes
of practice to restrict undesirable content or content at inappropriate times of broadcast.
Licencees are prohibited from broadcasting content that is likely to “(a) incite hatred again st
any group of persons, being a group defined by reference to colour, race, sex, religion,
nationality or ethnic or national origins; (b) result in a general breakdown in law and order;
or (c) gravely damage public health or morals.” (1) The Ordinance provides for an appeals
process and the courts of law rather than the regulator to be the ultimate arbiter.

Broadband and the Internet now pose similar challenges to those thrown up by cable TV for
the FCC. In the US the Internet had been treated by the FCC not as a carrier service but as an
information service. However, in April 2010, in the case of Comcast Corp. v. FCC, the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia decided that the FCC does not have
ancillary jurisdiction over Comcast's Internet service under the language of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended. (See Module 3.7.1). The FCC has also
traditionally defined other substitutes for carrier services, such as VoIP, as “enhanced”
services and therefore not subject to the same regulations as “basic” services. But these
definitions are really driven by their implications. A decision to encourage innovation and
allow a new service to flourish is served when the service is treated as unregulated or
regulated very lightly. The problem with defining according to traditional “basic” and
“enhanced” or “value-added” is that all telecom services are “value-added” including voice,
because without the transmission mechanism there would be no communication. And if it
were not adding value then no one would pay for it. The shift in regulatory perspective in
recent years has been away from these technologically-differentiated definitions, which
really have no objective basis to them, and towards technology-neutral and economic
regulation.

As with cable TV, Internet-based services cut across the technological separations of carriers
and broadcasters, including the fixed-wireless divide. But there is another separation that
has become increasingly blurred, the one between apps and content. The spread of P2P
communications using web-based applications, such as ‘torrents’, means for example, it is
possible to download different parts of a movie or video from many different servers over a
period of hours, or within minutes with fast enough broadband. Downloading a health check
app similarly provides the user with health care content, or an education app allows a user
to access education content and so on.

Most of these apps and the content they provide access to are provided by third parties.
They can be delivered by third parties. They are part of a vibrant digital economy. But they
can represent a challenge to the social norms and culture of a society and sometimes a
security risk. For example, in May 2013 an Internet posting in the USA provided a video of a
gun made from plastic by a 3D printer which was rendered legal under the Undetectable
Firearms Act of 1988 by having a piece of steel inserted into the body of the gun to make it
evident to a metal detector.128 The State Department demanded temporary take-down due
to a possible breach of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, but this may not apply
to the Internet if it is judged by the courts to be a “library” of information.

What Lessons?

Whatever the outcome of this particular case it is a good illustration of the many new
challenges to policy and regulation that content via the Internet throws up. So what lessons
can be drawn? The first is that in an interconnected world in which content can go viral
within minutes, and in which proxy servers can be used to by-pass national restrictions, the
law may not be a very effective means to control content. The second is that, rather like the
war on drugs, the most effective interventions are likely to be at the user end. At the benign
end of the scale are awareness and alertness campaigns and the use of Internet filtering
apps by parents and guardians to protect children.

At the other end of the scale is the use of the law. For example, it may be impossible to
prevent the uploading of child pornography somewhere in the world but cyber-detection
and law enforcement can identify users and break-up the crime rings that supply them.
However when the law is being used, the principle of proportionality is important and this is
mostly to be judged in terms of two factors: whether the intent itself was criminal or not
and the social impact of the infringements weighed against the rights of the individual of
freedom of access to the Internet.

3.10.1 Freedom of Opinions and Expression
In 2012 the United Nations General Assembly accepted a report from its Human Rights
Council that, among other things,

        Affirms that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online,
        in particular freedom of expression, which is applicable regardless of frontiers and
        through any media of one’s choice, in accordance with articles 19 of the Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
        Rights; 129

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a statement of human design. Societies make
choices, and the recognition of a ‘human right’ as a universal principle is an inhere nt part of
a democratic tradition whatever form it takes. The idea of a ‘human right’ hinges on the fact
that people will naturally demand it when they have the opportunity. While it cannot be
said that everyone in the world agrees on democracy and human rights, what can be
asserted with good reason is that global forces for change such as interconnected
broadband and the Internet, which can do so much to alleviate poverty, illiteracy, poor

health and other social ills and so much to improve the overall wellbeing of society, are not
compatible with too many restrictions on the freedom of expression, and not at all with the
efforts to restrict the freedom of thought.

It is important to stress these points as a guideline, because the challenges are very real.
Getting the balance right between freedom of expression and freedom to access and to use
the Internet on the one hand, and protecting society from serious problems is never going
to be an easy one to achieve, nor if achieved will it remain in balance forever. What the UN
Declaration of Human Rights provides is a good reality check on proportionality, on what
that balance should look like.
No society can be absolutely safe, no society can be absolutely free, but every society can be
resilient if the great majority of people are convinced of the goals. Different societies have
different priorities, different needs, enjoy different cultural traditions, and the resilience of
every society will be determined by how far they can adjust to these global changes. The
role of the Internet in giving ordinary people a voice cannot be over-estimated and
regulators have an important role to play one way or the other. Social media in particular
represents a genuine opportunity for user-generated news and analysis and is having
repercussions throughout the world.

But there are clouds on the horizon as every action causes a reaction. At the highest levels
there are serious debates about Internet governance and what should be the respective
roles of governments and civil society. This has become a controversial issue among
member states of the ITU for example, where some members argue a need for greater state
involvement and others see this as a dangerous way to rein-in freedoms on the Internet.
There are also pressures on social media organizations to exercise some degree of editorial
control over what appears on their sites. In some cases this is really about content that may
be considered extreme and harmful to society, such as the spreading of race or religious
hatred or homophobia or gratuitous violence. In other cases it may be about clamping down
on freedoms of expression and information. For example, at times in during the Arab Spring
in some countries the regulator closed down mobile networks and occasionally the Internet
also became unavailable. In emergencies such extreme actions might reduce the immediate
likelihood of violence, or they might be an act in a political conflict that only exacerbates
tension. The cost of such actions is to reduce transparency and the free flow of information.

Policy makers and regulators should therefore bear two things in mind. First, what are the
social consequences and implications of taking or not taking action and is this better left up
to the courts of law. Second, are the actions being proposed designed to strengthen and
safeguard social freedoms, or simply to serve and protect vested interests.

3.10.2 Regulating Specific Forms of Content
As the case of Hong Kong illustrates, the old distinctions between content and content
channels is breaking down. Under the traditional approach, regulators would rightly see FTA
broadcasting as having the greatest social impact and therefore the regulation of content
considered inappropriate was more strictly applied. Subscription channels reached smaller
audiences of self-selected viewers, and in the early days of the Internet receiving content
online was limited to highly specialised users. Those distinctions are rapidly losing their
validity. People of all ages can access virtually any content over the Internet, some of it
highly disturbing, using a mobile phone.

In a sense, all channels are equal, it’s just that some are more equal than others. Most
families have TVs, and most individuals have mobile devices. In some countries broadband is
widely available, in others not, but it is only a question of time and the availability of high
speed broadband is the driver of these content channels. The supply of content is also
becoming diversified as never before, from the big movie makers and the TV in-house
productions, to the professional and the amateur videos on You Tube, to local content
providers trying to become a business, to content on social media networks, to downloaded
P2P content. There are no all-embracing standards for rating this cornucopia of content.
Some regulators, for example in Singapore, are suggesting a code of practice by which
content providers such as Internet access providers like Yahoo! will not only commit to
making local content but will rate it appropriately for audience guidance.

This does inevitably raise the issue of a more libertarian approach to regulation. Exposure to
family shows on TV which openly discuss issues of sexuality, mortality, and similar ‘adult’
themes has been a factor in changing social attitudes, and it may not be the attitudes of the
young that are changing because their attitudes are already conditioned by the technologies
and the social discourse of their peers around them. It is rather the attitudes of older
generations that are being challenged to change with the times, the generations to which
most policy makers and regulators themselves belong, and seeing things through futuristic
eyes is not always easy. The point here is that it may become impossible, despite regulations,
to shield society from exposure to all sorts of challenging content. Society itself has to
adjust to this by becoming more resilient to these challenges, and more self-confident is
meeting them. This starts with home and family and school and college environments, and
regulators will perhaps need to shift their perspectives from trying to regulate what cannot
be regulated to engaging more closely with all stakeholders, from providers to users, to
support society in managing these challenges.

Child Safety

Of particular concern to all stakeholders of the Internet is the safety of children: in particular
safety from inappropriate content, from child abuse and the dangers of sexual predators
                                                                                              102
and from trafficking. There are two aspects that should be noted with particular care: online
behaviour and dangerous websites. In 2010 the ITU also launched a Child Online Protection
(COP) initiative, including the allocation of number 116111 for help lines,130 and issued a
Guideline for Policy Makers for Child Online Protection.131 The reality is that infants below
the age of five can now readily use the Internet and laws and regulations will not prevent
predators, nor prevent children being able to access unsuitable material,132 which means
that at a large part of the focus must be on helping parents and guardians how to educate
the children in their care to conduct and protect themselves online. Regulators also need to
be aware, as ICANN has pointed out, of unscrupulous ‘fast flux hosting’ whereby “operators
automate domain name service updates to hide the location of web sites where illegal
activities – IP Piracy (music, videos, games), hosting of child pornography, hosting of
phishing systems, sales of illegal pharmaceuticals, and execution of identity theft and
fraud – are performed.”133 Children can very innocently find them themselves in a
completely wrong environment.

3.10.3 Intellectual Property Rights
Intellectual property (IP), copyright in particular, is always an issue for Internet companies,
especially in an era of user-generated content and content going viral. For example, take-
down notices are difficult to enforce. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)
has put in place rules addressing interoperability, a key principle behind Internet neutrality,
through the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.
The guidelines are, however, only related and limited to the prohibition of the
circumvention of certain technological measures to gain access to protected digital works.134
Regulators and Internet companies are grappling with appropriate and effective codes of
practice with regard to safe use, copyright infringements, hate content, child pornography,
libel, and so on. The only effective way forward is if there is industry agreement, but often
the debate becomes infused with political, social, religious and cultural deliberations which
can result in unrealistic solutions.



IP issues always put policy-makers and regulators under pressure from lobby groups, and
there exists a panoply of trade agreements that commit signatory countries to protect
patents, trademarks, copyright, designs and geographical indicators for country of origin,

ranging from the World Trade Agreement (WTO) which administers the Agreement on
Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) under the auspices of the
World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) to multilateral (MTAs) and bilateral treaty
agreements (BTAs) and Free Trade Agreements (FTAs).135 These agreements need to take
into account the very different stages of economic development and administrative capacity
of the countries involved. For example, the context of the 2008 Economic Partnership
Agreement between the CARIFORUM Latin American states and the European Community,
given in Article 131 includes the sentence:

        [The Parties] recognize that the protection and enforcement of intellectual property
        plays a key role in fostering creativity, innovation and competitiveness, and are
        determined to ensure increasing levels of protection appropriate to their levels of
        development.136

The reference to “appropriate to their levels of development” is telling for a number of
reasons. Take software piracy as an example. Although more and more countries are
developing a capability in software development, the economies of scale that are required
to make operating systems and utility programmes commercially valid act as a brake on less
developed countries. Because the price of imported software can be high relative to
personal incomes in these countries the incentive for many users is to use pirated copies.
Although officially frowned upon it is nevertheless widely recognized that it can be a way to
kick-start an ICT market in low-income country. It is interesting to note that as China has
reached an advanced stage in writing software coding, Chinese developers are among the
strongest advocates of IPRs within China.137 The same pattern of development can be
expected in other countries and in other economic sectors.

Policy makers and regulators are undoubtedly under pressure to enter trade agreements to
gain access to major markets, and as further rounds of WTO negotiations have faltered in
recent years an increasing number of FTAs and BTAs have emerged, including the Trans-
Pacific Partnership (TPP) initiative led by the USA.138 Many contain IPR provisions which are
controversial because the countries owning most IP are the wealthier nations, and
economists are divided on how far IPR issues should be part of trade negotiations. These
are, by definition, issues of political economy. The business of trade negotiators and policy
makers is to find mutually-beneficial workable compromises, but it is important in market-
oriented economies that regulators remain as far as possible neutral and honest brokers for
the ICT industries under their authority.

Regulation and IPRs

In the ICT sector, as in other industries such as pharmaceuticals, IPRs have become a battle
ground for companies in fierce competition with each other over issues such as ownership
of algorithms to trade-mark designs. Whereas disputes between companies are usually civil
law cases, under Article 61 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights (TRIPs) signatory countries are required to establish criminal laws to cover
cases of "willful trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy on a commercial scale".
However, often individuals can get caught up in criminal cases, and once again it is
important for the sake of equity and practicality to exercise proportionality when applying
the law.

One approach to online copyright violations has been the “three strikes” approach whereby
the regulator issues two warnings and then applies a penalty, such as broadband
disconnection, a fine or referral to a law court. France introduced a “three strikes” law in
2010 and by September 2012 the High Authority for the Distribution of Works and
Protection of Rights on the Internet (HADOPI) had issued over 1.1 million first warnings, of
which 9% were followed by second warnings of which 0.3% (14 cases) were taken to
court.139 In the first case to be heard the court imposed a fine. But critics see a danger of
over-reaction to downloading when it is technologically difficult to stop, and complain that
by making it a criminal rather than a civil offence public resources are used to protect
private, mostly corporate, property rights. The counter-arguments include the economic
impact copyright theft can have upon local content, such as a local movie industry, and theft
is theft even though digital theft unlike physical theft may not deprive the owner of the
original asset. As always, the arguments will be influenced by the questions of intent and
proportionality and effectiveness.140

Other innovate approaches have been tried. For example, Google decided to offer copyright
holders who could prove their content had been illegally posted on You Tube one of three
options: to take down, to keep up with acknowledgement, to keep up and share in
advertising revenue associated with visitors viewing the content. Needless to say, this last
option has proved popular and in some cases profitable. Regulators might consider
encouraging other win-win approaches.

    Stealing an apple from a tree leaves behind other apples and the tree, whereas stealing a marrow that wins
a prize for its size deprives the owner of a valuable asset and causes hurt. Both are theft, but the consequences
differ. The law may determine liability for the action and determine punishment for the consequences.
                                                                                                            105
The basis of accountability is transparency. This is true of government and of the private
sector. One of many initiatives to improve the level of transparency and openness is the
OECD-backed Global Privacy Enforcement Network ("GPEN"), a global network of privacy
enforcement authorities working together to protect the privacy rights of individuals. In
May 2013, for example, GPEB organized an Internet Privacy Sweep ("the Sweep") by 19
participating authorities. The capacity of regulators to carry out industry and market
research of this nature is often limited in developing countries, but to develop such capacity
is a move in the right direction as it can only lead to better informed public policy.

Another good example of openness is the decision of UNESCO to make its digital
publications free for anyone to download under a worldwide open license. 141 UNESCO was
the first member of the United Nations to adopt such an Open Access policy for its
publications. In 2010 The World Bank announced it will offer free access to more than 2,000
financial, business, health, economic and human development statistics that had mostly
been available only to paying subscribers.142 This sets an important principle that publically-
funded data collection, research and publication should be made freely-available, subject
only to certain confidentiality rules. In lower income countries policy-makers and regulators
will certainly benefit from having this added source available to make more informed
decisions, and it follows an important trend in education by some of the world’s leading
universities to place their course materials online free of charge.143 The World Bank is also
supporting local open data Initiatives to make government data more open and online, for
example the LGU Research Project in the Philippines.144

Regulators would do well to examine their own websites and databases to judge how
transparent they are to their own public. A better informed public will be able to provide
regulators with better informed feedback which in turn will make regulation more
responsive and more effective.

EXTENDING UNIVERSAL BROADBAND
        ACCESS AND USE

                                1
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 A brief history of universal access

Early developments in universal access and service policies targeted public and private access to
copper based telephony services. By the start of the 21st century, fixed-line residential and fixed
public payphone were included within most existing universal access and service definitions.

National programs promoting expansion of copper line networks and telephony services were
reflected through measures such as the establishment of public telephone access centres and
provision of private telephone connections to homes and businesses. The development of cellular
mobile services was also a key means of expanding the reach of telephony services. As universal
coverage of basic voice telephony services became close to reality in many countries and with the
growing recognition of internet, particularly broadband services, as a key means of achieving
economic and social goals, governments have in recent years turned their focus towards securing
affordable high speed broadband access.

Initially using spare capacity in the telephone network, the internet is now the main driver of
demand for network capacity. Growing innovation and technological advancements, especially
with wireless and mobile products and their application, have enabled the rapid dispersion of
broadband-capable services in areas that were previously inaccessible. These advancements,
combined with market forces and a well-designed legislative framework, make broadband
proliferation and penetration possible.


4.1.2 Legislative efforts to provide universal broadband access

Private sector initiatives and investment are, and have proven to be, crucial to achieving
widespread broadband access and use. But when market mechanisms alone do not meet the
goals set for broadband access and use the important question that arises is what role should
government play?

Although policy makers generally aim to expand broadband service coverage as much as possible
with minimal government intervention, some degree of intervention may be required to
complement the market and overcome impediments to universal broadband. It is important for
policymakers to remember that universal access policies should not be a policy substitute for
regulatory reforms to make markets operate more efficiently.1

The objective of universality policies is to provide or maintain service to those who would not
normally be served by market forces alone. In the context of broadband access, unserved or
underserved groups include people living in rural areas or other high cost service areas, low
income populations, and people with physical disabilities who may have difficulty using standard
equipment. Gaps in availability, accessibility and affordability of broadband will typically remain
between and within countries where government intervention is absent.

                                                                                                      2
Countries have varied in the boldness of their goals and methods to secure universal access to
broadband. National broadband plans and strategies often provide targets for broadband rollout
to populations or priority groups and communities, and indicate a clear commitment by
governments to support the establishment of advanced infrastructure. A number of countries
have already moved to include broadband as a universal service, as in Australia and the United
Kingdom, and some countries go even further – Finland made broadband a legal right for its
citizens in 2010. Yet in 2010, of the 99 developing countries with a universal access or service
definition only 49 included internet dial-up and only 36 included broadband within their
definition.2 A table of data identifying the number of internet users per 100 people in countries
with population over 50 million is can be found at Attachment A.

As Next Generation Access (NGA) and national backhaul networks are rolled out across developed
and developing nations there is a growing momentum towards ensuring access to these
networks. This is being driven by the social and economic concerns of both policymakers and
populations. This creates opportunities and challenges for governments. How can governments
help facilitate access to networks, doing so in partnership with private enterprises? How can fair
access to networks be balanced against the need for the networks to deliver a return on
investment to those who build them?

As a starting point, many governments have already adopted broadband plans setting out policy
goals. Although the official definition of broadband is contentious, national governments have set
their own target minimum speeds, typically reflecting expected future rates of usage. In Australia,
the National Broadband Network Company (NBN Co) will provide superfast access at bit rates of
up to 100 Mbps in order to meet anticipated future demand. A terraced approach also exists in a
number of countries, such as in Malaysia where, under its High Speed Broadband (HSBB) service,
designated high economic impact areas will receive access at 10 Mbps, with businesses receiving
up to 1,000 Mbps (1 Gbps).3

This chapter will provide an overview of the policy mechanisms being utilised by governments to
ensure that populations have access to broadband products and services, and outline what
policymakers can do to define a broadband development strategy capable of addressing market
failures, work towards achieving universal broadband service and address potential policy
challenges.

This chapter will discuss the different levels of intervention that a government strategy may
pursue, the role of private-led competitive markets in achieving these objectives, the role of the
government in narrowing or eliminating gaps between markets and a country’s development
needs, and the design of effective government strategies to meet this challenge. Finally, this
chapter will examine the use of fiscal resources to support private supply of broadband, including
choice of policy instruments, the use of subsidies, and mechanisms to collect and disburse funds
for subsidy.

4.2 Universal Access Strategy and Broadband Development
The concept of universal access to telecommunications must be extended from pure telephony to
encompass broadband services. Technology adoption is recognized as a major contributing factor
to development, and the economic and social differences in communities on each side of the
‘digital divide’ are pronounced. Access to broadband services is recognized as a driver of
economic growth, promoting efficiency and overcoming geographic market restrictions.4 World
Bank statistics indicate that a ten per cent increase in penetration of selected ICTs may increase
Gross Domestic Product growth per capita by up to 1.38 percentage points.5

Beyond this, access to information and the ability to communicate opinions contribute to a
country’s education and political systems. Public services such as remote health advice and
disaster warning systems are improved through the construction of nationwide communication
networks. As a result of these benefits, the World Bank and other international organizations are
encouraging infrastructure development plans and governmental schemes to promote broadband
use and accessibility in underserved areas.

The United Nations’ Millennium Development project aims to achieve affordable and reliable
access to broadband services for all by ensuring that all countries will have a national broadband
plan in place or include broadband access in their national service definitions by 2015.6 Most
countries have preferred the more proactive approach of implementing a national broadband
plan.7 The approach adopted by a government depends on whether it seeks to intervene to drive
or facilitate development, or whether it prefers to rely on market forces to increase coverage. A
national broadband plan should set out desired outcomes, rather than to specify the technologies
sought to be implemented.

  The ITU analyses research on the impact of broadband penetration upon developing and developed
economies in ‘The Impact of Broadband on the Economy: Research to Date and Policy Issues ’, April 2012.
Overall the conclusion is that an increase in broadband penetration does lead to an increase in GDP growth.

is also observed in countries which are developed. Booz & Co analysed broadband penetration of 20 OECD
                                                                                      st
countries between 2002 and 2007 in ‘Digital Highways: The Role of Government in 21 -Century
Infrastructure’ 2009. The study concluded that countries which were consistently in the top five for
broadband penetration had an average annual GDP growth of 3.86 per cent, whilst in the countries with the
bottom five broadband penetration, annual GDP growth was 1.67 per cent. Available at:

and harmonising its approach to ICT with those of its Caribbean neighbours in order to achieved
increased uptake of internet technologies, St Kitts and Nevis has entered into PPP arrangements
with telecoms providers LIME and The Cable in order for schools to be provided with free internet
access ensuring that the next generation is proficient with the use of broadband technologies.
Providers have also supported government policies to train citizens in how to use broadband
technologies by providing the equipment and internet access to community centres to run
internet usage courses to teach basic online skills to the wider community.

As demonstrated in Malaysia, licensees providing service to rural areas under the High Speed
Broadband Network plan have been given permission to use TD-LTE services, rather than WiMAX,
as initially planned. Ensuring that major network backbones are suitably positioned to support a
variety of technologies will allow flexibility to adapt last mile services to the best solution
available at the relevant time.


4.2.1 Achieving Universal Access

Universal access can be accomplished when either:

               in response to demand for services, private entities decide independently to
                extend their network coverage;

               regulatory measures are put in place to require private entities to extend their
                existing networks; or

               governments fund infrastructure projects to increase network coverage.

Governments can play a role in ensuring sufficient demand for paid broadband subscriptions by, if
necessary, encouraging the use of the internet in a productive and enriching manner. A coherent
and comprehensive national broadband plan is necessary to ensure that broadband development
is successful across both steps and will create the intended benefits.8

The success of countries that have implemented holistic plans that incorporate both of these
policy steps, including Korea, Japan and Canada, is testament to the efficacy of this approach.

In each country unique hurdles will have to be overcome. Encouraging adoption of existing
networks in the European Union, extension of service to isolated rural areas in Australia and
subsidising access technology in Malaysia are good examples of tailored policy approaches to local
conditions.

between rich and poor and produced a roadmap to develop a more inclusive information society
called e-Sri Lanka. Closing the information gap between rich and poor was achieved by a blended
policy and regulatory approach of encouraging greater competition by the awarding of additional
sector licences, coupled with early licencing of 3G spectrum. The presence of 4
telecommunications operators forced the telcos to move away from skimming profits from
servicing only the rich and middle class consumers of Sri Lanka to a model which profits from high
volumes of users who only spend a small amount of pre-paid disposable income on internet and
data services, thus increasing universal access amongst poorer Sri Lankans.

4.2.1.1 Service Quality

The purpose behind implementing a universal access plan must be reflected in the bit rate
provided under the relevant broadband development scheme. Many of the functions that
universal access seeks to provide, including telemedicine and tele-learning, require access at up to
100 Mbps, while standard applications such as email and web browsing can function speeds as
low as 0.5 Mbps.10 High broadband upload rates facilitate a collaborative online environment by

encouraging user contribution, while high download rates enhance the accessibility of content.
High bit transfer rates enable interactive functions such as real time feedback and video calling.

It is advisable that access to ‘high-speed broadband’ be specified in universal access models. Even
where the headline rate is sufficient, frequently consumer experience of a broadband connection
will be substantially less. Other factors, including throughput and latency must also be taken into
account. For instance, the Ethernet port of an ADSL modem will report connectivity at its
particular line rate while the actual connection rate is determined by the distance from the DSL
access multiplexer in the exchange building and the quality of the copper lines. Similarly, a
wireless connection rate will depend on the use of others on the same access network and the
backhaul capacity from the relevant base station to the core network.

In some instances there is an additional issue of service providers submitting false compliance
reports on the quality of broadband services they offer. In India, the telecommunications
regulator has addressed this by imposing fines on providers found to have made such
statements.11 In South Korea, all buildings are to be designed to enable high-speed connections,
and assigned ratings to communicate to potential residents the bit rate supported.12

Government spectrum allocation decisions impact wireless service quality, while fixed line
services can be improved by upgrading the network quality and ensuring customers have access
to sufficiently advanced modem technology.

Countries at times adopt different target bit rates based on the forecasted use in different areas.
This may particularly be the case where governments are required to fund or subsidize
infrastructure or subscription costs. In Australia, the National Broadband Network that is currently
under construction plans to provide broadband access at bit rates of up to 100 Mbps. Conversely,
in the European Union the required base rate is to be 30 Mbps, although the Digital Agenda aims
to encourage 50 per cent of subscribers to pay for access at over 100 Mbps. In Malaysia
broadband and universal service policies are separate, and levels of access are terraced by region.
Under the HSBB service, households under the designated high economic impact areas receive
minimum of 10 Mbps, while businesses in these areas will receive up to 1000 Mbps.


4.2.2 Levels of Access

The levels of access provided under a universal broadband access scheme may be assessed
according to the proportion of the population that are able to access the internet and the
locations from where access is achieved. Establishing individual fixed broadband connections for
all households and businesses may not be a viable option in all areas due to the associated costs,
lack of demand and geographical constraints. At times, governments must assess the underlying
goals of their universal access strategy and prioritise the most cost effective means to achieve
those. The extent to which existing systems can be upgraded as opposed to new systems having

broadband connections to individual users and households, while Part 4.2.3 explores additional
approaches to facilitating communal and institutional access.


4.2.2.1 Individual Users and Households

Connecting individual users and households to a broadband network represents optimal service
penetration. Household connections overcome restrictions to access in other settings such as age,
employment situation or educational background.13 Broadband usage by households has
increased as access costs become more affordable and service coverage extends.14 Household
internet access in developed countries has consistently been higher than in the developing
world.15 In 2011, 70.3 per cent of households in developed countries had internet access,
compared with 20.5 per cent of developing countries.16 The Broadband Commission for Digital
Development (Broadband Commission), a joint initiative of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),
targets 40 per cent of houses in developing countries to have internet access by 2015.17

Studies in the United States found that home broadband users overwhelmingly valued the social
aspects of internet use, citing the ease of communicating with family and friends and content
sharing applications as the most important functions.18 Access to information, news and
entertainment are also important, as is the ability to engage in e-commerce through shopping and
selling goods online. The educational value of home internet access is frequently highlighted, as
research has shown that children with internet access at home perform better in school.19

In many countries, the extension of direct fixed line service networks to individual homes is
included in universal access targets. Governments have adopted a variety of strategies in order to
attain such connections.

Box 4.3: CASE STUDY: Extending broadband networks through regulation

Regulatory tools may be used to increase market entry and competition, while minimising the
input governments are required to contribute. Models which have separate sources of supply at
each “layer” tend to promote competition more effectively than vertically integrated supply. This
drives policies which seek structural or functional separation between the elements of the
network on the grounds that a vertically integrated approach may inhibit investment by
competitors and new entrants. In Singapore this strategy was initially adopted, however it proved
insufficient to extend coverage to a satisfactory level within the time limit this was required. In
Finland, a regulatory approach was also adopted when the Finnish Communications Regulator
required 26 designated telecommunications operators to provide connectivity of at least 1 Mbps
for all consumers and businesses at their permanent place of residence.

Finland is part of a growing global trend that identifies the communications and educational
opportunities afforded by broadband as so basic a foundation for adequate functioning in modern
society and accessing opportunities that it has become a fundamental right of all human beings
that governments must protect. Spain has taken a similar approach to the rollout of basic
broadband speeds and there is strong political support in Estonia that broadband is essential for
modern society, which led to a massive investment in Estonia of broadband facilities in rural
areas.

Legal challenges have also confirmed that broadband access is gaining recognition as a basic
human right. A 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Costa Rica confirmed that internet access is so
essential to modern day communication and expression and was a tool to access other rights such
as participation in society and self-government that the Court held that internet access itself was
a human right. Similarly, in France the Constitutional Court delivered a judgment striking down a
French law which proposed to cut internet access to people who were considered to be guilty of
illegally downloading content. The French court argued that broadband was essential to access
information and give free expression to ideas and political dialogue. Although Finland is one of the
forerunners of this rights based regulatory approach, it is likely many other sttes will follow suit.

Regulatory intervention may not be appropriate in all circumstances. In the United States
attempts to regulate the telecommunications market have been met with protracted litigation
from incumbent local exchange carriers.20 When constructing the National Broadband Plan in
2010, the United States Federal Communications Commission specifically referred to the
possibility State governments might intervene to provide infrastructure and broadband services
to individual premises in areas where private enterprises do not. This approach was more
palatable than imposing regulations requiring extension of coverage into non-profitable regions,
while still working towards the universal access goal of connecting 100 million Americans to
broadband services.

Box 4.4: CASE STUDY: Infrastructure development to extend broadband networks

Investment in network infrastructure reduces the initial capital investment for market entrants,
encouraging pricing competition, and also extends coverage to areas where this may not
otherwise have been commercially viable. In Australia the government-funded National
Broadband Network Company will construct a high-speed wholesale broadband network that
serves every home through a combination of fibre, fixed wireless and satellite services. Although
this is a far more substantial task than only providing connections in areas where they are not
currently available, this model allows the higher costs of rural rollout to be offset against the
lower costs of connections in urban areas.

In Canada the government has also funded infrastructure development, but restricts this to areas
where private coverage is not sufficient. In 2009 a $225 million (US$217 million) subsidy was
allocated to extend access to around 3 million people who did not have access to broadband
services, including the high-profile projects to provide satellites to the remote Far North Nunavut
and Northern Territories. A major benefit of the single wholesale provider model is that in
addition to regulating price, a single national infrastructure may also ensure that sufficient
backbone services and long haul data transmission are provided.


4.2.2.2 Demand Creation

It is particularly important in countries which extend networks to individual and households that
customers exhibit sufficient demand for broadband services. In situations where broadband
networks grow organically without regulatory intervention, broadband take-up and coverage
figures should follow a similar trajectory, as providers will improve upon the service they offer in
order to meet demand. Where universal service capacity is achieved through government
encouragement, individual users must take up paid subscriptions with service providers in order
for models to remain sustainable. A United States Federal Communications Commission Report
on home broadband use cited cost, lack of digital literacy and a feeling access was irrelevant to a
person’s life as reasons for not taking up available broadband services available.21 Cost is
addressed below in Part 4.2.4.2, while this section will explore examples of the measures adopted
by governments to increase the relevance of broadband services to people’s lives and improve
digital literacy.

There is a direct correlation between high household broadband use and areas in which a holistic
universal service strategy has been implemented.22 While a recent OECD report has suggested
that governments need to play more than a ‘push’ role of providing ICT infrastructure and

21
   United States Federal Communications Commission Report on home broadband use in 2010 concluded
that of the 35 per cent of Americans who did not have home broadband access, 36 per cent stated this was
due to the cost, 22 per cent lacked the requisite digital literacy to make use of broadband, and 19 per cent
claimed it was irrelevant to their lives. John B. Horrigan, ‘Broadband Adoption and Use in America’ (OBI

   ITU Statistics: in 2012, 70.9 per cent of households in Europe, 51.1 per cent in The Americas, 37.3 per cent
in the Commonwealth of Independent States (ie former Soviet Republics) 25.7 per cent in Arab States, 24.5
per cent in Asia Pacific, and 4.1 per cent of Households in Africa had internet access.

development of a domestic ICT sector,23 it is also important that they adopt ‘pull’ strategies aimed
at promoting digital literacy, establishing an appropriate legal framework surrounding internet
use and fostering the development of local content.

Box 4.5: CASE STUDY: ‘Pull’ strategies in the European Union and South Korea

The European Union’s Digital Agenda provides a good example of a ‘pull’ strategy focused on
facilitating certain uses of a broadband connection. By 2011 the whole of Europe had achieved
universal broadband coverage by satellite and around 95 per cent coverage by fixed line.
However, this coverage did not translate automatically into broadband subscriptions.

The European Commission’s Digital Agenda Scoreboard demonstrates that the percentage of
households with a broadband connection has increased dramatically from 14.9 per cent in 2004
to 67.3 per cent in 2011. The Digital Agenda aims to increase take up of broadband subscriptions
and to encourage particular uses of broadband services supported by a secure high-speed
connection. Targets include 50 per cent of the population buying products online and 50 per cent
of the population using e-Government. In pursuance of its goals, digital ‘to-do’ lists are published
annually, detailing the measures required to encourage adoption of these new use habits.

In addition, digital education is encouraged in order to enable EU citizens to take full advantage of
the benefits of broadband, with the aim of reducing the population that have never used the
internet before to 15 per cent. The success of the policy can be seen in OECD statistics that
suggest the European Union has some of the highest household broadband access rates in the
developed world.24


A similar project was undertaken in South Korea. The Korean government’s broadband strategy
envisioned a ‘knowledge-based economy’ in which every citizen would have access to a personal
computer and government would expedite development of an information infrastructure. Several
initiatives were put in place, including regulatory efforts to encourage infrastructure investment
by incumbents and market entrants, subsidies for low income citizens to purchase computers, and
free digital literacy programs encouraging internet use as a means of obtaining information,
providing entertainment, and accessing government services. South Korea further stimulated
demand by targeting much of this training to homemakers, who are typically married women not
in the workforce but who have a large amount of discretion in the organisation of household
finances. The theory was that by convincing homemakers of the benefits of broadband, demand
would be stimulated for household uptake and ensure the next generation of South Koreans
would have access to broadband as their parents accessed such services. The targeted training
was a successful approach to driving broadband uptake as the proportion of South Korean women
who utilise broadband is much higher than their counterparts in Singapore, China, Taiwan and the

rest of the region.25 In this way, top down and bottom up approaches were combined so that
incentives to improve service to citizens would be met by increased demand for services. South
Korea now leads the developing world in household internet connections. By June 2011, 97.2 per
cent of households in South Korea were connected to the internet.26


Other governments have implemented regulation to directly create demand:

               in Japan it was mandated that all administrative agencies must buy their
                broadband services from the Next Generation National Broadband Network;

               in Sweden, companies that purchase PCs for their employees receive subsidies
                and household that install broadband can receive tax deductions for the costs of
                installation up to approximately US$650. Computer ownership and the cost of
                hardware and software upgrades have been found to be a factor contributing to
                lower broadband uptake27 ;

               In Denmark broadband can be offered to employees as a tax-free fringe benefit
                which was a tailored demand creation mechanisms which took into account the
                relatively high income tax rates in Denmark and found that providing broadband
                as a form of employment benefit would be more effective at stimulating uptake28;
                and

               in Bahrain, the government has a policy of encouraging the use of the internet to
                deliver government services and involve citizens in decision-making. Over 200
                services are offered online, including payment of utility bills and traffic fines,
                tourist visa applications, driver’s licence renewals and student exam result
                delivery.

4.2.2.3 Mobile Access

While household access is simpler to measure, individual access figures incorporating the access
of individual household members may be a more relevant developmental indicator. Many
governments include mobile broadband penetration in assessments of whether universal service
is available.30 Individuals with mobile subscriptions may not have access to a household
connection, yet still have access to broadband services. In many areas across all stages of
development, mobile broadband subscriptions have overtaken fixed line ones. By the end of
2011, the United Nations estimated that 45 per cent of the world’s population was covered by a
high-speed (3G) mobile broadband service.31

Mobile technology can overcome major infrastructure barriers to internet access, and access
devices are cheaper and more portable than computers. However, capacity, quality and data
transfer rate can remain problematic. The expansion of mobile broadband subscriptions needs to
be coupled with adequate investment in robust backbone networks, as well as a careful spectrum
allocation plan. The broadband capabilities of mobile devices should also be examined. Some
functions, like reading and constructing long documents, may be sufficiently necessary to
achieving universal access goals to warrant computer broadband connection being included in a
country’s definition of universal access.

4.2.2.4 Smartphone Adoption

Continued growth in smartphone adoption poses a challenge to extending universal broadband
access and use as a number of previous studies have shown that an increase in the number of
smartphones leads to a decrease in fixed telecommunications lines.32 The relatively recent advent
of smartphones which utilise 3G broadband technology poses the question as to whether a similar
substitutability of access methods will occur, leading to a decrease in fixed connections. Put
another way, the question is will consumers choose to access broadband simply from 3G
smartphones rather than from computer broadband connections? There is a paucity of hard
evidence as to whether this is the case although some industry analysts have predicted that
smartphones will come to be utilised in a complimentary way to computer-based broadband
connections.33 ] Arguably there is still a need for fixed broadband that is not met by 3G broadband,
particularly for increasingly popular content services and business functions which still remain
challenging to access on smartphone technology. Fixed broadband connected to adequate
backhaul networks is better able to cope with large volumes of data traffic which is a challenge for

4.2.3 Communal and Institutional Access

Universal access to broadband does not require direct service to individual premises. In some
national broadband strategies access in businesses, educational and government premises is
prioritised. This may be due to prohibitively high costs of internet-enabled devices, paying
subscription fees and financing last mile connections. In addition, while many national broadband
schemes may be subsidised or supported by governments, ultimately the aim is to create systems
that support themselves through charging for use. If individual subscribers are unable or unwilling
to pay for broadband, institutional or community provision may be a more appropriate solution,
at least in the interim while demand for individual fixed lines is being promoted.

Community centres and institutional access may also help to supplement mobile phone use of
broadband services in situations where a larger computer is required. For example, basic
searching and email may be carried out by mobile phone, whereas creating complicated
documents requires a larger device such as a tablet, laptop or desktop.


4.2.3.1 Community Access Centres

Community access centres allow individuals to access internet services either free of charge or at
an appropriate rate. The size and frequency of these centres can be adjusted according to the
requirements of individual communities. Computer education programs can be run from the
same centres, teaching people to draw optimal benefit from their internet access and creating
demand for broadband connections in homes. Demand can later be met by the expansion of
national broadband networks to homes or through private financing of last mile connections from
the access centre node.

Box 4.6: CASE STUDY: Community Access Centres

In Malaysia, in addition to the national broadband rollout scheme, universal access has been
brought to rural areas by creating 3100 ‘wireless villages’ and 796 ‘telecenters’. Wireless villages
have at least three Wi-Fi spots in them to deliver data at 2 – 4 Mbps, and operate in conjunction
with a system of distributing 1 million netbooks to poor students. Telecenters each contain 5 – 20
personal computers for community use. Similarly in India the Universal Service Obligation Fund
provides kiosks connected to rural fixed line broadband exchanges. Kiosk workstations provide
internet browsing and other broadband applications, such as video calling, access to online
education and health services at subsidised rates. The benefit of this strategy is that any
interested community member may become involved.

There are some difficulties associated with community access centres that need to be overcome.
In South Africa theft of computer equipment has been a problem, while in the Dominican
Republic the national telecommunications operator INDOTEL provided the technical
infrastructure to run community access centres but did not remain involved to ensure that
centres were well-managed. Measures should be taken to ensure that access centre assets are
adequately protected and that centres are maintained. However, in theory the community access
approach strikes an attractive balance between universal access and cost-reduction.

4.2.3.2 Institutional Access

Some countries prioritise access in educational and governmental institutions. Broadband services
open access to a large network of sources of information, including multimedia sources and
online tutorials. These are seen to smooth out inherent disadvantages of some learning
environments by allowing learners access to the same resources and ‘teachers’ from anywhere
with a broadband connection.35 Institutional access may also be material in increasing content
available in certain languages, a factor which has been recognised as important to stimulating
demand for broadband services.36

Box 4.7: CASE STUDY: Institutional Access

Strategies prioritising institutional access vary. In the United States the National Broadband Plan
provides anchor institutions, including schools, hospitals and government buildings at rates of at
least 1 Gbps compared to 100 Mbps for home access. By contrast in Canada the only publically
funded broadband network is the CANARIE network, which connects research, industry and
educational bodies through long-haul fibre optic cables, with last mile connections provided by
users. The network can operate at bit rates as high at 100 Gbps, allowing the transmission of large
amounts of data with an ease and swiftness unavailable to virtually any other internet users. Both

the United States and Canadian models operate to give superior service to certain institutions on
the basis that other users will still have access to broadband services.


4.2.4 Universal Broadband Targets within the Broadband Strategy

National broadband strategies should aim to facilitate universal access and target areas in which
additional support is required to achieve this. Certain groups may face further barriers to access
that cannot be addressed through a singular national policy. Inherent inequalities in position may
be reduced, among other things, by funding infrastructure in less-populated areas and providing
computer equipment to certain groups. In addition, strategies to improve access affordability may
be included in universal broadband targets.


4.2.4.1 Regional Access

In regional areas some form of external involvement is frequently required to ensure that
adequate service is provided. The high costs of establishing a network and small pool of potential
subscribers make expansion into these regions an unattractive business prospect. However, once
network infrastructure is established, service providers need only pay maintenance and
operational costs. This substantially reduces the investment required from service providers to
enter new markets.

In regional areas the costs associated with rolling out and maintaining a network will differ
according to the technology used. Policymakers should consider factors like the expected life span
of technology deployed and potential for that technology to be upgraded or progressively
replaced as technology developments and demand for broadband increases. The relative location
of broadband connections to access nodes and the major network backbone should play a pivotal
role in the choice of telecommunications infrastructure deployed, as this will significantly affect
the quality of broadband access.

Box 4.8: CASE STUDY: Regional Access in Chile

A government scheme was established to extend high-speed broadband access into some remote
mountain regions of Chile. Public and private investments of nearly US$110 million funded a
combination or fibre and wireless network to provide broadband access at data transfer rates and
prices similar to those available in larger cities. The goal of this project was to remove the
disadvantage of distance from economic centres and encourage competition and efficiency across
Chile.

The benefitted localities were selected on the basis of their involvement with other national
developmental goals, including agriculture and tourism. These selections reflect the Chilean
Information Society Universal Access Policy, which seeks to enable rural communities with
productive potential to participate more effectively in the economy. Although this particular
project did not benefit all rural communities, its purpose was linked to the wider policy goal of
ensuring increased broadband use contributed towards a more cohesive and efficient Chilean
economy.

                                                                                                    17
4.2.4.2 Broadband Pricing

Service availability is the primary concern for achieving universal broadband access, but cost is
also relevant. Pricing may also impact the rate of household internet use, which is frequently
prioritised below business and institutional access. Studies of dial-up users on lower incomes
found that cost was a major factor influencing the decision not to switch to broadband and that
increasing household income led to increased demand for broadband technologies.37 In
developing countries, broadband access costs can account for 60 – 80 per cent of the total costs
of owning a computer.38 By contrast, the United Nations estimates that entry-level broadband
services in developing countries should cost less than five per cent of the average monthly income
in order to be considered affordable and to drive uptake.39 There has been some progress
towards meeting this target, as access prices have fallen in over 120 countries in 2008-2009 and
policymakers in developing countries have signalled their intent to make affordable pricing a key
policy issue in order to drive broadband uptake.40 Once universal service is established, it is more
likely service provider competition and related pricing and service levels will gain prominence in
access debates.

Box 4.9: CASE STUDY: Broadband pricing strategies

The Broadband Commission has suggested substituting a prepaid package system for a monthly
quota system.41 This approach has been adopted by the Intel World Ahead Program.42 Inspired by
the success of prepaid mobile telephones in developing countries, the Intel World Ahead Program
provides PCs and prepaid data download packages at low rates. For example, in Vietnam Intel has
partnered with the major telcos Viettel and VNPT to provide 700 MB of data prepaid for $2. This
result has increased the percentage of citizens who can afford broadband access from 12 to 70
per cent.

In Brazil the approach has been to institute an affordable fixed line access cap of BRL$35 (around
US$20) per month. It is hoped that this will enable fixed line service providers to compete with
the popular 3G mobile services, which are comparatively slow and expensive. For a more

Box 4.10: CASE STUDY: Broadband pricing in Kenya

Retail broadband prices in Kenya initially dropped following an 80% reduction in wholesale
pricing. For example, a monthly E1 link charge fell from US$ 7,5000 to US$ 1,290 in 2007 and
retail prices followed suit, with Telekom Kenya’s 256Kbps DSL monthly service falling from KES
16,008 to KES 2,999 (US$ 182 to US$34). However, there has been a lack of further price
reductions, with operators preferring instead to compete on broadband speeds and additional
features.

Mobile internet services are popular in Kenya as operators have developed pre-paid data
products which cater to the lower socio-economic end of the market. For example Safaricom
offers as little as 5 MB a month for KES 5 (US$0.07) per day.

4.2.4.3 Device Distribution

Depending on levels of computer and internet penetration in a country, a computer-distribution
program may either reduce disadvantages to certain groups where a large part of the population
has access, or to provide an advantage to students where the general population does not have
access. The ‘Home Access’ scheme, introduced in the United Kingdom in 2010, gave 270,000 low-
income families a free computer and broadband access for one year.

of 2012, the initiative has provided over 200,000 laptops for children currently in the educational
system and also aims to provide training to teachers on how to prepare classes in digital format
and troubleshoot software and hardware problems with the laptops. However, there are over 2.5
million children in the educational system and the program has only delivered 200,000 laptops in
the 4 years it has been in existence and has to contend with an educational system where most of
the schools are not linked up to the national electricity grid.43

4.3 Mechanisms
4.3.1 Government Intervention

Governments have an important role to play in the development of broadband infrastructure,
given the centrality of access to this technology to economic and social development. Not only do
broadband networks make national economies more efficient, they can assist government
agencies with the delivery of important services like healthcare and education. Governments are
also aware of the risks of being left behind, with decisions about international business
investment increasingly dependent on ready access to broadband networks. In this context, over
the past decade governments have tended to re-engage in the development of
telecommunications infrastructure, reversing the trend of diminishing government involvement in
the sector following the trend to privatisation in the 1990s.44

The manner in which governments have engaged in the provision of broadband infrastructure has
been diverse, reflecting the needs and limitations of different jurisdictions and markets. While
each government is likely to tailor their intervention in the market to local conditions, there can
be significant benefits to policymakers in studying the successes and failures of other government
interventions.

Government intervention to improve broadband access can focus on reforms to regulation,
market interventions or on the provision of infrastructure. Some governments may choose to
intervene at each of these levels, while others may choose to narrow the focus of their
intervention. The types of intervention that could be undertaken at each of these levels are set
out in the table below.

In developing broadband policy plans, policymakers may consider the approaches outlined above.
Some policy interventions may prove more successful in one environment or another, giving
policymakers the flexibility to shift resources to the interventions that are proving successful.

Box 4.14: CASE STUDY: New Zealand’s multipronged approach to broadband rollout

New Zealand has adopted an integrated approach to broadband infrastructure construction and
operation. On the supply side, the government-owned Crown Fibre Holdings is contracting
directly with four companies that will build and operate the broadband network. This is
supplemented by grant programs like the Rural Broadband Initiative that specifically support
broadband rollout in rural areas. The New Zealand Government is also involved in demand-side
initiatives that support network expansion by stimulating use and application of the network
service. Examples of these demand-side programs include subsidising computer hardware,
broadband access and the provision of digital literacy programs.



4.3.2 Improving the Legal, Regulatory and Business Environments

Universal access can be driven by a combination of demand stimulation and various policy and
legislative mechanisms to attract investment in and uptake of such services. Efforts to improve
the legal, regulatory and business environments can provide a cost-minimising approach to
extending service, by encouraging private sector expansion where market forces have not
achieved this naturally. In particular, rolling out broadband services in remote regions can be
incentivised through improved tax statuses and eased license conditions.



4.3.2.1 Address Universal Access and Service Challenges through Policy and Regulatory
Solutions

Governments can strategically adopt policies and take regulatory actions to encourage private
service providers to increase the broadband coverage they offer. This approach entails mutual
benefits for governments and service providers. Private providers are encouraged to invest in
increasing their coverage as factors impeding their progress are identified and addressed. In turn,
governments incur minimum cost as they are able to target their financial input specifically at

                                                                                                               23
those areas which do not attract private providers in the first place. Potential solutions include
sponsoring programs to increase demand for broadband services, financing network
infrastructure and removing barriers restricting competition within the marketplace. Where a
traditional framework would impose positive universal service obligations upon designated
operators, this approach is less direct and encourages private initiatives.

Rural areas are a common example of unserved or underserved regions, as the costs of
constructing the requisite infrastructure are high and the potential customer base is low.
However, an entirely government-funded broadband infrastructure rollout may be prohibitively
expensive and not necessary to persuade providers to increase their coverage. Where viable, one
of the advantages of a national broadband solution over targeted regional projects is that high
costs of rural rollout may cross-subsidised by savings made on lower cost urban rollout. This
strategy, adopted by the Australian National Broadband Network, allows wholesale broadband
access to be provided at the same price, regardless of the area served. This further reduces
disincentives to rural providers, and promotes equality amongst access seekers.

Box 4.15: CASE STUDY: Brazil’s policy and regulatory solutions to achieve broadband
development

Broadband access rates are directly linked with population density and wealth. In Brazil, high
levels of wealth disparity and a vast populated land area have meant that broadband penetration
is lower than in other countries of equivalent income and development levels. There is limited
fixed national telecommunications infrastructure for long haul data transmission and a lack of
middle mile infrastructure to connect all municipalities to national backbones. Competition in the
fixed line sector is low, although there is more competition between 3G mobile networks. In
addition, where service coverage is available the costs of access equipment are high due to import
duties, and many of the poor depend on cybercafés and mobile 3G connections.

Universal service goals incorporated in telecommunications licensing schemes in Brazil currently
do not include broadband services. However, revenues are collected from public
telecommunication providers and deposited in a Universal Service Fund which creates
infrastructure which can be used to support broadband services. In order to address the issues
impeding access, governments at a national, regional, state and municipal level have
implemented a range of strategies designed to promote network expansion and improve
affordability. Examples include:


               a National Broadband Plan (PNBL) with a budget of R$1 billion (US$437 million)
                per year was implemented in 2010 with the aim of tripling uptake by 2014. This
                will bring access to at least 40 million homes (serving 68 per cent of the
                population) at a bit rate of at least 1 Mbps;

               the dormant former state-owned monopoly operator Telecomunicacoes
                Brasileiras (Telebras) has been tasked with implementing the required network
                expansion under the PNBL. Deficiencies in existing backbones will be addressed by
                bringing oil and electricity operators’ fibre networks on board to fill gaps;


                                                                                                     24
              the PNBL has established a monthly pricing target of R$35 (US$15) based on
               research that 70 per cent of Brazilians who are still offline would be willing to pay
               this amount for a connection;

              the national telecommunications regulator, Anatel, has proposed that service
               providers with more than 50,000 connections be required to guarantee delivery of
               connections at least at 60 per cent of the headline rate, raising this to 70 then 80
               per cent over the two subsequent years. Currently, operators on the Telebras
               network are only required to provide a minimum of 20 per cent of customers
               access at the target bit rate, meaning that many connections operate at
               significantly less than the stated rate;

              in 2011 Anatel also implemented a General Plan for Competition (PGMC) which
               will compel large telecommunications providers to share network infrastructure
               with smaller players, who must be offered wholesale pricing lower than retail
               service pricing;

              radio spectrum has been freed up to allow mobile 3G and fixed wireless services
               to be expanded. These solutions are particularly well-suited to meet the
               requirements of isolated areas where cable connections to individual premises
               and users may be expensive;

              licence fees have been reduced and duplications across overlapping government
               areas simplified to encourage market entry;

              public access facilities are being expanded under the national government’s digital
               inclusion strategy. The Serpro program, for instance, has rolled out over 8000
               telecenters since 2003 and provides free broadband access across 98 per cent of
               municipalities. In addition, the Brazil Digital Network Database is being created to
               integrate telecenter management and form a database of digital inclusion
               initiatives in order to help shape government policies; and

              a Broadband in Schools and a One Laptop Per Student program also work to
               facilitate access linked with education.

       For a more extensive analysis, the broadband toolkit chapter on Brazil is available at:
       http://broadbandtoolkit.org/Case/br


A balance of incentives and regulatory requirements may be sufficient to persuade private sector
investment. This attitude of quid pro quo is also demonstrated in Sweden, where government
policies require recipients of public funds to operate open-access networks in a non-
discriminatory manner. Similarly, in the Czech Republic, legislation has been implemented to
enable the government to set aside 1 per cent of the proceeds of the privatisation of Český
Telecom to co-finance infrastructure projects. Those receiving funds will be required to operate
open-access networks.


                                                                                                  25
4.3.2.2 Revise the Scope of Universal Access and Service to Include Broadband

Most global telecommunications laws provide for universal service obligations to be imposed on a
telecommunications provider to ensure citizens’ access to services. These initially focused upon
basic telephony services, but have recently been expanded to include broadband services. The
United Nations aims to ensure that all countries at least include broadband access in their
national service definitions by 2015.48

Unlike a national broadband plan, a universal service definition will generally establish
technology-neutral aspirational service levels, costs and coverage. This allows those called upon
to provide universal service to adjust their delivery strategies in a manner appropriate to their
business. Universal access and service does not necessarily demand connections to individual
premises, but instead may encompass institutional or communal access, where appropriate.

The following are examples of countries that have revised the scope of their universal service and
access policies and universal service funds to include broadband services:

                  as set out in Part 4.1.2, in Finland access to broadband is a legal right. Since July
                   2010, every person in Finland has a guaranteed right to a one Mbps broadband
                   connection;50

                India was one of the first countries to include broadband in the Universal Service
                 Access Fund (UASF) in 2006. The UASF allows for the support of broadband
                 connectivity and mobile services in rural and remote areas of the country;

                in Morocco, the priorities of the Universal Service Fund (USF) were expanded
                 through a revision of the law in 2004 to include rural public telephony, installation
                 of community internet centres, and an increase in broadband capacity through
                 various programs;51

                in Switzerland, the government decided that, beginning in January 1, 2008,
                 universal service providers must provide a broadband connection to the whole
                 population, via digital subscriber line (DSL), satellite, or other technologies.
                 Connections must offer bit rates of at least 600 kbps downstream and 100 kbps
                 upstream, and the monthly subscription cannot be more than SWF69 (US$85);
                 and

                the United States aims, as part of the universal service objective, to provide access
                 to broadband services to all people at an initial rate of 4 Mbps downstream and 1
                 Mbps upstream by 2020.52

A number of countries, including Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom and Australia, have chosen to
develop plans or strategies to ensure that broadband is available to all through other universal
service policies. Since 2009, Australia has been committed to the roll out of the National
Broadband Network (NBN), a wholesale-only, open access network delivering broadband to all
Australian premises. Some countries have also opted to not support broadband through inclusion
in universal service obligations or other commitments to provide broadband for all. Countries in
this group include Denmark, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland.53

Box 4.16: CASE STUDY: Universal Service Obligations and National Broadband Network in

Universal Service Obligation (USO) in Australia. The USO obliges certain Universal Service
Providers (USPs) to ensure that all people in Australia have reasonable access on an equitable
basis to standard telephone services, payphones and prescribed carriage services.

In 2011 the Australian Government reached an agreement with the incumbent
telecommunications provider, Telstra, for the ongoing delivery of voice and payphone services

   Law no. 55-01, adopted in November 2004, made important modifications in the setup of universal
service in Morocco. The universal service definition was extended to include the supply of value added
services, including internet. A new approach relating to the operator’s contribution to the mission of
universal service was also introduced, including regional development obligations and the introduction of
the “pay or play” mechanism.

under the USO while the telecommunications industry transitions to the National Broadband
Network. In March 2012 universal service reform legislation was passed to establish the
Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency (TUSMA). TUSMA manages the
agreement with Telstra and grants to ensure that universal service obligations are met. TUSMA’s
current grants include:

       the agreement with Telstra to deliver the Universal Service Obligation (value:
        approximately A$230 million (US$213 million));

       the agreement with Telstra to provide public payphones which are reasonably accessible
        to all Australians (contract value up to A$40 million per year);

       the agreement with Telstra to provide emergency call services (contract value up to A$20
        million per year);

       the agreement with the Australian Communication Exchange to deliver a National Relay
        Service; and

       the agreement with Telstra to extend the zones where local calls are untimed to cover
        larger rural and regional areas.

Currently, the government business enterprise NBN Co is in the process of rolling out a new
national broadband network. The NBN is a wholesale-only, open access network delivering high
quality broadband to all Australian premises. The network will connect 93 per cent of Australian
premises with fibre cables, while the remaining 7 per cent will receive broadband by fixed
wireless or satellite service, and be completed by 2020.

As the network rollout progresses, voice customer contracts within the fibre footprint will be
migrated from the existing copper and HFC networks to the NBN fibre networks. The Telstra
Structural Separation Undertaking (SSU) and Migration Plan require Telstra to progressively
disconnect its copper and hybrid-fibre coaxial (HFC) networks as the NBN fibre network is rolled
out. Similarly, the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and NBN Co require Telstra to
progressively disconnect its copper and HFC networks when they fall within the fibre footprint. As
a result, in order to meet its USO and other obligations Telstra must provide customers with voice
services over the fibre network, where it is present, or otherwise maintain its existing network
services.

Although plans to provide universal broadband access are not included in the USO, the national
broadband network will connect all homes and businesses. While the National Broadband
Network is being rolled out, NBN Co must provide interim satellite service to eligible users in rural
and remote areas who will be served by the NBN Co fixed wireless and satellite services, when
they are completed. When the NBN is completed, it will be the responsibility of TUSMA to
distribute universal service funds to ensure that both voice and broadband services are provided
on a retail basis as NBN Co’s network is only supplied on a wholesale basis.

Box 4.17: CASE STUDY: Malaysian High Speed Broadband Network

In September 2008, the Malaysian government announced an agreement with the incumbent
fixed-line operator, Telekom Malaysia for a high-speed broadband network.

Under the terms of the agreement, Telekom Malaysia is required to rollout an access network to
provide a High Speed Broadband (HSBB) service to households and businesses in certain high
economic impact areas. The access network uses three technologies: Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH),
Ethernet-to-the-home and Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL2). The Public Private
Partnership (PPP) is phased over ten years, with phase 1 (providing HSBB access to over 1.3
million premises) ending in 2012.

The residential HSBB service will have a minimum speed of 10 Mbps, with options available up to
100 Mbps. Services to business customers are up to 1 Gbps. The expected investment costs were
split between the government and Telekom Malaysia in a PPP. The government and Telekom
Malaysia committed to investing RM2.4 billion (US$780 million) and RM8.9 billion (US$2.9 billion)
respectively.

Certain services provided over the HSBB network are subject to access regulation through the
Access List under the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998. Specifically, the Malaysian
Communications and Multimedia Commission has defined two layer 2 access services (one with
quality of service selected by the access seeker, the other provided on a best efforts basis) specific
to the HSBB, which Telekom Malaysia must supply to access seekers on reasonable terms and
conditions. The Access List also contains backhaul transmission services.


4.3.3 Support Private Sector Network Build-Out: Supply

Governments may adopt a range of instruments to accelerate the supply of broadband ahead of
or beyond the market. These can include subsidies for investment, equity in PPPs, facilitated
access to rights-of-way, preferential tax treatment, long-term loans for investment in local
currency, on-lending loans, credits or grants from international development organizations, and
guarantees to offset regulatory or political risk. Implementation of such policies can encourage
operators to focus on deploying networks and services in unserved areas since they will be able to
earn a higher rate of return on their investments over the long-term.

The most common practice is for the government to contribute money when needed to ensure
that important investments in rural development are commercially viable. Governments provide
one-off subsidies for investment and start-up, focusing on unserved and underserved areas. The
New Zealand government, for example, will provide approximately NZ$300 million (US$245
million) towards the cost of the Rural Broadband Initiative, which aims to deliver faster
broadband to rural households and schools: 97 per cent of rural households and enterprises




                                                                                                   29
receiving at least 5 Mbps, with the remainder receiving at least 1 Mbps, and 97 per cent of rural
schools receiving at least 100 Mbps (fibre), with the remainder receiving at least 10 Mbps.54

Alternatively, governments can contribute equity to PPPs with similar objectives. For example, the
government can help to build broadband backbone networks that are then made accessible in
equal terms to all interested downstream providers. When well designed, these practices can
mobilize substantial private sector investment, enable large projects that otherwise would not
materialize, contain the cost and risk borne by the government, and jump-start sustainable
markets from which the government can exit quickly. PPPs used in broadband projects include the
following examples:

                in Ireland, the government has funded the development of publicly owned,
                 privately operated Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). The MANs provide
                 wholesale access to networks of ducting, subducting and high capacity fibre optic
                 cable in urban areas. The MANs operate on an open-access basis;

                in the Netherlands, Amsterdam’s open-access, wholesale FTTH network was
                 developed as a PPP between the local municipality, housing corporations and
                 private sector investors. Each group invested €6 million for a one-third stake in
                 Glasvezelnet Amsterdam (GNA), the company delivering the project;

                New Zealand features a PPP agreement between CFH and Chorus, the
                 structurally-separated network business which emerged from the voluntary
                 demerger of Telecom New Zealand. The agreement provides for a 50/50 debt-
                 equity instrument (with an investment by CFH of up to NZ$929 million) as the
                 mechanism for Crown funding of Chorus’ fibre network rollout;

                Qatar’s National Broadband Network (QNBN) is a government-funded project that
                 aims to accelerate the deployment of a FTTH network nationally. QNBN provides
                 equal, non-discriminatory access to the FTTH network, enabling any operator to
                 use the infrastructure to deliver services. QNBN is also part of a number of
                 initiatives introduced to stimulate the take-up of FTTH services, notably Qatar
                 National Vision 2030 and Qatar ICT Strategy 2025;55 and

                Saudi Arabia’s Universal Service Project provides grants for operators to provide
                 voice and broadband access to unserved and underserved locations using wireless
                 technology, as part of the universal access/universal service policy established in
                 2006.56

It may be possible to reduce the cost of broadband development by giving investors access to
rights-of-way along railways or roads, on rooftops, and on other public property. Absent
alternative uses for these rights-of-way, their opportunity cost to the public is negligible, and if
they are made equally available to all interested parties, their use will not distort competition.
Therefore, granting rights-of-way may help to reduce the total investment cost of broadband
development.

One of the most significant obstacles in rolling out new communications infrastructure can be the
myriad of consents and approvals that an operator needs to obtain from central and local
government. In some countries such as India, government is facilitating and fast-tracking these
consents and approvals to speed up the deployment of broadband networks.

Box 4.18: CASE STUDY: Right of way permissions in India

In India, obtaining right of way (RoW) permission is regarded as a major hurdle in rolling out new
telecommunications infrastructure. Service providers have noted that local authorities take a long
time to grant permission. Permission requirements also give rise to additional cost as service
providers must pay for the cost to local government and/or agencies granting a RoW permission.
This is recognised in the 2012 National Telecom Policy, which notes the need to review and
simplify policies for RoW processes to facilitate smooth coordination between service providers
and the relevant government agency.57



Granting exceptional tax treatment is another tool policymakers may be able to use. Good tax
practice in general suggests that a particular economic activity should not be singled out for tax
conditions that do not apply to all like activities throughout the economy. This means that taxes
or duties that apply only to broadband should be phased out and, conversely, that exemptions
from generally applicable obligations should be avoided. The Hungarian government, for example,
took efforts to institute tax incentives to further the build-out of broadband. Specifically,
Hungary’s government grants a tax reduction of 50 per cent on profits as a way to support the
construction of broadband infrastructure. The concessions are available only to
telecommunications companies if their expected profits exceed Ft50 million (US$250,000) and if
they have invested at least Ft100 million (US$500,000). The tax allowance cannot be applied to
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) if the infrastructure is built in areas where internet service is
already provided or where the investment does not contribute to the growth of infrastructure.

Malaysia is another example of a government using fiscal measures to encourage private
investment in broadband. The Malaysian government has introduced tax allowances on ‘last mile’
broadband equipment, which includes giving ‘last mile’ network facilities providers an investment
allowance on capital expenditure spent on broadband. In addition to tax allowances, import duty
and sales tax exemptions are available on broadband equipment and consumer access devices.58

Investment in new open and competitive networks, including broadband networks, can also be
supported by the actions of national and local authorities in lowering costs. The European
Commission’s 2009 Guidelines on the Application of State Aid Rules (the 2009 Guidelines), for
example, lay down the conditions for public financial support on nonmarket terms for broadband
deployment in commercially unattractive or unviable areas.

The main objective of the 2009 Guidelines is to assist the actions of national and local authorities.
The 2009 Guidelines are presented as part of the broadband package, together with the two
other broadband commitments made by the Commission in the Digital Agenda for fast and ultra-
fast internet:

               the Next-Generation Access (NGA) Recommendation to provide regulatory
                guidance to national regulators; and

               the Radio Spectrum Policy Program to improve the coordination and management
                of spectrum and facilitate, among other things, the growth of wireless broadband.

In the 2009 Guidelines, the European Commission recognises that broadband networks tend to
cover only part of the population since they are generally more profitable to roll out where
potential demand is higher and concentrated (that is, in densely populated areas) rather than in
areas with less population, specifically because of the high fixed costs of investment and high unit
costs. The European Commission distinguishes acceptability of state intervention among:


               areas where no broadband infrastructure exists or is unlikely to be developed in
                the near term. Here, support is considered to likely promote territorial, social and
                economic cohesion, and address market failures (so-called white areas);

               areas where market failure or a lack of cohesion may exist despite the existence
                of a network operator, thus requiring a more detailed analysis and careful
                compatibility assessment prior to allowing state intervention; and

               so-called black zones, which are defined as a given geographic zone where at least
                two broadband network providers are present and broadband services are
                provided under competitive conditions (facilities-based competition). In these
                black zones, the commission does not consider that there is a market failure, so
                there is little scope for state intervention. In the absence of a clearly
                demonstrated market failure, state funding for the rollout of an additional
                broadband infrastructure is not available.




                                                                                                   32
4.4 Instruments of Fiscal Support for Universal Broadband
Access
Subsidies are a common form of direct government intervention in telecommunications markets.
Subsidies are likely to exist whenever the final price paid for a good or service is less than the cost
of providing that good or service. Companies may, for a time, cross-subside one set of customers
with the profits from another – however the more common form of subsidy involved a direct
government contribution making up the difference between the cost of private provision of a
service, and the price consumers pay for it.

This section considers how subsidies can be used to improve broadband access. In particular, it
focuses on the considerations policymakers should give to subsidy design to ensure that subsidies
are spent appropriately.



4.4.1 Subsidies as an instrument of Fiscal Support

Policymakers should approach subsidies with a degree of caution. The literature of economic
literature has, for some time, warned of the dangers of direct government intervention in markets
and the distortions such interventions can cause.59 Further, the fiscal pressure imposed by
subsidies is not likely to be counterbalanced by the benefits they deliver, particularly in the short-
term. In addition to this, most countries have bilateral and multilateral obligations to other
nations that often involve commitments that limit or exclude the provision of government
subsidies to national industries or discrimination in the provision of such subsidies. Policymakers
should examine each of these factors before considering whether subsidies could, or should, form
part of broadband infrastructure policies and plans.

Having considered these factors, policymakers may consider the use of subsidies as a tool of
policy, particularly in already highly regulated industries like the supply of telecommunications,
water or electrical services. In certain circumstances subsidies may prove effective in mitigating or
removing the effects of market failures in these sectors.

Subsidies are a medium-intervention strategy.60 Although subsidies require investment of fewer
resources than direct infrastructure construction or ownership by government, subsidies
represent a significant commitment to market involvement. If implemented prudently, subsidies
help to deliver services to groups who would otherwise miss out in an efficient manner. However,

without adequate levels of transparency, probity and fairness subsidy programs may present
significant economic and political risks.61

Subsidies can be financed directly from domestic government budgets or from international
development assistance. They can also be a policy mechanism used by UASFs to distribute funds
collected from a universal serve obligation or a levy.



4.4.1.1 The rationale for subsidies

The economic rationale for subsidies is demonstrated at the economy-wide level. Subsidies cover
the difference between the costs of providing a service and the revenues that are then recovered
from selling that service. Without a subsidy, investments in broadband infrastructure in certain
areas would not return economic profit to firms, so those investments are unlikely to be made.
The rationale for government providing a subsidy to make particular investments worthwhile for
private businesses is that the overall benefit of increased broadband coverage is both socially and
economically beneficial.

The economic impact of government investment in broadband infrastructure, through
mechanisms like the provision of subsidies, can provide both immediate and long-term positive
economic effects. Recent econometric analysis measured growth in 120 countries between 1980
and 2006. This analysis demonstrated that for every 10 per cent increase in penetration of
broadband services across an economy the economy grew by 1.3 per cent, on average.62

A particular benefit to subsidies is the fact that they provide a leveraged benefit. In providing a
subsidy that covers the difference between a marginal project and a commercially profitable one,
governments can induce significant commercial investment for a fraction of the cost of that
investment. Rather than having to pay for the whole cost of the infrastructure, as the government
would do if they built it themselves, a subsidy can deliver the benefit of the infrastructure
provision for a fraction of its cost.

Broadband investments delivered through subsidies are more likely to be fiscally sound than
other policy alternatives, as the market-led nature of the investments is likely to deliver greater
value for money than other approaches.63 Private sector firms are likely to have advantages like
skilled staff, a deep understanding of technological options and the ‘reach-back’ into the
corporate knowledge of international parent companies that should contribute to the efficiency
and effectiveness of market-led programs.

Box 4.19: CASE STUDY: Japan - ICT Grant and Collaboration with Local Governments

1. ICT Grant

Japan's New IT Reform Strategy (IT Strategic Headquarters, 2006) and Digital Divide Elimination
Strategy [MIC], 2008) both set FY2010 (March 2011) as the national target for eliminating all of its
Broadband Zero Areas. A Broadband Zero Area is a region where broadband service is not
available, even to households in the region that wish to subscribe. Eliminating all Broadband Zero
Areas means making broadband service available to every household nationwide.

While Japan was working to meet its goal by the end of FY 2010, MIC prepared several kinds of
promotion schemes, targeting both local government and telecommunications operators, in order
to support broadband deployment. Promotion schemes included grants, interest aid, debt
guarantees, and tax breaks.

Figure 4.3. Promotion Schemes for Nationwide Broadband Deployment (1)




One such promotional scheme was the ICT Grant, a grant available to local governments for
building broadband facilities to address the digital divide. Under the ICT Grant, a local
government submitted its proposal to MIC and if approved, MIC paid one third of the total
broadband facility installation cost. In many cases, targeted areas were also depopulated. Thus
the ICT Grant could be combined with a Depopulated Area Development Bond, a local
government bond providing even further reimbursement. If this bond was available, a local
government would be responsible for only 20% of the total cost.



                                                                                                 35
Figure 4.4. Promotion Schemes for Nationwide Broadband Deployment (2) ICT Grant




Once these broadband facilities were built, the local governments often formed long-term
contracts (Indefeasible Right of User: IRU) with telecommunications operators, under which the
local government let telecommunications operator use the facilities in exchange for providing
broadband service to the community. In this situation, the operators did not have to pay
broadband facility installation costs.

The ICT grant was technology neutral. It was up to local governments to decide which broadband
type to choose based on their needs.




                                                                                                 36
Figure 4.5. Broadband Type Comparison




The ICT grant was also telecommunications operator neutral. In many cases, local governments
made contract with telecommunications operators through open bidding.

The ICT Grant played a key role in ensuring that Japan reached its goal of eliminating all
Broadband Zero Areas by the end of FY 2010. As of March 2009, it was estimated that about
640,000 households did not have access to broadband. This is about 1% of households in Japan.
At the time of the FY2009 Supplementary Budget, MIC contacted all local governments that still
had Broadband Zero Areas within their territories. About 340 proposals were submitted by the
local governments, and MIC approved all them all in the early fall of 2009. The total project cost
was about JPY 230 billion and about 340,000 households were expected to gain access to
broadband. As for the approximately 300,000 households remaining, many of them were
expected to gain access to broadband due to telecommunications operators’ service area
expansion. For those areas where local governments did not submit a proposal and that still
remained uncovered (about 10,000 households), they were to be provided service by satellite
broadband.




                                                                                                 37
Figure 4.6. Efforts for Nationwide Broadband Deployment




2. Collaboration with Local Governments

While Japan was working on accomplishing its national target to make broadband available each
household nationwide by the end of FY 2010 (March 2011), the Japanese Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications (MIC) encouraged local governments to actively participate in this
initiative.

In Japan there are 47 prefectures and about 1,800 municipalities, and as of March 2009 about
640,000 households were living in Broadband Zero Areas (areas where broadband service is not
available).

There were several reasons for these Broadband Zero Areas. For example, about 60% of Japan’s
land areas is mountainous, and there exist hundreds of inhabited islands. Also, Japan is facing an
aging and shrinking population problem, which is especially manifest in rural areas. Small rural
villages are on the fringe of extinction due to aging and the migration of the younger generations
to urban areas. Because of these factors, there exist certain areas where telecommunications
operators cannot make a profit and thus do not provide broadband services. Since Broadband
Zero Areas create a potential digital divide, it was necessary for the national government together
with local governments to work towards eliminating them.

Here are two examples how the central Japanese government worked with local governments:

(a) 11 Local Broadband Promotion Committees



                                                                                                38
MIC has 11 Branch Offices nationwide. Each branch office organized a Broadband Deployment
Committee to discuss how to best deploy broadband. Each Committee was comprised of MIC’s
Local Branch Office, local governments (prefectures and municipalities), and telecommunications
operators.

Based on their input, MIC regularly updated the Prefecture Broadband Availability Maps. These
maps illustrated what kind of broadband service was available. (Note: the map shown below is
an early example).

Figure 4.7. Broadband Availability Map




(b) Prefecture Roadmap for Broadband Nationwide Development

In 2007 the Association for Promotion of Public Local Information and Communication (APPLIC)
formed the Broadband Nationwide Deployment Promotion Working Group in order to reach the
national target. Members included scholars, prefectural representatives, telecommunications
operators, and manufactures. MIC participated in this initiative as an observer. The WG held
meetings regularly to share best practices and discuss common problems. Also, based on the
input from all 47 prefectures, the WG every year updated Prefecture Roadmap for Broadband
Nationwide Deployment, which illustrated each prefecture’s plan to eliminate Broadband Zero
Areas.




                                                                                                39
4.4.1.2 Good subsidy practice

A World Bank research working paper published in 2004 set out three elements of good subsidy
practice,64 when a subsidy is being used to deliver infrastructure to rural communities:

                service providers invest their own resources to set up facilities and provide
                 services, at their own risk;

                government provides subsidies to help service providers meet start-up costs,
                 assist customers connect to services, and cover customer’s costs like installation
                 and connection charges or the cost of in-premises equipment; and

                customers pay for the service, at least at the level required to cover network
                 maintenance and operating costs. Customers are also required to pay at least a
                 part of the cost of the connection of the network to their premises, to confirm
                 their demand for the service. Subsidies should ideally be limited to only the small
                 amounts of the service which are necessary with the customer paying for the rest
                 of their consumption.

The rationale behind these principles is that subsidies should be directed at providing access to
services, with as minimal impact on market processes as possible. Subsidies can be helpful in
encouraging the building of infrastructure and the connection of customers to it.


4.4.1.3 Competition for subsidies

Another crucial element of good subsidies practice is competitive selection processes. When
determining which private sector enterprises government will partner with in the subsidised
provision of broadband infrastructure, policymakers should consider the tangible benefits
provided for by competition:

                competitive subsidy provision is likely to deliver significant savings to
                 governments, as it ensures that the enterprises with the best business models,
                 technological solutions and market acumen are selected to receive the subsidies;

                regular competitive processes are likely to reduce the risk of corruption or waste
                 in government subsidy programs; and

                the level of the subsidy is determined by the market, rather than by policymakers.

A least-cost subsidy auction is a proven mechanism for introducing competition into the provision
of subsidies. This approach has been used successfully by governments in their partnerships with
the private sector that have delivered a range of services, particularly telecommunications, to
areas beyond the current reach of the market. A least-cost subsidy auction is likely to involve the
following stages:

Services: Competing for Subsidies’ (2004) World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3365, page 3.
                                                                                                         40
               government outlines the scope of the program and its objectives: service levels,
                population coverage, geographic reach and the maximum level of subsidy on
                offer;

               government communicates these goals to industry through a Request for
                Proposals process. Key terms of the subsidy offer are also likely to be
                communicated at this stage, including the length of the program and any special
                requirements government may have;

               private firms prepare bids in response to the request. If firms have specific
                questions about the project objectives and auction process government answers
                them, but information is shared between all potential tendering parties – through
                mechanisms such as a project extranet;

               private firms are free to develop their own business strategies, technological
                solutions and pricing structures. They communicate these plans to Government
                through responses to the Request of Proposals;

               proposals are analysed in a fair and transparent manner. Government selects the
                proposal that delivers the best value for money;

               government enters into an agreement with the successful private sector firm and
                pays subsidies in full or in instalments, linked to milestone performance;

               service providers own all facilities and carry legal and financial risks associated
                with the delivery of the service; and

               government monitors project progress and performance – tracking the
                effectiveness of subsidies to feed back into later subsidy design processes.65

Box 4.20: CASE STUDY: The Mobility Fund competitive auction in the United States of America

On 3 October 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the successful
bids for the Mobility Fund Phase I auction. The fund will distribute $300 million in one-time
subsidies, in exchange for the winning carriers to build either 3G or 4G networks across previously
unserved areas over the next two to three years.

The FCC has not previously utilised a competitive auction mechanism to distribute funds from
their Universal Service Fund. The Mobility Fund auction enabled any licensed, eligible wireless
carrier to submit bids to build wireless broadband networks in areas deemed to be without such
service. The program resulted in an expansion of mobile broadband networks across more than
83,494 presently unserved miles in 31 states in the United States over the subsequent two to
three years.

Services in Rural and Low‐Income Areas’ (World Bank Working Paper no. 178, 2010) pages 36-7.
                                                                                                      41
In November 2011, the FCC announced plans for the Connect America Fund, to precede the
current $4.5 billion annual universal voice subsidy program. The Connect America Fund,
supporting the deployment of broadband services, would consist of three fundamental
components:

                    a set of subsidies that would ensure the universal availability of fixed broadband
                     service at speeds of 4 Mbps download/1 Mbps upload;

                    a Remote Areas Fund that would address additional connectivity needs of the
                     most costly areas to serve; and

                    a Mobility Fund that would support the universal availability of mobile broadband
                     service.

Phase I of the Mobility Fund was administered by a reverse auction of subsidies with the objective
to expand mobile broadband networks to currently unserved areas. The process of the auction
involved:

                    the FCC identified and established census blocks currently without mobile
                     broadband service;

                    all eligible and licensed wireless telecommunications carriers were permitted to
                     submit their bids for a subsidy to enable access to 3G or 4G services in those
                     areas;

                    bids submitted by providers were based on the amount of a one-time subsidy
                     they were willing to accept in exchange for providing mobile broadband to these
                     unserved areas. Such bids were submitted on a census block basis; and

                    the lowest subsidy request per currently unserved road mile was awarded as the
                     successful bid by the FCC.

Overall the reverse auction proved to be successful as 38 wireless companies and subsidiaries
participated, submitting a combined total of 894 bids. Of these bids, the FCC accepted 795 bids in
31 different states and territories in the US. Each successful provider will receive their subsidy
from the FCC once deployment of the 3G or 4G service is complete.

increased access to broadband services at public stations such as libraries or schools.


4.4.1.4 Public Private Partnerships

In some geographic areas broadband rollout is considerably less viable than in others. In these,
hardest to reach places, specialised government and industry partnerships are often required. A
strategy that has been utilised to provision services in disadvantaged or commercially non-viable
areas are PPPs. The concept involves the cooperation of a government and at least one private
sector firm, carrying out projects that are in the public benefit but deliver a return on investment
to the private sector. The EU Green Paper on Public Private Partnership characterises a PPP by the
following:

               a long-term relationship between public and private partners;

               funding includes at least some private participation;

               the role of the public sector is mainly to define objectives and monitoring, while
                implementation is left to the private sectors; and

               the private sectors assume at least part of the financial risk.67

The World Bank has approved approximately US$1.2 billion in technical and financial support for
connectivity initiatives a significant amount of which relied on PPP structures.68 In high-risk
markets such as rural telecommunications markets PPP initiatives create a ‘win-win’ situation
with the government better able to allocate scarce public resources while still ensuring a
customer oriented end product delivered with industry skill which encourages private sector
investment.69 Below is a table summarising the main categories of PPPs:

Cooperative      All sector operators (MNOs, ISPs) unite to form a private company      Burundi national
                 (special-purpose vehicle) for the purpose of building, owning, and     backbone project,

                 national coverage, including rural access points, open access,
                 nondiscrimination, and low-cost pricing.

Concession       Traditional build-operate-transfer approach, whereby the government
                 issues a public tender to select a private sector operator to build and
                 operate the national backbone or specific national and cross-border links.
                 The agreement is in the form of a long-term concession (15–25 years)
                 that requires the transfer of the networks back to the government at the
                 end of the concession.
Bulk capacity    The government, acting as an “anchor client,” issues a public tender for
purchase         the long-term (10–15 years) supply of bulk capacity (+ 1 gigabit)
                 bandwidth. This model stimulates investment by the private sector
                 through the aggregation of demand. In this case, the partnership is
                 governed by a PPP agreement or supplier contract that establishes the
                 rights and obligation of each party.
Management       Standard management contract agreement whereby the government
contract         issues a public tender to select a private operator to build, operate, and

A public-private partnership can be implemented through a contractual agreement between the
public and private parties, or alternatively by creating a new legal entity with allocated ownership.
Such an entity can house assets that were formally publicly owned and the scope for external
stakeholder contribution is also apparent.

Investment contributions from the public sector may enable the development of communications
infrastructure in commercially disadvantaged areas, or areas considered unprofitable for private
investors. Implementation of a PPP strategy may be required in areas where the provision of a
simple subsidy would not be enough to attract private sector investment in a project.

The viability of PPP investments is made more difficult in times of lower liquidity, when the capital
raising costs of private firms may make their participation in PPP less viable. The inability of a
private sector to finance its originally agreed contribution may disrupt the foundation for future
growth in output, employment and productivity.71 Furthermore, it is often necessary for the

4.4.2 Sources of Funds to Support Broadband Development


4.4.2.1 Government Programs

When markets fail to deliver broadband to areas of lower profitability or higher technical
difficulty, governments have an important role in financing this important infrastructure. The
benefits of this infrastructure can be social, economic and even cultural; making it an attractive
investment opportunity for all levels of government.

The following case studies consider two models of successful government involvement in the
provision of broadband infrastructure.


Box 4.22: CASE STUDY: Extending Broadband Coverage in Rural Canada

With around one in five Canadians living in rural areas, extending broadband access in rural areas
has been a priority for the Canadian central Government for some time. In its recent Economic
Action Plan, the Canadian Government invested $C225 (US $217) in a rural broadband extension
strategy, with more than half of this funding directed into the Connecting Rural Canadians
program. The purpose of this program was to provide government grants to encourage private
development of broadband infrastructure in areas the market had not yet extended to.

This program began with an extensive mapping exercise, conducted by the Industry Canada
department, to determine geographic areas that were unserved or underserved by broadened
coverage. This was followed by a competitive call for nominations for private telecommunications

providers to rollout infrastructure to these areas. Applicants could receive funding of up to 50 per
cent of eligible costs for projects in these areas. In some First Nation communities, funding of up
to 100 per cent of project costs was available.

Between June 2009 and April 2012 a total of 84 projects received funding. The project extended
broadband coverage to 218,000 Canadian households that did not previously have broadband
access. Each of the projects was tailored to the needs of the locality it set to serve, deploying the
most appropriate technology in each area. The range of technologies deployed included: fixed
wireless, satellite, wireline, DSL and mobile wireless.

Following the success of the program, the Canadian Government has announced its future plans
to extend broadband coverage, taking a different policy approach. In 2013 and 2014 the Canadian
Government intends to auction spectrum in the 700 MHz and 2.5 GHz bands with rollout
obligations attached as conditions of these auction sales. Companies that buy more than one
block of the 700 MHz band will be required to rollout services to 90 per cent of the population in
their coverage area within five years of the spectrum auction, and to 97 per cent of the coverage
area within seven years. This policy approach will not require direct investment of government
funds in broadband extension; rather, it pushes the incentive to rollout services onto the
companies competing for spectrum licences.


Box 4.23:CASE STUDY: Extending Broadband to Rural Municipalities in France

In the early 2000s the French government financial organisation, the Caisse des Dépôts, began
offering attractively priced loans to local French government authorities to improve broadband
access in their areas. These loans were primarily used to finance backhaul loops that connected
local areas to the national fibre backbone.

This investment was coupled with significant regulatory reform. Over the past decade France has
been progressively implementing the EU directive to unbundle local loops, allowing further
competition on local networks. As at the middle of 2012, approximately 6,257 exchanges have
been unbundled, representing more than 85 per cent of the existing lines.74

A good learning from the French experience has been to take a technology neutral approach to
government incentivised investment. In 2006, the French telecommunications regulator called for
an application for wireless local loop licences in the 3.4 – 3.6 GHz band. The intention was to
enable telecommunications providers to use the spectrum to provide broadband access using
WiMAX technology. Although spectrum take-up was high, roll out has been slow – with strong

networks.75

Governments cannot always accurately predict what technologies will best suit market and
community needs. So, in structuring government programs, technology neutrality should be an
important design feature. Such an approach allows the private sector to select and deploy the
most appropriate technological solution in each situation.


4.4.2.2 Mandatory Contributions

Financing broadband projects through direct investments from government budgets is not
without risks. Government priorities change, competing fiscal demands emerge and external
shocks can all rapidly alter the budget resources available for broadband projects. An attractive
alternative for policymakers, that avoids these risks, is to raise the funds for broadband projects
from mandatory contributions by telecommunications operators. These funds are generally
placed in a Universal Service and Access Fund (UASF), which sits outside the government budget
and is assigned to be used exclusively for broadband investments.

Telecommunications operators are generally willing to contribute reasonable amounts to UASFs,
provided certain conditions are in place: the funds are managed transparently, the money in the
funds is distributed to worthy projects, and operators are eligible to work on the projects funded
from UASF resources.

Box 4.24: CASE STUDY: Jamaica’s broadband funded by UASF

Jamaica’s Prime Minister announced in 2011 that the island nation would invest half a billion
Jamaican dollars (US$490 million) in a high speed broadband backbone network funded from the
Universal Access and Service Fund. It was acknowledged by the government that private entities
had a tendency to favour investments in densely populated areas which in the past had left rural
areas of Jamaica without adequate internet services and that the government had to promote
universal access directly.76

Commentators have noted that the Jamaican Universal Service and Access Fund has accrued J$7.8
billion since levies were first introduced in 2005 which is also being used to fund Jamaica’s e-
learning project which aims to ensure all high school educational facilities and teacher training
colleges have internet access. 77

Critiques of UASF schemes point to the inefficiency of spending and outcomes in UASF projects,
along with the potential for public infrastructure to ‘crowd out’ private investment. However

some level of inefficiency is unavoidable, as the purpose of the funds is to delivery services that
the market had deemed to be inefficient in the first place. Inefficiencies and delivery challenges
can be managed through attentive and adaptive program delivery.

Implementation challenge: calculating the levies to be charged

Determining the level of the levy and the manner in which it is calculated are important elements
in the development of a UASF policy. The global trend has been to calculate UASF levies as a set
percentage of gross revenue, applied to all firms in a sector. There are two weaknesses with this
approach.

First, a levy as a set percentage of revenue operates is an inefficient tax. When a levy is imposed
on all carriers it is likely to be passed through directly to consumers in the form of higher prices
for telecommunications services. The higher prices will mean that some consumers who would
otherwise have purchased telecommunications services would not enter the market. If the levy is
set too high, private investment in telecommunications infrastructure may be discouraged,
making the challenge of extending universal service even harder for governments. These effects,
described as ‘deadweight losses’, ultimately run counter to the purposes of a UASF.

The second weakness to a set percentage levy approach is that there is no relationship between
the quantum of funds flowing in, and the quantum of funds required to be paid out. This could
result in the fund either collecting more than what is required to deliver universal service, or less
than what is required.

To overcome these challenges, a best practice UASF levy needs considerably greater flexibility
than a set percentage levy approach. The diagram below sets out the structure of a dynamic levy
model, which involves the following policy design features:

               government defines the success metrics for the UASF. It sets out the coverage,
                penetration and uptake levels that it considers to be the baseline that the UASF
                will provide;

               the telecommunications industry makes contributions through a flexible levy
                mechanism, set year-to-year and apportioned across market participants on the
                basis of an equitable method;

               the funds that flow into the UASF support projects to deliver access in accordance
                with the defined goals. These projects are delivered by the telecommunications
                industry, on the basis of a competitive process like a least-cost subsidy auction;
                and

               the success of the projects is measured, with the levy adjusted to account for the
                anticipated future needs of the UASF to deliver its defined metrics.

4.4.3 Universal Access and Service Funds for Broadband Development

While UASFs can be effective in ensuring the availability of proper funding for broadband projects,
implementation of these funds in developing countries presents a number of specific challenges.

The first of these challenges is putting in place appropriate transparency and accountability
protocols. This can be difficult for governments that do not already have in place appropriate
financial management and accountability mechanisms. In such contexts, it may be more
appropriate for the fund to be established independent of government and overseen by a board
and staff of appropriately qualified individuals. Accountability mechanisms, like public disclosure
requirements and parliamentary oversight, could assist to ensure the transparent operation of
this type of organisation. In a handful of cases, there have been reports of USAFs which had highly
over-regulated and complex decision-making, governance and review structures, with Nigeria and
Peru noted by the GSMA as examples of this particular challenge.79

A second challenge faced by all governments operating UASFs is calculating the level and types of
payments which should be made from funds. Elements of these difficult decisions include
determining the types of equipment to include in cost estimates, the redemption periods and
depreciation schedules for this equipment and the process for determining geographical service
areas.

The European Commission has developed practical advice to its member states, which can assist
all states, in developing policies to encourage the rapid deployment of Next Generation Access
broadband networks. The types of conditions the guidelines set out are good policy safeguards
that, if implemented, can help to encourage competition and avoid the 'crowding out' of private
investment.80 Adopting these policy elements will help governments ensure that appropriate
payments are made from the funds, and they are at the right level, to ensure broadband networks
are rolled-out without unnecessary market distortion.

Box 4.25: CASE STUDY: Uganda’s Universal Service Fund and its effect on competition

While Uganda’s Universal Service Fund, the Rural Communications Development Fund (RCDF) is
often cited as an excellent example of management of USAFs in emerging economies, it has often
exclusively partnered with the telecoms provider MTN to deliver its projects to rural parts of
Uganda. MTN holds approximately 60% of the Ugandan mobile market while the fixed line market
is dominated by the state-owned fixed line incumbent Telekom Uganda Limited. While
competitive bidding processes are now a feature of the RCDF’s distribution of funds, the reality of
the matter is that there are only two operators who can effectively bid for RCDF projects, a
situation which had the potential to further ingrain MTN’s strong position in the market.81

A third challenge faced by governments in administering Universal Access and Service Funds is
determining what types of equipment to include in the cost estimates lodged by potential project
bidders an to set the redemption periods and depreciation schedules for this equipment.

Defining the success metrics for UASF projects is an important first step, so regulators can these
baselines to check the capability of the technology proposed against its baseline service goals. In
this way regulators can identify ‘gold plating’ behaviour from firms, which may seek to deliver
more expensive technological solutions than are necessary. These types of behaviours can be
discouraged through competitive processes for awarding work contracts, like lowest-cost subsidy
auctions.

Once a telecommunications company has been selected to do the work, policymakers should
carefully select the terms on which this work is done. A redemption period is the period of time
the infrastructure remains owned by a party, be it the government or a telecommunications
provider, before the ownership of that assets transfers to the other party. In determining this
period, policymakers should consider the effective life of the asset or system, the commercial
viability of its usage and the likely future demand for the service it provides.

Determining the depreciation schedule for the asset, the manner in which its value can be written
down by its owner, policymakers should also have due regard for the commercial circumstances
of prospective owners and operators. It may be appropriate to combine both accounting and
economic method of depreciation, taking into account the weighted average cost of capital borne
by the telecommunications provider, in establishing the arrangements for how the assets can be
written down.

4.4.4 Best Practice for Effective Management of Flow of Funds

Any best practice scheme for proper management of funds will centre around three core
principles; transparency, efficiency and accountability. The centrality of these principles to any
UASF is a crucial factor to the legitimacy and success of the fund.

Efficiency requires a fundamental understanding of the market as it currently operates, as well as
accounting and review mechanisms. Efficient programs maximise the impact of the resources
invested in them, ensuring that the maximum possible outcomes are achieved. One way
government can incentivise project efficiency is to structure contracts with market participants
that share risk and rewards.

For example, a contract may be structured to allow a contractor to keep half of the funds saved
on a project delivered under budget; while imposing penalties payments for projects that slip over
time or budget. This structure allows government to benefit from market knowledge and
expertise, and also achieve a saving, through properly aligning contractual incentives.

Accountability requires reporting and monitoring mechanisms, as well as a clear authority
structure. These structures may already exist within governments; however, in partnering with
market participants through UASF projects, structures may need to be adapted. Governments
should regularly audit projects and ensure project milestones are met, and tested against, before
incremental project payments are made. Furthermore there should be detailed dispute resolution

                                                                                                     54
procedures made available with adequate safeguards to ensure that in the event of an aberration
or discrepancy in reporting there is an impartial and objective method for determining the
outcome of the dispute.

One way government can assist industry participants in this respect is to provide for the
protection of information which is legitimately ‘commercial-in-confidence’. Giving companies
certainty that ‘commercial-in-confidence’ information will be handled appropriately, will make
them more likely to share such information with government. Conversely, if companies fear that
sharing information with government will lead to its wider distribution, information may not be as
readily provided.

Transparency requires appropriate awareness about project goals, progress and outcomes across
the range of stakeholders involved in the program. It may require ensuring that project bidders
receive the same information and access to discussion, providing information about the recipients
of government funding to the wider community, and ensuring that government oversight bodies
like appropriately vetted and transparently selected parliamentary committees are able to review
into the program and recommend improvements. Most Parliamentary systems require Members
to register their business interests such as their shareholdings, interests in real estate and any
companies that they have been officers or directors of. In order to ensure they do not suffer from
a conflict of interest when sitting on such committees82

Documentation of project rules and processes is another important element to transparency.
Manuals or handbooks for project participants can be a useful tool, to ensure that project
participants understand their obligations and commitments through the program.

Box 4.26: CASE STUDY: Columbia’s UASF success story

Columbia’s USAF has gone from strength to strength achieving the goals laid down in its mission
statement with admirable success. The fund is under the authority of the appropriate ministry,
but is legally and financial autonomous, with strict progress and financial reporting requirements
on an annual timescale. The fund is further split into three separate arms, each with different
goals; one focuses on online governance, another, Compartel, focuses on telecommunications
penetration in remote and rural areas while the last arm aims to improve the competitiveness of
small and medium Columbian enterprises through digital initiatives and access. Compartel has
installed 12,797 rural community telephony lines/access points using 9,745 sites built into rural
locations and has begun a fibre optic project to ensure that the poorest three million Columbians
have access to fibre.83

4.4.5 Reviewing the Flow of Funds

To ensure that a UASF is being used for the purposes it was created for, governments should
establish strict mechanisms to review the flow of funds out of the UASF. At a fundamental level,
this involved appropriate accounting practices with a focus on disbursements. Matching payments
to progress, through a structure of milestone payments, is one way to ensure this. However, this
approach has the disadvantage of placing cash-flow constraints on the business undertaking the
project work.

Regulators must also make important decisions about when to accept information provided by
fund recipients, and when they independently test and verify that information. A balanced
approach to this verification process is most likely to achieve the best results. If regulators spend
too much time evaluating information they run the risk of wasting valuable project resources,
though if too few checks are made the projects suffer from lack of oversight. A schedule of
random checking may be appropriate, to signal to contractors that the information they provide
may be checked, without imposing an onerous burden on regulators.

Another challenge is to ensure that money actually flows out of the UASF and into access
programs. This has been a major challenge for several universal obligation funds, particularly in
developing countries.

Box 4.27: CASE STUDY: the struggle to spend funds collected by India and Pakistan’s funds

The Indian Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) was established in 2002. In the past decade it
has collected over US$8 billion from the telecommunications industry through imposing a levy of
5 per cent of the Adjusted Gross Revenue of telecommunications providers. Less than US$3 billion
from the fund has, to date, been spent on projects.84

A similar problem also exists in Pakistan, where the Universal Service Fund (USF) had collected
almost $7 billion in 2009, but only spent around $1.5 billion.85

An important effect of reviewing the flow of funds can be the identification of unusual or
disingenuous directions of funds. These can be caused by fraud or corruption, but can also be the
result of adverse impacts of political processes on decision-making. A good example of this can be
seen in the politically influenced direction of funding to telecommunications projects in the
Australian state of Tasmania.

Box 4.28: CASE STUDY: disproportionate public telecommunications funding to the Australian
state of Tasmania

In order to pass legislation to privatise Australia’s government -owned telecommunications
provider Telstra in 1997, the Australian government needed to secure the support of a non-

Government Senator from the state of Tasmania, Senator Brian Harradine. The bill was passed,
and the company was privatised, on the condition that $250 million (approximately US$232
million) from the initial sale would be allocated to the Networking the Nation program.

More than one fifth of the funds from the first iteration of the Networking the Nation program
were directed to Tasmania, the home state of Senator Harradine. Despite being Australia smallest
state, both on the basis of geography and population, it received the largest share of the funds
under the program.86 Senator Harradine would later claim that he secured a total of $353 million
for Tasmania from the Telstra sales processes.87

While these funds were not from a UASF, they demonstrate the problem with legislators
‘earmarking’ funds from telecommunications programs to their own constituencies. A process of
project approval that is independent from policy makers, or improved probity procedures is
necessary to avoid such distortions.

5.1    Introduction--Broadband and Its Impact

        Broadband networks provide a medium capable of quickly delivering information,
communications and entertainment (“ICE”). High speed wired and wireless networks can
transmit digital bits making it even possible for instantaneous delivery of capacity intensive
applications such as full motion video like that seen on broadcast, cable and satellite television
channels. Prior generations of narrowband networks could not deliver such content, because
they had available limited amount of channel capacity, also known as bandwidth. Such
narrowband channels only could handle slow speed services, such as electronic mail, because of
limited available radio spectrum, or closed circuit capacity, typically measured in cycles per
second, or Hertz (“Hz”). Attempts to use narrowband networks for services requiring high
bandwidth resulted in user frustration as the desired content could not arrive fast enough to
deliver a clear and constantly changing video image, or even a high fidelity signal for reliable
voice and music delivery. Narrowband lines created a backup of traffic commonly termed a
bottleneck. The inability to provide timely delivery of traffic resulted in congestion.

         Broadband technologies, like those used to support the Internet 1 offer the promise of
faster, better, smarter, more versatile, personalized, cheaper and more convenient access to a
wealth of ICE services. Few users of available broadband networks would give up these benefits
for the slower, but cheaper option of using older technologies, such as conventional, dial up
telephone networks. With retrofitting existing wired and wireless telephone networks can
combine analog, voice services, with digital, data services. Likewise cable television networks
can add data and telephone services to existing video offerings. Subscribers of these broadband
services enjoy reliable and user friendly access to a broad array of services.

        Most subscribers of broadband networks readily can learn how to use them, but few
acquire much insights of how the networks operate. In most instances failing to acquire such
“digital literacy” imposes no significant burden. However, having even a basic understanding of
how broadband networks work can provide a foundation for achieving more effective and
possibly cheaper use of broadband technology. Understanding how these networks operate can
provide policy makers, regulators and users with a better sense of the strengths, vulnerabilities,
opportunities and threats generated by the evolving migration from several different analog
networks into a single, consolidated medium commonly referred to as the Internet, or World
Wide Web. 2

        The promise of a single Internet medium for access to most content confirms that
technological innovations have promoted a convergence of ICE markets. Previously separate,
stand alone media provided a specific subset of the services represented by this now convergent
ICE marketplace. Broadcasters delivered radio and television content to specific receivers, i.e.,
radio and television sets. Telecommunications companies provided voice connections between
subscribers using wired and wireless telephones. Publishers of printed content, such as
newspapers and magazines, delivered their “hard copy” products through physical distribution
channels having nothing to do with electronic media.
                                                                                                    5



         Converging telecommunications and information technologies now make it possible for
the Internet to provide a single medium for delivery of content to several devices in both fixed
and mobile locations. While television broadcasters transmitted content for reception by one
type of screen, Internet-mediated video content also can reach television sets, but also computer
monitors, tablets and smartphone screens. Delivery to multiple devices and screens can occur,
because content carried via broadband networks have been converted from their native analog
state, to digital bitstreams.

         Once digitized all forms of content appear as a sequence of data capable of carriage via
the broadband networks that make up the Internet. The standards that organize the Internet
provide common formats for identifying, addressing, labeling, switching, routing and managing
traffic. In particular, the Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol, 3 provide
standards for managing content broken up into small units of capacity known as packets for
transmission via any available network interconnected with other networks that collectively
comprise the Internet. The Internet Protocol provides an addressing system much like the
numbering system used by telephone companies.

Telecommunications and Information Processing via the Same Network

        The technologies that support innovation in telecommunications also provide new ways
to deliver, process, manipulate and add value to information. Policy makers and regulators
working in the telecommunications sector increasingly face issues involving the combination of
legacy services, such as broadcasting and video program delivery, with new services that use
telecommunications as the transport medium for information processing. The expanding use of
the Internet as a primary medium for delivering most information, communications and
entertainment (“ICE”) services shows how convergence in markets and technologies will impact
assumptions about how the ICE ecosystem operates. For example, increasing reliance on the
Internet to deliver content to retail users means that previously stand alone technologies will
converge so that one cannot segregate—and apply separate regulatory and market impact
assumptions—about the print, radio, television, cable television, wired and wireless
telecommunications and Internet media.

        One way to appreciate the impact of converging technologies is to combine them in a
vertical array ranging from the physical transmission media at the base and rising to the most
sophisticated software, applications and content deliverable to consumers. The Open System
Interconnection (“OSI”) model provides a vertical view of the elements that combine to offer
ICE services via new media such as the Internet. This model layers the Internet’s architecture
into seven increasingly sophisticated and specialized components: physical, data link, network,
transport, session, presentation and application. The model calls for the independent operation of
the layers, but also supports the interaction of various applications and equipment designed to
use the features represented by each layer.

         At the physical layer various media provide a wired or wireless conduit for the
transmission of ICE content. It provides the hardware used to send and receive data on a carrier,
including defining aspects of the physical medium used. At the data link layer traffic is encoded
and decoded into bits that are collected in units called packets. This layer includes the traffic
management rules used in the Internet’s Transmission Control Protocol to control the flow of
traffic and its synchronization as occurs in the routing of content via Ethernet, Asynchronous
Transfer Mode and Frame Relay networks. The Network layer provides switching and routing
technologies that create temporary pathways for traffic to move toward the desired final
destination. This layer, in conjunction with the Transport and Session layers above it, handles the
use of the Internet Protocol addressing system for identifying the source and destination of
traffic, plus error handling, congestion control, packet sequencing and the setup and break down
of the temporary pathways. The Presentation layer defines the format of the data exchanged
(e.g., text, graphic), followed by the Application layer that defines how applications
communicate with each other over the network (e.g., e-mail) using various protocols. 4

        Looking at the OSI Layered model, one might consider telecommunications
infrastructure concerns as limited to the lower layers that more directly focus on the physical
connections contained in information and communications technology (“ICT”) networks.
However the integrated and convergent nature of all seven levels requires an appreciation by all
stakeholders. For example, when retail subscribers experience congested or inoperative service,
they may not know which of several ventures should bear the blame. They simply want service
to return to normal without regard to which layer of service became dysfunctional and which, if
any, regulator has jurisdiction.

Analog Humans and Digital Networks

         Broadband networks provide the medium for digital bitstreams, having converted analog
traffic. This conversion takes content created by and for humans and makes it possible for
carriage by computers and digital networks. Humans have several analog body parts used to see,
hear, feel and communicate. Air held in our lungs provides a carrier for signals created
(modulated) by our larynx, also known as the voice box. We receive sound via our ears where
                                                                                                  8



the modulated signals are replicated by ear drums and converted into weak electrical signals
useable by our brains. Our eyes concentrate light and color at the optic nerve which also
converts the signals into electrical impulses.

         While the human body retains its analog characteristics, ICTs mostly have migrated to
digital transmission and processing formats. The digitization of networks promotes more
efficient use of spectrum such as the ability to compress a signal so that it uses less bandwidth.
Digitization also makes it possible to for a single network to handle different types of traffic
generated from many sources, by subdividing the content into small units, called packets, and
switching these packets via available transmission capacity offered by possibly many network
operators. When coupled with improvements in content storage and the speed of broadband
network transmission, digitization supports fast transmission, switching, processing and delivery
of content. Consumers can more readily access, transmit, share, copy and store digitized content.

          Digitization operates as a key driver for making broadband networks capable of
providing faster, better, smarter, more versatile, cheaper and more convenient services. Digital
networks can transmit content faster than narrowband networks thanks to the availability of
wider transmission channels (more bandwidth) and larger allocations of radio spectrum to create
more channels having larger capacity. Transmitting signals within larger channels can increase
the bit transmission speed which in turn reduces the time it takes for content to arrive at the
desired destination. The term bitrate refers to the speed by which a carrier can transmit and
deliver content. Broadband networks can transmit digital bitstreams at a rate of between less
than one million bits per second, i.e., 1 Megabit per second (1 “Mbps”) and more than one
billion bits per second, i.e., 1 Gigabit per second (1 “Gbps”). Narrow strands of glass fibers
provide a much faster transmission medium than available via copper networks.

       Another measurement of broadband networks’ comparative advantages to analog
predecessors lies in their ability to transmit bandwidth intensive content without triggering
congestion that would cause a backup in the delivery of bits. Broadband networks can deliver
content so quickly that users can download, process and view full motion video content in the
same manner as reception via conventional broadcast, cable and satellite media. The term
throughput refers to the amount of content, measured in bytes, represented by a file, or other
source of content. Narrowband networks could only make timely delivery of small files
containing a few kilobytes of content.

         Larger files, such as those containing full motion video content, including images in high
definition, constitute many megabytes of content. This type of content requires that networks
operate at fast transmission speeds having the ability to deliver large megabyte files on a timely
basis. For so called streaming content, the network must transmit bits that immediately will be
processed and converted into pictures and sound, as occurs when the Internet serves a medium
for “simulcasting” live television content, or for the immediate decoding and display of video
files as occurs when consumers download and simultaneously view content like a movie or
television program received via the Internet.
                                                                                                    9



        In addition to operating at vastly higher transmission speed, digital networks also
promote the likelihood that content will arrive without significant degradation in quality. Digital
networks offer high data integrity, because they convert content into a coded sequence that
travels easily through digital transmission links. Should any portion of the data sequence get
lost, dropped or delivered too late for timely conversion back into usable content, digital network
can resend it. Consumers welcome the ability to send and receive perfect copies of content, but
National Regulatory Authorities, policy makers and courts should appreciate that fast network
transmission of perfect copies makes it much easier for piracy of copyrighted content.
Previously analog networks could not transmit high capacity files corresponding to video
content. While these networks could handle smaller music files, the delivery process took
significant time with the potential for noise and other factors to degrade the quality of illegal
copies.

        Digital transmission through broadband networks also promotes the proliferation of new
services that requires two-way interactivity between users. Even with a narrower and possibly
slower uploading capability, broadband network users now can create and share content as they
interact with others. For example, many social networking sites allow subscribers to upload
content, such as photographs, and for selected “friends” to comment on the shared material.

Broadband is the Common Thread in a Network of Networks

        Reliable and high quality access to the complete range of services available via
broadband networks requires that every participating carrier operate with generally the same
speed and efficiency. Consumers of broadband services typically rely on several carriers,
commonly referred to as Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) to provide a portion of the
complete, two-way (“duplex”) link from and to sources of content. The Internet has been
characterized as a “network of networks” 5 and a cloud 6 to emphasize how many different
carriers must cooperate with each other by interconnecting their networks using common
operating standards so that subscribers have easy, reliable and uninterrupted access to services
and content located anywhere. Because many services require broadband connections for each
leg that combine to form the complete link, any gap or reduction in service quality will degrade
the total performance of the network as perceived by end users, i.e., final recipients of content
and services.

        The concept of cloud computing emphasizes the integrated and interconnected nature of
broadband networks, but inside the cloud are specific networks containing the
telecommunications lines, and data traffic routers that link consumers with the content they
desire. The information and communications technology (“ICT”) ecosystem seamlessly
combines the basic building blocks of telecommunications transmission capacity with software
and other forms of information processing. Much of the content and network enhancements are
located at the edges of networks where content is originally transmitted and eventually received.
However the networks transmitting such content must have sufficient intelligence to identify the
location of source material as well as its destination. Data networks use intelligent switches and
routers to make decisions how to route traffic in the fastest and most efficient way at the time of
the decision.

        When broadband subscribers experience inferior service they may not readily know the
cause, because they lack the diagnostic tools to identify the worst performing device or
transmission link in the group of participating ISPs. Additionally packet switching of content
constantly changes which carriers participate as cloud computing and data networking typically
use any available network transmission capacity offered by many different carriers.

        You can get a sense of how multiple carriers participate in broadband networking by
launching a simple tracking tool known as traceroute. This software program transmits and
tracks a small amount of data sent from your location, or an origination point you designate, to a
destination you also specify. You receive a line-by-line report on which carrier networks
participated in the carriage of your traffic to the final designation. The traceroute report
identifies the networks used to route your traffic. Using multiple tracereoutes over time, you can
see how the routing can change as the then current availability of networks changes. Traceroute
tools also provide a report on the length of time it took to traverse a network from one
geographical point to another.

Higher Stakes for Developing Countries

        Consumer demand for broadband network delivered services raises the stakes for timely
and effective deployment of ICT. Nations that do not have widespread access to affordable
broadband service risk losing comparative advantages in global markets, particularly for
information intensive applications. Lesser developed countries (“LDCs”) which may not have
achieved ubiquitous access to narrowband, voice services, now face the task of adding
broadband access to a universal service mission. The added broadband burden may raise the
total cost of network development, but technological innovations can help LDCs possibly avoid
having to retrofit legacy networks and instead concentrate on installing next generation networks
(“NGNs”) that can “leapfrog” prior generations and vintages of technologies. These cutting
edge technologies exploit technological convergence making it possible to provide both voice
and data services via a single Internet link.

        Broadband technologies can expedite a nation’s access to digital networks configured to
transmit data bitstreams combining voice, text, data, video, graphics and other content. In many
LDCs the opportunity to install and operate best in class technologies may lie in wireless
networks that already may provide widespread geographical coverage for narrowband voice
telephone service. Third and fourth generation wireless networks provide faster data services,
possibly reaching parity with some current generation wired broadband options. However, the
use of radio spectrum may constrain the ability to scale services to a large subscriber population
if National Regulatory Authorities do not authorize access to more bandwidth. Likewise
developing countries may not have achieved the same pace in migrating from second generation
wireless technologies to third and fourth generations that offer more bandwidth and data
transmission capabilities.

        Additionally consumers in developing countries may not have the opportunity to select
from two or more broadband distribution technologies as occurs in many developed countries
where both cable television, telephone and possibly electric companies offer broadband services.
The lack of so-called intermodal competition from two facilities-based carriers using two
different broadband technologies, may limit the degree of competition and consumer choice.
Similarly the lack of more than one carrier using the same technology may limit intramodal
competition as occurs when a nation has more than one wireless telephone company.

       Because broadband networks can achieve significant improvements in many types of
personal and commercial transactions, nations increasingly recognize the importance of making
broadband access widely available and affordable. The Finish legislature enacted a law that
recognizes the right of all residents to access affordable broadband, while many other nations
have integrated broadband access into existing universal service programs that subsidize access
and provide other financial incentives to operating carriers. 7 Other nations, have added access to
affordable and widely available broadband service as a policy goal worthy of government
funding and subsidies previously used only to promote access to voice telephone service.
                                                                                                 14



5.1.1          Managing the Transition from Narrowband to Broadband

        Despite the allure of broadband technologies and the obvious market demand for it,
incumbent carriers cannot simply execute a strategy of quickly replacing all existing plant that
use “legacy” technologies such as narrowband copper wire used to provide conventional public
switched telecommunications services (“PSTN”). Both carriers and National Regulatory
Authorities (“NRAs”) have to manage the transition with caution to ensure that subscribers do
not face substantial and immediate hikes in service rates resulting when carriers seek to “write
off” substantial plant investments, i.e., to recoup all PSTN investment in a short period of time.
Additionally complex regulatory issues will arise including the valuation of the rights of way
used for replacement broadband services, the potential for a reduction in the geographical scope
of access to broadband services and the need for subscribers to acquire additional equipment
such as computers and terminal adapters to make it possible to use existing telephones over a
Voice over the Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) network. NRAs will need to reform universal service
policies to achieve progress in access to both voice and data services.

        Broadband technologies require carriers to invest substantially in new plant at the very
same time as these ventures have high capital expenditures in expanding the range and upgrading
the services of both wired and wireless networks. While the Internet can provide a single
medium for virtually all types of services, now provided via separate networks, the carriers must
manage an incremental conversion that squeezes out as much value as possible from embedded
plant for as long as possible.

        For example, carriers providing wired voice telephone service can retrofit the PSTN to
provide some types of broadband services at a relatively low additional investment per line. This
Digital Subscriber Line (“DSL”) service cannot match the versatility and transmission speed of
fiber optic glass networks, or even the latest generation of wireless service, commonly referred to
as 4G. But as a transition technology, DSL can provide a more quickly installed broadband
service without the need for carriers to replace the copper wire network with a completely new
wired or wireless distribution network.

        Both developing and developed nations will have consumers keen on accessing the most
recent services and technologies available. Both broadband carriers and NRAs may struggle to
satisfy such demand. Carriers will need to upgrade even recently installed networks, so that they
can offer even higher bit transmission speeds. NRAs may need to find additional radio spectrum
to accommodate demand for wireless broadband service.

         Video will serve as a key driver for faster broadband networks with ever improving
content delivery capabilities. Initially improvements in image resolution could occur using the
same amount of radio spectrum and wired capacity through the use of compression techniques
that help conserve bandwidth. In many areas of the world, broadcast, satellite and cable
television operators have successfully migrated from delivering standard definition television to
high definition television. However engineers have devised even higher resolution video images
that will double or even quadruple the number of columns and lines that must be reproduced
thirty times a second. So-called ultra high definition television, delivered via wired and wireless
                                                                                              15



broadband networks, will require more bandwidth and the implementation of more effective
conservation techniques.

5.1.2 Reference Documents and Case Notes

Traceroute and the Network of Networks

       You can receive a line by line report on the networks used to send a small amount of
data. Traceroute software provides a graphical summary of how the Internet operates as a
Network of Networks providing users with seamless connectivity via the networks of many
interconnected carriers. Here are some Traceroute World Wide Web sites:

Visualizing the Internet Cloud

        The traceroute and other network diagnostic tools provide a visualization of how the
Internet functions through the physical interconnection of networks at various locations around
the world. Many telecommunications lines, routers, servers and other equipment provide service
in a such user friendly, seamless way that the Internet can be analogized to a cloud. The
following sites provide a visual depiction of the networks that form this cloud:

Packet Switching

         Most Internet traffic is subdivided into small units of capacity called packets. The
Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”) used by ISPs offers traffic management procedures for
the transmission and delivery of these packets to the intended recipient using the network
capacity of two or more participating carriers. Each separate packet traverses the network
facilities of any participating ISP with available transmission and switching capacity. TCP
usually provides for “best efforts” routing of packets meaning that first arriving packets at a
router are the first to be delivered to recipients, or carried onward toward the final destination.

       The following sites offer a tutorial on how packet switching works:

Internet Addressing

        One can access a desired Internet site by keying in an easily remembered name into a
World Wide Web browser such as Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. The Internet Protocol
establishes a series of rules for the creation of an address and a governance system operates for
the registration of the names and the resolution of disputes. The addressing system combines a
name with a top level domain designation such as .com, .edu and .gov representing commercial
ventures, educational institutions and government organizations respectively.

5.2     Overview of Broadband Networks

        Characterizing the Internet as a cloud and a network of networks emphasizes how users
benefit from the seamless integration of many different carrier facilities located throughout the
world. The Internet design emphasizes convenience and simplicity even as complex network
interconnections take place between equipment of different vintage and manufacturer. By
agreeing to use a common set of operating standards, all ISPs have the ability to interconnect the
equipment needed to transmit, switch, identify, label and deliver traffic. This means that users
can access content located anywhere within the Internet cloud by using a universally agreed upon
addressing system that uses easily remembered words, e.g., www.worldbank.org. These domain
names translate into a sequences of numbers used by devices called routers to identify the origin
and destination of traffic as well as the next network that will deliver traffic closer to its intended
destination, or to the final destination. The Internet addresses of senders and recipients of traffic
are located in the header portion of packets. Content is located in a separate portion of each
packet commonly referred to as the payload.

        Broadband networks combine high capacity transmission lines with devices such as
routers that coordinate the delivery of traffic. By analogy think of the telecommunications lines
as high capacity highways, or pipelines and routers as the traffic lights that manage the
intersection of lines, i.e., their interconnection, and the routing of traffic that typically involves a
switch from one transmission line to another, i.e., a handoff from one carrier’s network onto the
network of another carrier.

         The Internet offers fast and reliable management of high capacity traffic bitstreams
thanks to the reciprocal agreements among ISPs to share transmission, switching and routing
duties. Peering refers to an agreement between two ISPs to exchange Internet traffic typically
with no payment if the traffic handed off to the other ISP roughly equals the volume received
from the other ISP. 8 For instances where ISPs exchange unequal traffic volumes, the carrier
generating more traffic volume typically has to pay the other carrier for its comparatively greater
traffic carriage, a financial transaction commonly referred to as transiting.

         Internet traffic can quickly and seamlessly maneuver through the cloud using the
networks of many ISPs. ISPs agree to interconnect their networks and have both technological
means and financial incentives to secure a complete link from an end user upstream via his or her
retail ISP and many other interconnected ISPs all the way to the source of desired content and
back. The specific networks use at any time during the connection can change, because carriers
subdivide Internet traffic into packets and the decision on which carrier network to use for each
packet is made “on the fly,” i.e., as the packets are presented to a router. Routers typically use
operating standards that switch individual packets on a “best efforts” basis that identifies which
of possibly several networks are available and which individual network is most likely to deliver
traffic quickly onward to another ISP, or to the retail ISP serving the end user requesting the
content.
                                                                                                 19




Hierarchical Structure of the Internet

         The Internet ecosystem divides into a number of separate network elements that combine
to provide users with a complete link to and from sources of content. A retail ISP serving end
users provides the first connection that originates an upstream traffic flow used by subscribers to
initiate a request for content, e.g., a query submitted to a search such as Google, or to upload
their own content, e.g., uplinking a photograph to a social networking site such as Facebook.
More than one retail ISP may offer broadband links to individual subscribers, but generally end
users opt to subscribe to only one carrier for all uplinking and downlinking services.

        In many locales consumers have a choice of technological options that include broadband
provided by a telephone company that has retrofitted its voice network to provide data services, a
cable television company that has reassigned a portion of its video content delivery capacity for
data services, one or more terrestrial and satellite wireless carriers and possibly the electric
power company. These carriers have limited opportunities to aggregate traffic and achieve
operational efficiencies for the first and last kilometer link, 9 because eventually they must
identify and deliver or receive traffic from each and every subscriber on an individualized basis.
However, retail ISPs can aggregate traffic for upstream delivery to other carriers and receive
such aggregated traffic from these carriers.

         The ability or inability to aggregate traffic has great significance on how much
operational efficiency and cost savings an ISP can generate. As traffic moves upstream from a
retail ISP the carriers providing intercontinental and transoceanic transmission have the greatest
ability to combine traffic onto the fastest and highest capacity transmission links available. This
traffic aggregation function makes it possible for such carriers to accrue best possible scale
efficiency and to become a part of the largest class of operators known as Tier-1 ISPs. 10 These
ISPs provide long haul traffic delivery and typically only interconnect directly with other
similarly-sized Tier-1 ISPs, on zero cost, peering terms. Smaller ISPs may also enter into
peering agreements, but typically have to pay transit fees to Tier-1 ISPs for access to their long
haul services.

       The Internet ecosystem can be visualized as a hierarchical pyramid with many
comparatively small ISPs serving individual localities and regions, with fewer ISPs operating
upstream as Tier-2 and Tier 1 carriers.

Hierarchy of ISPs

        Internet traffic also has characteristics that affect how ISPs configure their networks.
Because most subscribers download more content than they upload Internet networks have to
handle more downstream traffic. This asymmetrical traffic volume requires some ISPs,
particular retail carriers, to allocate more capacity for downstream transmissions than for
upstream flows. Similarly ISPs have to configure networks that can handle and quickly respond
to significant variation in the total volume of traffic demand made by individual subscribers.
Most Internet subscribers have “bursty” traffic requirements as they will require fast, high
capacity downloading capability for a period of time after which they may impose no significant
demands whatsoever. ISPs need to have the ability to accommodate high throughput demand,
e.g., downloading a very large file containing video content, but also to reassign network
resources when one subscriber completes a bursty demand for transmission capacity and starts to
watch the downloaded content.

        The Internet ecosystem will constantly change as new types of content and uses emerge.
Current developing trends include increasing reliance on wireless broadband networks, the
proliferation of applications designed for use of these networks and the rapid inclusion of
Internet connected sensors to monitor the health and performance of both people and devices.
These trends will have a substantial impact on how planners design and configure future
networks. With increasing reliance on wireless networks ISPs will need to convince government
regulators to reallocate and assign more radio spectrum for Internet access. A growing “Internet
of Things” 11 means that our understanding of what the Internet can do will expand into an even
larger ecosystem of people, devices and monitors.

        Another developing Internet trend reduces the hierarchical nature of interconnections and
increases the number of financial compensation arrangements available. When the Internet
started only a few carriers participated and they generally had roughly equal volumes of traffic to
exchange. Additionally these carriers did not have to pay close attention to traffic volumes,
                                                                                                 21



because governments typically subsidized their operations. Most governments have stopped or
reduced subsidizing Internet development thereby prompting ISPs to pay closer attention to
capital and operating costs, including whether an interconnecting carriers generates more traffic
than it receives. ISPs generating more traffic for carriage by another carrier now have to pay for
such access. Faced with significantly higher interconnection costs, these carriers have explored
new ways to interconnect networks.

        For example many smaller Tier-2 ISPs have agreed to interconnect directly rather than
rely solely on higher capacity Tier-1 carrier networks. Additionally ISPs of all sizes increasingly
opt to interconnect and to store content at a centralized location commonly referred to as an
Internet Exchange. Such co-location makes it possible for many ISPs to interconnect in the same
building. This promotes operational efficiency and reduce interconnection costs.

        Very large suppliers or repositories of content also consider alternatives to relying on one
or more ISPs to manage delivery. These ventures, such as Google, Facebook, and Youtube can
secure and manage their own network routings closer to end users. Some content providers have
registered to secure an Autonomous System identifier that specifies routing options as though the
content source operated as an ISP. In the alternative Netflix has under consideration the
installation of high capacity storage units on subscriber premises that will contain hundreds of
the most popular content thereby reducing the aggregate subscriber demand for immediately
downloaded content.


5.2.1 The Broadband Supply Chain

        While many components parts make up the broadband supply chain, they split into two
basic categories: conduit and content. Conduit refers to the technological means by which
geographically separated users of the Internet can connect with equally dispersed sources of
content. The Internet seamlessly combines the conduit function with content so that end users
can readily access desired content simply by keying in easily remembered names, or Web
addresses, or clicking on an icon, a small image that launches an application and accesses
content.

        While willing to pay directly for specific content, applications and software, consumers
generally consider their broadband subscription as entitling them to expect their retail ISP to
make all necessary arrangements to provide consistently reliable broadband links to all content
sources. Accordingly while a complete understanding of broadband supply chain necessitates
examination of each component part, consumers generally consider Internet access a single
transaction regardless of how many ISPs and diverse telecommunications network facilities
participate in the complete routing and management of the links between end users and sources
of content.

        A variety of ISPs participate in the transmission, switching, routing, storage and data base
interrogation that are necessary for making complete links between end users and content
sources. The transmission element refers to broadband transmission technologies that use closed
                                                                                                  22



circuit media, such as copper wire and fiber optic cables, as well as radio spectrum to provide a
wideband conduit for content to travel to and from end users. These telecommunications links
constitute the core carrier functions for which National Regulatory Authorities have direct
jurisdiction to ensure that consumers have widespread access on reasonable terms and
conditions. In subsequent sections, this Module will explain how each broadband transmission
technology operates.

        To achieve global connectivity, broadband networks need robust and flexible
telecommunications line switching and routing functions. Routers manage the selection of
which telecommunications network will deliver traffic for each of possibly many legs in a
complete link up. As identified in a traceroute report, the networks participating in the provision
of service are accessed by routers that switch between available networks on the basis of
available capacity and the destination of the traffic. Routers inject intelligence into the switching
and routing process, because they make network selection decisions based on an analysis of
network capabilities immediately available as well as interrogation of data bases to identify the
source of content and its intended final destination.

         Because routers need to look up the identity of traffic sources and recipients, network
operators create data bases, located in computers with high storage capacity known as servers.
Just as routers have to select the next telecommunications link to transmit traffic onward toward
its final destination, these devices also have to interrogate servers containing information about
the identity of network users. Servers responding to this “look up” function may be located at a
distance from the router, but a very fast lookup of Internet Protocol addresses must occur before
the router can decide onto which network to switch the traffic. Based on traffic conditions and
the location of the destination for a particular bitstream routers then coordinate the hand off from
one network, the initial source of traffic, onto another network possibly operated by a different
ISP.

5.2.2 The Transition to All-IP Networks

        Technological and marketplace convergence favor increasing reliance on a single
Internet-based network to provide most information, communications and entertainment (“ICE”)
services. Current and next generation networks 12 use uniform Internet standards, formats and
protocols making it possible for them to deliver globally just about any type of content, including
that previously available only from one specific type of medium, e.g., broadcast radio and
television, via wireless point-to-multipoint technology. With increasing reliance on the Internet
as a single source of content, previous medium-specific media may become less important.

        The Internet is becoming a single conduit for all types of content, because it can switch,
route, sort and store digital bitstreams. All types of content can be converted into digital bits and
subsequently organized into packets. Packet switching technology can send bitreams
representing many different types of content, e.g., voice, music video, text, photographs, etc.
generated by different sources via shared networks that combine to form the Internet.
                                                                                                23




        One can analogize packet switching with the older legacy delivery of mail by postal
carriers. Much of the traffic handled comes to a post office in two parts: 1) an exterior envelope
containing information about the source and destination of the communication; and 2) an interior
space for content, such as a letter. Packet switching uses the same two part structure: packet
headers contain routing information including the IP addresses of sender and intended recipient
and the payload containing content.




        One can anticipate the transition to an ICE marketplace served primarily by the Internet
as a “one stop shop” for most content thanks to digitization and standard operating protocols.
Consolidation by the Internet can trigger a migration by consumers from several standalone and
mutually exclusive networks. Instead of using a separate network for telephone calls, watching
video programming and web browsing consumers increasingly can rely on a single, versatile
                                                                                                 24



Internet available via several wired and wireless transmission technologies, each using the same
Internet formats.
        The term all-IP network refers to the ability of networks using the same standard formats
to offer many different types of services that previously were available only via separate, single
purpose networks. By consolidating the number of networks needed to deliver all forms of ICE,
all IP-networks can reduce or eliminate the need to have separate networks for radio, television,
cable television, telephone service, data and even other physical delivery systems used to reach
consumers of print media such as newspapers and magazines.

        Migration to an all IP-network will enhance the value of broadband Internet access for
both network providers and consumers. Having digitized their networks and replaced many
different operating standards for the single, now preferred Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol combination, network operators can market Internet access as a single,
preferred medium for any and all ICE services. Consumers can benefit when previously separate
demand for content can be aggregated and delivered via a single, more versatile and convenient
conduit.


5.2.3          Cloud Computing and Enterprise Networking

        Even as carriers in developed and developing nations strive to extend broadband services
to residential and small business users, the more sophisticated requirements of large business
users also require accommodation. High volume users increasingly want telecommunications
and Internet carriers to combine telecommunications and information technologies to offer
customized services. Carriers now have the ability to provide managed networks using software
to configure a temporary, “virtual” network designed to meet the specific requirements of one
large volume broadband user.

        A technique known as Multiprotocol Labeling Switching (“MPLS”) enables carriers to
insert routing instructions as labels that preclude the need to inspect packet headers and to look
up the location of the source and destination of traffic. MPLS and other techniques work to
make it possible for an entire corporate network, spanning many countries and continents, to
operate much like a local area network which provides campus-wide Ethernet connections to
many computers.

        The integration of information and telecommunications technologies may have started at
the multinational corporate level, but increasingly sophisticated individual users also have
diversifying network requirements. With a broadband connection employees and sole
proprietors have the means to maintain a Web presence 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The line
between work and leisure can become fuzzy when one can respond to work demand at home and
at other off site, remote locations at any time. Additionally employees have a preference to use
personal handsets and privately owned home computers to handle work-related requirements. It
appears quite possible that high level ICT applications designed for corporate users may extend
to employees as they work from home and other remote locales.

5.2.3.1 Reference Documents and Case Notes

An IP-Centric Ecosystem

        The Internet’s versatility and ease of use makes it plausible to suggest that it will operate
as the primary medium for delivering most of the information, communications and
entertainment service consumers want. Viewing the Internet as a single source for all forms of
content promotes efficiency and scale, but risks the formation of very powerful ventures having
significant control over the Internet marketplace. Competition need not be threatened, or
eliminated simply because all network operators choose to use the same transmission, routing
and switching protocols. However, reliance on a single medium for all types of content means
that previously separate and stand alone networks may consolidate and converge into one
massively large and powerful medium.

5.3            Basic Technologies for Broadband Connectivity

        This section will provide a tutorial on the many different transmission technologies used
to provide broadband services. Because wireless broadband technologies likely will become an
increasingly significant option, this section will also provide an introduction to basic radio
spectrum management. Additional background on spectrum management is available in the ICT
Regulation Toolkit, Module 5, Section 2.2; available at:
http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/Section.3513.html.


5.3.1 Spectrum Management

       While key wire-based technologies operate using closed circuit copper or glass conduits,
wireless broadband transmission technologies use radio spectrum, a shared resource with
physical characteristics that require attention to the potential for excess demand and interfering
uses. Typically governments manage the allocation and assignment of spectrum with an eye
toward reducing the likelihood of both interfering use of the same frequency and insufficient
capacity to meet current and future demand for specific services, such as wireless broadband.
                                                                                               26



        Governments manage this shared public resource by acting as a “traffic cop of the
airwaves” who determines what uses can be made for specific blocs of spectrum and who can
use specifically assigned frequencies through licensing. These potentially intrusive management
strategies originated when spectrum users had limited technological means to avoid causing
interference to other users of the same frequency. Rather than risk the potential for harmful
interference, governments typically identify a specific use for a range of frequencies and assign
specific frequencies solely to one user. When multiple users receive authorization to use the
same frequency from a National Regulatory Authority, the potential for interference is deemed
minimal primarily based on the geographical separation of the licensed users.

        This allocation of spectrum blocs by service and assignment by specific user has occurred
in both intergovernmental forums such as the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”),
and unilaterally in specific national spectrum policies. For example, the ITU, a specialized
agency of the United Nations, decided long ago which frequencies nations should use for
commercial radio and television broadcasting. Individual governments have a sovereign right to
determine whether to accept the global consensus on such spectrum allocations and how to
assign usage rights. Generally nations implement the consensus spectrum allocations decisions
made at the ITU, but they can vary the terms and conditions under which operators secure
spectrum usage rights. Even as many nations support commercial use of broadcast spectrum by
private operators some nations, including developed nations such as the United Kingdom,
continue to have government entities as the sole national broadcaster, or as a subsidized
alternative to commercial broadcasting.

Wireless Broadband Spectrum Management

        Wireless broadband operators need large amounts of spectrum so that they can provide
very fast transmission of feature rich content, such as full motion video, to ever increasing
numbers of subscribers with growing demand for service. Because all useable spectrum already
has a specified use, governments can accommodate growing demand for wireless broadband
spectrum only by reallocating blocks of spectrum with already specified uses. This means that
existing or prospective users of spectrum authorized to use specific frequency bands, may lose
that right, or face the need to share access, a process that requires coordination based on location
of the spectrum use, or the implementation of techniques designed to support multiple, non-
interfering use by two or more nearby operators.

        High bandwidth requirements and rising demand for wireless broadband combine to
                                                                                                  28



support the use of radio spectrum at very high frequencies. These frequencies, measured in the
billions of cycles per second, termed GigaHertz (“GHz”), only recently have become available as
scientists invent ways use spectrum that increasingly has characteristics of visible light energy.
Useable radio spectrum lies on a continuum with sound energy at the low end and infrared and
light waves at the high end. Low radio frequencies have some characteristics like sound such as
the ability to penetrate walls and other obstructions. Very high frequencies have some of the
characteristics of light such as the ability to bounce off obstructions. Having only recently made
allocations of the highest usable frequencies, governments can more easily accommodate the
vast demand for wireless spectrum at these high frequencies in light of the possibility that at least
some frequency bands have few current government and commercial users.

         Very high spectrum also has transmission characteristics, known as propagation, which
supports many broadband uses. For example, these frequencies, like light, lose power quickly
and on a predictable and measureable basis. Wireless broadband operators can use the same
frequencies at nearby locations without interference thereby making it possible to accommodate
lots of simultaneous uses in the same region. This efficient frequency reuse can occur, because
very high frequencies do not travel long distances, a characteristic much more likely to occur at
lower frequencies. At lower frequencies signals with the same transmission power travel farther
and thereby have the potential to interfere with more users operating on the same frequency over
a larger expanse of terrain.

        The likely growing demand for wireless broadband service can generate a shortage,
unless governments respond by reallocating additional spectrum. Candidates for such
reallocation generally represent underused spectrum that results from an initial overly generous
allocation, or because usage patterns have changed. Spectrum reallocation decisions typically
generate conflicts, because no incumbent user group will welcome the need to operate more
efficiently, possibly having to satisfy all requirements with a net reduction in available spectrum
capacity. Governmental spectrum users will invoke national security and cost concerns over
any loss of available spectrum, while incumbent private users also will complain about incurring
higher costs and inconvenience.

        All spectrum has value, but that triggering the greatest demand logically also has the
greatest value. Governments may try to extract some of this value by auctioning off the most
desirable spectrum designated for the most attractive services that include wireless broadband.
While some spectrum auctions have accrued limited returns, ones allocating mobile
radiotelephone service and next generation broadband networks have generated up to several
billions of dollars for national governments.




Spectrum Conservation
                                                                                                  29




        Because spectrum scarcity is all but inevitable for broadband applications, governments
likely will try to reallocate additional spectrum by forcing some users to make do with less. This
freeing up of spectrum can occur when new digital technologies make it possible for operators
to:

               send signals using less total bandwidth;

               carry multiple calls and data sessions over the same channel;

               compress signals so that content can travel using narrower channels;

               increase the speed by which traffic reaches an end user; and

               use new techniques that avoid causing interference even by users in close
               proximity using the same frequency.

        The so-called Digital Dividend 13 provides an example of how digital transmission
techniques make it possible to accommodate incumbent operators’ bandwidth requirements using
less total spectrum. When broadcast television operators convert from analog to digital
transmission, governments typically can “refarm” portions of the frequency band allocated by
reassigning all incumbent users into a smaller range of usable channels thereby freeing up
spectrum for new uses. 14 Digital transmissions reduce the potential for harmful interference
between the signals of two or more television broadcasters, because the signal weakens
(attenuates) quickly after serving a predictable geographical area. Analog signals on the other
hand degrade more slowly making it possible for signal reception and interference to occur over
farther distances from the transmitter. By relocating all broadcasters onto more closely aligned
channels governments can free up spectrum and reallocate it for wireless broadband use.

         Spectrum conservation also can take place through the use of transmission formats that
facilitate shared use by several simultaneous users of the same frequency channel. By using
smart transmitters and receivers, equipped with digital signal processing technology, many
nearby operators can identify unused spectrum and operate at very low power. Before
transmitting, smart radios can identify actual existing users nearby, or consult a data base of
known users.

        Additionally governments can permit use of allocated, but sparsely used spectrum
thereby permitting unlicensed uses in these geographically dispersed “white spaces.” 15
NRAs typically allow white space use only if it does not cause interference with licensed
operators, and other users having a higher access priority. Governments also can identify
spectrum for shared use by unlicensed, low powered devices such as Wi-Fi routers that provide
wireless access to broadband services. However excessive use of unlicensed spectrum leads to
what economists call “the tragedy of the commons” 16 when no one can productively use a shared
resource due to overuse that becomes apparent when users encounter congestion and
interference.

       Because governments cannot typically remedy all types of existing or anticipated
spectrum scarcity, carriers have to employ many types of spectrum conservation techniques.
Section 5.7.2 will identify many strategies used by wireless broadband carriers.

Spectrum Management

        Radio spectrum has different value based on the specific amount of bandwidth available,
propagation characteristics, allocated uses and demand. For example, spectrum allocated for
wireless mobile services such as cellular radio and broadband, can generate billions of dollars in
a competitive auction. On the other hand some spectrum has little value, because of limited
demand, or because a legislature or National Regulatory Authority has decided that the public
should have access on a free and unlicensed basis as is the case for Wi-Fi spectrum. Spectrum
scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply and a government cannot quickly add to the
inventory of available spectrum allocated for a specific use.

5.3.2 Fiber Optic
                                                                                                   31




        Increasingly widespread installation of flexible, fiber optic cables as thin as one strand of
hair constitutes one of the major telecommunications transmission media for broadband
networking. Glass strands coated (“doped”) with trace amounts of rare earth elements such as
erbium provide a medium that can guide extremely fast pulses of laser light beams across
significant distances without the need for reamplification (“regeneration”) of the signal. Very
narrow, high frequency light energy can travel great distances, because this type signal can
“refract” or bounce from one edge of a glass cable to the other without quickly degrading or
weakening as happens when electrons travel through copper wires. While a copper medium
generates friction and resistance to the conduction and transmission of electrons, the glass
medium offers far less obstruction to the transmission of laser signals.

       Carriers using fiber optic cables can transmit vast amounts of broadband traffic, not only
because single strands have wideband capacity and fast transmission speeds, but also because
many pairs of cable (for two-way, simultaneous upstream and downstream “duplex” traffic) can
be bundled together and then encapsulated with plastic and metal cladding for structural support.
Dense Wave Division Multiplexing makes it possible for multiple laser beam (“optical carrier”)
transmissions to take place via a single cable strand using different, non-interfering lightwave
frequencies.

         While the technology of fiber optic cable refraction and transmission involves complex
science, the use of lasers in compact disk (“CD”) and digital video disk (“DVD”) players can
provide insights on how the cables operate. If you were to examine the operation of CD and
DVD players, you would see an apparently constant illuminating red or blue light, which you
should examine only from a distance and at an angle. The light source actually turns on and off
in very quick succession matching the on and off sequence of data transmissions which can be
reduced to a series of ones and zeros. CD and DVD players use the laser beams to “read” the
digital signal streams imbedded in the disk. The concept of different operating frequencies are
represented by the red laser beam used by lower frequency and lower capacity CD and first
generation DVD players, as well as the higher frequency and higher capacity “blue ray” laser
frequency used by current generation DVD players.

        The substantial capital expenditures required to install fiber optic cables support their use
primarily for high capacity transmission projects often covering long distances. Operators seek to
spread the cost to acquire rights of way and install wires within ductwork over a large pool of
users. While the services provided via fiber optic cables may be priced on an average cost basis,
the installation costs of such facilities are distance sensitive, i.e., the total cost increases
incrementally as the length of the cable installment grows. However, once installed fiber optic
cables provide great opportunities to scale up and increase overall transmission capacity simply
by activating additional cable pairs, or by using multiple frequencies of light in each cable.
Except for instances where operators cannot economically justify the cost of installing cables
most long haul carriage of broadband traffic takes place via fiber optic facilities.

The Australian National Broadband Network

         Determining that it should expedite the availability of affordable and ubiquitous
broadband service, the Government of Australia has underwritten the development of a
wholesale broadband network with the goal of serving every resident in the country. The venture
will provide direct fiber connections to 93 percent of the population at speeds of up to 100
megabits per second (“Mbps”) with the most remote residents served by terrestrial wireless and
satellite technology providing bit transmission rates of up to 12 Mbps. The network will provide
business with up to 1 Gbps downstream and 400 Mbps upstream service.

5.3.3 Satellite

         Satellites perform a vital role in the broadband ecosystem, particularly for nations located
far from coastal connections to transoceanic fiber optic cables and major population centers
served by them. From a vantage point located 22,300 miles above earth communications
satellites can provide a signal relay service covering as much as one third of the earth’s surface.
By operating as a “bent pipe” satellites can receive “uplinked” signals from earth and relay
(“downlink”) them back down to locations within a large “footprint,” or signal contour. Satellite
technology has made a reality to something envisioned by science fiction author Sir Arthur C.
Clarke. He predicted the use of an artificial satellite located at a specific orbital location where
the speed of the satellite relative to the earth’s orbital speed made the satellite appear motionless.

        These geostationary satellites are located in a narrow orbital arc where the earth’s
gravitation pull is offset by the centrifugal force created when the satellite was launched.
Because communications satellites primarily are subject to the earth’s gravitation pull, they are
termed geosynchronous. Communications satellites also operate in a geostationary mode when
their orbital speed matches that of the earth and the satellites operate above the equator. At this
location satellites appear to hover, motionless thereby eliminating the need for receiving dish
antennas on earth to track a moving target. Such earth station equipment costs less when they can
“lock in” on a satellite operating in a single location.

         Signal transmissions from satellites travel long distances and generate a large footprint on
the surface of the earth. An unconcentrated satellite signal can cover as much as one-third of the
earth’s surface making it possible for a single source of content to reach many receivers located
within the footprint. This point-to-multipoint capability makes satellites well suited for content
delivery targeted for access by many simultaneous users, e.g., video and television relay, but the
distance from earth results in some negative factors when used for Internet access by individuals
and for point-to-point communications between two people as occurs in telephone calls. The
time it takes to send and receive traffic from distant satellites results in comparatively more delay
than what occurs using terrestrial options. Such latency can present problems for traffic that
frequently switches between sender and receiver, videogames. Also without increasing signal
strength by narrowing the size of the footprint, or using higher powered transmitters satellites
require large earth station dish antennas and other equipment having significant bulk and
expense1.

        Despite their limitations, satellites perform a vital role in extending the geographical
scope and reach of broadband access to areas where a business case does not support private
venture investment in very high capacity fiber optic cable, or terrestrial wireless services.
Satellites may provide the only viable, “gap-filling” broadband distribution technology to the
most remote and least populated locations in the world. Additionally networks using many
small, low cost satellite earth stations can serve users located in remote areas as well as places
where the terrain makes terrestrial services comparatively more expensive, or infeasible, e.g., a
chain of islands, and communities situated in remote desserts, mountaintops and valleys. Users
in these remote areas can access broadband satellites using Very Small Aperture Antenna
(“VSAT”) earth stations operating as a geographically dispersed network. A star topology
VSAT network combines a central hub earth station with many smaller terminals. A mesh
network eliminates the need for a central hub. Another broadband network access option in
remote areas combines the use of VSATs with a terrestrial network such as wi-fi or Wi-MAX.

        In light of ever-increasing consumer demand for high speed, high capacity broadband
service, satellite operators have begun to launch satellites with much more available bandwidth
optimized for data services. These High Throughput Satellites (“HTS”) have greater size and
overall transmission power than previous satellite generations. They also use many small and
steerable, “spot beam” transmitting antennas that can concentrate signals to cover a smaller
portion of earth thereby making it possible to use receiving dishes with a diameter of 1-3 meters.

         Satellites have significant disadvantages compared to fiber optic cables rendering them a
more expensive option for point-to-point broadband transmission services. Satellites only can
offer a fixed amount of bandwidth while a few fiber optic cable pairs can transmit the total
capacity of all available communications satellites. Satellites have a usable life of about fifteen
years and cannot easily be repaired should a malfunction occur. On average one out of every ten
communications satellite launches fails and a single satellite typically costs $300 million or more
to construct, insure, launch and track. Additionally the large distance between satellites and
users results in longer transmission time (latency) than what it takes to send and receive via a
terrestrial network. For two way traffic, such as voice and some kinds of Internet traffic that
involve frequent changes in who transmits and who receives, such latency can present a problem.
                                                                                                    38



         Despite these cost disadvantages, satellites offer comparatively greater cost savings for
point-to-multipoint applications, such a video content distribution, because activating an
additional receiving point within the satellite footprint has low costs, primarily the installation of
a relatively inexpensive receiving antenna and associated electronics.

Basic Technical Elements of Satellites

        Satellites provide a broadband signal relay function requiring them to have onboard all
the electronics needed to receive content and resend it back to earth. The receiver/transmitter
(“transceiver”) function requires radios, tuned to satellite frequencies—typically at the very high
GigaHertz (“GHz”) range—and capable of both receiving and transmitting content. To power
these radios, satellites need a constant source of electrical power. The primary source comes
from solar energy collected by panels that cover much of the satellite’s exterior. However,
because the moon occasionally blocks access to solar energy in an eclipse, satellites also must
have rechargeable batteries onboard.

         Satellites operate in a number of extremely high frequency bands for two primary
reasons. Because of the distance between earth-based users and satellites (ranging from a few
hundred to 22,300 miles) transmissions must use very narrow signals to achieve a direct line of
sight link to a tiny, distant target. For downlinking from the satellite even a very narrow beam
expands as the signal travels down toward earth. Extremely high frequencies transmit with very
narrow amplitude and therefore have the desired propagational characteristics. Also satellites
require substantial blocs of radio spectrum. National Regulatory Authorities could identify new
previously unused extremely high frequency bands for which satellites could make the first
practical use.

        Multinational and national spectrum managers use alphabetical letters to identify the
frequency bands allocated for satellite use. The C-band and Ku-band represent the major
frequency band used by most communications satellites, with the later used Ka-band offering
more spectrum for data and broadband service. Satellite frequency bands typically have
different allocations for spectrum used to “up-link” to a satellite and for spectrum used to “down-
link” from the satellite. Generally the uplinking bands operate at higher frequencies than the
downlinking bands. For example the C-band uplinking frequencies range from 5.925 GHz to
6.425 GHz with the downlinking frequencies at 3.7 to 4.2 GHz.

        The lettered satellite spectrum also identifies frequency bands that support different types
of service, in part based on signal propagation characteristics. The L-band offers spectrum at the
lowest frequencies now used by satellites. These lower frequencies make it possible to for
consumers to use very small, lightweight handsets to communicate with satellites. Satellites
operating in low earth orbit (“LEO”), only a few hundred miles above earth, can receive
comparatively weaker signals than ones operating in geostationary orbit 22, 300 miles above
earth. Mobile satellite service ventures, such as Iridium and Globalstar operate in the L-band.
Other L-band services include satellites used primarily for maritime, aeronautical and mobile
applications like that offered by Inmarsat. Additionally global positioning satellite (“GPS”)
services operate in the L-band. These satellites operate in Middle Earth Orbit (“MEO”), about
                                                                                                                           39



12,500 miles above earth, and transmit with at high power making it possible for mobile handset
manufacturers to install a very small module capable of receiving GPS signals.

       The S-band and X-band generally provide spectrum for government satellites including
frequencies used for defense, intelligence and some remote sensing applications. S-Band is also
used for satellite phone and TV broadcasting in some countries.

        The Ka-band provides and increasingly used frequency band for the latest generation of
communications satellites, particularly ones providing broadband access such as High
Throughput Satellites. At Ka-band frequencies (17.3-30 GHz) satellite operates need to consider
the potential for rain, fog and smog to weaken and interfere with signals. Ka-band satellite
operators can increase the transmission signal strength. Alternatively some Ka-band operators,
e.g., o3B, use MEO orbiting satellites that can combine high transmission power with shorter
distances to earth to ensure reliable service.

         The frequency range of transceivers is limited by the amount of total weight the satellite
can support. Typically satellites have several hundred MegaHertz (“MHz”) of bandwidth which
is measured in terms of transponders each having about 36 MHz of capacity. Satellites double
their transponder capacity through the process of polarizing signals, in the same manner as
coated sunglasses block certain solar frequencies while allowing other frequencies through.
Satellite receivers and transmitters are able to use signals polarized horizontally and vertically
using the same frequency without significant interference.

         Operating at such a great distance from earth, satellites need to amplify both received and
transmitted signals. A two step process provides the necessary amplification (“gain”). First
satellites use parabolic antennas that collect received signals from all angles of the curved
circular surface. Similarly they aggregate transmitted signals across the same surface when
transmitted back to earth. The collection and aggregation of signal strength provides a natural,
non-electronic amplification in much the same way as ears and eyes collect and concentrate
sound and light respectively. Satellites collect both received and transmitted signals at a single
focal point known as the feed horn. Additional signal amplification takes place electronically in
both receivers and transmitters.

        Satellites also need systems to manage the steep variation in temperature caused by direct
exposure to the sun and the absence of such exposure. Heat sinks are used to draw away heat
and reduce the temperature of sensitive electronic components. Satellites also need onboard
ways to keep the satellite in its proper orbit (“on station”) and properly pointed down toward
earth (proper “azimuth setting).” To achieve ongoing stability, including the elimination of
vibration to antennas and other sensitive components, satellites use internal motors or gyroscopes
that spin internally, or at external locations lacking proximity to sensitive components. So called
spin-stabilized satellites combine internal gyroscopes and exterior spinning to achieve
stabilization. One way to visualize this process is to examine washing machines that have an
                                                                                                    41



interior basin that spins at high speeds to draw away water from cleaned clothing in what is
commonly called the spin cycle. As the interior basin spins the exterior vibrates less. For spin
stabilized satellites the external spinning and interior gyroscope spinning makes it possible for
other parts of the satellite to operate without vibration and instability.

The now dominant satellite design uses long wings and an interior spinning motor to control the
three major axis of flight: yawl, pitch and roll. Satellites of this type are termed three-axis
stabilized. Satellite carriers prefer this design, because it can provide more bandwidth using a
much larger payload than spin stabilized spacecraft.

         Satellites also need the ability to rise to geostationary orbit from a lower, temporary
position reached by using large capacity thrusters attached to the rocket launcher. Satellites also
may have to change orbital parking places (“slots”) and to make minor adjustments in their
location and earth pointing orientation or attitude. Small thrusters located on the satellite provide
short bursts of propulsion to place and return a satellite to its proper location and orientation
relative to earth. Most satellites use a gas fuel known as hydrazine to control their position or
attitude. Because satellites have only a fixed amount of fuel on board, often station keeping is
the first operational element of a satellite to fail. Such satellites tend to wobble in orbit and can
continue to provide service, albeit less reliable. New generations of satellites will use electric
propulsion instead of gas power thereby reducing their weight and extending useable life.
Satellites also have on board processors to receive and respond to instructions issued from earth
and to send down information about their current health and operating conditions (“telemetry”).

Basic Technical Elements of Satellite Receivers

         Satellite receivers (“earth stations”) combine many of the same elements contained in
satellites to process and convert signals into useable content. Outdoors a parabolic antenna
(“dish”) must have an unobstructed “line of sight” to the desired satellite downlink transmission.
Most communications satellites hover 22,300 miles above the equator so earth stations located
north must point south and earth stations south of the equator must point north. Dish antennas
located close to the equator have a more advantageous “look angle” toward the satellite, because
the signal from the satellite will traverse less of the earth’s atmosphere, as it points upward at a
more direct angle. Likewise the dish can avoid more obstructions, because it can be pointed well
above the horizon pointing upward instead of across the horizon. A satellite antenna located on
the equator would point straight upward while dishes near the north and south pole have to point
only a few degrees above the horizon.

      In the immediate vicinity of the antenna satellite earth stations have electronic
components that process and amplify the weak signal that has traversed 22,300 miles and been
                                                                                                       45



concentrated at the feed horn located above the center of the parabola. The GigaHertz
frequencies used to transmit content are converted to lower frequencies so that cheaper and more
effective amplification can take place. A device known as a block converter/low noise amplifier
performs the frequency conversion and amplification process. The signal subsequently travels
via a closed circuit low loss wire and is attached to the antenna terminal of a receiver. Inside the
receiver the signal may undergo additional frequency conversions and filtering. Additionally the
desired content is detached from the radio frequency carrier, a process known as demodulation.
The now stripped off content is delivered to a proper device for consumption, e.g., a computer
terminal, radio receiver, or television set.

Satellite Orbits and Footprints

        Satellites operate in several orbital locations, based on their function and target audience.
as does the size of the transmission contour (“footprint”) received on earth. For maximum
coverage and connectivity communications satellites operate in the geostationary orbital arc and
use unconcentrated “global beams.” By concentrating the downlink beam size, satellite
operators can increase the strength of the received signal available in a smaller geographical
area. Satellites operating in geostationary orbit typically have global beams for maximum
coverage, plus concentrated beams, having a smaller footprint, but making it possible for users
within the smaller coverage area to install smaller receiving antennas. As a satellite footprint
decreases in size the strength of the received signal increases making it possible to use smaller
antennas. Concentrated footprints of geostationary satellites can cover an entire hemisphere,
with about half the coverage as a global beam, a zone within one hemisphere, with about one
quarter the coverage of a global beam, or as small a coverage area as a single metropolitan area
(a “spot beam”). Geostationary orbiting satellites can more readily provide broadband services
                                                                                                 46



using spot beams, because the higher signal strength supports the needed wideband link and
users can transmit and receive content using the smallest possible earth stations.

        Satellites operating in orbits closer to earth are better equipped to provide broadband
services, because of the lower signal delay and the ability to generate adequate signals for use by
small, even handheld devices. Satellites located closer to earth than 22,300 miles lose their
geostationary orbital status. This means that they become moving targets orbiting in known
locations that must be tracked and monitored from earth. Several existing and planned
broadband satellite venture have designed a network using satellites in middle earth orbit
(“MEO”), a location where satellites can still operate without the risk of being pulled back to
earth by gravity. MEO broadband networks require more operating satellites, because the closer
proximity to earth reduces the footprint size. However this closer location makes it possible for
subscribers to communicate with these satellites using small, lightweight devices.

Coordinating Satellite Use

        Because of the potential for interference and the duty to share scarce resources, nations
using satellites must coordinate their use of both satellite orbital locations and frequencies. The
International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”) provides a multinational forum for conflict
avoidance through the process of registering future uses and conflict resolution by providing a
forum for parties to negotiate ways to avoid actual or anticipated interference. Invariably
conflicts will occur, because only a relatively small number of satellites can share the
geostationary orbital arc and demand for satellite services continues to grow.

         Nations generally coordinate the use of satellite orbital slots through an ITU notification
process that favors the first filed registration. This process may create incentives for prospective
satellite operators to register uses prematurely and to increase the anticipated number of orbital
slots required. The ITU has sought to reduce such “paper satellite” registrations and to impose
deadlines for operators to launch and operate a satellite.

Geostationary Orbiting Satellites

International Telecommunications Satellite Organization

INTELSAT was established by national governments in 1965 to operate the world’s first global
communications system. The organization first operated as a cooperative, but later privatized
into a commercial venture. INTELSAT operates geostationary orbiting satellites, including ones
22,300 miles above the equator in slots located between continents to maximize geographical
coverage and connectivity. For background on INTELSAT see: http://www.intelsat.com/.

International Maritime Organization

Inmarsat was organized in 1979 to provide service to maritime users. This organization operated
as a cooperative using spectrum allocated specifically for maritime applications. Nations
participating in Inmarsat subsequently amended the treaty level management document to
authorize the organization to serve aviation (“aeronautical”) and land-based users. Inmarsat
subsequently privatized and now provides broadband services via geostationary satellites. For
background on Inmarsat see: http://www.inmarsat.com/index.htm.

Middle Earth Orbiting Satellites

O3b

O3b proposes to use Medium Earth Orbit (“MEO”) satellites, located approximately 8,000km
away from Earth to provide voice and data service primarily to users in lesser developed nations
situated near the Equator. The network will use Ka frequencies (20-30 GHz) in an orbital
constellation that emphasizes service to users located 45 degrees north and south of the Equator.
The venture’s name refers to the other three billion people on earth who lack access to advanced
telecommunications services due to geography, political instability and economics.

Low Earth Orbiting Satellites

Iridium

The Iridium satellite networks uses 66 low earth orbiting satellites to provide voice and data
service primarily to users in locations where reliable terrestrial service does not exist. Because
the Iridium satellites operate close to earth their footprints are small thereby requiring a larger
number in the constellation of satellites to provide global coverage. Iridium satellites are
interconnected and cross-linked so they can communicate with nearby satellites in adjacent
orbits. For background on the Iridium network see:
http://www.iridium.com/About/IridiumGlobalNetwork/SatelliteConstellation.aspx.

Using Satellites for Broadband Service

While satellites lack the capacity of terrestrial networks such as fiber optic cables, their large
geographical coverage makes it possible to provide broadband service to users in many widely
dispersed locations that may never qualify for terrestrial broadband network service. Recently
launched satellites in the Ka-band (20-30 GHz) offer high power and large bandwidth making it
possible for offer broadband service at speeds exceeding 10 megabits per second.

5.3.4 Microwave

       Microwave technology offers low cost solutions to broadband requirements mostly for
non-residential applications. For many decades it provides point-to-point analog services using
very high frequencies 17 that can provide first and last kilometer services for local and long
distance telephone companies, as well as business users. Microwave radio offers long haul
transmission using a chain of repeater transmitters, each transmitting over a distance of up to 50
kilometers.

       Microwave transmissions have proved quite reliable and cost effective service, largely
because ample spectrum makes it possible to transmit a large volume of traffic over such
networks. Operators can achieve efficient scale which makes it possible to spread the costs of
constructing towers and installing the necessary electronics over a large user base.

        While microwave frequencies operate in bands that favor line of sight, directional
transmissions, they also can provide point-to-multipoint services spanning an entire contour of
360 degrees. Recent examples of such “omni-directional” service include wireless fidelity (“Wi-
Fi”) that provides short range broadband access to multiple portable devices and Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access (“WiMAX”) service offering broadband access with
signal contours extending out for up to 15-20 kilometers.

         Microwave radio networks use parabolic antennas, much like that installed for satellite
communications. However the antennas are pointed across the horizon in the direction of a
transmitting antenna located on a tower or rooftop installation some distance away. Like satellite
communications microwave radio transmitters need an unobstructed “line of sight” link to the
next transmitting antenna in a network chain. Microwave networks contain a relatively simple
combination of receivers and transmitters typically located at high vantage points to avoid
obstruction by buildings and terrain. Transmitters contain a number of subsystems that include
multiplexing, the combining of many different channels of traffic, encoding and modulating
signals, alignment of traffic onto the proper transmitting frequency, signal amplification and
filtering for spectrum control. Receiver functions include filtering, down-conversion of
frequencies for easier processing and amplification, demodulation, decoding, and
demultiplexing.
                                                                                                  52



         Microwave radio can provide a cost-effective, land-based solution particularly for terrain
not favoring inexpensive underground ductwork installations, e.g., swampy, rocky and sandy
locations. Similarly microwave radio can operate in urban locales, including the central business
district, where tall buildings provide an ideal vantage point for line of sight transmission and
reception above all obstructions. Because microwave networks do not require the installation of
below ground ducts, or closely spaced above ground poles, installation can occur on a relatively
short timetable. Placing transmitting and receiving antennas at high vantage points also prevents
most service disruptions, like that caused by cuts in wires.

        On the other hand microwave network operators need to coordinate their use with other
operators to avoid congestion and interference, especially in urban locales. Additionally some
equipment, located in remote and hard to reach places, will need maintenance and a source of
electric power that may not be generally available in the area. Operators also need to consider
propagation factors including the potential for rain and snow to cause signal fading and
weakening.

Microwave Backhaul and Middle Mile Services

       Microwave radio networks can provide long, medium and short haul carriage of
broadband traffic. Long haul applications typically substitute for fiber optic and copper based
                                                                                                     53



networks, because hostile terrain conditions necessitate wireless tower-based operation instead of
transmissions underground, or via closely spaced poles. Short haul carriage includes the first and
last kilometer access to private networks, such as a dedicated network for retailers, banks and
other financial service providers, manufacturers, etc. Recently some stock market traders have
installed dedicated, private microwave networks, because they can provide slightly faster
opportunities (lower “latency”) to receive the latest share price information and to execute trades.

         For medium distances microwave radio networks provide essential links between
facilities of users and network operators. So-called middle mile services provide a link between
the geographically separate factories and other installations of users within a region. A single
business venture may have the need to link many different factories, office building, warehouses,
and campuses within a region. Each facility can communicate with all others via the short haul
first and last kilometer microwave radio facilities interconnected with other microwave facilities
designed to transmit at farther distances.

         Microwave radio also provides essential “backhaul” functions for networks including
satellite and terrestrial wireless networks. Many traffic receiving facilities are situated in remote
locales that must be interconnected with network management facilities typically located at a
central point, often in a city or suburb. Microwave backhaul networks receive and deliver traffic
originating at remote tower sites like those providing cellular radio telephone service. The
towers that provide service to cellphones and smartphone also contain parabolic antennas to send
voice and broadband data traffic to a central facility, commonly referred to as the Mobile
Telephone Switching Office (“MTSO”) for onward delivery to other networks, including the
Internet “cloud.”

5.3.5          Copper

        Copper metal has provided a closed circuit medium for telecommunications since the
onset of telegraph and telephone service in the late 1800s. Wireline communications exploit the
electron conductivity of copper and its historically moderate price. While far from ubiquitous
wireline copper networks typically serve all areas with high and moderate population density and
many more remote areas have qualified for universal service subsidies that extend the
geographical reach of service. Copper has provided a cost-effective way to route voice, data, and
video traffic via above-ground wires attached to poles and through underground ductwork.
Wireline service costs increase with the distance served by a network, but carriers may average
costs.

         For many years copper wireline networks have provided both first and last kilometer
service as well has long haul transmission. The conventional wireline Public Switched
Telephone Network (“PSTN”) uses narrow gauge copper wire pairs to form a “local loop”
connection between individual subscribers and a nearby telephone company switching facility.
Telephone companies provide highly reliable service using direct current to power the local loop
at short distances not requiring electronic amplification. For onward delivery from the initial
switching facility, commonly referred to as the End Office or Central Office, telephone
companies aggregate traffic by multiplexing so that larger capacity trunk line and inter-office
channels handle many simultaneous calls. Telephone networks have evolved over time to
incorporate digital transmission technologies and increasingly efficient routing and multiplexing
of traffic.

        Copper wires of higher thickness (“gauge”) and more insulation and support (“cladding”)
can provide a closed circuit medium for the delivery of video content. Cable television networks
use coaxial cables to offer many channels of video content through a locality or metropolitan
area. Cable television operators provided the first truly broadband, two-way networking
capability to residences. They started offering one way retransmission of a few broadcast
stations, so called Master or Community Antenna Television. Cable operators later expanded the
bandwidth available from the coaxial cable to provide many additional channels, installed an
upstream channel and provided each subscriber with an address so that individual subscribers
could request and receive specialized content, e.g., pay per view, video on demand, premium
programming.
                                                                                               56



        Both the PSTN and cable television networks have been retrofitted so that they can
provide broadband, Internet access. While next generation networks primarily will use wireless
and fiber optic connections, currently most residential broadband access comes from two copper-
based networks: 1) Digital Subscriber Line (“DSL”) service provided by telephone companies
and 2) cable modem service provided via cable television networks discussed in Section 5.7.1.




5.4    International Connectivity

        Broadband access to the Internet requires the seamless interconnection and coordination
of many networks operated by different carriers. People refer to the Internet as a “network of
networks,” because users simply “call up” web sites by keying in easily remembered domain
names such as www.worldbank.org. Behind the scenes, a series of universally agreed to
operating standards support the integration of the several links needed to connect consumers of
content with sources. Carriers interconnect their telecommunications lines using common
protocols that make it possible to identify and link users and sources of content. Many users also
refer to Internet access as “cloud computing,” because the various interconnected networks
appear invisible as though they operated in a cloud.

        We can penetrate the obscurities of the Internet cloud to identify each and every network
used for any particular link. Traceroute software and Internet web sites offer an easy way to
generate a report on the specific networks used to reach a user-identified destination. To
achieve global accessibility and connectivity, several different types of carriers participate.
These carriers have transmission and routing equipment in identifiable locations, even though
users generally do not think of the Internet in terms of the locations of specific devices and
equipment. Internet access starts with a query or request generated by an individual, machine or
sensor located in a specific location. A “retail” Internet Service Provider (“ISP”), which has
                                                                                                     57



installed wired or wireless facilities, provides the first leg of this Internet routing. The first link
is often described as the first kilometer or mile, but the actual length may span vast distances via
a satellite earth station instead of other local options such as DSL, cable modem, microwave and
cellular radio.

         The retail ISP connects upstream with one or more ISPs that may not provide service to
residential users, or other “end users” including small and medium sized businesses. Many of
these ISPs provide “wholesale” service in the sense that they concentrate on providing service to
large volume users, such as multinational corporations and governments. Most of these ISPs
own and operate lines with extremely large transmission capacity that provides long haul service
across vast distances including transcontinental and transoceanic coverage. The ISPs may
connect directly with content providers, or with a retail ISP that provides the so-called first and
last kilometer service to and from the content source.

       International connectivity among ISPs operates in a hierarchical fashion with
comparatively many retail ISPs, and fewer ISPs that offer long haul services to subscribers in a
diverse geographical area. Among long haul ISPs the hierarchy continues and becomes more
exclusive with very few operating as so-called Tier-1 ISPs and more operating as Tier-2 ISPs.

       Tier-1 ISPs represent the largest carriers having the most extensive and highest capacity
networks. These carriers also carry the most traffic and typically qualify for interconnection
with other carriers on a zero cost, “sender keep all” basis, i.e., no funds are transferred between
two ISPs largely because a roughly equal amount of traffic originates from one carrier for
onward delivery by the other carrier. The term peering 18 refers to the zero cost interconnection
arrangements Tier-1 ISPs negotiate. Smaller ISPs typically secure access to Tier-1 carrier
networks on a paid basis commonly termed transit, or paid peering.

        As the Internet matures and more ISPs enter the marketplace, new hybrid arrangements
have evolved that deviate from the peering/transiting dichotomy. For example, some Tier-1 ISPs
have opted for “private peering” where they interconnect directly with another ISP, outside of
Internet Exchanges. 19 Some ISPs now agree to “multilateral peering” where more than two
carriers interconnect on common terms and conditions at an Internet Exchange.

5.4.1 International Links

        Fiber optic submarine cables and communications satellites provide the vast majority of
broadband international links. For nations bordering on a coast submarine fiber optic cables
provide the most cost-effective option as a cable installation can combine several cable strands,
each capable of transmitting at a rate of several Gigabits per second (“Gbps”). For example the
recently installed TAT-14 cable linking the United States with several points in Europe has a
baseline capacity of 10 Gigabits per second that carriers subdivide into three service offerings:
Synchronous Transport Module 1 (“STM-1”), approximately 155.520 Mbps; STM-4 ,
approximately 622.080 Mbps and STM-16, approximately 2.5 Gbps. The cable system has four
fiber pairs configured for 47 channels each with about 10 Gbps in capacity, making the total
design capacity of the cable system 3.2 Terabits per second.
                                                                                                58




        Satellites cannot match fiber optic cables in the terms of overall capacity and bit
transmission speed. However satellites can provide a cost-effective way to distribute broadband
Internet traffic to many locations within a footprint as compared to the single point-to-point
design for submarine cables. Satellites have the ability to transmit broadband Internet traffic at
rates exceeding 15 Mbps, but more affordable retail offerings typically offer somewhat slower
service, particularly for uploading content to the satellite. 20

5.4.2 Internet Links

         Having made the near complete conversion from analog to digital networks carriers have
great flexibility in the manner in which they load traffic onto available transmission capacity.
Technological convergence makes it possible for both domestic and international transmission
facilities to combine voice and data traffic rather than use specific links for Internet traffic
separate from conventional voice traffic lines. Instead, Internet links use transmission, switching
and routing protocols optimized for data traffic, but also capable of handling voice traffic
configured for transmission via Internet links. Put another way carriers no longer configure
networks with an eye toward allocating transmission capacity for specific types of service. With
traffic converted into packets of digital bits, both international and domestic links can handle
bitstreams that subsequently will be converted into voice, data, video, text and other types of
traffic.
                                                                                                   59



        Technological convergence means that a reference to Internet links has less to do with the
nature of the traffic carried and more to do with the operating standards used by the carrier as
well as the terms and conditions established for the complete delivery of the traffic. 21 This
means that carriers are less likely to identify the nature of the traffic, e.g., telephone call versus
video link, or to use legacy measures of the traffic, e.g., minutes of use. Instead the traffic will
be identified in terms of the capacity and speed of the transmission link as well as the
interconnection arrangements established for that link.

         When carriers establish interconnection terms and conditions for Internet links, they
increasingly refrain from applying the longstanding financial terms and conditions used in
telecommunications and telephone service in particular. These legacy arrangements
characterized interconnection as a “settlement” based on usage, such as voice minutes. Carriers
handing off more traffic than they received from a specific carrier had to transfer funds to the
“terminating” carrier. Carriers providing long distance telephone service negotiated a
compensation arrangement, commonly referred to as an accounting rate, applicable to every
minute of usage. For Internet links carriers are less apt to meter traffic in terms of time. Instead
they will interconnect based on the capacity of the network links used and an estimate of overall
traffic volume handled. For Internet links carriers substitute a measurement of minutes used
with a determination of the bandwidth and bit transmission speed made available for the carriage
of traffic originated by another carrier and routed onward to the final destination, or to the
network of another carrier located closer to the final destination.

         ISPs use different vocabulary and transmission measures when they interconnect Internet
links. Also they generally use commercial negotiations to establish agreements, rather than rely
on government forums, or regulated terms and conditions contained in a public contract known
as a tariff. The largest Tier-1 ISPs, providing the longest links with the highest capacity,
typically choose to interconnect directly with other similarly large and important carriers. Based
on the assumption that Tier-1 ISPs typically have the same amount of transmission capacity
available in different geographical regions, these carriers initiate interconnection negotiations
with the expectation that they probably will not need to transfer funds. If two ISPs generate the
same amount of traffic for each other to handle, then no money transfer should occur, because
ISP A hands off to ISP B roughly the same volume of traffic that ISP B handed off to ISP A to
handle. Such equivalency allows the carriers to “bill and keep” all funds generated from service.
ISPs use the term peering to refer to interconnection arrangements based on traffic equivalency.

        When two ISPs do not have roughly equivalent traffic volumes, the carrier generating
more traffic that it receives incurs an obligation to compensate the other ISP. The term transit
refers to negotiated terms and conditions when interconnected traffic volumes are unequal and a
transfer of funds has to take place. The Internet links available to consumers combine peering
and transiting capacity seamlessly so that in the vast majority of instances Internet access is
available to any site, typically via more than one carrier and route.

       Only in rare instances have ISPs refused to maintain an existing arrangement, or come up
with acceptable replacement terms and conditions. When a dispute cannot get resolved two ISPs
no longer will interconnect their Internet links. However, consumers usually do not experience
                                                                                                       60



service outages, because carriers typically negotiate several interconnection arrangements,
covering two or more alternative routing arrangements, commonly referred as multi-homing.
Except in instances where only one carrier provides “single homing” access to and from a
content source and destination, one carrier’s decision to “de-peer” and not interconnect usually
does not result in the inability to have Internet traffic routed to and from any source or recipient
of content.

5.4.3 Implementation Issues for International Connectivity

       Thanks to a common set of operating protocols carriers can interconnect their broadband
networking with ease. For Internet traffic the Transmission Control Protocol (“TCP”) provides a
widely used standard for traffic switching, routing and transmission. TCP helps support
economic efficiency in the production of equipment, such as routers, by establishing a common
standard useable by all manufacturers. While many devices are available and later vintages
incorporate newly available features, the TCP supports high volume production of routers and
                                                                                                    61



other equipment produced based on the ability to sell them to all carriers and other users
throughout the world. Put more simply the TCP establishes a standard “traffic cop” management
function that most Internet equipment uses.

        Additional enhancement of international connectivity results from the use of a common
Internet addressing system, the Internet Protocol (“IP”) by both consumers and carriers. Having
a common addressing system means that consumers need only remember the names attributed to
desired Internet sites, e.g., InfoDev.org. Carriers install devices, such as routers, that can read IP
addresses and convert them to a larger sequence of numbers that corresponds to a specific
installed device, e.g., the computer and the network used to originate a request for service as well
as the name of the designated source of the requested service, or content.

        The IP provides the basis for a universally supported addressing system that can establish
order and promote ease in use by subscribers. While behind the scenes, ISP use routers to look
up identities and locations of service requesters and providers from special servers containing
such registrations, requesters only need to key in a single IP address. End users do not even have
to know the procedures for assigning IP addresses and the method for organizing them. So
called Top Level Domains refer to the type of organization housing the computer that originates
a service request and the server that delivers requested content. For example .edu identifies an
educational institution and follows its name or acronym. The complete address for the
Pennsylvania State University in the United States combines www, to identify the part of the
Internet providing Internet World Wide Web sites, the acronym psu followed by edu. Other top
level domains include .com, .org, .mil., .co. and net representing in sequence commercial
ventures, inter-governmental, multilateral and nongovernmental organizations, militaries,
companies and networks. Additionally an IP address can specify the country location attributed
to the IP address, e.g., www.bbc.co.uk for the United Kingdom based British Broadcasting
Corporation.

        While operating protocols promote international connectivity other factors have the
potential to hamper progress and impose higher costs, particularly for users and operators least
able to afford them. Maximum international connectivity requires the existence of networks for
each and every link in the pathway between content server and recipient. Ideally each network
should be in place and readily accessible either because one venture owns and operates each link,
or because multiple ventures use common operating protocols and have agreed to mutually
beneficial interconnection terms and conditions. In the multiple carrier scenario consumers can
benefit by having access to more than one routing option as well as the potential that carriers will
compete for both the long haul links and the first and last kilometer links.

         On the other hand consumers may incur higher costs and inferior service if multiple
carriers cannot easily interconnect their networks, or when few if any carriers are available to
provide service. The weakest link—in terms of competitiveness and ease of interconnection—
can have the most significant impact on the quality, convenience and affordability of service.
For example, if the lack of network options forces a carrier to resort to indirect and circuitous
traffic routing, both the carrier and its subscribers will suffer in terms of higher costs and inferior
quality of service, including higher latency. The Internet’s operating protocols are designed to
                                                                                                    62



secure a complete link from the network capacity that is both immediately available to a specific
ISP and represents one of the possibly many options for which the ISP has secured
interconnection rights. If no such link exists, the ISP and the TCP/IP will search for alternative,
indirect options.
        ISPs and their subscribers in developing countries face the greatest possibility that they
may not have access to the most direct and efficient routing, at the least cost. Direct network
interconnection may not exist. The lack of competition might make a direct link prohibitively
expensive. ISPs that might want to interconnect networks may lack an efficient and low cost
way to do so. When direct interconnection cannot take place, indirect options have to suffice
even though they add time, distance and cost to a link. For example, until nations in Africa had
local or regional interconnection facilities, ISPs had to secure interconnection at distant facilities,
some located many thousands of kilometers away. The term thromboning refers to the need to
use circuitous routing to achieve interconnection that optimally could have occurred at a more
convenient, nearby location.

        Even for ISPs in relatively close proximity to each other, if direct interconnection cannot
take place, a short link between countries would have to be replaced with two longer links to a
third nation having ample interconnection facilities, e.g., nations in Europe. For example
consider a still plausible scenario where African ISP-1, receiving a request to contact nearby
African ISP-2 might not have a direct interconnection option. Instead African ISP-1 must route
the traffic to a European ISP with which it has a transit agreement. African ISP-1 and its
European transit service provider might interconnect at an Internet Exchange located in Europe.
The African carrier would incur the costs to carry the traffic to Europe as well as the transit costs
incurred when the transit providing European ISP routes the traffic to African ISP-2. The
European ISP might provide the return path from Europe to Africa by itself, or via
interconnection with one or more other ISPs with which it peers or transits, for onward carriage
to African ISP-2’s network.

        Years ago African ISPs might have identified ways to secure routing of their traffic via
other generous carriers who might agree to provide transit services at low prices. The term hot
potato routing refers to a strategy of handing off traffic as quickly as possible so that other
carriers incur more of the total cost to secure a complete link. Because all ISPs now pay close
attention to traffic volumes and the flow of traffic, ISPs cannot easily find inexpensive hot potato
routing opportunities. ISPs bear the obligation to build or lease the facilities necessary to handle
traffic without premature handoffs. However even if an ISP in a developing country did not
want to handoff traffic to avoid network costs, having to do so now triggers higher routing costs.

        ISPs not keen on exploiting hot potato routing opportunities need to have networks
available to route local and regional traffic as well as the ability to interconnect with all needed
networks. Because even the largest Tier-1 ISP does not own or least all the network capacity
needed to reach any and all sites throughout the world, all ISPs need to have access to a facility
that operates as a hub and interconnection point for many ISPs. These Internet Exchanges
(examined in Section 5.5.2) provide the physical means for achieving local, regional and
international connectivity by serving as the agreed to “meeting point” for all ISPs operating in
the vicinity as well as those ISPs equipped to provide long haul transmission to other continents.
                                                                                                  63



Internet Exchanges provide seamless interconnection between local operators providing first and
last kilometer service with other ISPs operating international links.


5.5    Domestic Backbone

         When broadband service is characterized as an “information superhighway” the domestic
and international links used for medium and long haul carriage aggregate traffic from many
individual users. First and last kilometer links may serve only one subscriber, or a small group
in close proximity, but so called backbone networks use very high capacity transmission
facilities that carry the traffic of many subscribers. Carriers can maximize network efficiency by
collecting traffic and injecting it onto high capacity transmission lines for carriage over long
distances. Multiplexing provides the traffic loading process whereby the traffic of many
individual subscribers is combined for carriage by high capacity cables and wireless links
onward toward the final destination. Demultiplexing unloads and disaggregates inbound traffic
so that the ISP can route content to the appropriate end user.

        Domestic backbone networks use the same transmission technologies as international
backbones with the same goal of providing full connectivity. However there exists a likelihood
that domestic backbones may not reach remote and hinterland locations, particularly in
developing countries. Even if two distant cities share access to a domestic backbone, localities
situated between these two hubs typically do not have the traffic and financial resources to
persuade network operators to install branches off the backbone trunk.

         International connectivity has become certain thanks to sufficient demand and the
competitive necessity of having to offer widespread network access throughout the world. Such
certainty does not exist for domestic connectivity even in developed nations, because both
private and public carriers may have determined that they cannot generate sufficient revenues
and profits when serving remote locales. Accordingly domestic backbone networks may link
different urban centers, including ones separated from more closely situated cities. For example,
Perth, in Western Australia has reliable, high speed broadband connections to all of the other
Australian cities located a significant distance to the east. However, some localities far closer to
Perth than Perth is to the other major Australian cities currently lack access to similar domestic
connectivity.

        Domestic backbone networks can be analogized to the multi-lane long haul national
highways that traverse great distances. For subscribers close to these networks access is a
relatively easy and inexpensive undertaking, far cheaper than the cost of installing a new
highway interchange. Both copper and fiber optic networks can be spliced to add short haul
branches. But for subscribers located farther away, a carrier may not consider the necessary
branch link an affordable investment based on the distance sensitivity of the investment, i.e., the
cost rises in direct relationship to distance from the backbone. As the branch line increases in
length the population of prospective and actual subscribers may not increase sufficiently to offset
the higher costs. Put another way, the cost of backbone construction, operation and maintenance
requires a degree of population density sufficient to generate adequate subscribership and
                                                                                                 64



revenues for the carrier to recoup costs and accrue a reasonable profit.



         Many ISPs seek to offset the high cost of serving remotely located subscribers by
averaging the total cost of network operation. Cost averaging makes it possible for ISPs to offer
a single monthly subscription rate not based on an individual subscriber’s actual distance from a
backbone and ISP switching facility, or the distance between the subscriber and sources of
content. Cost averaging creates the impression that Internet access is “distance insensitive,” i.e.,
that the cost of providing service does not vary with the distance between subscribers and ISP
facilities and between subscribers and the source of content they seek. Internet carriage of traffic
does cost more as distance increases, but ISPs willingly have averaged costs to offset and mask
the difference. Subscribers pay the same monthly rate regardless whether they seek content from
far away sources, or from nearby ones. ISPs may offer tiered service at different prices, based on
the total volume of content downloaded and uploaded, but without reference to the overall
distance traveled by the content.

         ISPs operating domestic backbone networks also incur the cost of having diverse and
redundant routing options for each link. To provide high quality of service, ISPs need to design,
install, operate and maintain two or more links, so that all routes have an alternative routing
option in the event the main link becomes congested or inoperative, e.g., from a cut in the cable.
Routing diversity refers to having two or more physically separate, but interconnected networks,
typically operating in a ring, so that an indirect and more circuitous option exists during an
outage and congestion in the more direct route. Redundancy refers to the ability of a network
operator to offer subscribers more reliable service, perhaps backed up by a quality of service
guarantee. The TCP traffic management standard supports near instantaneous traffic re-routing
from the main line to alternatives in the event of an outage or congestion.

5.5.1 National Links

        National links refer to domestic backbone networks as well as other facilities that provide
high capacity and fast bit rate connections to backbone networks. Such non-backbone networks
include branch lines or “backhaul” facilities that link specific localities, users and widely
dispersed facilities, such as wireless radio tower sites, to a backbone network. Additionally
national links provide so-called middle mile services that provide transmission services between
first and last kilometer facilities, which originate and terminate Internet traffic, and long haul
networks, including domestic and international backbone networks.

        Carriers may price national links on a distance and usage sensitive basis, resulting in far
higher total and per unit of capacity rates than what backbone carriers charge. Comparisons to
first and last kilometer costs are difficult, because at the retail level, such subscriptions cover
Internet access which factors in both the cost of conduit access and arguably includes a
contribution to defray the cost of the content made available. An end user Internet access
subscription also includes the local ISPs’ peering and transiting costs for securing access
                                                                                                68



upstream to other ISPs that participate in the set up of multiple network links to achieve a
complete connection from end user to content source, regardless of location.



        Middle mile and backhaul markets tend to have less competition resulting in fewer
redundant and diverse routing options. ISPs typically first concentrate on installing domestic and
international backbone facilities so that the largest volume users, typically located in urban
locales, have access to the rest of the world as well as at least one high quality, reliable link
between domestic urban centers. ISPs extend the geographical reach of facilities that access
backbone networks, perhaps with more emphasis on geographical coverage as opposed to
accommodation of the middle mile and backhaul needs of specific users.

        In many instances, for different reasons, broadband users in both developed and
developing nations, may incur steep charges for access to national links. National broadband
plans typically address how to stimulate private investment in facilities that extend broadband
networks into remote, hinterland locations. Many nations emphasize private-public partnerships
that combine government and private sector resources. Governments can create financial
incentives, but also contribute to projects by offering rights of way for the installation of ducts
and towers used by transmission facilities. Governments also can facilitate sharing in the cost
and use of networking infrastructure by rewarding carriers that work conscientiously to pool
resources without conspiring not to compete, or to fix prices. Given the high costs in broadband
infrastructure construction, competing carriers should not always have to build separate
telecommunications lines and switching facilities. Where existing conduits and rights of way are
available, governments can promote shared use. Many of the competing long haul
telecommunications networks in developing countries started by using existing rights of ways
secured long ago by railroads, electric utilities and gas pipelines. 22


5.5.2 Internet Exchanges

        Internet exchanges provide a much needed interconnection point for ISPs providing local,
regional, national and international service. Because no single ISP typically owns or leases all
the networks needed to achieve a complete every link between end user and content source, ISPs
agree to interconnect their networks, often at a single facility where multiple interconnections
can take place between and among many ISPs. Internet exchanges centralize and economize the
network facility interconnection process, by making it possible for several ISPs to share in the
cost of installing, operating and maintaining the site. Many Internet Exchanges are jointly
owned by the carriers that interconnect networks. Other commercial sites are owned by real
estate developers, or ventures unaffiliated with the carriers. A hybrid model combines public
and private partners, much like arrangements made for airports, seaports, exhibition halls and
sports facilities. A non commercial alternative uses a cooperative, or not for profit model to
stimulate use of a facility and the benefits accruing to nearby service subscribers.

       The lack of Internet exchanges in lesser developed regions has exacerbated the so called
                                                                                                    69



Digital Divide. 23 The lack of international and domestic backbones, branch lines, middle mile
options, backhaul routes and direct links with end users surely contribute. However, once
various networks get built by different ISPs, collectively all carriers need convenient and nearby
access to Internet Exchanges to facilitate the interconnection and exchange of traffic. Without
these facilities interconnection cannot take place within the region where traffic originated, or
eventually will terminate. Instead ISPs must resort to lengthy and circuitous routing of traffic at
distant Internet Exchanges. Such “thromboning” of traffic, representative of the long tubing in
the musical instrument, increases the time it takes for traffic to reach its final destination as well
as the cost.

       The operator of Ghana’s Internet Exchange summarizes the benefits of having an in-
country facility:

       “The value of an IXP is clear to governments, regulators, industry experts, and industry
members for good reason: it usually heralds significant development and opportunities for new
revenue in the local ICT industry. It is because of this eventual national pay-off that IXPs are
usually financed by donations from individuals, organizations, corporations, governments, etc.
One point of failure for Exchanges is attempting to finance them by means other than donations
or sponsorship.

        “The cost of the Exchange is minimal compared with the benefits. Exchange points have
two benefits (short and long term) that directly address two obstacles to ICT growth
(international bandwidth costs and network latency). The short-term benefit happens overnight.
Once ISPs are connected to the Exchange, they will no longer pay international bandwidth costs
for local, Ghanaian traffic. This cost savings, however, is not the only value of an IXP.

       “The long-term benefits far outweigh the short-term. Once the ISPs are connected to the
GIX, latency or transit time of traffic becomes a fraction of what it was since it stays within the
same network. As a result of this increased speed and reliability, additional ‘value-added’
services become possible on the national network. Exchange Points make web content hosting,
audio and video streaming, E-commerce, E-governance, etc. possible. Right now ISPs and local
businesses often go outside of Ghana for advanced Internet solutions such as the above, taking
revenue elsewhere. With the GIX, all of that business and the revenue that comes with it can
come to Ghana creating more entrepreneurial opportunities, jobs, and options for investment.

        “In Ghana the cost of Internet bandwidth and connectivity is highest compared to the rest
of the competitive world. In one sense the cost of sending a local destined email is equal to the
cost of sending an internationally destined email. To overcome this anomaly, connecting to a
local or National exchange in this case GIX ensures that the cost of sending a locally destined
email is at a lower cost. With the offsetting of the local traffic to the exchange point, the
upgrading of International links of operators can be postponed for an additional period.
Therefore translating to saving on the International link capacity. These savings can further be
extended to the operators customers.” 24

Internet Exchange Governance

         By design Internet Exchanges require the joint investment and participation of multiple
carriers. The more carriers that agree to fund an Exchange, the lower their shared costs and the
more routing and interconnection opportunities become available to both carriers and consumers.
Because Internet Exchanges involve multiple carriers, the management and governance of these
facilities may require scrutiny by governments to ensure that no single carrier, or group of
carriers can dominate in ways that reduce the benefits to other carriers and Internet users.
National Regulatory Authorities may require transparency in the terms and conditions for
                                                                                               71



affiliation with an Internet Exchange to ensure that carriers do not collude to raise prices to
consumers, or to handicap other carriers, including ones that do not have an ownership interest in
the facility.


        Internet Exchanges typically contribute to the integration and interconnection of local,
national, regional and international routing options and carrier choices. However without
adequate safeguards they can help bolster the market power of a dominant carrier, or a small
group of carriers. Internet Exchange governance documents should provide clear and fair terms
for financial, technical and operational terms for membership by new carriers as well as their
interconnection rights. Carriers should cooperate in the operation of Internet Exchanges without
such collaboration leading to a reduction in competition for traffic and subscriptions.

         Best practices in the operation of Internet Exchanges include assurances that whoever
manages the facility (government agency, university, non-profit association, carrier consortium,
etc.) the Exchange operates in the spirit of neutrality and openness. Internet Exchanges should
secure competitive bids for the construction of the facility with benchmarks in the contract for
timely and cost-effective performance. The parties should agree to locate the facility in close
proximity to where existing and prospective network facilities are located. The facility should
have the ability to increase in size (“scalability”) on an incremental basis. Governance of the
facility should ensure fiscally sound stewardship.

African Internet Exchanges

       The very large continent of Africa remains underserved both in terms of Internet access
and the number of essential interconnect and traffic exchange points. However several nations
have achieved progress with the recent installation of an Internet Exchange.

5.5.3 Implementation Issues for Domestic Backbone Networks

        Domestic backbone networks provide the essential connection between urban networks
as well as the necessary extension of broadband access beyond central business districts to
suburban, exurban and rural localities. These networks bridge the Digital Divide by providing
broadband access to users located in regions having less than ideal demographic and demand
characteristics. The first Internet access opportunities typically become available to business
                                                                                                  76



users in close proximity to each other in a nation’s central business district and to switching
facilities, commonly referred to as Internet Exchanges, where Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”)
interconnect with each other and access cross-border links.

        Domestic backbone construction can provide a cost-effective way to expand the
geographical reach of broadband access as well as the total population served. However the
capital intensive nature of broadband network construction presents numerous financial
challenges, coupled with many managerial and logistical issues in implementing a business plan
to build or extend a domestic backbone network. Backbone planning requires consideration of
ways to maximize geographical reach and market penetration as well as strategies for
economizing through the pooling of investment and sharing of costs among multiple network
operators.

        Backbone networks generate substantial upfront costs well before carriers can deliver
service to paying customers. As a threshold matter a single carrier or consortium of carriers
must agree on the technology to be used as well as the routing of the network. Backbone
networks typically use high capacity, point-to-point microwave links, or fiber optic cable. While
the former may have less initial costs, because carriers can install towers at intervals of up to 50
kilometers, it offers less initial broadband capacity and does not have the capability of increasing
bandwidth (“scalability”) as available from multi-strand, fiber optic cable installations.

         Most domestic backbone networks use fiber optic networking technologies, because of
their initial and scalable capacity. However such terrestrial networks require a dedicated
pathway for the installation of the cables, known as a right of way, and ductwork used to house
and protect the cables. Backbone operators have incentives to install high capacity networks
whose bandwidth capacity can increase in response to growing demand by activating additional
“dark,” “unlit” capacity. Because significant funds and effort typically are needed to secure all
necessary rights of way and operational authority, operators install ample capacity with an eye
toward spreading the costs over the largest possible amount of bandwidth use. Many nations
have licensing and permitting authority shared between a National Regulatory Authority and
other administrative entities having jurisdiction over a state, province, country, or even a smaller
region.

        Domestic backbone operators in both developed and developing nations need to identify
opportunities for cost sharing without making it possible for competing carriers to fix prices and
otherwise pursue collusive and market disrupting arrangements. Just as competing carriers can
cooperate in the construction, operation and management of a single Internet Exchange, they also
can share the costs of a single domestic backbone, particularly the infrastructure that can be
shared efficiently. There are several components in broadband networking that are passive in the
sense that individual carriers do not have to design, install and manage the technology.

       For example, competing wireless carriers can share in the cost of installing and
maintaining a tower onto which they install their own electronic devices such as transmitters,
receivers and antennas. The carriers can divide up the cost of designing, constructing and
operating the tower including the cost of supplying or bringing power to the site. For terrestrial
                                                                                                 77



networks carriers can share in the cost of acquiring rights of way to install ductwork and cables
on private or public property.


5.6    Metropolitan Connectivity

        Broadband network planning requires stakeholders to design optimal ways for accessing
the Internet cloud and for engineering accessibility throughout a nation. Planners start by
securing access to major regional and international telecommunications links and by installing a
domestic Internet Exchange. Subsequently they extend the geographical scope of Internet access
by constructing a domestic backbone network that provides a broadband connection between
urban centers and eventually extends broadband access into the hinterland. As planners increase
the penetration of broadband access into less densely populated areas, they also should pay
attention to a less obvious requirement: ensuring connectivity between and among users within a
metropolitan area. As urban regions spread out the tasks of ensuring metropolitan connectivity
becomes increasingly challenging.

        Metropolitan connectivity constitutes a possibly underappreciated goal, because users
require both access to the Internet cloud and the rest of the world, but also access between and
among various points within a sprawling metropolitan region. The “anchor tenants” of
broadband networks typically have very large demand for bandwidth and access requirements in
many different locations. For example, a multi-national corporation involved in the extraction,
processing and export of natural resources typically would have broadband access requirements
in remote areas, where the resources are situated, as well as other locations that process and
refine the material plus regional headquarters and locations handling administrative functions.
Additionally such an important user might have several facilities within a metropolitan area
housing management staff who typically have broadband requirements both for interacting with
other corporate personnel as well as the various organizations that support the business, e.g.,
bankers, attorneys, consultants, and engineering firms.

        Metropolitan connectivity provides both the first and last kilometer access to the Internet
cloud as well as the so-called middle mile access that links various outposts of both affiliated and
unaffiliated ventures located at many dispersed locations within a country. Because not all of
these users are physically near existing domestic backbone networks, carriers will need to devise
ways to provide similar broadband functionality even though possibly far fewer users will
require access. In light of the fact that demand may not be as robust as that for direct access to
the domestic backbone, network operators cannot achieve the same scale economies and
accordingly will have to charge higher rates on a per unit of capacity basis. Middle mile access
typically costs more to provide thereby resulting in a commensurately higher cost to users.

        Users of metropolitan broadband networks have the same “mission critical” traffic as
customers located at or near a domestic backbone. As a threshold matter, they will need to
assess whether to seek authority to construct and operate their own dedicated network, to rely on
an existing operator to lease existing capacity, or to build new facilities to accommodate the
user’s specific requirements. This “make/buy” decision depends on many factors including the
                                                                                                78



price of available capacity, as well as dedicated new facilities and the ease or difficulty in
securing regulatory authority to construct private facilities and to interconnect them with
equipment and lines operated by incumbent carriers. If a National Regulatory Authority will not
allow installation of private facilities, or imposes unreasonable terms and conditions, users with
specific metropolitan broadband service requirements will have little bargaining power when
resorting to negotiations with an incumbent carrier. While some users are functionally “captive”
to the terms and conditions imposed by a single incumbent carrier, others can leverage the ability
to relocate elsewhere to secure fair rates.

        Metropolitan network negotiations may generate high rates for users particularly when
carriers cannot anticipate that other nearby users would require similar services thereby helping
the carrier offset the high, initial costs incurred to accommodate the needs of one user.
Network operators have to provide the same sort of service quality and reliability as available
from public networks even though doing so generates higher costs when as few as one user
leases capacity. Backbone operators routinely install redundant, back up capacity as well as two
or more different routing options so that they can continue to provide essential service even
when congestion or an outage occurs. Middle mile users have the same requirements for
redundant and diverse traffic routing options.

        In addition to middle mile service, metropolitan connectivity includes “backhaul”
options, particularly for wireless carriers. Backhaul service provides links from remote
locations, e.g., a rural cellphone tower, back to an urban location where the wireless carrier
would route calls to intended call recipients including ones using the city’s wireline network.
Not all wireless carriers install both the towers needed to provide service throughout a region and
the backhaul capability needed to route rural traffic to urban switching facilities and call
recipients. To conserve capital and to expedite the availability of service, wireless carriers may
concentrate on the installation of tower sites without the fiber optic cable or microwave radio
backhaul links needed to route traffic from and to remote tower sites. Incumbent domestic
wireline carriers may be expected to accommodate the back haul requirements of cellphone
companies. In many nations incumbent operators are classified as common carriers having the
obligation to satisfy the reasonable service requirements of end users and even other carriers.
This classification typically obligates incumbent carriers to provide service even if doing so
would require the installation of facilities likely to be used only by few, if any customers other
than the cellphone carrier that initiated the request for service.


5.6.1 Regional Metropolitan Links

        Broadband network planners typically use a blend of wired and wireless technologies to
meet the demand for middle mile and backhaul services by end users and carriers. Because the
total demand for any specific link may not generate a substantial volume of traffic, network
operators will need to use comparatively less expensive technologies than that used for high
demand links. Wireless microwave services can provide a cost-effective solution to these lower
volume “sparse route” requirements. These wireless technologies provide service to users in
fixed locations, rather than the more familiar mobile services such as cellular radiotelephone
                                                                                                 79



service.

         Regional metropolitan links provide an example of how two broadband technologies can
combine to solve specific end user requirements. For broadband users in remote locations a
single technology solution would prove too expensive. A network operator could not make a
business case to extend the fiber optic domestic backbone to the remote customer, or even to
install a dedicated branch unit off the backbone. Instead the carrier routes traffic via existing
broadband facilities to the point closest to the remote user with sufficient population density and
demand and then installs lower capacity broadband, wireless facilities to link “off network,”
remote users with the backbone. Because of the distance from the backbone such branches are
not considered first and last kilometer services.

5.6.2 Implementation Issues for Metropolitan Connectivity

         Metropolitan connectivity presents network planners with many challenges, because of
the number of routes needed and the lack of readily available options. The importance of the
domestic backbone and a possibly large rural footprint makes it more likely that carriers can
quickly and economically secure the rights to install facilities. Incumbent carriers typically have
a legal status that authorizes them as public utilities to demand property easement access based
on “eminent domain” which favors the public interest claims of the carrier over the property
rights of individual land owners. Additionally network operators may choose to locate backbone
networks along existing rights or way such as that used or abandoned by railroads, electric
utilities, pipeline operators and highways.

         Middle mile and backhaul routing in more densely populated areas may trigger more
difficult and time consuming rights of way acquisitions. Because much of the route may cover
still densely populate terrain, the carrier cannot claim to be extending first time broadband access
and the carrier may not qualify for the option of invoking eminent domain. Land owners located
near a proposed tower site or conduit installation may not want the disruption and possible
division of a single tract of property. In developed nations property owners have banded
together to oppose network facility installations. The phrase Not in my Back Yard (“NIMBY”)
refers to the typical displeasure property owners have toward rights of way requests of public
utilities and telecommunications carriers.

5.7    Local Connectivity

        Local connectivity refers to the first and last link used by broadband users to receive
(“download”) and transmit (“upload”) the various forms of content, software and applications
available via the Internet cloud. Local connectivity constitutes only one part of the multiple
links to and from the Internet cloud, but broadband subscribers may consider it “Internet access,”
because they pay a monthly subscription to the retail ISP providing the first and last link. This
subscription also defrays the costs incurred by the retail ISP for accessing links farther upstream
needed to complete a connection between an end user and a source of content.
                                                                                                80



        The emphasis on local connectivity is justified for a number of reasons. First, a nation
may have ample broadband backbone capacity, but satisfying individual subscribers’ needs
requires broadband connections to and from a backbone. For the first and last kilometer of this
route the carrier typically has to install a line dedicated for the sole use of one subscriber.
Measures of broadband market penetration and subscriptions typically identify the total number
of actual subscribers, the upload and download transmission rates available to them and the cost
of service. Second, local connectivity completes the interconnected and integrated links needed
to provide what consumers consider Internet access. Put another way the Internet as a “network
of networks” cannot provide seamless access to the content unless and until consumers have
broadband options available at their homes, small businesses and other sites. Third, concerns
about the viability, affordability and competitiveness of local connectivity dominate public
policy and regulatory discussions. In many developing countries—and even some developed
ones—local connectivity options may be limited both in terms of the number of technological
options available (“intermodal competition”) and the number of competitors using the same
technology (“intramodal competition”). Fourth, local connectivity, marketed as Internet access,
constitutes one of the core services that carriers combine to offer a desirable and discounted
“bundle” of services. Consumers accrue savings and carriers generate higher revenues with a
“Triple Play” bundle of access to the Internet, video programming and voice telephone service.

        The Internet cloud and network of networks concepts exemplify the hierarchical nature of
Internet access. One can consider the transmission, switching and routing technologies that
make up the Internet as numerous and geographically dispersed at the base of the pyramid.
Moving up the number of ISPs and the geographical coverage concentrates. Retail ISPs provide
dedicated broadband links to users: a one to one ratio of service. At the actual first and last few
feet or meters of service a wireline ISP has to install a physical medium that serves just one
subscriber. Wireless ISPs use a single carrier to serve the traffic origination and termination
needs of retail subscribers. Upstream from the retail last kilometer link, ISPs aggregate traffic
onto higher capacity cables and wireless links so that a single conduit carries the traffic of very
many subscribers simultaneously. Upstream ISPs offer very high capacity limited to specific
routes, typically between cities and across great distances.

5.7.1 Wireline Access Technologies

       Currently the primary local broadband technologies use upgraded and modified copper
wire conduits already installed by telephone and cable television companies. Incumbent carriers
have determined that they first should “retrofit” existing wire-based technologies, because doing
so conserves capital and extends the useable life of plant already installed. While replacing
copper conduit with fiber optic cable offers consumers much faster bit transmission speed,
incumbent carriers have determined that few localities currently have the population density and
willingness to pay for a fiber optic broadband delivery networks to specific end users. In the
interim, incumbent carriers have identified ways to reconfigure existing networks so that they
can provide a combination of voice, data and video services.
                                                                                               81



         Telephone companies offer a transitional, copper-based technology that upgrades the
available bandwidth sufficient to provide a carrier just barely wide enough to provide broadband,
telephone and on-demand access to a single video channel. Cable television companies have
more available bandwidth making it possible to reassign one or more television channels for
broadband access. For many locations, broadband carriers eventually will replace the copper
conduit with fiber optic cables, perhaps initially with a hybrid network that combines the two
media. For example, the term Hybrid Fiber/Coax refers to the installation of new fiber optic
cables from traffic management headquarters to a point closer to end users, whose access to that
midway point continues to rely on existing copper lines.

Digital Subscriber Line Service

        Telephone companies can provide broadband Digital Subscriber Line (“DSL”) service by
expanding the bandwidth available from the narrow gauge copper wires used to provide the first
and last kilometer of telephone service. In essence DSL constitutes a transitional technology
upgrade or retrofit using already installed copper wire. This wire uses a narrowband carrier to
deliver voice telephone calls. The bandwidth generated by the narrowband voice carrier is only
3000-4000 cycles per second, also known as Hertz. A 3-4 kiloHertz (“kHz”) channel can
provide only a low fidelity signal, but that is sufficient for the transmission of voice
conversations.

        Broadband signal transmission requires more bandwidth so that the signal can carry the
higher volume of information contained in the Internet cloud. Instead of narrowband delivery of
a telephone call, broadband channels must offer both the capability of carrying lots more
information, e.g., full motion video content, and to do so on a timely basis so that the content
does not freeze, blur, or become unavailable. Put another way broadband networks need to have
the bandwidth capacity capable of delivering high throughput, i.e., lots of information typically
measured in bytes. Bandwidth intensive applications, like video, require fast, broadband
networks having the capability of delivering content on an immediate, “real time” basis.

         Telephone companies can expand the bandwidth available from the narrow gauge, pair of
twisted copper wire from 3-4 kHz to as much as 1500 kHz that also can be stated as 1.5
MegaHertz (“MHz”). With this expanded carrier, telephone companies can offer broadband
service typically at transmission speeds averaging 1.5 million bits per second (1.5 “Mbps”) with
high transmission speeds available to subscribers located near the telephony company switching
facility. The highest transmission speed available, termed Very High DSL (“VDSL”) can offer
speeds reaching 55 Mbps over a distance of 1000 feet from a telephone company switching
office, or an Optical Network Unit installed to serve a specific neighborhood or real estate
subdivision.

        DSL subscribers located relatively close to a telephone company switching facility can
receive higher bit transmission speeds, but subscribers located more than 5 kilometers typically
cannot receive any DSL service at all. Because telephone companies use unamplified copper
wire as the medium for service, signals weaken (“attenuate”) as the distance increases between
subscriber and telephone company switching office.

        DSL technology offers relatively slow bit transmission rates, compared to that available
from cable television and fiber optic networks. To maximize the effectiveness of DSL networks,
carriers configure the service to make more transmission capacity available for downloading than
for uploading of content. This lack of symmetry between uploading and downloading responds
to the fact that most broadband subscribers download more capacity than they upload. The term
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (“ADSL”) refers to a DSL service configured with more
downloading capacity. DSL service that has equal downloading and uploading capacity is called
Symmetric DSL.

DSL Bitrate Varies with the Distance from the Telephone Company Switch

         Telephone companies also have an operational reason to provide ADSL instead of
symmetrical service that offers equal bandwidth for uploading and downloading. When
subscribers upload content the most likely place where data traffic may interfere with voice
traffic occurs at the telephone company switching facility handling both types of traffic in close
proximity to each other. Uploaded data arrives at the telephone company switching facility with
the weakest signal. Because data starting at the telephone company switching facility has the
strongest signal the telephone company can spread the signal over wider bandwidth and thereby
transmit content at a higher bit rate.

        At the telephone company offices closest to subscribers, certain upgrades are needed to
provide DSL service. Carriers need to separate “legacy” voice telephone traffic from the new
data traffic. They achieve this separation by using a frequency splitter to divide the frequencies
used for voice service from the newly available bandwidth made available for DSL service. The
voice traffic continues to route to the Central Office for the customary switching and routing
along a hierarchy of facilities that multiplex traffic onto very high capacity, long haul
transmission lines. Separately Central Offices, equipped to provide DSL service, receive the
data traffic and route it to a separate traffic aggregator, commonly known as the Digital
Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer (“DSLAM”). This device aggregates Internet traffic for
onward delivery via long haul Internet traffic transmission lines and disaggregates it for delivery
                                                                                                 86



to the intended recipient.

        At residences DSL subscribers must use filters to block the data frequencies at jacks used
for voice telephone service. DSL subscribers also need to install a device that modulates and
demodulates Internet, data traffic thereby differentiating it from conventional voice traffic. This
modem device connects to a conventional telephone service jack and also to a computer, or
wireless router serving one or more portable devices.

        DSL service offers slow, but cheaper broadband service as compared to what cable
television operators offer. Additionally the need for subscribers to be located no farther than 5
kilometers from a telephone company switching facility further reduces the market size of
potential subscribers. Similarly telephone companies do not serve all locations within the 5
kilometer potential service area. Localities with the greatest population density and most
favorable demographic characteristics, e.g, high income, typically attract the first company
investment in the retrofitting needed to provide service.

Cable Modem Service

         Cable television operators also can retrofit their existing networks to provide broadband
service starting with the conversion of as little as one 6 MHz television channel into an Internet
access link. By partitioning (“diplexing”) this bandwidth, cable operators can designate the
frequencies represented by this channel as available only for uploading and downloading Internet
traffic. A modem similar to that used for DSL service can tune solely to the bandwidth now
designated for Internet access and modulate and demodulate data traffic through that channel.

       Because the cable television distribution grid operates with amplifiers located throughout,
cable modem service can be offered everywhere the company previously offered video service.
Additionally cable modem service can operate at bit delivery speeds well in excess of what DSL
can provide. Cable operators can further increase delivery speeds by adding more bandwidth in
6 MHz increments, a process known as cable bonding.
                                                                                               88



       Cable modem service costs subscribers significantly more than DSL service, but the cost
may offer a better rate on a per Mbps basis. For example, DSL service typically costs between
$18-$30 USD per month, while cable modem service typically costs between $20-$75 per
month. A $30 rate for 1.5 Mbps would cost more on a per megabit delivery speed if a cable
operator offered 6 Mbps service for anything less than $120 per month. Increasingly
broadband subscribers require bit transmission speeds well in excess of 1.5 Mbps to receive such
bandwidth intensive content as high definition television on an instantaneous, “streaming” basis.

        Cable modem service represents a third major upgrade in service. In the first generation
cable television operators simply imported broadcast television signals to places too far away to
receive signals “off air” using the two small telescoping antennas supplied with the set (“rabbit
ears”) and possibly even if one installed a rooftop antenna. In the second generation, cable
operators increased the inventory of content to include networks that did not broadcast their
content. Instead of serving as a community antenna for broadcast content only, cable television
operators used satellites and microwave networks to distribute additional content. In this second
generation cable operators expanded the available bandwidth for television and also created a
small upstream link from subscribers so that they could be identified by address for billing and
content delivery purposes.

       In the third generation cable operators expand the range of service available to include
telephone and Internet access in addition to video content. The cable television distribution grid
becomes the functional equivalent to a Local or Metropolitan Area Network (“LAN” or “MAN”)
capable of providing high speed data transmissions both downstream and upstream to all
subscribers. LANs initially provided data networking within an office building or throughout a
college, or corporate campus. Now cable operators offer the same functionality in the third
generation of cable television network development.

Broadband Over Powerline

        The nearly ubiquitous electric power grid offers a potential third wire capable of
providing broadband into residences and businesses. Broadband over powerline (“BPL”) uses
the transmission power of the electricity delivery to carry signals using much higher frequencies.
While an electrical conduit generates a quite noisy and inhospitable environment for other types
of transmissions, advances in digital signal processing makes it possible to differentiate a high
frequency data signal from the predominant, lower frequency electrical current. BPL uses lines
in the electrical grid operating at several thousand volts instead of the highest powered lines that
operate with tens of thousands of volts.

        The greatest challenge in making BPL commercially viable lies in solving two problems:
1) ensuring that the data signal can pass through transformers near retail subscribers that lower
(“step down”) the transmitted voltage to the 110-220 volt level used by consumers; and 2)
convincing National Regulatory Authorities that the data signals, typically operating between
1.7 and 80 MHz, will not leak out of the grid and interfere with wireless radio users.

       BPL injects and extracts broadband data signals onto the electrical grid. An inductive
coupler transfers the data signal onto the power line by wrapping around the line, without
                                                                                                           90



directly connecting to the line. The extraction process decouples the data signal and sends it to a
on premises modem for demodulating inbound traffic and modulating outbound traffic in the
same manner as DSL and cable modems.

over-power-lines/.

       For nations where a transformer provides individual premises with the final voltage
conversion to 110-220 volts, the extraction process can fail, because the signal has become
unrecoverable. A solution to this problem relies on a wireless router, operating on a pole or
above a conduit, to handle the first and last few meters outside of the transformer.

5.7.2 Wireless Access Technologies

        Because many nations lack ubiquitous access to new or transitional broadband wireline
technologies, wireless options can provide telecommunications access into remote localities.
Developing countries typically have the most areas unserved, or underserved by incumbent
carriers. Ironically this lack of service can make it possible for the installation of cutting edge
wireless broadband technologies that can help developing countries expedite broadband access
even in remote areas. Just as wireless technologies made it possible for developing nations to
accelerate the availability of voice telephone services into even the most remote and sparsely
populated areas, they also can help these nations accelerate broadband deployment, an outcome
referred to as “leap forging.”

        Wireless technologies have the potential to offer faster, cheaper and more widespread
installation of broadband services. Using microwave frequencies and an antenna that transmits a
360 degree, “omnidirectional” signal, wireless carriers can cover a contour or circle of land area
                                                                                                93



spanning over 100 kilometers. Wireless network operators do not have to install ducts, conduits
and wires to serve each and every subscriber. Instead the omnidirectional signal from a single
tower can deliver voice and data traffic to any user within the transmission contour and also any
user can communicate with the tower using a small, lightweight handset. Wireless
telecommunications technologies have significant initial costs, which are incurred before
revenues accrue from service, but the incremental cost of adding a subscriber is low and ongoing
operating expenses may be low as well. This means that even with substantial, startup costs,
many types of telecommunications and information networks can succeed in the marketplace if
additional subscribers do not trigger even higher capital investment and carriers incur relatively
low costs in maintaining their network.

        The economic term positive network externality refers to the ability of networks to
increase in value as more subscribers join. With relatively low incremental costs, carriers and
service providers can offer free or inexpensive subscriptions that become more valuable as
subscribership grows. Positive network externalities create incentives for more and more users
to “join the bandwagon” as evidenced by the success of social networking, auction and
ecommerce sites.

        Wireless technologies can provide both mobile and fixed services. Cellphone users
appreciate the benefits of thetherless mobility, i.e., the enhanced productivity and efficiency
made possible by having telephone access anytime and almost anywhere. But for many
broadband applications, much of the benefits accrue from access to the Internet cloud regardless
whether the user is moving, or at a fixed location. Wireless services use leapfrogging technology
in the sense that remote localities lacking any Internet access can secure roughly the same quality
of service, previously available only to urban users.

Cellular Radiotelephone Service

        Before we examine wireless broadband technologies, some fundamental aspects of how
wireless technologies work can offer helpful perspective. Wireless technology made a huge leap
in the early 1980s with the introduction of cellular radiotelephone service. Before that time few
users of wireless service existed, because the technology was quite expensive, capacity
constrained and unable to provide uninterrupted service for more than a few minutes. Before
carriers offered cellular service, they used single transmitters that did not connect with other
towers to provide continuous service to users moving out of range from the first tower and into
range of another one. This meant that a mobile user could only carry on a conversation for a few
minutes before losing contact with the tower containing facilities for linking the user with the
wireline telephone network. Carriers installed only a few towers operating with limited amount
of bandwidth.

        Cellular radio uses more bandwidth and has the capability of reusing high frequencies to
support many more simultaneous telephone calls. It also has the ability to hand off calls from
one tower to another making it possible for a mobile subscriber to maintain a conversation as the
call can be forwarded from tower to tower as the user moves out of range from one and into
range of another. Frequency reuse and the ability of manage the hand off of calls from tower to
                                                                                                     94



tower makes it possible for cellphone networks to serve many more users, to offer vastly lower
rates, given large scale operations, and the ability to provide reliable service for calls running
more than a few minutes.

        The use of the term cellular refers to the ability of wireless carriers to transmit from
overlapping signal contours generated by transmitters on adjacent towers. Cellphone service has
been visualized as using the tightly connected hexagonal honeycombs of a beehive to emphasize
continuous service achieved through frequency reuse of overlapping cells. In reality the cell
contours are circular, but the concept of signal contour integration offering continuous service
constitutes an essential component to reliable mobile wireless service.

         Frequency reuse makes it possible for carriers to have nearby towers operating on the
same frequency without generating harmful interference that would prevent callers and call
recipients from hearing each other. Because cellphone networks use very high microwave
frequencies, the signals weaken (“attenuate”) very quickly and managers can track the
geographical coverage of reliable service. At the point whether a single tower service contour
starts to deteriorate rapidly a second tower is installed having a slightly overlapping signal
contour. At a small distance from the first tower, the cellphone operator can install another
tower using the very same frequencies as the first tower, but because of the sharp “rolloff” in
signal the transmissions of the first tower do not interfere with a later built tower operating on
the same frequencies.

        Cellular networks can provide service continuity by using technologies that manage the
conversion of frequencies when mobile users move from one tower signal contour to another.
The Mobile Telephone Switching Office (“MTSO”) constantly monitors the strength of signals
from towers to handsets and vice versa. When the signals start to attenuate, due to a user moving
away from a tower, the MTSO orders the user’s handset to change to the transmitting and
receiving frequencies of the adjacent tower. This handoff requires an immediate change in radio
frequency and tower communication, sometimes resulting in a “dropped call” when the change
does not take place on time.

Frequency Reuse

        Cellular networks can provide service to vastly more subscribers than previous
technologies thanks to more available spectrum allocated by National Regulatory Authorities,
frequency reuse and several types of spectrum conservation technologies that make it possible
for several users to share the same channel. Cellphone service initially used generously large
channels of spectrum available for use by a single subscriber. Over several generations of
service cellular networks have increased spectrum efficiency by using transmission technologies
that make it possible for multiple subscribers to share the same frequency channel. Time
Division Multiple Access (“TDMA”) allocates a shared channel among multiple users by
assigning very short slots of time. Code Division Multiple Access (“CDMA”) allocates a shared
channel by assigning users different code sequences. These advanced technologies require
handsets that not only can quickly change the frequencies they use (“frequency agility”), but also
operate using complex transmission formats that require well calibrated synchronization of use
within an assigned time slot, or code sequence.
                                                                                                  96




        Handsets have evolved from serving as a radio transmitter and receiver (“transceiver”) to
the functional equivalent of a powerful, lightweight and radio equipped computer. Smartphones
offer a wide versatility of services including the ability to display video content, play music, take

Four Generations of Cellular Service

       Sine the middle 1980s, wireless radiotelephone service has evolved in four distinct
generations. In the first generation, spanning the middle and late 1980s, cellular radio used
analog transmission formats to provide wireless telephony only. Urban subscribers benefitted
from efficiency and productivity enhancements, while subscribers in rural and remote areas,
many not having any existing telephone service option, enjoyed the benefits of access to the
Public Switched Telephone Network.

        First generation service used spectrum in the Ultra High Frequency band (400-900 MHz),
including frequencies previously allocated for television service. Handsets were heavy and
service was expensive. Early adopters of cellular service included users with high incomes, such
as doctors, attorneys and bankers, but also service technicians, such as plumbers and electricians
who benefitted from the ability to schedule appointments and receive directions without having
to stop and look for a wireline payphone.

       The second generation of cellphone service (early 1990s) introduced digital transmission
technologies and the first spectrum conservation techniques. In the second generation, new
spectrum allocations increased available bandwidth in the 1-2 GigaHertz range. At these higher
frequencies operators had to install more towers, because of shorter signal range, but the greater
frequency reuse opportunities promoted scale in light of the ability to handle many more
simultaneous telephone calls.

        In the second generation cellphone operators started to introduce new services, such as
texting, which retrofitted the existing signal strength monitoring and handset polling function of
the MTSO which tracks the location of every operational handset. Whenever a handset is on, it
regularly sends a short sequence of numbers and letters to the nearest tower which forwards
these identifying sequences to the MTSO so that it can route an inbound telephone call to the
proper subscriber and also provide dial tone for one requesting service. Cellphone operators
                                                                                                   98



created an extremely low cost and vastly profitable texting service by providing subscribers with
the opportunity to key in letters and numbers corresponding to a message instead of a cellphone
identification sequence. Texting is limited to about 160 letters and numbers, because that
corresponds to the amount of bandwidth and time allocated to each passing opportunity for a
handset to send its identification code sequence.

        In the third generation (early 2000s) cellular networks acquired the first ability to handle
data traffic. Because all types of software, applications and content can get subdivided into
small digital units of capacity, wireless networks became a slow speed option for accessing
Internet –based content. In the third generation wireless operators retrofitted their networks to
handle data traffic commingled with voice calls. Subscribers soon started to rely on so-called
3G networks for Internet access, but they often grew frustrated with the speed at which they
could download and upload content that required high bandwidth, e.g., full motion video. 3G
networks could readily handle the real time, “streaming” of music and the distribution of web
pages, but not the streaming of full motion video and other more bandwidth intensive
applications such as some forms of video gaming.

        The fourth generation of wireless service has started to offer dedicated high speed data
service at bit transmission speeds exceeding what terrestrial DSL offers and rivaling that from
some cable modem services. 4G service makes it possible to consider wireless a competitive
alternative to many terrestrial, wireline services. The proliferation of handsets, including tablets
and lightweight computers, coupled with ever increasing content and software options has
stimulated increasing demand for wireless spectrum. Experts disagree on whether and how 4G
networks can handle all of the demand for service, particularly if wireline telephone companies
opt to discontinue some or all terrestrial wireline services thereby migrating more and more
subscribers to wireless options.

5.7.2.1 Traffic Offloading and Other Spectrum Conservation Techniques

         In light of extraordinary growth in the demand for mobile services—especially
broadband—National Regulatory Authorities cannot readily solve all existing or potential
spectrum shortages simply by reallocating more bandwidth. Wireless operators have to come up
with strategies for conserving spectrum including ways to offload traffic from their congested
towers onto less heavily used frequencies, or higher capacity wireline options. Additionally
carriers can treat voice and data traffic differently so that two parallel networks can be optimized
to handle each type of traffic. An alternative view anticipates an Internet-driven network where
all traffic functions as data, including voice traffic that can be digitized and subdivided into voice
packets for processing like other forms of data traffic.

         For first and last kilometer local connectivity, wireless carriers have offered retail
subscribers the option of installing a device known as a femtocell that operates as a miniature
cellphone tower. This device extends the in-building signal penetration of a wireless network,
and also can change the frequencies used and even take traffic off the wireless network and place
it onto a wired broadband connection. However these devices need to coordinate service with an
adjacent tower and the potential exists for interference with other units, as well as dropped calls
                                                                                                      99



and lost data packets.

         Ironically most wireless carriers initially refused to allow subscribers the option of using
their handsets to access alternative networks such as Wi-Fi and competing Voice over the
Internet Protocol services. The carriers considered these technologies as depriving them of
traffic and network minutes of use. Now that some carriers have offered unmetered service and
have experienced network congestion they gladly support the offloading of traffic onto other
networks.

         The use of femtocells provides an example of how a series of overlapping wireless
signals, provided by multiple carriers and transmitters, will cover most locations. Satellites
provide the largest service contours covering up to one-third of the earth’s surface. Terrestrial
wireless networks offer megacells and macrocells covering many kilometers in rural locations,
but also microcells serving only a as little as one kilometer in the central business district of a
city. Smaller picocell service will cover less than one kilometer with femtocells, Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and sensors covering a few meters, often within a building. Intelligent devices and
networks integrate access to multiple networks in a seamless manner offering high quality and
reliability. These integrated network are compatible for human interaction, computer to
computer communications and an “Internet of Things” incorporating billions of sensors able to
monitor the real time condition of people, places, and the environment.

Wi-Fi

        Wireless Fidelity (“Wi-Fi”) extends access to a wired or wireless broadband service to
multiple users within a small distance. This technology offers an extension of an existing
broadband service, such as DSL and cable modem service. In essence Wi-Fi constitutes an
“access to access” service, because it extends the accessibility of a usually fixed wireline
broadband service to wireless and mobile users within a closed and limited area, e.g., a home or
coffee shop. Wi-Fi service typically requires the installation of a wireless router operating on
unlicensed microwave spectrum at low transmission power. Computers equipped to transmit and
receive Wi-Fi frequencies can communicate with the Wi-Fi router serving as an interface for
downloading traffic from the Internet cloud and receiving traffic for uploading to the cloud.




        Few business or residential users of Wi-Fi know that they are using microwave radio
transceivers, typically operating in the 2.4 and 5 GigaHertz (“GHz”) frequency bands, to connect
their mobile handsets, tablets and computers to a wired broadband service (Digital Subscriber
Line and cable modem) or a wireless broadband service (cellular radio, or possible another
microwave network such as Wi-MAX). Wi-Fi provides a very low power, omnidirectional
broadband signal that can deliver and receive content originating in the Internet cloud, or
playback devices such as a DVD and Compact Disk player.

        Wi-Fi is a microwave radio technology that provides a wireless link to various devices
that combine with another broadband link for receiving content and for issuing instructions to
receive more content, or to upload content. A Wi-Fi receiver and transmitter is typically housed
in a device called a router that consumers use to receive and send content. Routers take content
previously received from the Internet and forward it onward to untethered devices. Routers also
can receive instructions from these wireless devices and forward them to a broadband Internet
connection for uplinking to an Internet-based server containing desired content.

        Wi-Fi routers typically cost less than $100 USD in part because manufacturers and other
stakeholders agreed to use a common set of transmission and operating standards, including the
radio frequencies Wi-Fi uses and how signals are formatted. The Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”) has created a number of operating standards for wired and
wireless Local Area Networks that include Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi standards are numbered 802.11
and then have several different letters representing succeeding generations of standards typically
representing an increase in transmission bitrate. The most recent standard or protocol 802.11n
refers to Wi-Fi networks operating in the 2.4 and 5 GHz frequency bands having bit transmission
speeds of up to 150 Mbps.
                                                                                          101

Wi-MAX Network Configuration

        Wi-MAX stands for World Wide Interoperability for Microwave Access and it refers to
another standards-based (IEEE 802.16) microwave technology, typically operating at 2.5-3.5
GHz frequencies. Wi-MAX can provide backhaul and first and last kilometer broadband service
at speeds of up to 30-40 Mbps. The higher bit transmission speed combined with greater signal
reach has prompted some observers to deem Wi-MAX “Wi-Fi on steroids.” Wi-MAX promoters
had expectations that it would provide a competitive alternative to cellular radio services
including next generation network standards that also promise vast improvements in bitrate.
However, it appears that so-called 4th Generation cellular radio standard Long Term Evolution
(“LTE”) has overtaken Wi-MAX as the preferred option for extremely high speed, cutting edge
wireless broadband service.

       Wi-MAX provides the ability to extend Wi-Fi type access over a larger transmission
contour and in some instances on a commercial basis using licensed spectrum. However as is the
case with Wi-Fi when Wi-MAX network demand grows and as users move farther from a
                                                                                                 102



transmitter, actual achieved bit rate speeds decline. In operation Wi-MAX networks typically
deliver broadband services ranging from 1-15 Mbps.

5.7.3 Implementation Issues for Local Connectivity

        Most local connectivity projects present challenges in terms of coordination, logistics,
access to capital and availability of necessary supporting components such as electricity. In
developing nations the challenges may be more significant, because planners may seek to install
broadband before other infrastructure projects such as electricity, sanitation and water. For
wireless projects in remote locales, spectrum shortages may not present a problem, but the
anticipated frequencies must be cleared with National Regulatory Authorities so that no potential
interference will occur.
                                                                                                 104




        Local wired and wireless broadband project planners do not have to “reinvent the wheel.”
The World Bank and other organizations have identified best practices with an eye toward
providing a template for new projects. For example, in the Dominican Republic the national
regulatory authority INDOTEL undertook a multi-phased implementation of broadband
connectivity projects requiring first that administrative and legal underpinnings for the project,
the nature of the license to be awarded and the contract to be signed are well understood. 25 It also
required a number of practical steps be undertaken to ensure successful completion of the
project, including assessing demand, running an economic model to determine the maximum
subsidy to be offered, implementing a transparent and thorough tender procedure, close
supervision of projects, development of dedicated web pages and raising awareness among
prospective users.

        The Dominican Republic already had enacted laws governing the basis by which
INDOTEL would establish regulatory authority, transparent rules on government-sponsored
procurements and a universal service funding program. For each prospective project INDOTEL
undertook economic analysis of broadband demand as well as a cash flow analysis to determine
the net present value (“NPV”) and the internal rate of return (“IRR”) of the project.

       INDOTEL’s demand analysis had four categories of review:

       1)      Collect and analyze secondary data and information such as demographics, the
               economic situation of households and individuals, geography, traffic and tariffs;

       2.)     Collect, compile and analyze primary micro‐economic data on individual
               customers, households, companies, institutions, and others by means of
               questionnaires, interviews and other information gathering tools;

       3)      Use econometric modeling techniques to determine the demand functions,
               establish the accuracy of the estimates, and calculate elasticity and other
               parameters needed to quantify demand. These techniques are used for each type
               of service, each geographic area, each period of time, for incoming and outgoing
               calls, payment types, and for different socioeconomic levels; and

       4)       Evaluate and present the results, including an assessment of their relevance for
               the aspirations and objectives of the companies and/or institutions that required
               the demand estimates

        INDOTEL also estimated the revenue generating potential of proposed broadband
projects with an eye toward identifying how much of a subsidy the government should contribute
to make the project viable in light of a projected negative net present value. 26 This process
requires estimates of capital investments, recurring operating expenses and maintenance costs.
For each project INDOTEL calculated an output based aid (“OBA”) subsidy, a direct payment,
“to support investments, for example, in rural areas where the cost of construction and service
provision combined with limited revenue potential makes the project commercially unfeasible. A
                                                                                                105



key requirement for a one‐time OBA‐type subsidy is that it results in the establishment of an
operation and service provision that should ultimately be self‐sustaining and commercially
viable.” 27




        Governments can decide to provide subsidies based in part on an assessment whether a
project only needs preliminary funding to become commercially viable, or whether recurring
subsidies are needed. In the latter case, governments typically establish service milestones and
conduct audits of operators to ensure that a project meets specified benchmarks and will provide
adequate service.
                                                                                                  106



5.8    Practice Notes

African Internet Exchange System

       Following adoption of the African Regional Action Plan on the Knowledge Economy
(“ARAPKE”) framework, the Second Ordinary Session of the African Union Conference of
Ministers in charge of Communication and Information Technologies (“CITMC”) requested the
African Union Commission and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa to
accelerate the implementation of the flagship projects including the development of Internet
Exchange Points (“IXPs”). IXPs, also referred to as Internet Exchanges, provide the
opportunity for many Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) to hand off and receive traffic at a
convenient regional facility instead of having to establish several direct interconnections, or
using costly interconnection and traffic management services of other carriers.

        The African Internet Exchange System (“AXIS”) project aims to create a robust Africa-
wide internet system by installing IXPs in nations lacking any such facility, along with five
regional internet hubs to serve as many African ISPs as possible. The African Union
Commission has received funding from the Luxembourg Agency for Development Cooperation
and the EU-Africa Infrastructure Fund. The Internet Society, a non-governmental organization
with expertise in the Internet technology, logistics and coordination will assist the African Union
to use the funds efficiently. Senegal, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Niger, Namibia and Guinea have
been selected as the first countries to benefit from the project. The Internet Society’s Africa
Interconnection and Traffic Exchange program aims to have 80 percent of local Internet traffic
exchanged within Africa by 2020.

         Implementation of the AXIS project involves several phases. Before actual construction
of facilities representatives of the Information Society visit candidate nations for an IXP with an
eye toward explaining the benefits of the facility and how it would operate. These community
mobilization and technology training workshops can help explain the cost savings, efficiency
enhancing and consumer benefits accruing from having an in-country IXP. IXPs can reduce
yearly operating expenses for ISPs, including transiting costs imposed by other carriers.
Additionally multiple ISPs can share IXP infrastructure costs reduces . Broadband subscribers
benefit by the possibility of lower rates as well as the likelihood of faster service and less latency
(delay) in accessing content, particularly that available from regional carriers.

Broadband Decision Tree

        Both private and public network planners need to identify which of many broadband
technological options best match specific requirements in a particular region or locality, taking
into consideration such factors as the terrain, expanse of desired land coverage, population
density, level of existing interest in broadband, ability to pay for service and distance from
existing service options. Using these and other locality-specific factors, planners can begin to
identify which broadband technologies constitute candidates for providing services. Having
identified viable technological options, planners subsequently need to assess which one option
provides the most cost-effective and efficient solution, taking into consideration whether grants
and subsidies are available for projects identified as commercially unviable and unsustainable
without one-time, or continuing subsidization.

        Broadband network planners can begin to develop a decision tree based on experience
gleaned from projects occurring in similarly situated areas. The decision tree below can provide
a baseline template.

Preliminary Assessments

Map Existing and Planned Narrowband and Broadband Plant

        Before assessing which of many broadband technologies can optimally serve a specific
geographical area, planners should map existing and planned infrastructure. Such documentation
can help identify specific areas lacking broadband service and also start the process of
determining which technological options are feasible and efficient. Broadband mapping also
should identify the location of Internet Exchanges, telephone company switching locations, cable
television headends, wireless carrier tower sites and existing broadband network locations.

        In addition to mapping existing and prospective broadband assets, mapping projects also
can identify the population density of locations having some forms of broadband access as well
as those areas currently lacking any option. In the unserved areas, population density and
geographical terrain will have a substantial impact on what broadband option is both
technologically feasible and affordable. For example, in mapping existing broadband backbone
network lines, planners can assess whether adjacent areas have sufficient population density to
support either extending the backbone, building lower capacity branches, or using wireless
networks. Similarly maps that identify the locations of telephone company switching facilities
and cable television headends can provide planners with locations possibly served by retrofits of
existing plant, e.g., Digital Subscriber Line broadband service to areas having sufficient
population density and close proximity to a telephone company switch.
                                                                                                109



Identify the terrain of the targeted locality or region.

        If the terrain has swamps, deserts, mountains and other obstacles, technologies requiring
the installation of ducts, poles and towers typically become cost prohibitive. Wireless options—
particularly satellite earth stations—will offer the best option based on this criterion. If the
terrain supports installation of comparatively low cost ducts, poles and towers wireline options
may offer the best option, including construction of a branch, or back haul link to an existing
broadband network facility.

Identify the desired terrain coverage area and conduct an analysis of population density
demographics and interest in broadband.

        Network planners should specify the locality and region targeted for broadband access.
The size of the desired broadband footprint and its population density have a significant impact
on which technologies can provide the most cost-effective solution. Most targeted locations will
have sparsely populations, but some may have the population comparatively more concentrated
in villages than others. Generally the more concentrated the population, the greater the
likelihood that broadband options can include access from individual residences, or at least
multiple facilities, instead of a single access point such as a telecentre or kiosk. Planners should
use surveys to assess interest in broadband and willingness to pay for service.

Inventory the nearest wireline and wireless broadband options and estimate the cost to
extend them to the targeted locality or region.

        While network planners may have to construct “islands” of broadband access, typically
using satellite option, they first should determine the distance from the targeted locality to the
closest existing broadband access options. Planners should assess whether and how existing
networks can extend to the targeted locations. Some technologies, such as DSL, are distance
constrained meaning they cannot penetrate farther into the hinterland. Others have no
technological limitations, but planners will need to calculate whether a business case can be
made for an extension, on an unsubsidized basis, with a one-time infusion of capital, such as a
grant, or only with ongoing subsidization.

       Broadband Options in Relation to Terrain and Population Density

         Broadband planners cannot readily erect a flow chart that specifies which technology to
install based solely on population density levels and terrain. However, several basic “rules of
thumb” can provide a baseline for analysis of particular circumstances.
                                                                                               110



       Telephone and Cable Television Network Retrofits Typically Offer Timely and
       Lowest Cost per Prospective Subscriber Passed

        Broadband planners wisely opt to retrofit existing telecommunications plant whenever
possible. This strategy helps extend the useable life of existing, “sunk investment” and helps
conserve capital by reducing the amount of capital expenditures needed to offer a broadband
option. Areas already served by terrestrial, narrowband telephone service can include broadband
Digital Subscriber Line service with an investment of as few as a few hundred dollars per home
passed. Of course the cost of a network retrofit will vary as a function of population density.
Also one should appreciate that many remote locations may have wireline telephone service
thanks to universal service subsidies and not because the location and population density
supported the network installation free of government mandated financial support.

       Wireless Options May Offer Cost-effective Service to Locales Lacking Terrestrial
       Wireline Options

        Areas currently lacking cable television or wireline telephone service can be prime
candidates for terrestrial wireless network installations. The ongoing buildout of cellular
radiotelephone service well into the hinterland corroborates this point. Once a wireless voice
network has extended into a specific geographical region, carriers may voluntarily make the
additional investment to support broadband options. Targeted government subsidies and other
universal service financial incentives can expedite the timetable.

       Satellites May Offer the Carrier of Last Resort Option

       Even now many geographical areas lack terrestrial broadband access, because the
population density, terrain and proximity to existing broadband network assets do not support
buildout farther into the hinterland. For these least populated, most remote locations satellite
broadband access may constitute the only feasible option. Typically satellite broadband costs
more than terrestrial options and may offer comparatively slow bit transmission speeds.
Subscribers to satellite service must acquire and install an antenna, receiver and possibly other
devices such as a modem. This equipment has become less expensive and smaller over several
generations of innovation, but they do add costs typically not incurred by wireline subscribers.

        Because the satellite option may constitute the best and only solution for people in quite
remote areas, ICT development specialists have devoted much effort at finding innovative ways
to economize and to maximize access. For example, rather than install a very small antenna for
each subscriber, some communities have installed a somewhat larger satellite antenna capable of
serving many users at the same time. The term very small aperture terminal (“VSAT”) refers to
these satellite dishes that facilitate shared use. A single VSAT antenna linked with a terrestrial
wireless delivery medium, such as Wi-Fi or WiMAX can serve an entire village.
                                                                                          111



       Many residents, in remote communities also have limited discretionary income thereby
necessitating the search for ICT development grants and subsidies. Typically “community
champions” help identify and aggregate demand for broadband with an eye toward
demonstrating the viability of a satellite project to private, public and non-governmental
organizations with grant money available.

Broadband Mapping

         Mapping existing geographical availability of broadband networks constitutes one of the
first steps undertaken in formulating a strategic development plan. This inventorying process
may seem straightforward, but one should not underestimate the cost and complexity involved in
acquiring an accurate assessment of existing installed physical plant. For example the United
States federal government allocated $240 million to develop a comprehensive national
broadband map as well as maps of individual states. See National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, National Broadband Mapping Program, available at:
http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/broadbandmapping.html.

        Best practices include on site and road tests to confirm reported availability as well as the
solicitation of reports from end users using in person interviews, online surveys and informal
self-reporting, sometimes referred to as crowdsourcing. See Sam Knows, Join our broadband
campaign…Sign up with us today to accurately measure your broadband performance, web site,
available at: http://www.samknows.com/broadband/signup.

       Additionally formal reporting requirements of facilities-based carriers can promote
mapping accuracy. Map creators should make their findings readily available and provide
consumers with both the opportunity to see what options exist and to provide corrections and
updates to incorrect data.

        Interactive maps can provide information about broadband access opportunities from
businesses and residences as well as information about which community anchor institutions
exist in a neighborhood, or locality. Maps also should provide contact information for
broadband providers as well as informational about any programs designed to stimulate and
subsidize access.

Conversion from Analog to Digital Television and the Digital Dividend

        The delivery of broadcast, satellite and cable television has migrated, or soon will
migrate from analog to digital transmission. While this conversion will impose costs on both
operators and viewers significant benefits will accrue including the ability to view a higher
quality image and the opportunity for nations to reallocate a significant portion of broadcast
television spectrum for other uses including wireless broadband. Because digital television
offers a more efficient and higher quality transmission, containing as much as six times more
content for display, broadcasters can offer more than one video signal still using a 6 MegaHertz
channel. National Regulatory Authorities can group all broadcasters within a smaller range of
frequencies thereby freeing up broadcast television spectrum for reallocation.

        Digital television will require consumers to replace their existing television sets, or install
a device that receives digital signals and converts them back to analog for viewing. New digital
television sets can display a higher quality image that increases the number of columns and lines
of pixels, the individual and tiny squares of color that combine to form an image. High
Definition Television (“HDTV”) is typically classified by the number of pixel lines and whether
the video image is created in one line-by-line sequence, called progressive scanning, or by the
sequencing of even lines in one scan followed by another scan of the odd lines, called
interlacing. While standard definition, analog television generated about as few as 350 visible
lines of resolution, HDTV offers 1080 lines. HDTV also presents video signals in a ratio of
length to width like that occurring in movie theaters. This aspect ratio also makes it possible to
reproduce entire movie images when broadcast on television. Previously movie images were cut
from a 16 x 9 aspect ratio to 4x3.

        The migration from analog to digital television will generate what some call a Digital
Dividend, because freed up broadcast television spectrum can expand the amount bandwidth
available for current and future broadband wireless networks. In many nations wireless carriers
providing broadband services have expressed concerns about a scarcity of available spectrum,
particularly for Next Generation Network (“NGN”) services that require lots of bandwidth to
transmit content, such as full motion video, at bit transmission speeds comparable to wired
networks. The reallocated broadcast spectrum offers superior signal transmission characteristics,
known as propagation, because of its frequencies are lower than that previously allocated in
many nations for wireless mobile services.

Deep Packet Inspection

         As the Internet evolves subscribers will have diversifying network requirements that
place different demands on broadband networks. For example, viewers of full motion video will
need high bit transmission speeds with little tolerance for delays in delivering such “mission
critical” content. On the other hand broadband networks can handle content with less time
sensitivity in ways that conserve bandwidth and use network capacity during off peak times.
Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) increasingly use technologies that can identify the nature of
subscribers’ service requirements by inspecting labeling information contained in packets as well
as the actual content being transmitted.

        Deep Packet Inspection (“DPI”) provides ISPs with tools to identify subscribers’
bandwidth requirements, to prioritize traffic and to prevent piracy by implementing restrictions
on copying content . Some consider this technology controversial, because it equips ISPs with
the means to offer different levels of service and to charge for higher quality of service. On one
hand offering “better than best efforts” routing can enhance the user experience for subscribers
requiring high quality service that conventional “best efforts” routing will not achieve. On the
other hand DPI can provide ISPs will many ways to avoid operating as neutral conduits leading
some to express concerns that the Internet will become less open and receptive to improvements
and innovations.

        DPI provides real time monitoring of packets as they travel through an ISP’s network.
The technology can inspect header information that typically provides information about the
source and destination of the traffic. Additionally DPI can examine packet payloads and identify
the nature and type of traffic being transmitted. This capability will make it possible to identify
“mission critical” content can provide superior service, possibly at a premium rate. However
ISPs can also use this technology to prioritize, degrade, or block traffic, not because of network
conditions, such as congestion, or even at the request of a subscriber. Under a worst case
scenario DPI can provide ISPs with ways to identify traffic so that it can be subject to inferior
service with the goal of forcing subscribers or content sources to pay more to achieve a basic
level of acceptable service. DPI also raises questions about privacy as ISP and even third parties
can use the technology to track and profile online usage.

Featurephones Smartphones and Tablets

        As wireless networks become more sophisticated and able to handle data applications at
high speeds, the nature, type and number of useable handsets also will expand. The handsets that
transmit and receive wireless signals now range from simple devices designed primarily to
provide telephone calls to ones that operate much like portable computers. Generally the cost of
handsets increases as the number of functions and available services rises. For wireless
subscribers interested primarily in voice communications, as well as the ability to send and
receive text messages and photographs, a variety of “featurephones” are available at low cost.
These handsets lack many of the news features and either lack the capability, or offer less than
optimal access to Internet-based, data services. Some recent vintage feature phones also offer
additional features such as personal digital assistant note taking and scheduling, a media player, a
touchscreen, Global Positing Satellite GPS navigation and Wi-Fi access. Currently a majority of
consumers use feature phones, but near term migration to smartphones will reduce market share,
particularly in developed nations.

       Smartphones offer far more use options, because manufacturers have installed an
operating system with data access in mind. Most smartphones use a mobile operating system
created by Google, Apple, Nokia, Research in Motion, and Microsoft. These devices use high
performing computer chips and typically have larger screen capable of displaying high definition
content, including full motion video. Some smartphone users rely on their wireless connection
exclusively for broadband data services, while others continue to maintain subscriptions to both
wireless and wireline broadband services. Other smartphone users may never have acquired a
personal computer, or laptop before resorting to smartphone access to the Internet.

        Tablets offer users an even larger screen and more computer processing power coupled
with wireless access that may include both Wi-Fi and mobile radio frequencies. Tablets still
offer voice and text communications options, but their size and power favor data
communications. Many content providers now offer services optimized for access via tablets
and smartphones. These so-called applications accommodate the smaller screen sizes of
smartphones and tablets as compared to tablets. Applications also offer fast access to a specific
service or function as compared to the possibly larger options available from a world wide web
site containing many pages of content.

Hybrid Broadband Using a Combination of Copper and Fiber Optic Cables

        Carriers providing terrestrial broadband services typically attempt to upgrade and retrofit
existing networks facilities, rather than replace them entirely with costly new technologies such
as fiber optic cables. A combination of newly installed glass fiber optic cables and already
installed copper wire cables provides an opportunity to extend the usefulness of existing plant
and also to reduce the amount of capital investment needed to provide next generation network
services. The word hybrid is used to identify networks that combine older “legacy” facilities
with newly installed plant. As some future date these hybrid combinations will get replaced with
entirely new equipment that can offer even better transmission speeds and capacity. However in
the interim time period carriers have found ways to expedite the introduction of networks
offering improvements to an all copper wire medium.

       Companies providing both basic wireline telephone service and cable television service
have devised ways to combine fiber optic cable connections with existing copper wire. The
replacement process typically starts between carrier facilities with the last wire replacement
occurring for the wire providing the first and last link to individual subscribers.

        The term Hybrid Fiber Coax (“FTC”) identifies a network that combines fiber optic and
copper coaxial cables. The terms Fiber to the Pedestal (“FTTP”) and Fiber to the Curb
(“FTTC”) identify the location where copper wires continue to provide the network delivery.
The retained copper wire is located at the point where a network connects directly to an end user,
on the curb near a street, or at a frame, called a pedestal, where the wire linking a residence is
connected with another copper or fiber optic wire. For residential subscribers the “drop line”
leading to and from a residence is located on the property of the subscriber, but typically along a
right of way or easement at the edge of the property. The drop line may connect with another
copper line, or to the first of many fiber optic links.

         At the location where copper and fiber optic cables are connected, the carrier must also
install equipment that can convert the transmitted signals from an optical carrier to a copper wire
based carrier and vice versa. Telephone companies can extend the reach of their broadband
services and increase the transmission speed and capacity by replacing the copper local loop with
fiber optic cables also extending close to subscribers. The term Fiber to the Node refers to the
installation of fiber optic cables to a switching facility in a neighborhood serving as many as 500
residences. Fiber to the Premises refers to the installation of fiber optic cables all the way to a
pedestal serving one subscriber.

Infrastructure Sharing

        Broadband service providers can share the cost of installing and maintaining
infrastructure in ways that promote competition, operating efficiency and universal service.
When multiple operators can spread the investment costs over a larger base of users, they can
achieve scale economies represented by lower per unit costs of essential elements of service.
Additionally consumers can benefit when infrastructure sharing helps expand the coverage area
that carriers can afford to serve.

        Infrastructure costs are comprised of capital expenditures in the physical plant needed to
provide service, operating expenditures needed for ongoing service and the interest and other
expenses operators incur when they borrow funds to invest in new infrastructure. Infrastructure
costs also divide into passive and active elements. Operators can share passive elements without
affecting their ability to differentiate service and market their offerings as superior.

        Passive elements constitute the civil engineering and non-electronic elements of
infrastructure including: physical sites, poles and ducts, power supplies, trenches, towers and
masts, splitters, shelters, air conditioning equipment, diesel and other forms of backup power
generators including batteries, and the premises easements and other authorizations to own or
lease property. Because passive elements do not directly transmit content shared management of
these resources does not impact coverage or capacity of a broadband network.




       When operators share active elements they cooperate in the use and cost recovery of
                                                                                                  125



components such as spectrum, copper wire and fiber optic lines. Such sharing raises more
difficult coordination and cost sharing issues and may also trigger regulatory matters such as
who shall serve as the holder of any required license, how will that licensee represent the
interests of all parties before the regulatory agency and how to ensure that a dominant carrier
does not use sharing to handicap smaller competitors.

Integrating Femtocell and Wi-Fi Coverage in Residences and Beyond

        Currently some residential broadband subscribers have the option of using two separate
wireless devices to extend the range and accessibility of their service. A Wi-Fi router provides
access to more than one computer, tablet and smartphone by sharing a single broadband
subscription available to any device equipped with a small receiver and transmitter operating on
Wi-Fi frequencies, typically 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Wi-Fi routers assign addresses to each
computing device to avoid data stream collisions. To avoid interference between computing
devices, which might operate in close proximity to each other, these routers also assign different
frequency channels to each device.

       At residences wireless broadband subscribers also might install a small femtocell that
operates as a low-powered base station to improve network accessibility. Mobile wireless
broadband services operate on very high frequencies that partially bounce off walls and other
obstructions instead of penetrating them. To improve in-building signal penetration some
wireless carriers offer subscribers the option of installing a device that receives weak incoming
wireless signals, amplifies them and retransmits them inside a building. Subscribers with mobile
radio handsets communicate with the nearby femtocell instead of the closest available network
tower that might have a location far from the residence.

         Integrating the femtocell and Wi-Fi devices with a subscriber’s wired broadband service
has the potential to generate benefits to both carriers and their subscribers. Wireless carriers can
install a specific type of femtocell designed to interconnect with their subscribers’ wireline
broadband service that might be offered by an affiliate of the wireless carrier, or by another
carrier. By connecting the femtocell with a wired broadband connection, the wireless carriers
can offload subscriber traffic that otherwise would travel through the femtocell and onto the
wireless carrier’s network. The wireless carrier can reduce its volume of traffic and the potential
for network congestion by routing traffic originating and terminating at residences via an
available wireline broadband connection instead of the wireless connection. Subscribers benefit
by having a more reliable service capable of delivering high bandwidth intensive applications
such as full motion video.

       In the future manufacturers will combine the femotocell coverage extension function with
the Wi-Fi ability to offload data from wireless to wireline networks and perhaps more
importantly from one type of wireless network to another. This device also will provide the
necessary modem function so that both wireless and wireline routing options are available
depending on current network conditions.

        Additionally wireless operators may plan on combining their 4G networks with small cell
configurations using Wi-Fi frequencies. Rather than offload broadband traffic onto a wired
carrier’s network the wireless carrier can assign traffic to either its 4G network, or localized Wi-
Fi small cells based on the nature of the traffic to be delivered and the potential for congestion.
Carriers might install the small cell option in places where high demand and the potential for
congestion is likely, such as shopping malls, stadiums, university campuses and public
transportation like airports and train stations.

Internet of Things

        Currently the Internet provides a medium for the transmission and processing of
information created and used by humans. Computers, servers and other devices store, switch and
transmit the information, but human involvement must occur in one or more instances. The
Internet of Things refers to the prospect for the creation of data by devices, such as sensors, that
do not involve humans in the collection, processing, storage and even interpretation of the
information:

       [T]he predictable pathways of information are changing: the physical
       world itself is becoming a type of information system. In what’s called the
       Internet of Things, sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects—
       from roadways to pacemakers—are linked through wired and wireless
       networks, often using the same Internet Protocol (IP) that connects the
       Internet. These networks churn out huge volumes of data that flow to
       computers for analysis. When objects can both sense the environment and
       communicate, they become tools for understanding complexity and
       responding to it swiftly. What’s revolutionary in all this is that these
       physical information systems are now beginning to be deployed, and some
       of them even work largely without human intervention. 2

        The Internet of Things requires physical objects to have the ability to identify themselves
and regularly transmit data measurements via the Internet. Tiny measurement devices,
commonly referred to as sensors, can operate in a variety of hostile, mobile and other
environments where ongoing human monitoring would be impossible or too expensive. For
example, monitors can be installed under or on the skin of people so that medical data, such as
heart rate, blood pressure and glucose levels, can be transmitted on an ongoing basis. So long at
the reported data does not fall above or below a prescribed level the receiving computer would
collect the data and do nothing more with it. However should the reported data exceed set
parameters the computer could have programmed instructions to issue and alert triggering human
intervention.

        Device miniaturization, wider and cheaper Internet access and drastic drops in the cost of
data storage make it possible for computer and network intelligence to become part of new
networks serving households and businesses. Significant operating efficiency gains can occur,
because regular monitoring can occur automatically and frequently without human intervention.
For example, a utility company can measure power demand on an immediate, “real time” basis,
rather than send meter readers to make monthly on-site visits to each subscriber. With
immediate power demand information, utility management and programmed computers can use
price changes to stimulate or retard demand and better avoid outages.

New African Submarine Cables

        As never before, residents throughout the continent of Africa have access to high speed
fiber optic cables including several submarine cables that link Africa with other transoceanic
cables traversing the world. African submarine capacity divides between west and east coast
systems. On the west coast the SAT-2 cable provided the first available bandwidth in 1993
followed by the SAT-3/SAFE cable in 2002. Between 2010 and 2012 four new systems began
service: Glo-1 and Main One Main Street Technologies in 2010 and Africa Coast to Europe
(“ACE”) and the West Africa Cable System (“WACS”) in 2012. WACS offers a 14,000
kilometer route from South Africa to Portugal and the United Kingdom with a total bit
transmission speed of 5.12 Terabits per second. The ACE cable follows a serving 21 landing
points in Africa.

        On the east coast of Africa the East Africa Marine System delivered the first fiber optic
submarine cable capacity in 2009. The Seacom cable, launched in 2009, provides connectivity
between the east coast of Africa onward to Europe and India. The key markets served are:
Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, South Africa and Rwanda. The East Africa Submarine
Cable System (“EASSy”) started operations in July 2010, providing a 10,800 kilometer fiber
optic pathway running from Sudan to South Africa. This $263 million project has a total
capacity of 3.84 Terabits per second divided into lines currently offering up to 30 Gigabits per
second transmission speed. There are nine landing stations in South Africa, Madagascar,
Mozambique, Comoros Islands, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti and Sudan.

Powering Remote Broadband Access

         Access to broadband facilities in remote areas often requires consideration on how to
install and maintain other necessary infrastructure such as a reliable source of electrical power.
A major challenge to rural connectivity lies in the lack of a “last mile” infrastructure providing a
link to a regional or national backbone network. Telecenters and broadband kiosks may not have
a direct link to the power grid and therefore must have a sustainable, self-contained direct source.
Power options include rechargeable batteries, solar power, diesel/gas generators, micro-
hydroelectric dams and small windmills.

Satellite Backhaul

        Satellites provide broadband network access to and from local distribution facilities
located in the most remote areas as well as locations where topography restricts connection to
backbone networks and when emergency telecommunications is needed. The satellite option
typically triggers high operating costs with comparatively slower transmission speeds and
problems with latency, transmission delays due to the length of time it takes to transmit and
receive signals to and from satellite operating as far as 22,300 miles from earth.

        Despite their limitations satellites may provide the only viable means for users in the
remote locations to access the Internet cloud. Best practices in satellite backhaul address how to
build and maintain facilities in a timely and efficient manner, taking into consideration particular
site requirements such as the need for a reliable power source where no installed grid access
option exists.

         Recent developments in satellite backhaul include the installation of smaller sized
satellite dishes that operate in the 20-30 GigaHertz, Ka-band. These “[s]atellites can use more
spot beams. Rather than broadcast the same signal across their whole footprint, the satellites can
reuse the spectrum many times over because they have been fitted with a number of small spot
beam antennas for specific geographic coverage. The same spectrum can be reused in every
second spot beam. This greatly increases the overall system capacity and total throughput
available.” 3

       “The second major advance has been the change from using dedicated bandwidth to
packet switched architecture.

- The older fixed capacity allocation method [Single Channel per Carrier] left bandwidth unused,
wasting system capacity that could have been used elsewhere. Allocating bandwidth on demand
means that statistical multiplexing gains can increase total system capacity by anything from 30
to 80%.

- Rather than pay for a fixed bandwidth link, regardless of how much of it is being used, satellite
operators can be more creative in their tariff plans, and for example, they can charge on usage
rather than on a fixed capacity basis.

- For small cells, where there are potentially thousands of sites to be connected, it doesn't make
economic sense to use dedicated bandwidth, so solutions that can centrally manage bandwidth
will be used.” 4

Types of 4G Wireless Service

         The latest generation of wireless networking offers the promise of bit transmission speeds
that rival what wired terrestrial systems can offer. So-called 4G networks represent the fourth
major technological change in wireless networking with dedicated bandwidth for data services
and transmission formats conducive to very fast broadband service. The preceding generations
did not offer networks optimized for data services and accordingly offered significantly slower
transmission speeds. 1G service offered analog voice services and no data. 2G services offered a
digital transmission format, but no special accommodation for data services. In the third
generation, wireless carriers retrofitted their voice networks to handle data services, but the bit
transmission rate rarely exceeded 200-400 kilobits per second.

        While the 4G networks currently in operations do not fully comply with the transmission
speeds identified in international standards, these networks, providing Long Term Evolution
(“LTE”) regularly offer speeds between 5 and 12 megabits per second (“Mbps”). The
International Telecommunication Union official standard for 4G, the International Mobile
Telecommunications Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specification, establishes a peak transmission
speed standard for 4G service at 100 Mbps for high mobility communication (such as from trains
and cars) and 1 gigabit per second (“Gbps”) for low mobility communication (such as
pedestrians and stationary users).

        The IMT-Advanced 4G specification establishes a number of operating standards
including the use of Internet Protocol, packet switching instead of formats primarily suited for
voice communications. Networks must efficiently use available bandwidth both in terms of
supporting shared use of the same channel by multiple users and the ability to scale up the use of
allocated bandwidth as demand grows. Carriers use Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple
Access (“OFDMA”) technology that divides available bandwidth into many channels and also
multiplexes data streams into multiple pieces, each of which is modulated onto a separate carrier
which are later combined.

         Another spectrum efficiency requirement imposes a minimum rate of how many bits can
be transmitted per channel and by each individual transmission cell. The standard also requires
that all network operators can handle the traffic of other carriers thereby eliminating format
incompatibility as exists between 3G networks that operate on the same spectrum, but use
different transmission formats, e.g., Time Division Multiple Access versus Code Division
Multiple Access. 4G carriers also have to provide subscribers with the ability to transmit and
receive data that represents full motion video and high fidelity sound.

        It appears that the LTE format for 4G service has become the consensus standard in light
of the decision by many carriers to purchase and install 4G equipment. Previous a significant
number of formats competed for adoption including: High Speed Packet Access, Wi-MAX,
WCDMA, Edge and EV-DO.

Ultra High Definition Television

        The next generation of high definition television sets will have even more resolution than
currently available. Video screen resolution is measured in terms of the number of columns and
lines as well as the total number of pixels, the smallest unit of video display. The current best
standard for high definition television combines 1920 vertical columns with 1080 horizontal
lines. Multiplying the number of columns by lines identifies the total number of pixels
displayed.

        Ultra high definition television doubles or quadruples the number of columns and lines.
So-called 4K Ultra High Definition contains 2160 lines of resolution and 8K 4320 lines. Ultra
high definition video resolution will make it possible for television manufacturers to offer larger
sets with screens exceeding 84 inches as measured diagonally.

        Ultra High Definition video will likely generate even greater consumer demand for faster
broadband transmission speeds to accommodate the increased amount of content delivered per
video frame. Terrestrial broadcasters and cable operators can repurpose some bandwidth by
eliminating analog transmissions. However, Internet Service Providers, as operators of a fully
digital medium, will have no ability to repurpose bandwidth to accommodate rising demand.

Ultra Wideband Networks

        Next generation network options use even higher spectrum to satisfy the ever increasing
demand for wireless broadband service. So called Ultra Wideband (“UWB”) networks provide
very high speed bit transmission using a wide range of extremely high frequencies, at or above
the 2.4 GHz band currently used for Wi-Fi service. UWB transfers large amounts of data
wirelessly over short distances, typically less than ten meters. Unlike other wireless systems,
which are limited to relative narrow allocation of spectrum, UWB operates by transmitting
signals over a very wide range of spectrum, but at very low power.

       UWB networks can satisfy individual short broadband requirements and provide a
wireless alternative to possibly inconvenient wire-based services. So-called Personal Area
Networks will provide broadband connectivity like that currently served by Bluetooth
applications that can link mobile phones, portable computers, cars, stereo headsets, and MP3
players with sources of content. The low power and short range of these technologies supports
unlicensed use.

        In light the proliferation of sensors, which typically need to transmit over very short
distances, UWB technologies can power an Internet of Things. UWB can avoid causing
interference with current narrowband and wideband radio services and between unlicensed users.
It can operate in hostile environments and has been miniaturized so that it can be embedded in
chip sets attached to other devices.

White Spaces Explained

        White spaces refer to radio spectrum allocated for a specific use, but available for other
uses in many locations where such secondary uses will not cause interference to the primary,
authorized users. Historically the International Telecommunication Union on an international,
multilateral basis and individual nations on a domestic basis typically allocate spectrum for a
single, specific use. This results in many instances where no primary spectrum user operates, but
administrative rules prevent other uses. Put another way concerns about the potential for
interference have motivated spectrum allocation decisions that result in inefficient use, because
significant amounts of bandwidth remain unused even though many uses can occur without
causing harmful interference.

        For example, most nations have allocated a large amount of spectrum for radio and
television stations, typically on an exclusive basis. Such exclusivity ensures that the broadcast
signal encounters no interference, but there are many locations where spectrum use of
broadcaster assigned frequencies have no potential to interfere with actual broadcast
transmissions. White spaces refers to the geographic areas where there exists no potential for
interference, because actual users are located at great distances away and in some instances there
may be no actual users whatsoever.

        The broadcast television band constitutes a likely candidate for identifying white spaces,
because national regulatory authorities created a very large frequency band for this service and
often substantial distances separate actual users of any specific broadcast channel. “White
spaces exist primarily because analog television receivers were highly susceptible to
interference, requiring the FCC to create frequency ‘guard bands’ between television channels in
order to prevent interference. For example, in a given viewing market, if channel 9 is licensed,
channel 8 and 10 will be vacant, as will channel 9 in any neighboring viewing market.” 5

        With the conversion from analog to digital television broadcasting in many locations the
amount of white spaces increases significantly. Some nations have identified spectrum for
reallocation to other services such as wireless broadband. In some instance nations auction the
newly available spectrum and accrue a substantial monetary infusion into the national treasury, a
so-called Digital Dividend. Even for nations reallocating some of the freed up spectrum, the
expanded availability of white spaces has resulted in changes in policies allowing non-interfering
uses.

White Spaces Interference Avoidance

       The opportunity to use white spaces for broadband access depends on the ability of
secondary users to apply techniques that ensure the ability of primary users to continue operating
without interference. For broadcast television white spaces this means that even unlicensed
broadband applications must use sophisticated techniques that can sense other uses and change
frequencies to avoid causing interference.

        Technologies such as software-defined and cognitive radio offer such frequency agility.
They have sensing capabilities that can identify frequencies where TV channels exist and can
find and quickly move transmissions to open spectrum. This means that instead of simply tuning
into a specific frequency, white spaces devices must have built in intelligence for detecting other
spectrum users and quickly finding other frequencies on which to operate.

        In addition to using receivers to sense whether a specific frequency has an existing user,
white space devices can interrogate data bases that map and identify preexisting registered uses
for specific locations. In light of inexpensive access to the very accurate Global Positioning
Satellite service, white spaces transmitters can employ geo-location procedures to assess the
interference potential before operating.

        Additionally white spaces devices can operate at very low power to provide location
specific broadband access in much the same way as Wi-Fi operates. With low power Wi-Fi
devices can reduce interference even for other users in close proximity. Also Wi-Fi devices can
change channels once interference is sensed. In addition to operating at low power and having
the ability to change transmitting frequencies, white spaces devices have sensing capabilities that
trigger a change in frequency to avoid causing interference in the first place.

Wireless Device Tethering

        Tethering refers to the ability to link two devices so that they can share a function such as
wireless access to the Internet. Cellphone users might want to use personal computers and
tablets for accessing the Internet instead of their phones which may not have a sufficiently large
screen or the capability of accessing the World Wide Web. Some personal computers and tablets
can achieve direct wireless access using installed electronics or with the insertion of a dongle
into an interface such as a Universal Service Bus (“USB”) jack. Devices lacking direct access
capability can tether to a cellphone for indirect access.

       Currently many areas in the world have cellular radio access, but lack a local broadband
access options such as Wi-Fi. For locations one can tether a personal computer or tablet to the
cellphone thereby securing the Internet access available via the cellphone. Note that the
cellphone must have software supporting tethering and the wireless carrier may impose a
surcharge for this feature, or prohibit the option.

Creating Your Own Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot

        In areas where Wi-Fi broadband access does not exist, subscribers to a broadband service
can create a limited, short range alternative. So called mobile Wi-Fi hotspots use a portable
wireless router to provide shared access to a broadband service such as 4G wireless data. This
small, battery powered device offers a portable hotspot that taps into wireless data services, just
like a smartphone does, and then wirelessly shares its data connection with other nearby Wi-Fi-
enabled devices such as a personal computer or handset. Several users can share the single Wi-
Fi connection and encryption techniques provide a password authentication process to prevent
unauthorized access.

Wireless Mesh Networking

        Wireless mesh networks provide broadband access through the coordination and
interconnection of nodes that have can receive and retransmit traffic. In much the same way as
the Internet provides a managed, “best efforts” routing of traffic, the software configured
management of nodes achieves the same “dynamic routing” based on intelligent selection of
which node can help move traffic to the final destination or closer to that destination.

         Wireless mesh networking requires at least one broadband connection to the Internet,
e.g., a cable modem or DSL link. Access to that links can be shared over many geographically
separated users who can secure a link to the broadband connection via one or more intermediary
nodes. The geographical range of the mesh network extends with increases in the number of
installed nodes.

        Wireless mesh networking can provide a low cost way to extend the reach of a broadband
connection. However its open and shared networking characteristics does create security risks,
particularly when nodes are installed in a variety of locations not under the control of a single
manager. Nevertheless wireless mesh networks can offer a quickly installed and inexpensive
way to share broadband access, particularly on an unlicensed and noncommercial basis.

        “The World Wide Web (known as "WWW', "Web" or "W3") is the universe of network-
accessible information, the embodiment of human knowledge.
        The World Wide Web began as a networked information project at CERN, where Tim
Berners-Lee, now Director of the World Wide Web Consortium [W3C], developed a vision of
the project.
        The Web has a body of software, and a set of protocols and conventions. Through the use
hypertext and multimedia techniques, the web is easy for anyone to roam, browse, and contribute
to.” World Wide Web Consortium, About The World Wide Web available at:
http://www.w3.org/WWW/.

        The Internet is a vast network of individual computers and computer networks that
communicate with each other using the same communications language, Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). The Internet consists of approximately
more than 100 million computers around the world using TCP/IP protocols. Along with
the development of TCP/IP, the open network architecture of the Internet has the
following characteristics or parameters: 1. Each distinct network stands on its own with
its own specific environment and user requirements, notwithstanding the use of TCP/IP
to connect to other parts of the Internet. Communications are not directed in a unilateral
fashion. Rather, communications are routed throughout the Internet on a best efforts
basis in which some packets of information may go through one series of computer
networks and other packets of information go through a different permutation or
combination of computer networks, with all of these information packets eventually
arriving at their intended destination. 2. Black boxes, for lack of a better term, connect
the various networks; these boxes are called ‘gateways’ and ‘routers.’ The gateways and
routers do not retain information but merely provide access and flow for the packets
being transmitted. There is no global control of the Internet.” Konrad L. Trope, Voice Over

        The Internet cloud refers to the vast array of interconnected networks that make up the
Internet and provide users with seamless connectivity to these networks and the content available
via these networks. “The increasing functionality of the Internet is decreasing the role of the
personal computer. This shift is being led by the growth of “cloud computing”--the ability to run
applications and store data on a service provider's computers over the Internet, rather than on a
person's desktop computer.” William Jeremy Robison, Free at What Cost?: Cloud Computing

        “Television stations often operate on the same or adjacent channels. However, to avoid
interference between each other, television stations are often operated in geographically separate
areas. Further, there are areas of the country where, because of population density, not all
television channels are utilized. This unused spectrum between TV stations -- called white
spaces -- represents a valuable opportunity for our changing wireless mobile landscape. This
block of spectrum is ripe for innovation and experimental use, holding rich potential for
expanding broadband capacity and improving access for many users, and for developing
technologies that can expand this type of spectrum access to other frequencies and services in
order to greatly increase our ability to utilize spectrum.” Government of the United States of

         “Currently, agreements for the exchange of Internet traffic are unregulated and left solely
to commercial negotiation between Internet backbone providers. Agreements for the exchange of
traffic between operators are called ‘peering agreements’ and depending on the balance of traffic,
it may be either free or paid. Other arrangements provide that one network will carry traffic
without exchanging traffic on that network link. This will involve payment, and such service is
called ‘transit.’” Daniel L. Brenner and Winston Maxwell, The Network Neutrality and the

        “So, as we start seeing digital divides closing around Internet access and mobile phone
ownership, a new broadband divide is growing. This is already – and will continuingly – require
a strategic response which, if not led, must at the least be coordinated by government. As and
where this happens, the development results will be impressive. Broadband uptake is associated
at the macro level with growth in indicators such as employment and GDP, and at the micro level
there are many new employment- and productivity-enhancing opportunities.” Richard Heeks,

         “A negative NPV means that the project is not profitable. To get companies to invest the
rate of return of a project has to be equal or greater than what can be achieved elsewhere. This
happens when the NPV is equal to zero or, in other words, when the IRR equals the discount
rate. Therefore, a subsidy that makes NPV equal to zero has to be offered to make the rural
project attractive for current operators and potential new entrants.” Id at 61.

6.1    INTRODUCTION

Module 6 of the Broadband Strategies Toolkit focuses on the strategies for
stimulating broadband demand. The debate around the digital divide has been, so far,
driven by statistics based on the number of households that have a broadband
connection and a computer and individuals that have a wireless broadband device,
such as a smartphone. Along these lines, policy emphasis has been made, to a large
degree, to increase the deployment of broadband networks. While the causality
between network deployment and broadband penetration certainly exists, it is
important to consider that a substantial portion of the digital divide is also explained
by the demand gap, the reasons for which will be discussed in depth throughout this
paper. While the supply gap measures the portion of the population of a given country
that cannot access broadband because of lack of service, the demand gap focuses on
the potential users that could buy broadband service (since operators offer it in their
territory) but do not (see figure 6.1).

Tackling the demand gap is critical for policy makers. The research on the social and
economic impact of broadband indicates increasing returns to scale derived from
enhanced adoption. In other words, higher broadband and ICT penetration benefits
the country’s population as a whole. In that sense, stimulating broadband access and
usage is critical for social development, economic performance, and overall welfare.

The ideal situation for a broadband market is one in which broadband is deployed and
service provided by operators on a commercial basis and that can be subscribed on a
voluntary basis. Because broadband is a basic element of societal infrastructure, it is
desirable for operators’ business to be sound. Operators will continue to provide
broadband service in the long term if they are able to achieve a proper profit under
sound market mechanisms that can be achieved by government’s proper supervision.
In order to achieve this win-win relationship between stakeholders of users, operators
and government, an adequate amount of demand has to exist in the market. Thus it is
necessary for policy-makers to enhance demand with the purpose of maintaining the
win-win relationship, without distorting market competition. Also, there may be
certain areas in which operators cannot make a profit and do not provide their service.


                                                                                      4
This creates a potential digital divide. It is necessary for policy-makers to support
those areas.

This module introduces readers to the benefits of higher adoption rates; it examines
the progress made so far by countries in the developed and emerging worlds in
stimulating broadband demand. It provides an explanation of concepts, such as a
supply and demand gap, broadband price elasticity, and demand promotion. In doing
so, it also explains differences between fixed and mobile broadband demand gap,
introducing the notions of substitution and complementarity between both platforms.
Building on these concepts, the toolkit provides a set of recommendations of best
practices and potential strategies aimed at promoting broadband demand.

Readers should use this module in close connection with the other modules of the
Broadband Strategies Toolkit. In particular, Module 2 – Policy Approaches to
promoting Broadband Development, Module 3 – Law and Regulation for a
Broadband World, and Module 4 – Extending Universal Broadband Access and Use
are all useful inputs to demand stimulation. For example, stimulating demand by
breaking the economic barrier and offering low-priced broadband service and
addressing needs of rural and isolated populations should be considered tools for
stimulating demand and achieving universal adoption (covered in module 3).
Similarly, references to the role of government and price regulation will be found not
only in this module but also in Modules 2 – Policy Approaches to promoting
Broadband Development and 3 - Law and Regulation for a Broadband World.

To reiterate, the focus here is not the supply gap, but rather the obstacles for adoption
on the demand side. A supply gap is found in places where broadband infrastructure
is rudimentary or exhibits limited deployment. This access gap may indeed derive
from regulatory policies, but can also come from a lack of interest from investors and
telecom operators. Addressing this gap and identifying the common parameters
behind it is critical for most national broadband strategies. It is one of the primary
themes of Module 4 - Extending Universal Broadband Access and Use.

On the other hand, this module focuses heavily on strategies to affect the behavior of
subscribers, whether they are residential users or Small and Medium Enterprises. In
this sense, it is less focused on the technological aspects (the subject of Module 5), or
even on specific regulatory approaches such as network neutrality (covered in
Module 3).

Building on the structure of Chapter 6 of the Broadband Strategies Handbook,
evidence and best practices from past projects, and ongoing work in the field of
broadband demand stimulation will be described and analyzed to provide a holistic
tool and guide regulators and policy-makers. In line with constantly updated
information resources, the module has direct links to the sources of information.

6.2    ASSESSING THE BROADBAND DEMAND GAP

Before implementing specific demand stimulation strategies, policy-makers must
conduct a diagnostic that allows them to determine the size and sources of the
demand gap. This process begins by measuring the demand gap: what percentage of
the population can purchase broadband yet still do not? Once this gap is quantified, it
is necessary to understand the drivers of this so called “market failure.” Is it because a
portion of the population cannot afford to purchase a subscription at current prices?
Or is it because they lack the necessary digital literacy that allows them to access the
Internet? It could also be the case that while potential users have a computer (or
comparable device), they cannot find any online content, applications, or services that
would motivate them to purchase broadband service.

This section explains the different concepts and provides examples of methodologies
for measuring the demand gap and constructing a diagnostic of structural factors
affecting adoption. It would set the stage to explaining a variety of approaches and
policy solutions to meet the adoption targets.

6.2.1. Measuring the broadband demand gap:

Measuring the demand gap is the first step in the development of a diagnostic that
will lead to the formulation of demand stimulation policies. Given the
interrelationship of fixed and mobile broadband leading to complementarity and/or
substitution scenarios, this exercise is not trivial. Moreover, measuring demand gaps
in the aggregate for a whole country is not necessarily a suitable approach for the
development of targeted policies. Therefore, any attempt at measuring the broadband
demand gap has to be conducted at a disaggregated level (county, department). This
section first addresses how to measure the demand gap in fixed broadband, then
moves to the mobile broadband gap, and finally discusses the interrelationship
between both domains.

6.2.1.1. The fixed broadband demand gap:

Demand gap is defined as the difference between either households or individuals that
could have access to broadband but do not acquire the service. This is not a statistic
that is being tracked by either regulators or made public by operators. In recent years,
however, policy makers, driven by the need to develop national broadband strategies
and plans, have in some instances been able to estimate this metric.

While most countries have fairly accurate estimates of broadband subscribers, they
lack a solid grasp of network coverage, defined as the proportion of the population of
a given country that is “served” by broadband technology. This metric (and the
supporting coverage maps) should be calculated both for fixed and mobile broadband.

In the case of fixed broadband, coverage needs to be estimated in terms of the number
of households that are served by broadband providers (i.e. where residents have the
option to purchase service from telecommunications carriers or cable TV operators).
Even this number can be sometimes difficult to estimate. For example, the
development of the United States’ National Broadband Plan introduced the notion of
the “underserved” household. “Underserved” means that the resident can get access to

                                                                                        6
broadband, but at a download speed below the target stipulated by the broadband plan
(in this case, 2 Mbps). Therefore, a first level assessment should consider three
categories of fixed broadband coverage: “served,” “underserved” (download speeds
lower than the target), and “unserved” (no service at all). The problem with the
“underserved” category is that in emerging countries, a large portion of households
can gain access to service speeds much lower than those speeds stipulated in a
broadband plan (for example, 256 kbps). Given the hurdle to improving the level of
service to the “underserved” population, the general consensus is that, at least in
emerging countries attempting to reach mass-deployment levels of broadband, this
category should not be considered as part of the estimation of the broadband demand
gap.

Another difficulty in assessing fixed broadband coverage resides in the interpretation
of operator-provided information. As the Technology Strategies Module reviews,
broadband deployment, in its most basic mode, is fulfilled by introducing certain
modifications to existing telecommunications and cable TV networks. In the case of
telecommunications copper networks, xDSL service requires the installation of
equipment at the central office, while in the case of cable TV, cable modem service
requires the upgrading of its networks to bi-directional 750 MHz capacity. The
implication of this situation is that a residence could have either wireline telephony or
cable TV coverage, but the infrastructure is not upgraded to the point where it may
have the capability of handling a subscriber’s request for service. The question of
interpretation, then, is whether that residence should be considered “served” or
“unserved”? It is generally accepted that, in the case of emerging countries, if the
customer is served by either a telecommunications fixed network or a cable TV
system, he/she should be included in the “served population” category.

With these two caveats in mind, the demand gap can be calculated by using a
standard coverage metric estimation. For example, table 6.1 presents data on the fixed
broadband demand gap for select developed countries.

As shown, the broadband demand gap is not only an emerging market phenomenon.
In certain developed countries (such as Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom,


                                                                                       7
and the United States), an important portion of households lack broadband
connectivity for reasons other than service availability.

In the United States, for example, 96% of households are served by cable modem
technology, while 82% can acquire broadband service from the telecommunications
operator. However, as indicated in the statistics of table 6.1, only 64% of households
purchase service. Therefore, 32% of households could have access to broadband
services, but choose not to acquire a subscription. As expected, the demand gap in
this country varies by state as shown in Figure 6.2.

As figure 6.2 indicates, the broadband demand gap is larger in less-developed states.
In Mississippi, for example, it is 60%, while the supply gap (non-served households)
is 9%. In a more developed state such as Georgia, where service penetration is higher,
the supply gap is 8%, while the demand gap is 34%.

In a European country such as Germany, according to the National Broadband
Strategy published in February of 2009, 98% of all households (39,700,00) can access
broadband service. Of these, 37,600,000 can be served by xDSL, 22,000,000 are
served by cable TV (and therefore could buy broadband via cable modem), and
730,000 can access broadband via fixed wireless or satellite. However, despite the
near-complete coverage, only 58% of households have purchased broadband,
signifying a demand gap of 40%.

The fixed broadband demand gap is, as expected, a more serious problem in emerging
countries. Table 6.2 presents statistics for coverage and demand for Latin America
countries.

Latin America displays an average demand gap of 48%, which means that less than
half of covered households are purchasing broadband subscriptions. As table 6.2
indicates, more extensive coverage results in a higher demand gap. These metrics,
typical of emerging countries, indicate that supply in Latin America does not appear
to be the dominant hurdle to increasing broadband penetration. They demonstrate,
rather, the criticality of demand stimulation strategies targeting either the
affordability or the awareness structural factors.

6.2.1.2. The mobile broadband demand gap:

Measuring the demand gap in mobile broadband presents methodological problems as
in the case of fixed broadband networks. First, it is generally agreed that policy
makers should consider 3G networks to be the technology benchmark when
measuring mobile broadband coverage. While 3.5G, HSPA, or LTE networks are the
obvious platforms to provide a relatively smooth Internet access experience, in
emerging country contexts, it is advisable to measure coverage once again at a
slightly lower speed, such as the one comprised by the whole WCDMA family1.

Secondly, the analogue concept to the “underserved” category in fixed broadband
exists in the case of mobile broadband as well: in this case, it is labeled the “gray”
zones. These represent the areas covered by wireless networks affected by either
capacity or signal propagation limitations. Again, while some national broadband
plans have been very emphatic about measuring these zones (see Germany’s National
Broadband Strategy), in the case of emerging countries, it might be convenient to set
this measurement aside for the next few years.

Thirdly, mobile broadband adoption needs to consider the device utilized to access
the Internet. The first category of devices includes, quite naturally, all modems that
can be relied upon to access the Internet from a PC, a laptop, or a netbook. These
devices include dongles, USB modems, and air cards. The integrated devices such as
tablets, and smartphones that provide adequate screen formats and interface to surf
the web, respond to emails, and access common web platforms such as Google,

1For example, when Japan implemented its (1) New IT Reform Strategy which was set in 2006 by IT
Strategic Headquarters (headed by the Prime Minister) and (2) Digital Divide Elimination Strategy
which was set in 2008 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs – both of which aimed to eliminate all
broadband zero areas by the end of FY2010 (March 2011), 3.5G was considered as broadband

                                                                                                    9
YouTube, or Facebook comprise the second category. This category would exclude
feature phones, which, by virtue of small screen formats and keyboards, have limited
broadband access ability. Horrigan’s (2012) pioneering work on the value of mobile
broadband to close the digital divide in the state of Illinois focuses on smartphone
adoption.

In light of these issues, how should mobile broadband coverage and adopters be
measured? Beyond shipment statistics and installed base for selected operators, the
number of subscribers that own an Internet suitable device connected to a 3G or
higher performance network is not readily accessible. On the other hand, the number
of 3G and 4G subscribers is easier to access. Therefore, it would be advisable to
gather those statistics to measure the mobile broadband demand gap. Mobile
broadband coverage should be measured in terms of 3G coverage, a metric provided
by the ITU or Wireless Intelligence. However, the estimates provided by these sites
are only presented at the national level, preventing a detailed regional analysis.

Table 6.3 presents statistics on mobile broadband demand gap for selected developed
countries.

As the table 6.3 indicates, with a few exceptions (Australia, Republic of Korea,
United States), the mobile broadband demand gap of countries studied is higher than
the fixed broadband demand gap. These numbers should be interpreted with the
caveat that the latter measures the household gap while the former measures
population.

In the case of emerging countries such as those of the Latin America region, the
mobile broadband demand gap is even higher (see table 6.4).

As table 6.4 indicates, the average demand gap in mobile broadband is 63%, which
means that 63% of the Latin American population could purchase a mobile broadband
connection but do not. This difference requires an analysis of the obstacles faced by
users to acquire broadband service. An understanding of such factors will allow
policy makers to deploy the relevant initiatives to tackle these obstacles. This is
addressed in sections 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 below.

6.2.1.3. Demand gap and the interrelationship between fixed and mobile
broadband:

Until now, we have treated the demand gap within fixed and mobile broadband as
two independent phenomena. This treatment is somewhat artificial since both
technologies are offered within adopters’ same universe. Naturally, each platform
meets specific requirements. Mobile broadband adds the mobility premium to the
Internet access experience. At the same time, at least for now, due to given
technology and shared resource limitations, mobile broadband networks are not the
most suitable platform to fulfill certain applications, like downloading movies or
playing massive parallel games. This factor notwithstanding, it is generally assumed
that, given their ease of deployment, mobile broadband networks are very appropriate
to fulfill coverage requirements in emerging countries. If that were to be the case,
how should policy makers think about the interplay between both platforms?

At the initial steps of diffusion processes, mobile broadband technology represents a
complementary technology to fixed broadband. The early adopter of mobile
broadband is, most likely, already a subscriber of fixed broadband. In this situation,
mobile broadband complements fixed broadband by providing the added value of
mobility. An example of this situation is that of Mexico (see figure 6.3.).

As the Mexican example indicates, mobile broadband subscribers through the end of
2010 were likely already fixed broadband customers belonging to high socio-
demographic segments for which mobile broadband represented an added value
proposition to meet their Internet connectivity needs.

However, the complementarity consumption pattern is not the only trend. In many
cases, especially in emerging countries, mobile broadband represents a substitute to
fixed broadband. This occurs under three situations: 1) when the fixed broadband
service is not being offered in the area where the customer resides, 2) when the
quality of fixed service is at a disadvantage with respect to the mobile offering (for
example, in terms of speed), 3) when the user decides to consolidate services to
reduce expenditures and acquires the mobile service that provides both connectivity
and mobility. It is important to mention that the last situation can occur in the context
where the applications and services to be accessed are interchangeable between the
two platforms. While this is possible, as it was mentioned above, there are services
that are better suited to the fixed technology and cannot be fully accessed by mobile
broadband. Additionally, a limiting factor of mobile broadband’s substitution power
is the prevalent pricing plans that institute caps on the amount of data subscribers can
download on a monthly basis.

The case of Bolivia is a good example of substitution of fixed broadband (see Figure
6.4).

Bolivia is a country that arrived fairly late to the Internet revolution. At the outset of
mobile broadband in the country, the adoption of the fixed platform had not reached
1%, a common scenario in many emerging countries. Not surprisingly, the high price
of the offering contributed to this limited adoption. At the second quarter of 2010, the
least expensive plan for a 2.5 Mbps download speed cost the equivalent of US$ 325.
That year, a wireless service providing broadband connectivity to a PC via a USB
modem was priced at the equivalent of US$ 16.38. The cross-elasticity of both
offerings resulted in a decline in the number of fixed broadband lines and a dramatic
increase in mobile broadband accesses, a classic case of substitution. The Bolivian
example could be quite applicable to the experience of other emerging countries.
In considering the substitution scenario to understand the broadband demand gap, it is
important to include in the broadband subscribers numbers those users who purchase
only mobile broadband service and add them to the customers who have acquired
fixed broadband. Therefore, the broadband demand gap that considers mobile
broadband subscriptions has to be quantified according to the following formula:


 Broadband Demand Gap = Broadband Coverage (C) – Broadband Subscriptions (S)

     C = Population covered by fixed and mobile broadband + Population covered
         only by fixed broadband + Population covered only by mobile broadband
     S = Subscribers of fixed and mobile broadband (complementarity) + Subscribers
         of only fixed broadband + Subscribers of only mobile broadband
         (substitution)


According to this formula, the precise estimation of the broadband demand gap
requires a solid understanding of parameters such as the degree of complementarity of
fixed and mobile platforms, to avoid double counting of mobile and fixed subscribers.
Unfortunately, this type of statistic does not exist for the time being, which obliges
the policy maker to continue relying on demand gap assessment by technology. Some

                                                                                                            13
countries are currently conducting field research aimed at evaluating the degree to
which both technologies complement or substitute each other. As was discussed
above, the answer will depend on geography and socio-demographic segment. The
first results of such a research are being generated primarily in developed countries.
Horrigan (2012) recently published the results of survey research conducted in the
state of Illinois testing the hypothesis of mobile broadband contributing to closing the
digital divide. The results indicated the existence of only a small portion of
households accessing the Internet through mobile platforms: of 86% of at-home
broadband subscribers, 53% had fixed broadband and smartphones, 26% had only
fixed broadband, and only 7% had only smartphones. The interesting finding is that
the 7% of subscribers that accessed the Internet only through smartphones tended to
have a low income (below $20,000), lower education than the general population and
lived in rural areas. While the activities these users conduct on the Internet are less
intense than those that have both fixed and mobile broadband, one could argue that
the latter contributes to some extent to close the digital divide.

A similar conclusion was formulated by Bohlin (2011), who estimated in his study of
Sweden broadband that the probability of using mobile broadband tends to increase if
the respondent is aged 35 years or less, and has low income.

The primary caveat is that both studies were conducted in an environment of widely
diffused fixed broadband. In emerging country settings, with less fixed broadband
coverage, the substitution power of mobile broadband could be much larger.

6.2.2. Understanding the residential broadband demand gap:

Once the broadband demand gap is quantified, policy makers need to understand the
factors driving that gap. In this section, the obstacles and drivers of the residential
demand gap will be first reviewed. At its conclusion, the same approach will be
followed for the enterprise side, focusing primarily on small and medium enterprises.

To reiterate, the primary topic in this section is the adoption gap. An adoption gap is
found in places where broadband infrastructure is in place but often underutilized.
This is a typical low demand case that reflects a low desirability for the services
offered or a relatively high cost of ownership. The broadband demand gap can be the
result of multiple factors. In fact, the obstacles could be different by region of the
country, and by socio-demographic group.

Research on the variables affecting broadband diffusion is quite extensive. For
example, Hauge and Prieger (2010) point out that income, educational level of the
head of household, and household age composition are the main predictors of
broadband adoption. Other studies mention variables that are more specific to
countries or regions. Navarro and Sanchez (2011) indicate that, ceteris paribus,
gender is a strong predictor in Latin America, where females are 6% less likely to
adopt broadband. In the United States, several studies underscore the importance of
factors such as ethnicity and mastery of the English language (Ono and Zavodny,
2008; NTIA, 2011). Other factors such as the location of potential subscribers (rural
versus urban), the presence of school children in the household, and the penetration of
broadband in the location where the potential adopter resides are also important


                                                                                     14
factors driving Internet adoption (see Chaudhuri and Flamm, 2005; Vicente and
Lopez, 2006; Grazzi and Vergara, 2011).

At the highest level of analysis, the residential broadband demand gap is the result of
three obstacles:

        Limited affordability: certain portions of the population either cannot acquire
         a device or purchase the subscription needed to access the Internet
        Limited awareness of the potential of the service or lack of digital literacy
        Lack of relevance or interest: the value proposition of applications, services,
         and content does not fulfill a need of the adopting population

Each of these three obstacles are driven by one or a combination of four structural
variables:

        Income levels: the socio-demographic group, measured by income, does not
         only influence the affordability barrier, but is also correlated with limited
         awareness and lack of relevance
        Education levels: the education attained by the potential user influences the
         degree of digital literacy and is related to interest in accessing the Internet
        Age: similarly, the age variable is inversely related to digital literacy and
         content relevance
        Ethnicity: as a result of linguistic and/or cultural structural factors, ethnic
         group belonging can impact the level of interest in accessing the Internet

These relationships have been depicted in figure 6.5.

The research literature has also studied the role played by other structural variables,
such as gender. For example, a gender gap was detected in some countries (see
Universidad Alberto Hurtado, 2009 for Chile; INEI, 2012 for Peru; and Rectoria de
Telecomunicaciones, 2011 for Costa Rica). However, research by Hilbert (2011) has
indicated that the gender gap disappears when control variables such as income and

                                                                                     15
education are included in the analysis. Furthermore, research conducted in Asia by
the Korea Network Information Center (KANIC) show that the gender composition
of Internet users has shifted toward equality from 33% female in 1999 to 45% female
in 2002. In consequence, the gender variable has been excluded from the following
analysis. This does not exclude the viability of gender-based policy initiatives for
having a positive contribution to stimulating adoption (these will be reviewed in
section 6.3.12)2.

The following section will explain each of the three obstacles - affordability,
awareness, and relevance – and link them back to the structural variables. In each
section, studies and data regarding the obstacles and driving variables in developed
and emerging countries are presented.

6.2.2.1. The affordability barrier:

The economic barrier remains a key factor in limiting broadband adoption. However,
it would seem that in developed countries with higher household incomes, the
economic barrier takes second seat to either low digital literacy or cultural
inadequacy.

In the United States, broadband non-adopters amount to 22% of households (34.6
million). Within this group, the head of household is older than 65 years old (30%),
has not completed high school studies, belongs to a household with less than US$
30,000 income (41%), and has a limited understanding the English language (Pew
Center, 2012). In a study by the National Telecommunications and Information
Agency (NTIA, 2011) researching the reasons of non-adoption, 24% of respondents
mentioned affordability of either devices or service. If the household already had a
PC, 37% of respondents mentioned broadband affordability as a barrier. Conversely,
the households that did not have either a PC or broadband amounted to 21%.
Consequently, in the United States, if a household already has a computer, broadband
affordability becomes an important adoption barrier. In a statistic close to that of the
United States, a 2009 survey among Australia’s non-adopters showed cost to be the
most common deterrent cited amongst Australian non-adopters: 26% of respondents
reported that it was too expensive (Australian Government Information Management
Office, 2009).

In Spain, another developed country, a study (ONTSI, 2011) indicated that of the 7
million non-adopting households, 42% indicated affordability as a primary barrier to
adoption. The distribution of this population is, not surprisingly, tilted towards
households of the lower socio-demographic segments. For example, 52% of
households with income of less than 1,100 Euros mention affordability as a primary
barrier; that percentage decreases to 16% among households with incomes higher
than 2,700 Euros.

In the United Kingdom, of the 24% of non-adopting households, only 16% mentioned
the affordability barrier, while 66% mentioned lack of perceived content relevance. In
a similar study conducted in 2010, the percentage citing cost as an obstacle to

gender divide still needs to be addressed. Please see "Digital literacy for Women" section (currently,
Page 65 of the World development Report).

                                                                                                     16
adoption was 23%. This statistic suggests that as prices decrease, digital literacy and
relevance structural factors (to be discussed in the next section) have more of an
impact.

Moving now to emerging countries, the importance of affordability increases among
the reasons mentioned for non-adoption. For example, in a household ICT survey
conducted in Brazil, 48% of non-adopters of broadband mentioned cost as being the
dominant reason (CGI, 2012). In research conducted as part of the National
Household Survey, 60% of Mexican households with no computer and no broadband
connection mentioned cost of access as the dominant reason (INEGI, 2010). In Chile,
the number was slightly less: 37% (Subtel, 2009), while in Costa Rica, it was 60%
(MINAET, 2011). The percentage mentioning affordability as the dominant reason in
Chile was quite close to households surveyed in Colombia: 39.9% (MITIC, 2010). In
Puerto Rico, 16% of non-adopters mentioned price as being too high (Puerto Rico
Broadband Task Force, 2012).

Research conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa indicates that while availability does play
a role in this difference in uptake, the cost of broadband services in the region is
prohibitively high. In 2006, the average price for basic broadband in Sub-Saharan
Africa was US$ 366 per month, when in India the average rate ran from $6 - $44 per
month (Williams, 2010).3 In much of Europe, these rates ranged from $12 - $40 per
month.

Not surprisingly, a 2011 study demonstrated that many of the countries with low
broadband adoption rates were the same countries with the highest annual costs for
broadband per gross national income (Point Topic, 2011). 4 This list of countries
included Kenya, where the average annual cost for broadband amounted to 79.25% of
gross national income. In comparison, the cost of broadband access in Switzerland –
which ranks amongst the top 10 countries in the world in terms of broadband
penetration – amounted to a mere .07% of gross national income.

A compilation of all the statistics reviewed above indicates that affordability remains
a preeminent variable in explaining the non-adoption of broadband, particularly in
emerging countries (see table 6.5).

           As the data in table 6.5 suggests, the lower the level of disposable income, the higher
           the importance of the affordability barrier becomes. This conclusion is supported as
           well by the penetration of broadband by decile of the socio-demographic pyramid.

           The statistics of table 6.6 confirm the disparity regarding broadband adoption
           between the top three deciles and the three bottom deciles of the socio-demographic
           pyramid. While the difference between the bottom and top of the socio-demographic
           pyramid is smaller in emerging countries, that is due to the overall lower penetration
           of broadband in these economies (see table 6.7.).

This conclusion for emerging economies is further supported in studies conducted at
the country level. For example, in research conducted by the Costa Rican
government, in households with a monthly income higher than 750,000 Colones
(local currency), computer and fixed broadband adoption exceeds 80%; in households
with incomes lower than 750,000 Colones, the adoption of both technologies
decreases to 60% and under (see figure 6.6).

Since the penetration in the bottom of the socio-demographic pyramid is highly
correlated with the average household income and the GDP per capita of a given
country, it is expected that nations that undergo rapid economic growth or implement
poverty-reduction programs would witness a reduction in the broadband affordability
gap. Brazil is a clear example of this effect (see figure 6.9).



                                                                                        21

While figure 6.9 confirms the wide disparity between socio-economic level A and the
lower segments D and E, it also depicts the emergence of the middle class (segment
C), which has more than doubled broadband adoption in four years from 16% to 35%.

However, if the economy does not grow or no poverty reduction programs have been
actively implemented, the affordability broadband gap tends to increase. For example,
in Mexico the increase in broadband penetration has been significant within the
higher deciles (VIII to X) between 2008 and 2010 while rates stagnated amongst the
lower tiers, therefore accentuating the socio-demographic digital divide (see figure
6.10).

  Figure 6.10. Mexico: Household Internet Adoption (by income decile) (2008-

In conclusion, the evidence collected both at the aggregate and country level confirms
the importance of the affordability variable in explaining a substantial portion of the
broadband demand gap. In this context, two policy levers are particularly relevant to
affect this dimension of the digital divide. At a macro-economic level, all programs
aimed at reducing poverty levels (such as the ones implemented in many countries of
Latin America, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela) will, without doubt, have
an impact in reducing the demand gap. At the ICT sector level, policies aimed at
reducing the pricing of services will necessarily stimulate adoption. The types of
programs that could be put in place and their expected impact will be reviewed in
Section 6.4.

6.2.2.2. Limited digital literacy

Beyond the affordability barrier, lack of digital literacy can explain a portion of the
demand gap. Digital literacy is the ability to navigate, evaluate, and create
information effectively and critically using a range of digital technologies. Digital
literacy encompasses all devices, such as computer hardware, software, the Internet,
and cellphones. Research around digital literacy is concerned not just with being
literate at using a computer, but also with wider aspects associated with learning how
to find, use, summarize, evaluate, create, and communicate information effectively
while using digital technologies. Digital literacy does not replace traditional forms of
literacy; it builds upon the foundation of traditional forms of literacy.

The digital literacy barrier has been identified in numerous surveys attempting to
explain broadband non-adoption. For example, in the United States (Horrigan, 2009),
13% of non-adopting households mentioned difficulty of use as a major barrier for
adopting broadband. This answer comprised different reasons for difficulty (lack of
training, age, physical handicap such as being visually impaired). In Spain, digital
illiteracy amounted to 29% of the broadband non-adopting households (ONTSI,
2012). This number is close to the one reported by non-adopters in Puerto Rico
(31%), which explained their behavior by saying that “they do not need broadband or
the Internet” (PRBT, 2012). In the United Kingdom, lack of digital ability was only
cited by 4% of non-adopting households (OFCOM, 2012). This metric is close to the
results of a comparable Australian survey, where 7% of non-adopters found “the
Internet to be too complicated” (AGIMO, 2009). In the Colombian research cited
above, 8.6% of households surveyed responded that they did not know how to use
computers as an explanation for not adopting broadband (MTIC, 2010).

As indicated in the figure 6.4 above, limited digital literacy is determined primarily
by two structural variables: education level and age. In addition, income level (as
correlated with education level) remains a contributing factor. However, digital
illiteracy could be particularly high in certain socio-demographic groups, such as the
elderly, the unemployed, the disabled, certain female groups, etc.

Broadband, digital literacy, and education:

The first indication that educational level and broadband adoption were intrinsically
linked was found when comparing country broadband demand gap and household
education across countries. For example, the Republic of Korea has one of the lowest
broadband demand gaps in the world: 93% of households have adopted broadband,
which would indicate an adoption gap of 7% (given the 100% coverage level). On

                                                                                     23
average, Korean citizens complete an additional year of education compared to
citizens in Japan and the United States. Additionally, Korean households have 50%
more aggregate years of education than households in the United States. This statistic
would suggest a correlation between education and broadband adoption.

Further research confirmed this initial evidence. For example, in Costa Rica,
broadband adoption doubles when the head of household has completed high school
(see figure 6.11).

As figure 6.11 indicates, while computer ownership increases substantially after the
head of household completes primary schooling, broadband adoption jumps after
some years of secondary schooling have been fulfilled. This fact would indicate that,
beyond the general influence of the education level variable, affordability plays a
stronger role (considering that schooling and income are correlated) in the case of
broadband subscription than in terms of purchasing a computer. The combined impact
of household income and level of education in the Costa Rican study can be clearly
visualized in figure 6.12.

As the data in figure 6.12 indicate, the overall direct relationship between household
income and fixed broadband adoption is clear. One exception to this trend is seen in
second decile households where the head has a tertiary education: in this case,
adoption is significantly higher than households below the eighth decile. This
anomaly could be explained by the existence of households where the head is a recent
university graduate who has not yet been able to earn an income commensurate to his
or her educational achievement.

Beyond the direct relationship between income and broadband adoption, the influence
of education is quite relevant. Particularly, above the sixth decile (where affordability
represents less of a barrier), education becomes a determining factor. The higher the
educational achievement of the head of household, the higher broadband adoption is.

The importance of education in explaining broadband adoption has also been detected
in a study in Chile (see figure 6.13).

The study of the education variable reveals the complex interrelationship it has with
the affordability factor. At lower income levels, the affordability variable is stronger
than the educational in predicting adoption. On the other hand, at income levels
higher than the sixth decile, demand is less elastic to income, and educational
achievement becomes preeminent.

Again, from a policy perspective, despite the importance of sector specific initiatives
such as digital literacy programs, classical education programs will ultimately have a
contribution to stimulating broadband demand.


                                                                                                                                                               26
Broadband, digital literacy, and age:

Studies conducted in the developed world have all pointed out the existence of a
generation gap linked to limited digital literacy. In the United Kingdom and the
United States, the average age of a non-adopting household is over 65 years old
(OFCOM, 2012).

Research in the emerging world suggests the existence of a threshold of 30 years old,
after which Internet use tends to decline significantly. For example, in Chile the
percentage of non-adopters doubles after 30 years old (Universidad Alberto Hurtado,
2009). In Peru, the percentage of Internet users within the 19 to 24-age bracket is
61%, compared to 37% amongst the 25-40 cohort (INEI, 2012). In Brazil, the
percentage of Internet adopters 24 years old or younger is 81%, compared to 48%
amongst the 35-44 age group.

In Costa Rica, the adoption of fixed broadband tends to decline significantly after 45
years old (see figure 6.15).

The difference between the 30-year threshold for Internet usage and persisting
broadband penetration at the 35-44 bracket is explained by the presence of children in
the household. Children tend to act as change agents in a household, stimulating
Internet usage and sustaining broadband adoption. This indirect influence cancels
some of the generational gap identified in numerous studies. In the case of Chile, the
presence of children in the household increases the probability of acquiring a
broadband subscription from 39% to 43% (Universidad Alberto Hurtado, 2009). In
Peru, the probability increases from 43% to 57% (INEI, 2012). In Costa Rica, the
effect was not general across ages, but when controlling for income and education,
the presence of children as a stimulus for adoption becomes very strong in households
where the head has a low level of education.

In Puerto Rico, survey data confirms this trend. Broadband adoption drops 14
percentage points after 54 years old (see figure 6.16).

                                                                                   27

The digital literacy generational gap poses more serious problems for some countries
than others. Asian countries like Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, for instance, have
some of the world’s fastest growing aging populations. Even in these countries,
seniors appear resistant to broadband use and adoption. Research suggests that
governments and institutions could potentially change this trend by focusing on the
socialization of technology to make it more widespread throughout this demographic
(Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 2011).5

6.2.2.3. Lack of content relevance or interest:

Since broadband is a platform used to access Internet content, applications, and
services, the relevance of such content offers an incentive to purchase a subscription.
Conversely, the lack of cultural relevance could serve as a barrier to adoption.
Cultural relevance could be conceptualized either in terms of content suited to the
interests of the adopting population or in terms of language used for interacting with
applications/services or consuming content.

The relevance dimension has been identified in several studies in the developed
world. For example, Horrigan (2009) estimated that, according to his survey, 50% of
non-broadband households linked non-adoption to “lack of relevance/interest.” In the
survey, lack of relevance was driven by “no interest”, “busy conducting other tasks”,
or other unspecified reasons. Interestingly enough, the percentage of non-adopting
households citing lack of relevance (50%) was higher than the percentage citing
affordability (35%). In a study conducted in 2011, the non-broadband adopting
households that provided the “lack of relevance” explanation only decreased to 47%,
while affordability dropped to 24% (NTIA, 2011). When disaggregating non-
broadband households between those that have or do not own a computer, “lack of
relevance” jumps to 52%, and affordability drops to 21%.

                                                                                    28
“Lack of relevance” consistently outranks affordability structural factors in most
studies conducted in developed nations. For example, in a study conducted in the
United Kingdom in 2011 (OFCOM, 2012), 66% of non-adopting households said
“lack of relevance” explained their decision not to purchase a broadband service.
Again, this percentage was substantially less than those households that alluded to the
affordability barrier (16%). Interestingly enough, in a similar study conducted in 2010
(OFCOM, 2011), the affordability barrier was mentioned by 23% of households
surveyed. This suggests that, as prices for broadband service decline, the cultural
relevance factor gains in importance. In other words, from a policy standpoint, once
the economic obstacles are tackled and affordability becomes less of an explanatory
factor of non-adoption, the lack of relevance or interest variable gains weight. In the
case of Australia, affordability (26%) was somewhat more important than lack of
relevance (19%) (AGIMO, 2009).

As expected, lack of relevance as a barrier in developed countries is prevalent in very
circumscribed socio-demographic categories. In the United Kingdom, the non-
broadband households that cite lack of relevance tend to be lower income households
with people over 65 years old. In a study conducted in Spain (ONTSI, 2012), lack of
relevance of Internet content is inversely proportional to income levels (see figure
6.17).

In at least one study conducted in a developed country, the linguistic factor
contributed to the lack of relevance. That was identified in the United States among
the Hispanic population that had recently immigrated to the country. It is important to
consider, however, that, as in the United States, the linguistic barrier is strongly
correlated with economic and educational factors. Therefore, it is still difficult to
tease out the socio-demographic variables in order to isolate the linguistic factors.

The language barrier has been identified in the emerging world as well. For example,
in Peru, only 8% of those individuals whose first language was not Spanish are
Internet users. That percentage increased to 40% amongst native Spanish-speakers. In
the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region, the relatively low availability of

                                                                                              29
native-language content is cited as a major challenge to broadband demand
(Broadband Strategies Toolkit Chapter 7). Focusing on the development of local-
language digital content may be the key to increasing the uptake of broadband in
these instances. This issue will be discussed at length in chapter 6.6.

Beyond language, lack of content relevance remains a strong variable influencing
non-adoption. For example, in Colombia, 20% of non-broadband households justified
their behavior explaining that they did not view the Internet “as being necessary”.
(MITIC, 2010).

The lack of relevance variable presents some complexity in terms of its
understanding. Two interpretation options are open to policy makers. One option is
that the consumer has evaluated the offerings in terms of applications, services and
content and has not found them relevant to his/her needs. Under this premise, policy
initiatives should be oriented towards increasing the perceived value of broadband by
expanding the range and utility of offerings (these are called “demand pull” policies).
The second option is that the consumer does not have enough information to make a
decision of adopting broadband. The policy implication in this case is that the
consumer needs to be made aware of the potential of the technology (called
“awareness” policies).

6.2.2.4. Broadband diffusion cycles and the importance of adoption structural
factors

The importance and weight of each of the three residential demand structural factors
– affordability, awareness and relevance – is not homogeneous across the broadband
diffusion cycle. Some are more important than others, depending on the level of
adoption of the technology. This is a critical concept that needs to be understood
before deploying stimulation policies.

The studies of both fixed and wireless broadband adoption in developed countries
would indicate that residential broadband adoption tends to proceed along three
clearly defined stages (see table 6.8).

                       Table 6.8. Stages of Broadband Adoption
                              Stage 1              Stage 2               Stage 3

In stage 1, at lower levels of adoption, the factor constraining penetration is supply-
driven. Price does not play a significant role because the first group of adopters is
relatively price insensitive. In his research on broadband adoption, Varian (2002)
found that the first group of subscribers is fairly price insensitive, while the next
generation exhibits an elasticity of demand between -1.3 and -3.1. The second

                                                                                      30
variable affecting broadband adoption is device availability. For example, Chinn and
Fairlie (2004) found in their study of Internet usage in 161 countries between 1999
and 2001 that the main factors affecting adoption are possession of a computer and
awareness of benefits. That finding is confirmed by Ono and Zavodny (2007) who
found, by relying on microdata for United States from 1997 to 2003, that the
possession of a computer to use Internet remains the main barrier. Vicente & Lopez
(2006) obtained a similar result for Europe using data for 15 countries in 2002.

In stage 2, beyond a coverage tipping point, the most important, variable driving
penetration is affordability. When Chinn and Fairlie (2006) extended their study up to
2004, they found that the price of the service started to be relevant in the explanation
of the levels of Internet adoption. When affordability becomes a more important
barrier, elasticity coefficients increase dramatically. For example, using survey data
from 100,000 households in the United States, Goolsbee (2002) found that in areas
where service is available to a majority of households, a decline in broadband prices
of 10% yields an increase in penetration ranging between 21.50% and 37.60% (with a
mean value of 26.50%). A similar price reduction in areas where the service is not
available to a majority of consumers would result in an increase in penetration
ranging between 15% and 30%. There are three reasons why elasticity is higher in
areas with full service coverage. First, in areas with partial coverage, early adopters
are less sensitive to prices and therefore, demand is inelastic. Second, in areas with
full coverage, consumers have the opportunity of observing the benefit broadband
generates, and they are willing to engage in cost/benefit analysis, whereby any
reduction in pricing would increase the consumer surplus. Third, in areas with full
broadband coverage, another dimension to be factored in the cost/benefit analysis
consumers conduct is the one related to network effects.

The importance of the affordability barrier in Stage 2 is also confirmed by Rappoport
et al. (2002). In a survey of 5,225 urban households in the United States, the authors
determined that a 10% price reduction of broadband would yield an increment of
14.91% in service adoption. Extending the analysis to the OECD countries between
2003 and 2008, Lee et al. (2011) found that 10% price reduction of broadband results
in a 15.80% increase in penetration. In this last research, the impact of price reduction
begins to diminish relative to earlier studies, anticipating the transition to next stage.

In Stage 3, at higher penetration levels, price elasticity coefficients start to diminish.
In their study of price elasticity in the United States between 2005 and 2008, Dutz et
al. (2009) observed that coefficients declined from -1.53 in 2005 to -0.69 in 2008.
Coincidently, Cadman and Dineen (2008) estimated elasticity coefficients for OECD
countries in 2007 to be -0.43. This could be due to a shift in consumers perceptions as
to the value of broadband (and consequently willingness to pay) from “luxury” to
“necessity”. On the other hand, because of diminishing importance in the
affordability barrier to adoption, as reviewed in the survey data above, structural
factors related to limited digital literacy and cultural relevance take precedence.

Consequently, according to the research conducted up to now, the evidence regarding
broadband adoption structural factors is conceptualized as follows (see figure 6.18).

              Reaching Advanced Stages of Broadband Penetration

In Stage 1, the primary lever to foster adoption is service coverage. In Stage 2,
affordability becomes the most important barrier, although digital literacy and
cultural relevance begin to assume greater prevalence. In Stage 3, at higher
penetration levels, price sensitivity becomes secondary, and the most important
adoption barrier remains digital literacy and cultural relevance.

Moving to emerging countries, initial evidence produced by Galperin and Ruzzier
(2011) confirms that regions whose penetration is within stage 2 (3%-20%) exhibit
high elasticity. OECD countries, with an average penetration of 27.48% have a price
elasticity of -0.53, while Latin American countries (average penetration of 7.66% in
2011) have an elasticity of -1.88.

While there is still not evidence available, two factors could change the sequential
pattern of adoption structural factors outlined above. First, as a result of the
increasing adoption of mobile broadband enabled devices and the deployment of 3G
and 4G networks, the structural factors of Stage 1 could shorten up significantly,
rapidly putting countries in the need to tackle the affordability barrier. Secondly, the
increasing availability of applications and services could enhance the willingness to
pay of consumers, thereby altering the consumer surplus equation and reducing the
elasticity coefficients. This could be an important factor in many emerging countries.

A final note should be made that, while the generic evolution model presented above
is one follow by a large number of countries, in some contexts residential broadband
adoption may skip Stage 1 and start directly from Stage 2 or skip Stage 1 & 2 and
start directly from Stage 3. For example, in Japan, when DSL service started from
scratch in areas only with dial-up connection, some ISPs experienced a jump-start in
penetration rate of between 10 and 20%.

6.2.3. Understanding the enterprise broadband demand gap

The structural factors and adoption obstacles of broadband among enterprises are
different than those variables constraining diffusion among individual consumers.
Notwithstanding the fact that broadband technology is a production factor with a

                                                                                                                32
      positive contribution to the efficiency of business operations, small and medium
      businesses (especially microenterprises) in emerging economies have faced some
      broadband adoption impediments. Kotelnikov (2007) has defined four stages of ICT
      adoption within the small and medium business universe. Those stages are depicted in
      table 6.9.

      These four stages should not be considered in a static fashion, particularly in light of
      technological progress and pricing reductions. Nevertheless, data would support the
      notion that, particularly in emerging markets, these four stages remain a fairly
      common development path. This is illustrated by the still limited adoption of
      broadband within SMEs. Furthermore, while in many cases small businesses rely on
      the Internet, they do so in shared facilities as opposed to on their own business
      premises (see table 6.10).

Note: Due to the fact that the sources and methodologies for estimating these statistics are not
consistent, data in this chart should not be compared across countries.

At the outset, the nature of the business of SMEs, especially micro-enterprises,
explains the lack of broadband adoption. Katz (2009) argues that SMEs can be
grouped in three categories, each of which has a different need for broadband
services:

       “International” SMEs: regardless of their size, these units need broadband to
        gain access to international markets, deal with their supply chain, and support
        their logistics




                                                                                             34
       SMEs supplying large enterprises: as part of the supply chain of large firms,
        these SMEs require broadband to receive orders, process payments, and
        provide delivery information6
       SMEs operating in low value added industry sectors, primarily services: these
        firms have a low compelling need to purchase broadband since the nature of
        their business does not require the type of transactions mentioned in the other
        two categories.

Considering that the last category comprises a large portion of the SME population in
emerging economies, it is natural to expect a delay in the adoption of broadband
among small enterprises.

However, beyond this structural factor, other reasons explain the low level of
broadband adoption, including limited access to investment capital, comparatively
high technology costs, and lack of training. Regarding capital investment and
monthly service costs, it is important to note that a significant proportion of SMEs do
not receive fixed monthly income because they operate outside of the formal
economy of emerging countries. Their income is generally daily or weekly and is
dependent upon the type of labor performed; thus they cannot borrow long-term or
purchase products that require a fixed monthly payment such as PCs, servers or
Internet access. These enterprises are generally forced to use prepaid wireless,
Internet booths, or cybercafés, and rented PCs.

Secondly, many of the entrepreneurs that run SMEs (which are primarily
microenterprises in emerging countries) have a very limited level of technological
training. A large number of SME owners in these economies face a generational gap
by not receiving Internet technology exposure growing up. Therefore, they lack the
necessary training to operate a computer or use broadband to improve business
efficiency. This lack of education translates into the anxiety of using technology and
ignorance of its capability to create economic value. Another related obstacle facing
SMEs is the limited availability and retention of skilled ICT workforce, particularly
in emerging markets. Because of the systemic shortage of technical personnel, large
companies offer wages to graduates of higher education that SMEs cannot match.
Even when SMEs manage to hire graduates, retention rates are very low.

Broadband adoption by SMEs is also limited by the lag required to make the
necessary organizational and business process changes to assimilate broadband and
data transmission technologies. In general terms, SMEs (particularly in emerging
countries) tend to restrict the use of ICT to accounting and finance, while neglecting
its application to production processes. A survey by the Chilean Ministry of Economy
found that only 2.6% of Chilean companies used ICT to increase the efficiency of
business processes other than accounting and finance. Yet, the survey made an even
more worrisome observation: 80% of companies reported they did not implement ICT
in areas other than finance and accounting because they lacked the technological
expertise necessary to understand its benefits.



6 A particular case of SMNEs refers to start-ups initiated by an incubator program. See below in
section 6.3.4.3.

                                                                                               35
In sum, beyond the composition of the SME sector, which might structurally
constrain the need to adopt broadband, the enterprise broadband demand gap is the
result of three obstacles:

        Limited affordability: certain portions of the SME space either cannot
         acquire a device or purchase the subscription needed to access the Internet
        Limited technology training constrains the ability to purchase and effectively
         introduce broadband in the firm
        The assimilation of broadband to render efficiency gains in the small
         business requires the introduction of changes in organization, business
         processes and even use of IT, all tasks that are well beyond the scope of
         expertise of small business management

These relationships have been depicted in figure 6.19.

                                                         business processes

Recognizing the benefits broadband holds for SMEs will have additional positive
macro-level effects on the country beyond just penetration rates. Indian SMEs, for
instance, spent a combined US$ 9.9 million on the IT sector in 2009 alone, and this
spending was attributed to the increased demand for high speed Internet and
broadband (Access Markets International, 2010)7. Many of the firms also invested in
hiring more employees to utilize this technology and industries such as e-commerce
boomed.

The following section will explain each of the three obstacles - affordability, training,
and assimilation. Each section presents studies and data regarding the obstacles and
driving variables in developed and emerging countries alike.

6.2.3.1. The economic barrier:

12259.html

                                                                                      36
As mentioned above, the affordability barrier is not only important for individual
consumers but also relevant in the case of SMEs, although this variable tends to be
more important in the case of microenterprises.

In a survey conducted in Colombia among SMEs, 12.9% of surveyed firms indicated
that they did not have the economic means to pay for broadband service, while 9.3%
would like to buy broadband because of its utility, but found the service pricing to be
too high. While the research does not break down the answers by size of firm,
broadband adoption numbers help determine that most of the firms mentioning
affordability as a barrier are concentrated among microenterprises: broadband
penetration among firms with 11-50 employees is 79%, while adoption among firms
with less than 11 employees is only 7% (National Department of Statistics, 2010).

6.2.3.2 Limited technology training:

The difficulties encountered in recruiting staff with technical skills to select,
purchase, and operate ICT infrastructure serves as a critical limitation for adopting
broadband. This factor was measured in a survey regarding the difficulty to recruit
ICT trained personnel conducted among SME managers in Latin America (see figure
6.20).

As figure 6.20 indicates, the recruiting constraint is particularly acute in Argentina
and Brazil. Katz (2009) also identified the problem in field research conducted in
other countries such as Uruguay and Chile. The constraint in recruiting technical
personnel is due to the fact that the educational system does not generate enough
graduates in ICT-related disciplines. In that context, salary inflation “prices out”
SMEs when it comes to attracting graduates, which end up working for large
enterprises.

In developing countries, the problem is not exclusive to smaller businesses. South
Africa faces a similar situation. In 2012, the country reported an unemployment rate
of 25%, with more than 4.2 million adult citizens actively searching for employment
to no avail. While the government attempted to address the situation by “creating

                                                                                                           37
jobs,” a more in-depth analysis demonstrated that a lack of qualified workers
contributed more to the problem than did a lack of available jobs. In fact, the
country’s organizations reported more than 800,000 vacant positions, the majority of
which were found in high-skilled industries such as information technology,
engineering, and finance.

A 2012 survey of Malaysian CIOs concluded that the low digital literacy skills of
organization executives negatively impacted business capabilities (Vanson Bourne,
2012).8 The CIOs “feared senior-level digital illiteracy is causing a lack of market
responsiveness, missed business and investment opportunities, poor competitiveness
and slower time to market.” This sentiment was felt across many Asian markets,
where business leaders appeared to fall behind their peers in more developed
economies.

6.2.3.3 Slow assimilation of broadband:

In order to increase efficiency and output, the adoption of information and
communication technologies by enterprises requires the introduction of a number of
processes and organizational changes. These changes, as well as training and other
cultural factors (such as entrepreneurial spirit, willingness to take risks in an
organizational transformation), are referred to as the “accumulation of intangible
capital.”9 Broadband alone does not have an economic impact. It rather enables the
adoption of e-business processes that result in increased efficiency (such as
streamlined access to raw materials and management of the supply chain, or better
market access). Intangible capital accumulation and the adoption of e-business
processes delay the full economic impact of broadband.

This gradual process of technology adoption and assimilation can be studied in the
aggregate for economies as a whole. Certain companies, by virtue of the
innovativeness of their management and their willingness to transform their
enterprises, are the leaders that will initially reap the benefits of ICT.

The second wave of adoption is concentrated on industrial sectors whose structure
and value chains tend to generate higher transaction costs. These network-oriented
industries offer financial services, transportation, or retail distribution. In these
industries, complexity costs are so high that, in addition to increasing the number of
information workers, they need to adopt technology to improve their productivity.
This wave represents a move from firm-related adoption drivers to industry structure
and economics. It is only in those economies that Jorgenson calls “IT intensive”,
where the concentration of industrial sectors more prone to adopt ICT is higher, that
we can see the macro-impact of ICT on productivity.

Small and medium enterprises tend to adopt broadband in the third wave, after they
have been able to make the necessary process and organizational changes needed to
assimilate broadband-enabled applications. In light of this effect, these firms will
naturally lag in the assimilation of broadband technology. The public policy
implications of this effect cannot be understated. To achieve full economic benefit of

broadband deployment, governments need to emphasize the implementation of
training programs and, in the case of SMEs, offer consulting services that help firms
capture the full benefit of the technology.

6.2.4 Broadband Demand Gap Diagnostic

A diagnostic of broadband demand obstacles needs to precede the formulation of
suitable policies. Building on the concepts presented above, the development of
broadband demand stimulation policies needs to begin by conducting a diagnostic of
the demand gap. This should follow a structured methodology tackling the following
questions:

      Quantification of the residential demand gap
          o What is the coverage of fixed and mobile broadband services (portion
              of the population served or unserved)?
          o What is the percentage of the population served by both fixed and
              mobile platforms?
          o What portion of the population by administrative unit (such as
              departments or counties) purchases both fixed and mobile services
              (complementarity effect)?
          o What portion of the population purchases only mobile broadband
              services (PC connectivity devices, smartphones) (substitution effect)?
          o What portion of the population is served by fixed broadband and do
              not acquire a subscription?
          o What portion of the population is served by mobile broadband
              exclusively and do not acquire a broadband plan?

      Socio-demographic analysis of the residential demand gap
          o What is the profile of non adopters (by age, income level, education,
              gender, ethnic group)
          o Disaggregation of non-adopting population by region and
              administrative unit

      Quantification of the enterprise demand gap
          o What is the percentage of enterprises (primarily SMEs served by both
              fixed and mobile platforms?
          o What portion of the enterprises by administrative unit (such as
              departments or counties) purchases both fixed and mobile services
              (complementarity effect)?
          o What portion of the enterprises purchases only mobile broadband
              services (PC connectivity devices, smartphones)?
          o What portion of the enterprises is served by fixed broadband and do
              not acquire a subscription?
          o What portion of the enterprises is served by mobile broadband
              exclusively and does not acquire a broadband plan?

      Firm level analysis of the residential demand gap
          o What is the profile of non adopting enterprises (by size, and industrial
              sector)
          o Disaggregation of non-adopting enterprises by region

                                                                                  39
By answering these questions, policy makers will be able to develop a diagnostic of
the broadband demand gap. With this diagnostic, policy makers need to start devising
appropriate demand stimulation policies. The different examples of policy initiatives
are reviewed in the following sections.




6.3.   CREATING AWARENESS

                                                                                  40
In section 6.2 the structural factors constraining broadband adoption were reviewed
for both the residential and enterprise spaces. This section first focuses on a specific
adoption obstacle for residential subscribers: limited digital literacy. Addressing this
obstacle requires the implementation of programs that build an understanding of the
service offerings. However, building awareness requires building user confidence,
explaining the benefits of use, and understanding security and privacy constraints as
well. As a result, four types of initiatives, targeting digital literacy impediments will
be reviewed (see figure 6.21).

       Figure 6.21. Awareness Promotion Initiatives in Residential Broadband




        Digital literacy through education programs entail the inclusion of specific
         programs at all levels of the formal education system, requiring also the
         implementation of training programs for teachers
        Targeted digital literacy interventions comprise the implementation of
         programs addressed to specific segments of the population, such as the
         elderly, the disadvantaged or the rural population
        Deployment of community access centers allows supplying non-adopting
         population with devices and access points to the Internet; in addition, the
         access centers can become points of delivery of training programs and user
         support
        The privacy and security training programs allow building the levels of trust
         from consumers in order to foster adoption of broadband

As mentioned in section 6.2, beyond digital literacy programs focused on residential
subscribers, building awareness has also an enterprise focus, primarily targeting small
and medium enterprises. In this case, the awareness emphasis comprises initiatives in
training and the promotion of broadband assimilation (see figure 6.22).




                                                                                      41
       Figure 6.22. Awareness Promotion Initiatives in Enterprise Broadband




       Advanced ICT training is aimed at supplementing the formal education
        system with training of technical personnel that will facilitate the introduction
        and assimilation of broadband-enabled applications in small and medium
        enterprises
       In addition to generic advanced programs, training for SMEs is specifically
        targeted for management and personnel working in those firms
       Consulting services provided to SMEs allow for those firms to deploy and
        efficiently integrate broadband-enabled applications in their businesses
       As a specific case of broadband impact, some initiatives should focus on how
        to build broadband-enabled businesses, thereby stimulating new firm
        formation

This section will explore all these potential approaches oriented toward raising
awareness of broadband services. In doing so, cases and practices from both
developed and emerging countries will be described and assessed.

6.3.1. Developing basic digital literacy

In section 6.2.2.2 it was explained that up to 29% of broadband non-adopters in
certain countries cited limited digital literacy as a reason from not acquiring service.
Again, digital literacy is defined as the “ability to use digital technology,
communication tools or networks to locate, evaluate, use and create information”
(Hauge and Prier, 2010). Evidence from section 6.2.2.2 also showed that, when the
affordability barrier is lowered through price reductions or state fostered policies,
digital literacy remains the dominant impediment. Finally, research also shows that
limited digital literacy is intrinsically linked to level of education, age, and ethnic
affiliation.

In light of this evidence, initiatives aimed at building digital literacy need to involve
both embedding programs in the formal education system and targeting non-formal
initiatives to specific segments of the population (elderly, handicapped, rural poor,
etc.). The structuring of digital literacy efforts should be conducted after concluding
the basic diagnostic of demand gap.

6.3.1.1. Digital Literacy through Formal Education Programs

                                                                                      42
Programs oriented to fostering digital literacy through formal education consist in
embedding ICT training in curricula at the primary and secondary school level
complemented with targeted programs focused on teachers. This section addresses the
need to introduce fundamental changes in the formal educational system in order to
enhance the level of digital literacy.

Digital literacy programs embedded in the formal educational system should be, by
definition, large scale and centrally driven, generally hosted within ministries of
education. While providing access infrastructure (both devices and broadband),
programs tend to generally focus on improving usability. As expected, the initiatives
are less focused on delivering standard computer courses, emphasizing the use of IT
and broadband access within course material by leveraging e-learning platforms and
social networking.

Primary school programs

Primary school digital literacy programs are critically important in building
broadband awareness for numerous reasons. In the first place, a large portion of the
population in many emerging nations only benefit from only a primary school
education (see table 6.11).

    Table 6.11. School Enrollment by Region of the World (2010) (Percent of
                                  population)

NOTE: These numbers can exceed 100 because they include students who fall above or below the
typical age range for that level of education.

As such, primary schooling represents their only opportunity to get access to digital
literacy training. Moreover, research has shown that students that gain access to
broadband in school are more likely to use it later in their life (Goldfarb, 2006). This
appeared to be particularly true among low-income households.

Secondly, and as a corollary from the first point (and shown in section 6.2.2.2), a
large portion of the broadband non-adopting population has only a primary school
education. In that sense, limited digital literacy and low levels of educational
attainment are linked. A digital literacy program focused on primary schools would
help lowering the educational barrier.




                                                                                           43
Thirdly, as shown in section 6.2.2.2, children tend to act as change agents in a
household, bringing all the positive influence that stimulates Internet usage and
sustains broadband adoption. By introducing intensive digital literacy programs in
primary education, the initiative consists in training residential change agents that will
promote literacy within low-income households. Belo and Ferreira (2012) found in
researching the impact of broadband in schools in Portugal that broadband use in
schools leads to higher levels of adoption in the surrounding region, and that the
spillover effect is mediated by children. According to the authors school broadband
use increase the probability of adopting high-speed Internet access by 20% in
households with children. This translates into an increase of 5% in the penetration of
residential broadband within the whole country. Spill-over effects have also been
pointed at by Goolsbee and Klenow (2002), while the positive influence of children
on residential broadband adoption was identified by research by OFCOM (2005) and
Katz (2011).

As the examples below will show, successful digital literacy programs in primary
education tend to focus holistically on the provision of computers to students, the
subsidization of broadband service both for students via Wi-Fi and for schools via
fixed facilities, and the intense embedding of ICT programs in the formal curriculum.
In many cases, successful initiatives in this domain are associated to partnerships
between the public and private sectors.

Box 6.3.1: “Plan Ceibal” (Uruguay)

Also known as The Educational Connectivity of Basic Information for Online Learning
Program, Plan Ceibal aims to provide every primary school student in the nation with a
computer as part of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative. Following its initial success,
the plan now includes secondary school students. Plan Ceibal also brings Internet to the
schools and incorporates IT training into the curriculum.

Plan Ceibal came into existence in 2006 during the Vázquez presidency in an effort to
address the country’s digital divide. By providing students with laptops that they can take
home, ICT access increases not only amongst the students, but also within their families as
well. In an indirect way, the provision of laptops also addresses digital literacy within the
country, assuming that as students become familiar with the technology in the classroom,
they then share this knowledge with family members, which then spreads to other members
of the community.

By 2011, the total investment in the program amounted to approximately US$ 100 mn, or the
equivalent of 0.25% of the country’s GDP and 8% of its education-related expenditures. This
figure covers the US$ 250 spent per student, derived from the US$188 cost of the laptop and
the US$60 in maintenance and Wi-Fi connection fees over four years.

By mid-2012, nearly 600,000 Uruguayan students owned personal computers and 99% of the
nation’s 4,375 primary and secondary schools had Internet access.

Box 6.3.2: Fusion Universal Project (Tanzania)

Tanzania’s Ministry of Education has long recognized the importance of digital literacy and
the inclusion of ICT training into its formal curriculum, as evidenced in policies such as
Teknolojia ya Habari na Mawasiliano (TEHAMA) and the Primary Education and
Development Plan. These goals saw limited success until a private corporation offered its
assistance.

In 2011, Fusion Universal, a London-based corporate solutions provider, partnered with
UhuruOne Tanzania, a local ISP, to offer Internet access to students and homes in select areas
within the country. As part of the program, Fusion worked with the Tanzanian government to
develop further its education policies, emphasizing the need for IT instruction. To this end,
Fusion developed its own 5-year ICT curriculum for students as well as a video-based toolkit
for teachers and adult learners covering topics ranging from basic computer use to software
application instruction. More than 300,000 learners across the African continent now follow
this curriculum. Fusion chooses its locations based on need, in line with its goal of
“improving the lives of the world's poorest billion people through the use of learning
technology.”

As part of the program, in 2011, Fusion brought computers and training to a free library in
Moshi – known as Jifundishe or “teach yourself” – emphasizing ICT training for school aged
children. As the children became more comfortable using the computers, they became more
interested in additional workshops and in teaching themselves computer skills.

In addition to this program, the organization also plans to run evening classes for adults in
rural locations in conjunction with the Tanzania Postal Corporation, which purchased 300
laptops to implement the curriculum. Furthermore, Fusion stated its goal of working with
USAID, the United States public development donor, to build ICT labs within 600 primary
schools and 40 teacher-training colleges to promote digital literacy in the country further.

Box 6.3.3: Education Modernization Program (Russia)


                                                                                           45
The Russian government has included ICT training in its education system since 1986,
though until recently this training focused on secondary and higher education. In 2006, the
government connected all public schools to the Internet, and with this push to increase access
to technology came the introduction of ICT training to primary school classrooms. The
Federal Education Agency of Russia recommended that schools develop a formal computer
curriculum, encouraging the use of ICT as part of the curriculum from Grade 2 – or age seven
– onward.

Beyond simply increasing the presence of ICT in the classroom, the Russian government
partnered with the World Bank’s Russia office in 2004 to implement the “Education
Modernization Program,” which supported the improvement of ICT skills and competencies
through e-learning. While the program covered all levels of education and government
services, it specified that 20% of resources must be used toward ICT at the primary school
level.

The program was developed to address the disparities in ICT access and competency
throughout the country. As Russia transitioned to a market economy, many regions inherited
failing education systems and did not receive adequate funding to provide students with
marketable skills for employment. Per the 2000 OECD PISA assessment, Russian students
ranked 27th of 31 countries. The government concluded that ICT competency would improve
the quality of the workforce, and that ICT could enhance the access and quality of its
education system.

Once the government provided schools with basic computers and Internet connections the
three phases of the 4-year e-learning project included: “(i) development of new learning
materials; (ii) support for both pre-service and in-service teacher training in the introduction
of ICT into teaching and learning; and (iii) establishing not less than 200 resource centers to
improve access to ICT enhanced education opportunities and to disseminate new teaching
practices.” Additionally, by the end of 2007, all schools had broadband connections.

The entire cost of the project totaled US$ 145 mn, broken into US$ 35 mn on learning
materials, US$ 43 mn on teacher training, US$ 63 mn on resource centers, and US$ 4 mn on
project management.

To measure efficacy, the program incorporated a series of 18 indicators, including: teacher
competency in Internet education, the incorporation of digital resources into the classroom,
and the creation of open access textbooks. The program met or exceeded each of these goals.
By completion, the number of students enrolled in distance learning had increased by 75%,
with the number of rural students accessing online education multiplied by 5. Further, ICT
competency levels improved and the availability of e-resources grew.

Box 6.3.4: National ICT Literacy Assessment (Australia)

In 2008, Australia introduced measures to assess students’ digital literacy skills and
comprehension. Students in years 6 and 10 (ages 12 and 16 on average) sat for standardized
tests, which ranked digital literacy comprehension on a 6-point scale. The lowest level, Level
1, designated a basic understanding of how to use a computer and software. The highest level,
Level 6, was reserved for students who could use advanced software features to organize
information, synthesize data, and complete information products. Prior to this assessment, the
country had testing in place to identify areas of weakness in its traditional literacy and
numeracy education, but not in its ICT curriculum.

To develop the test, Australia’s Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and
Youth Affairs (MCEETYA) partnered in 2005 with the Australian Council for Educational
Research (ACER). The independent non-profit organization produced the National Sample
Assessment of ICT literacy, the first of its kind. The initial trial tested 620 Australian
students and evaluated students’ analytical skills rather than simply their software know -how.

Per the results of the 2008 testing, more than 40% of year 6 students tested at a Level 3 or
higher, meaning that they could conduct simple Internet searches and identify the best source.
Almost half of all year 10 students tested at a Level 4 or higher, meaning that they could
conduct more complex searches and use the information they found to generate new content.

In 2011, the OECD released its results from the Electronic Reading Assessment (ERA)
component of the 2009 OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). The
overall PISA examination tests high school students’ readiness to enter and contribute
positively to society following the end of their compulsory education. The exam places high
value on the ability to address “real world” situations rather than on specific curriculum
items. Within this context, the ERA specifically looks at students’ abilit y to navigate through
electronic text, as developed through exposure to ICT. Of the 19 countries surveyed,
Australia ranked second in terms of the ERA.

Secondary school programs

While secondary schools do address basic digital literacy skills, they tend to provide
students with a more advanced knowledge than they would gain during their primary
school years. Viewing digital literacy as a life skill can explain its application in a
student’s life well beyond the classroom. As the global economy shifts from the
manufacturing of goods to the provision of services, workers and countries require
more high-level skills to stay competitive. Particularly in instances where students
move directly from secondary or vocational school to the workforce, the exposure
they have to ICT training via the education system has the potential to shape the
trajectory of their future careers and the strength of the national economy. Employers
increasingly require digital competence, and workers with this type of training also

                                                                                             47
tend to acquire other on-the-job skills more easily. Further, the ICT industry tends to
offer more high paying, lucrative jobs, adding financial incentive to the benefits of
obtaining advanced digital literacy.

By incorporating digital literacy training into the secondary school system, policy
makers can effectively bridge the digital divide, thus creating more equal workforce
opportunity amongst the population. Further, employees comfortable with using the
technology at work are more likely to see its value within the household.

Given that most countries now require secondary school attendance, this environment
seems to serve as the ideal setting in which to introduce citizens to basic and
advanced ICT training. Training cannot come to fruition, however, without the
necessary technology. In addition to developing effective and applicable lesson plans,
educators and policy makers must also consider the provision of personal computers
coupled with broadband connectivity. To this end, an increasing number of
government initiatives have focused on distributing laptops to secondary students and
faculty members. Some governments, such as North Carolina in the United States,
require students to pass an ICT competence exam in the seventh or eighth grade to
receive a high school diploma.

As is the case with primary school digital literacy programs, educators should have
some form of measurement or standardization in place to promote the efficacy of
such initiatives. Successful examples have included testing, certification programs,
and partnerships with international organizations. As in the case of primary school
programs, successful initiatives are also based on public and private partnerships.

Box 6.3.5: Conectar Igualdad and Educ.ar (Argentina)

In an effort to promote digital literacy in the country, in 2010 Argentina established its
national Conectar Igualdad program. The first phase of the program targeted the country’s
secondary schools, promising equal ICT access to all students in urban and in rural areas
alike.

While Conectar Igualdad aimed to distribute 3 million laptops to secondary students and
teachers, it recognized that access alone would not increase digital literacy. Beyond laptop
distribution, the initiative also included Internet access and internal networks within the
schools, the creation of digital content, and a standardized program to train teachers on how
to incorporate ICT use into the classroom. To this end, Conectar Igualdad complemented the
country’s Educ.ar platform, which was designed to assist teachers in the development of an
ICT curriculum by creating a standard set of materials for use throughout all schools.

In developing Conectar Igualdad, the Argentine Republic Ministry of Education partnered
with other sectors of the government - the Social Security National Administration, the
Ministry for Federal Planning and Public Investment and Services, and the National
Executive Cabinet’s Head. By incorporating these high-level agencies, the program promoted
centralization and discouraged an uneven distribution of resources.

By purchasing computers on such a large scale, each unit costs approximately US$ 350 (as
opposed to the average US$ 506). While the government covers the connectivity and training
costs, Educ.ar operates as a private enterprise and relies on pro-bono support from
educational institutes and corporations.



                                                                                          48
By May 2012, Conectar Igualdad had so far distributed 1.8 million laptops and Educ.ar had
created more than 20,000 pieces of material specific to the secondary school curriculum.
Together, through increased ICT access and formal training, Conectar Igualdad and Educ.ar
effectively promoted digital literacy throughout Argentina’s secondary schools.

Box 6.3.6: ICDL Accreditation (Senegal)

Designed to serve as an international standard for computer competency, the International
Computer Driving License (ICDL) certification program was initially developed for use in
European nations by the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS). Its
success spread, however, and citizens in 48 countries now have access to the program. In
order to receive the license, candidates must pass a series of tests on modules covering
various ICT-related subjects ranging from word processing to web browsing. In preparation,
individuals typically take a training course before sitting for the 45-minute exam.

In 2010, Senegal’s Ministry of Vocational and Technical Training established a formal
partnership with ICDL – Africa and USAID to ensure a standardization of digital literacy
training within the country’s schools. The project introduced the certification program to
students in the country’s middle schools with the goal of certifying all students within four
years.

When announcing the program, the minister of Vocational and Technical Training
emphasized the potential for ICT skills to impact national development and close the socio-
economic divide by potentially empowering otherwise disadvantaged groups. By partnering
with ICDL, the Ministry can ensure effective quality digital literacy training. All holders of
the certification have demonstrated an ICT and digital literacy competency. With the support
of national governments, private corporations, and international organizations, it is now
internationally recognized and available in 148 countries. To date, there are more than 11
million global candidates, making the ICDL the world’s largest end-user computer skills
certification program.

The first step in implementation in Senegal involved a pilot testing of 100 students, which led
to the accreditation of select institutions to serve as official training and exam centers.
Following this initial phase, universities and other educational facilities joined and the
program eventually expanded to include partnerships with corporations to assist with
publicity and funding. Within a year, 113 middle schools registered to participate. As written
into the program, local citizens run all management and training.



                                                                                            49
In the event that students cannot attend class, they have the option to download the ICDL
syllabus free of charge. The examination requires a “small cost,” and supplemental training
courses cost extra. While the program itself does not yet offer scholarships, corporate
sponsors may do so in the future.

Box 6.3.7 – GILAS (Philippines)

Gearing up Internet Literacy and Access for Students, or GILAS for short, provides public
secondary schools in the Philippines with computer labs, complete with Internet connections,
software, basic hardware, and Internet training. The initiative, which began in 2005, is a
partnership between 26 corporations and non-profit institutions that recognize the limitations
of the government’s education budget. Per the GILAS website, the project aims to deliver:

           Internet access for schools with computer labs
           Servers or routers, LAN cards, cables
           Provision of connectivity and unlimited free Internet usage for the first year
           10 computers and Internet access for schools without computer equipment
           Basic training
           Training for teachers and administrators on networking and resource
            mobilization
           Formulation of basic curriculum and year-long lesson plan
           Maintenance

By providing Internet access to schools, sponsors of the project see it as a means of bridging
the digital divide among public high school students. Only a small number of Filipino
students attend college, largely due to the prohibitive costs of higher education in the country.
Beyond a college education, many employers see Internet literacy as a hiring requisite,
though this skill is typically reserved for wealthier students whose families can afford
household computers and Internet connections. Without computer access or the ability to
afford a college education, many students have few opportunities awaiting them at
graduation. By increasing computer access and digital literacy within the school system, the
GILAS project aims to produce a more qualified and highly skilled workforce.

To support the initiative, GILAS matched donations from local and foreign companies, local
governments, and legislators. Per the most recently released annual report, the public sector
2009 contribution added up to approximately US$ 500,860 in addition to the private sector’s
US$ 598,470 contribution. Overseas Filipino expatriates also made donations, mainly through
the Ayala Foundation USA, that totaled US$ 175,980. In total, donations that year equaled
US$ 1.3 million.

In 2010, the country’s Department of Education initiated its DepEd Internet Connectivity
Project (DICP) with the intention of connecting all public high schools to the Internet while
providing relevant monitoring through an annual allocation of US$ 1200 per school. The
initiative complemented the GILAS program and leaders of both projects worked together to

                                                                                              50
reach their shared goal. DICP focused more on financing schools’ Internet connections while
GILAS looked more at the initial investment in the provision of ICT tools and training.

Within four years of its 2005 inception, the GILAS program connected 39% of the
Philippines’ public high schools. As a result, more than 2 million students accessed the
Internet and 11,621 teachers received training. By late 2012, the program had reached a total
of 3,349 schools, with 3,811 remaining.

Distance learning programs

The introduction of technology in education changes the scale in the delivery of the
educational product, both in terms of resource availability as well as regarding the
training of teachers and professors. In addition, by its nature, technology has the
potential to break the distance barrier, becoming a fundamental tool to meet the needs
of population in remote areas. The use of ICT in education can generate a significant
contribution in four areas:

       Learning support to students in quantitative subjects such as geometry, basic
        algebra and hard sciences;
       Teaching support in regions where achievement tests yield results that are
        lower than the national average, whereby they might be linked to socio-
        economic, ethnic, or gender gap;
       Contribution to address shortfalls in adolescent students that exhibit reading
        and comprehension difficulties;
       Resource support for teachers;

Finally, ICT also appears to have a potential, indirectly through some of the effects
mentioned above, or directly, to reduce student attrition, particularly in areas where
rates approach 30%. Having said that, the return on the technology investment in
education in remote areas depends on three factors: the contents delivered through
technology have to be adapted to the technology format, the processes and principles
guiding the teaching experience have to be redesigned in order to incorporate the
technology input, and finally, teachers and professors have to be trained on the
utilization of technology. These three requirements are of paramount importance in
order to ensure that the technology investment in remote areas yields the expected
results. In the first condition, research indicates that educational contents need to be
adapted to the new teaching formats, rather than being merely copied and digitized.
Under the second requirement, the teaching process has to be transformed in order to
render the use of technology within a new context of enhanced learning that blends
the classroom experience with the technology support. Finally, teachers and

                                                                                          51
professors need to be trained so they can not only familiarize themselves with the
technology but also learn how to use it effectively in the classroom.

In light of these conditions, technology plays a very important role in the
transformation of the educational institution located in remote areas. In the first place,
the technology platform becomes a learning tool inserted within a learning experience
that is student- focused. Secondly, technology becomes a vehicle for delivering
resources and teacher support. Third, technology becomes an enabler to facilitate the
transition of students in an information society.

There are several broadband-enabled technology platforms that can contribute in
terms of the benefits pointed above:

      Video programs distributed through broadband: there is considerable research
       supporting the educational value of distance learning through television as a
       complementary resource to the classroom. With the introduction of broadband
       and the use of computers, the development of "learning objects", which
       constitute small video segments that can be easily integrated with
       mathematics, history and geography curricula, have become commonplace.
       These programs have also started to be modified in order to be able to be
       distributed through smartphone screen formats;
      Interactive whiteboards: despite being a new technology, these tools can play
       a very positive role with regards to the use of methods promoting student
       engagement, that can be easily adapted to different learning styles;
      Portable terminals, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones can
       address limitations in terms of access to content, promoting student
       independence in those educational settings that have a small number of
       teachers (such as schools with a single teacher in remote areas). However, this
       effect can be fulfilled if content is adapted to the different screen formats,
       which in some cases, can be fairly small;
      Virtual learning platforms: these technologies comprise traditional audiovisual
       tools, such as videoconferencing, or more o advanced based on the Internet,
       with a capability of operating in real time with an upstream channel. These
       types of tools can very useful in teaching semantics and conceptual mapping
       (such as story lines, and roadmaps to structure the writing of essays),
       geometry and hard sciences.  

The contribution of technology in education remote areas covers numerous
applications domains from distance learning to the utilization of portable terminals
and computer-based tools. In the case of distance learning, research shows that
students in remote areas whose primary vehicle of instruction is the technology
platform tend to perform at an equivalent level that those students learning in
traditional classrooms (Hudson; 2006). The studies of Witherspoon et al. (1993) show
that, despite the distance and physical separation from the teacher, the students
undergoing a distance learning program tend to be more motivated to learn, and are
more mature. On the other hand, the design of educational material tends to be more
systematic and oriented toward making the learning process more efficient. Finally,
Hudson indicates that distance-learning programs combined with tutoring delivered
via satellite tend to reduce school absenteeism (Hudson, 1990).


                                                                                       52
Another important effect of technology in education is the impact of the Internet.
While the extent of its contribution is highly dependent on the quality of equipment
and the telecommunications access, when those factors are controlled in study
settings, the Internet can compensate for variables such as low training of teachers or
lack of educational material (Puma et al., 2002). Social networks, which citizens
access over broadband, can deliver education to students in remote areas.

Box 6.3.8 – Aprendaris.cl (Chile)

Aprendaris.cl is a web portal developed in Chile with the purpose of creating collaborative
social networks in support of learning and knowledge search focused on educational
institutions. The project, conducted by the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria in
2008, was funded by the Chilean government at a cost of US $130.000. The portal provides
several technology tools that help build online learning communities, comprised of teachers
and students. At the end of 2008, the system counted 1,600 users, of which 960 were teachers
and 640 students. Aprendaris.cl is a third generation web- based application based on two
principles: promote user participation in the flow of information by means of offering user-
friendly tools and use of semantic tools, capable of understanding context of searches and
automatically generating the content that is most suited to the user.

Box 6.3.9 – MOOCs: Coursera and EdX (United States and international)

In 2008, researchers and professors from the National Research Council of Canada and the
University of Manitoba launched a course on learning theory, and opened it to 25 university
students (who were paying tuition) as well as to 2300 members of the public (who were not
paying tuition), who could take the course online. This course was soon dubbed a “massive
open online course,” or MOOC, a term that is used today to describe countless free web -
based classes that are designed to reach a large audience. These classes can vary in format in
terms of length, structure, level of interaction, or requirements. They all, however, stress
convenience and individual learning pace. At present, two large American ventures dominate
the MOOC environment – Coursera and edX.

Founded by two Stanford University computer professors in 2012, the education company
Coursera has grown into a partnership with 33 global universities, offering 222 free online
courses and drawing nearly 3 million students within less than a year of its inception.
Courses cover a range of subject matter from education to business to foreign language. As
described by Coursera co-founder Andrew Ng, this project can “bring higher education to
places where access is limited, and … give established educational institutions opportunities
to raise their impact both on and off campus.”

Founded and governed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard
University (both also in the United States) in May 2012, the non-profit EdX has expanded to
include 12 university partners, although more than 200 institutions expressed interest in
collaborating in its first year. The program started when one professor offered his electrical
engineering course online and now has approximately 25 courses designed specifically for
interactive online learning. By 2014, EdX will likely offer 50 – 100 courses. MIT and
Harvard will also use these courses as an opportunity to study further the impact of
technology on both on-campus and distance learning. EdX aims to eliminate traditional


                                                                                           53
barriers to quality education access for students all over the world, including age, income,
nationality, and location. With more than 900,000 course enrollments in its first year, by
2025, EdX expects to have worked with one billion students across the world.

From their inception, both Coursera and EdX have seen a large international student
presence, and their emerging partnerships with international universities will likely only
increase this trend and demand for online university services.

While the programs will continue to offer their online courses for free, they are both pushing
a new model that will offer students formal college accreditation, but at a fee. To do so, they
will soon incorporate such tools as identity-verified certificates, proctored exams, and
recommendations from the American Council on Education, all of which many universities
look for when considering transfer credit.

The benefit of technology in education can materialize when its introduction is
coupled by teacher training with the purpose of breaking down adoption structural
constraints. In a similar fashion, technology training has to be extended beyond
teachers into the mid-level functionaries of ministries of education, where the impetus
for the introduction of technology tools often reside. Ultimately, one of the most
important challenges in this domain is transforming the culture and resistance to
technology in educational institutions and ministries of education.

Box 6.3.10: KorPhil (Korea / Philippines)

The Korea-Philippines Information Technology Center (KorPhil) serves as an advanced ICT
training center for the Asia-Pacific region and was inaugurated by Korean President Roh Moo
Hyn and Filipino President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo in 2005. As part of its model, KorPhil
offers distance-training modules for students in other regions as well as for local
governments. The center aims to provide students with professional digital skills and ICT-
related training relevant to the demands of the Filipino economy. While doing so, it has
developed an ICT community of industry partners and individual experts and evolved into a
research and development facility. By producing high skilled IT workers throughout the
Philippines, the institute aims to increase the country’s competitiveness in the international
market.

The institute features high-speed broadband access and satellite facilities to support web-
based courses and virtual education across the country. With the ability to transmit

                                                                                            54
curriculum to even the most rural regions of the Philippines, KorPhil is the only facility of its
kind in the country capable of developing distance-learning modules for other institutions. To
support this endeavor, KorPhil also offers training programs and enhanced curriculum
development in conjunction with other ICT schools and industry experts.

As part of a government grant-in-aid initiative, the Korea International Cooperation Agency
(KOICA) granted the Philippines’ Technical Education and Skills Development Authority
(TESDA) US$ 4.3 mn to facilitate the development of KorPhil. The Quezon City Polytechnic
University and the Quezon City Local Government operate and manage the facility.

Box 6.3.11: Center for E-Learning and Distance Education (Saudi Arabia)

Recognizing the need for more equal educational opportunities for its students, Saudi Arabia
created a taskforce dedicated to the preparation of an e-learning and distance education
model. Distance education addresses such barriers as physical location and time constraints
and creates opportunities for all members of society regardless of their age, gender, or
lifestyle. As education quality and availability improves, so too should the country’s labor
market.

In 2006, the Ministry of Higher Education contracted the Malaysian consortium METEOR to
begin the first stage in the creation of the center for a cost of US$ 12.5 mn. At the time,
METEOR was comprised of 14 universities and offered distance-learning programs to more
than 50,000 students globally. The Center now serves as the hub for university e-learning and
distance education programs, providing the resources and training necessary to create a more
accessible education program while addressing the country’s shortage of qualified professors.
The center also sets the standards for the design and production of materials while
coordinating with international higher education institutions.

In the past five years, the Center has undertaken various initiatives, including the creation of
an educational portal that facilitates the exchange of e-learning education-related experiences.
The portal includes a forum where users can discuss their experiences and share their
expertise in the field as well as a news section for a compilation of all information pertaining
to the Center and the field of distance education. The portal also houses all digital courses and
resources, which are developed by university faculty members. Because the materials are all
developed as open source, students can easily access and share them. Similarly, the Center
also established the Saudi Digital Library, which now offers nearly 100,000 digital books to
all university students and faculty.

In Saudi Arabia, culture has likely impacted the low ICT adoption rates more so than the cost
or availability of physical hardware. Beyond distance education’s direct benefits, initiatives
such as the Center for e-Learning produce positive externalities, raising awareness of the
importance of ICT use and understanding. As the perception of technology changes and it
comes to the forefront of Saudi educational policy, teachers are more likely to introduce ICT
instruction into the curriculum.

Digital literacy for teachers

Digital literacy programs focusing on teachers represent a critical component of
formal education changes. Any change in the formal curriculum in primary and/or
secondary education that is not complemented with teacher retraining has a high
failure rate. At best, given the digital awareness of young cohorts, these situations can
result in the syndrome known as “digital children/analogue teachers,” whereby
teachers are not capable of providing the necessary training and/or interacting with
children on the basis of ICT usage.

Many of these initiatives go beyond increasing teachers’ digital literacy, offering
resources and instruction on the incorporation of ICT training into the classroom.
Naturally, the heightened exposure to these tools makes teachers more comfortable
with the technology and more aware of its benefits in and out of the formal education
system. Aside from schooling students to use computers and the Internet effectively,
many teachers also introduce online learning supplements – such as games,
assessments, and e-books – that require interaction and fast speeds to enhance the
education of their students. As students become more engaged and technology use
becomes second nature, they bring these skills home with them, unknowingly passing
their knowledge along to other members of their families and communities.

As is the case with primary and secondary school digital literacy initiatives, the
training of teachers requires an investment not only in the instruction but also in the
relevant technology. Without access to computers, related software, and broadband,
these programs would have little to no value or application. Various initiatives
address this issue differently, though many successful programs tend to provide both
students and teachers with laptop computers. Local and national government
partnerships with international corporations, NGOs, and multilaterals offer both
funding and quality instruction and resources that incorporate the best experiences of
past projects.

The implementation of teacher training varies, but the cost efficient “train the trainer”
model appears to have the best results. In this instance, project leaders work with
select teachers – through online training courses, intensive workshops, or certification
programs – who then train other teachers and faculty members. Some programs start
with urban schools and then expand to rural schools, while others target schools with
the most need. Others still selectively choose schools based on their geographic
proximity to other schools and resources.

Ultimately, an investment in teachers is an investment in human capital. High-skilled
teachers produce high-skilled students, which lead to large-scale and long-term
sustainable economic growth.

Box 6.3.12. – Microsoft IT Academy (Nigeria)

The Microsoft IT Academy Program – which to date consists of 10,000 members in more
than 160 countries worldwide – is designed to provide students with the ICT training
necessary to stay competitive in the workforce. Beyond courses and certifications for
students, it also offers resources for teachers and faculty members that include training,
lesson plans, E-learning, student projects, and assessments. By providing such tools, teachers

                                                                                           56
can more easily incorporate new technology into their classroom curricula and effectively use
them to create specialized age appropriate lesson plans. The Academy allows educators to
access to its e-reference libraries as well as its database of resources designed specifically for
educators and students looking for advanced IT-training.

In the summer of 2010, Microsoft Nigeria partnered with the Lagos State Government to
bring the IT Academy to local secondary schools in Agidingbi as part of its efforts to
modernize public education. As part of this pilot, Deux Project Limited - a Nigerian
company providing construction and consulting services - worked with Microsoft to provide
Microsoft software-equipped laptops to the schools. The partnership was recognized as
means to address the country’s lack of quality training and a resource for teachers looking to
supplement their course plans with online learning tools.

Deux Project Limited managed the academy while working closely with Microsoft to ensure
the fulfillment of its requirements. The Academy offered students more than 175 e-learning
courses and email addresses while increasing faculty access to online resources.

In January 2012, the Microsoft IT Academy concluded the pilot phase of its teacher-training
program, Digital Literacy Curriculum for School Teachers. During this 2-week training,
teachers learned how to utilize ICT to teach their students to do the same. This initial pilot
drew 83 teachers, which in turn led to the classification of their schools as “Certified
Microsoft IT Academies.”

Box 6.3.13 – Intel Teach Program (Sri Lanka)

Since 1999, the international Intel Teach Program has trained over 10 million teachers in 70
countries. The training focuses on providing teachers with the professional development
needed to integrate technology into their classrooms and improve their curricula. Intel
developed its education model through partnerships with governments, NGOs, multilateral
organizations, and educators and research spanning more than a decade. Ultimately, it created
a program emphasizing five main facets: policy reform, curriculum and assessment, teacher
profession development, ICT, and research and development. Based on these five
components, Intel structures its programs to address each country’s specific education needs.

In 2006, Intel signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Sri Lanka’s M inistry of
Education to implement a teacher development program designed specifically for the needs
of the Sri Lanka education system at no cost to the government. The project introduced a
variety of tools including “skoool Sri Lanka,” an interactive web-based program promoting
math and science learning. Skoool offers students practice exams and instruction tailored to
their individual areas of difficulty. In order to use the program, classrooms must have access
to a PC with Internet capabilities. The Intel Teach Elements website offers Sri Lankan
teachers lesson modules that promote Project-Based Learning. When teachers log in, they
receive help in organizing their curricula to encourage training relevant to the demands of the
21st century.

                                                                                               57
One year after its inception, Sri Lanka organized the “South Asia Intel Teach Program
Forum” for policy makers from the country as well as from India and Pakistan to promote
classroom ICT integration in the region. In November 2008, the Ministry of Education hosted
an awards ceremony to recognize the first 100 “Master Teachers” who had completed the
Intel Teach training program. By December 2011, the program had reached 1,500 schools
and 800,000 students in the country.

Box 6.3.14. – Regional ICT Training and Research Center (Rwanda)

In 2004, Rwanda’s Regional ICT Training and Research Center (RICT) was established to
strengthen the population’s ICT skills to support sustainable economic growth. The center
provides students with basic training as well as the skillset needed to enter the IT industry.
This emphasis on computer literacy fell in line with the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning’s “Vision 2020,” which included initiatives to prepare the country for a transition to
a knowledge-based economy by 2020. Amongst other facets, Vision 2020 addressed the need
to support ICT skills aimed at public sector, private sector, and civil society as well as the
development of ICT network infrastructure.

In 2009, RITC announced plans to ensure computer literacy amongst all Rwandan teachers
by 2010, with an emphasis on hands-on computer skills building. Phase one targeted 5,000
primary school teachers and the second phase reached secondary school teachers. While the
project initially focused on teachers in urban schools, it later expanded to reach the needs of
the rural teachers. The plan also included the distribution of 100,000 XO computers to
schools.

Prior to this push, Microsoft Partners in Learning (PIL) worked with RITC to provide 3,000
secondary school teachers with basic ICT skills. The project took place in 2005 and received
funding from the Ministry of Education. The following year, RICT conducted an in-depth
ICT training project for 1,000 secondary school teachers using the same model. Both projects
followed a “trainer-of-trainers” model, whereby two teachers from each school received
higher-level instruction to then train other teachers and act as troubleshooters. This project
had a budget of US$ 129,540. Microsoft PIL pledged an initial US$ 37,900 and the Microsoft
Emerging Markets Team contributed an additional US$25,000. RITC contributed US$
15,750, with the Ministry of Education covering the remaining US$50,890.

Box 6.3.15 – Enlaces (Chile)

Established in 1992 by the Ministry of Education, Chile’s Enlaces program addresses the
country’s digital divide and introduces new technologies to public schools. Participating
schools receive computers for the creation of computer labs, related software, and ICT
training for teachers. Schools also have access to technical assistance and training from 24
universities and special educational content via the state educational portal, educarchile.

When implementing the program, educators first identify which schools could benefit most
from an increase in ICT access. The project then targets teachers, recognizing their need for
content relevant to the curriculum with an emphasis on collaboration, projects, and self-paced
learning. The teachers have access to networks that enable online collaboration with other
education professionals regardless of their physical location. They can then participate in
Internet-based training courses related to e-learning and utilize resources such as lesson
planning tools and educational portals and software. Beyond training teachers directly,
Enlaces also assists in school management and leadership from the classroom level up
through ministries. As an example, the program offers tools for teachers to track student
progress and retain records, support systems for principals, and technology for policy makers
to disseminate information more efficiently.

In 2004, Enlaces established the Funds for Broadband program, providing primary and
secondary schools with funding for subsidized broadband. In 2008, the program awarded
2,644 schools broadband funding with an additional US$ 200 mn allocated for an investment
in infrastructure – including Internet connections and computers – through 2010.

By 2008, 87% of Chilean students had access to ICT, which amounted to an 11:1 student-
teacher ratio. 75% of all schools boasted Internet connections – 67% of which had broadband
connections - and the country reported a reduction of its digital divide. Further, studies
demonstrated an increase in digital literacy amongst teachers following the implementation of
Enlaces, as well as a raised awareness of the value of ICT use in the classroom and more
highly skilled high school graduates.

6.3.1.2. Targeted digital literacy programs

While digital literacy embedded in formal education processes are conducted in
school institutions, closely linked to curricula, targeted programs entail group-specific


                                                                                           59
training in the use of computers and broadband typically delivered through a range of
public access centers. This section reviews the major categories of targeted programs.

Targeted digital literacy programs are of a wide variety, potentially addressing a
number of objectives, not all necessarily consistent. In designing such programs,
policy makers need to consider what are the goals of the program, since these goals
will frame the methods of intervention. Among the goals to be considered in
designing a digital literacy program, the following issues need to be considered:

      What is the overall objective of the program? Digital literacy, conceived as a
       skill, represents the means to achieve a varying set of goals, such as
       improvement of quality of life, develop citizenship and promote democratic
       participation, or social inclusion. By outlining the ultimate objective, policy
       makers will help framing the program.

       As expected, digital literacy programs could have more than one objective,
       partly driven by the population being targeted. For example, if targeting the
       rural poor, the purpose of the digital literacy program could include providing
       access to broadband, improving quality of life to prevent rural exodus to
       cities, and promoting social inclusion. As Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009)
       mention in their report to the European Commission, that differences in
       program objectives could “reflect different policy domains” (e.g. education,
       economic development, social welfare). Program objectives could also be
       driven by the potentially different constituencies sponsoring the program.

      What is the target group? Targeted digital literacy programs take different
       shapes according to the population they will address. As an example, the type
       of content to be emphasized in program delivery will change significantly if
       the program aims to target the elderly (email for social inclusion and fostering
       of social and family ties) versus adults (applications to build employability
       skills). It is often the case that even needs within a single targeted group might
       be of different types. For example, some digital literacy programs that target
       the elderly have focused on helping users working with devices, while others
       have focused on basic operations and routines of operating systems.

      Usability versus accessibility? Some digital literacy programs emphasize
       training and skills transmission, while others complement this with
       infrastructure for public broadband access. This represents a critical policy
       choice since access does not necessarily equate to the capability to use
       broadband in a productive and beneficial manner. In fact, if the primary
       objective is usability, experience indicates that tailored courses,
       complemented with intense coaching, are the more appropriate approach.

       As expected, if the target of the digital literacy program is the rural poor,
       accessibility will be a dominant objective. A combination of both objectives –
       use and access- can be provided by community access centers, which will be
       reviewed later. Nevertheless, best practices indicate that accessibility and
       usability are not that easy to combine in digital literacy programs. As such, the
       two objectives are frequently addressed sequentially, first providing access,
       followed by training.

                                                                                      60
        Formal versus informal delivery mode? Formal digital literacy training entails
         structured programs based on established curricula, learning tools, and
         certification. Informal training is not delivered in specific training
         environments, lacking a structured pedagogical process. While it might not be
         intuitively appropriate for targeted programs, the emergence of new Internet
         platforms might lead to the adoption of informal approaches.

        Scale of implementation? This question addresses whether programs will be
         focused on a particular region, or deployed on a national scale. In Hilding-
         Hamann et al. (2009) view, “national programs are rooted in centralized
         policies at the national level and (…) seen as strategically linked to
         government objectives”, such as building an information society. In general
         terms, local programs, while having a more limited impact across targeted
         populations, tend to experience a large sustainability success rate due to more
         limited funding requirements. Nevertheless, Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009) did
         not find a relation between size of the program and sustainability.

         Sustainability is a primary concern of targeted digital literacy programs. In
         their review of 464 programs, Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009) estimated that
         22% of them had been discontinued. Furthermore, they found that program
         sustainability is generally linked to the number of stakeholders (“more than
         half of the (ongoing) initiatives have been delivered by three or more
         implementers”).

        Device focus: Until now, the great majority of digital literacy programs have
         focused on personal computers connected to broadband technology. However,
         with the growing importance of wireless broadband and smartphones, the
         need to make decisions on what kind of device the digital literacy program
         focuses on will become very important.

In the ten year period between 1998 and 2008, the number of domestic IT jobs in the
United States increased 26%, compared to just 6% of overall employment growth.
Nearly all Americans (96%) now use ICT daily, and the majority (62%) uses the
Internet as part of their jobs. Further, these skills allow citizens to search and apply
for these jobs and promote access to other valuable resources such as online college
courses and government services. Digital literacy ultimately improves not only the
employment opportunities for individual citizens, but the country’s competitiveness
and economy as well. In the United States, for instance, Internet-related jobs in the
country added US$ 300 billion in economic activity to its GDP in 200910.

Other developed countries experience the same need for employees with digital know
how. In the UK, for instance, 90% of jobs require “some level of IT competency.”
With more than 10 million Internet users in the country, those citizens without access

or digital literacy skills will soon find themselves “even more isolated and
disadvantaged,” particularly as every day services move online.

As such, the larger education system and national initiatives should focus on the
provision of digital literacy training at all levels. Students must leave the classroom
ready to enter a world requiring IT skills, while adults must have access to necessary
instruction to keep pace with the skill-biased technological change. Incorporating
such programs into the education system ensures sustainability and funding. As a
basic skill – much like traditional literacy and numeracy – digital literacy ought to be
included in all areas of the formal curriculum. Further, numerous studies have shown
a link between digital literacy and excellence in other academic areas, concluding that
technology use in the classroom contributes not only to digital literacy, but also to
improvements in mathematics, science, and “learning motivation.”

In 2007, the UNESCO Education Council identified 16 core indicators of education
and training, many of which directly related to digital literacy and emphasized digital
competence11. The framework developed stressed the importance of integrating ICT
skills into the education system and establishing professional development for
educators through e-learning courses. Subsequent UNESCO reports recognize,
however, the difficulties school systems face in developing this integration, and
continue to stress the importance of teacher digital competency. Not only must
teachers know how to use ICT themselves, but they must also be well versed in
methods to utilize ICT to deliver educational instruction.

Beyond acting as a “gateway” for employment, digital literacy skills affect citizens’
ability to develop other skillsets. Access to online courses, for instance, can offer both
academic and real world instruction, while social and professional networking sites
can improve and expand an applicant’s job search. As an example, the site LinkedIn
now boasts more than 200 million worldwide users, and the majority of its job listings
look for future employees in the IT, financial services, and management consulting
fields – industries typically offering higher-paying jobs. Without universal digital
literacy and the knowledge necessary to navigate through such sites, opportunity
stratification will only continue to increase.

Adult education programs

Adult education programs are focused on upgrading the skills of the workforce,
therefore preparing it to fulfill a productive role in the digital economy. They can be
structured around conventional continuing education courses, as extension programs
of universities, or organized under economic development efforts focused on specific
regions of a country.

As Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009) concluded in their extensive review of digital
literacy programs, a large portion of these programs are targeted to the unemployed,
with the objective of increasing their employability. In this context, these programs
tend to provide a certification (such as EDCL reviewed above) to provide a proof of

skill. On the other hand, digital literacy programs focused on adults with a low
education level represent an opportunity to provide a second chance instruction,
thereby enhancing their personal development.

Some of the best practices captured in the assessment of adult digital literacy
programs include the following:

        Consider delivering courses in mobile settings (e.g. trucks equipped with
         computers, servers, and mobile broadband) to make it easier for people to
         participate in different geographies, thus enlarging the reach of the program;
         the mobile unit and instructors can arrive in one town, install the equipment in
         a library, a city hall or any community center, offer the five day courses, and
         then move on to the next location
        Allow participants to borrow equipment and take it home to continue
         practicing after the training sessions (although this could face some logistical
         difficulties)
        The formal course should last approximately five days and be delivered to
         groups not larger than 12 individuals, so each of them gets proper attention
        After completion of the formal course, users can enroll in a web-based
         program
        Waive enrollment fee for unemployed adults, but consider charging for others

In this context, certification (proof that the appropriate training was delivered and
received) becomes critical. In 2008, Cisco commissioned Forrester Consulting to
determine the importance of formal certifications in hiring decisions. By surveying IT
hiring managers across the world, the resulting study concluded that “certifications
were second only to a college degree to qualify for jobs and the top criteria used in
determining ability to perform the job,” because they serve to “validate the skills
required for computer support technicians and for careers in IT networking.”12

As an example, the Microsoft IT Academy Program13 focuses on technology career
training. Upon completing the program, students receive certification demonstrating
that they have acquired “21st century technology skills.” Academy membership offers
educators professional development opportunities, technology-centric curriculum and
lesson plans, E-learning, student projects, and assessments. At present, Microsoft has
more than 10,000 IT Academy members in more than 160 countries.

The program stresses formal certification through the “alignment of academic and
vocational standards and courses.” The academies provide educators with curriculum
mapping to ensure that instruction properly prepares students to receive Microsoft
certifications. The mappings pair curriculum and certifications including:

Box 6.3.16. – VOX (Norway)

The Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research promotes workforce competency
development through its Agency for Lifelong Learning, known as VOX, which it founded in
2001. VOX offers adult education that goes beyond basic skill instruction. It also focuses on
digital competence and ICT skills in an effort to improve the age group’s employability and
involvement in the education system. While the agency offers a vast range of courses, it does
have more specialized programs that target certain groups such as senior citizens, prisoners,
and adult immigrants. The agency also conducts research and analysis, producing reports and
compiling statistical data related to the field of adult learning.

In order to stimulate national economic growth, employability, and competitiveness, the
government recognizes that it must foster an environment that promotes competency and skill
development amongst its citizens. To this degree, rapid advances in technology and a
growing involvement in international markets have created a demand for a new type of
skillset. Per its research, more than 400,000 adults in the country are considered “at risk” in
terms of their employable skill levels. VOX aims to create a more valuable workforce
through the promotion of basic skill instruction as well as digital and ICT training.

Because adults have different needs than younger learners, Vox established a Framework for
Basic Skills for adults, emphasizing employable skills and flexibility. One such initiative,
“InterAct,” promotes on-the-job problem solving through a web-based platform. The activity
lasts approximately 5 weeks and targets employees who lack pre-existing ICT skills. Users
log in to the website and partake in role-playing activities where they are given scripts related
to a particular industry that force them to interact and make decisions with other users. Other
programs, like “ABC pc,” target adults in need of basic ICT training and addresses tasks
ranging from the use of the keyboard to using the Internet and email.

To cover the operational costs associated the study centers, distance learning institutions, and
study associations, the agency administers governmental subsidies and offers financial
support. In 2010, Vox reported that the Ministry of Education and Research spent US$ 7.9
mn on adult learning and education. ** Vox works closely with the European Commission in
the development of its adult learning policies and this partnership has allowed the agency to
share and learn from the experiences of its neighbors.

** Per a UNESCO report filed by VOX, the national government expenditure was 45,131
Norwegian Krone and the sub-national government expenditure was 68,736.

Box 6.3.17 – Technological Specialization Courses (Portugal)

In 1999, Portuguese legislation established technological specialization courses (CETs) to
train its adult population and provide them with the vocational qualifications necessary for
employment. CETs emphasize scientific and technological knowledge, workplace-relevant
skills, occupational placement, and also offer a continuation of studies. Courses typically
account for 1400 hours, including one year of classroom education plus additional internships
or work experience. All students must have a secondary education, though those students in
their final year may enroll in CETs.

In addition to the CETs, the government also partnered with industry leaders such as
Microsoft, Cisco, and Sun Microsystems to bring ICT Academies to polytechnics and
universities across the country. These academies offer students the opportunity to receive
professional training from professionals while completing their education. In 2006, three
American universities – MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and University of Texas, Austin – partnered
with the Portugal Program to add engineering systems, Internet technologies, and digital
content to its curriculum.

Portugal also implemented the New Opportunities Program, which targeted adults who did
not have a full education. The program offered courses at community centers and local
enterprises, all of which involved some degree of ICT skill building. As part of the program,
more than 200,000 laptops were distributed.

The country recognized the need for training to address the market for skilled workers. CETs
were developed to address Portugal’s drop out rates as well as the high proportion of both
young workers and mid-level staff lacking the qualifications necessary to succeed in the
workforce. The development of the courses focused on the provision of training specific to
real-world professional environments.

By 2009, Portugal boasted 119 CETs specializing in ICT-related skillsets offered in 38
institutions across 30 towns. Such courses included multimedia development, information
systems installment, and computer programming.

Digital literacy for disadvantaged/underprivileged population

Current research points to the fact that one of the largest pockets of broadband
demand gap is focused on the disadvantaged/underprivileged segments of the
population. However, explanatory variables of this phenomenon are not only
economic (addressed below in the affordability section), but also cultural and

                                                                                          65
educational. In this context, any policy oriented to reduce the economic barrier needs
to be complemented with digital literacy programs oriented at developing a
familiarity with broadband technology.

Given the modern day economic shift away from low-skilled manufacturing jobs to
high-skilled services jobs, lack of workplace opportunity is particularly heightened as
a result of the digital divide. Additionally, economic, educational, and geographic
disparities tend to impact ICT exposure, further exacerbating this cycle. Thus,
successful digital literacy programs many times target the following disadvantaged
groups that are less likely to have prior knowledge of computers or the Internet and
face more hurdles as a result:

           The unemployed
           Older citizens
           Welfare recipients
           Rural populaces

Training can be provided in a variety of ways, so long as it is offered in an easily
accessible, affordable manner to encourage participation. Many training sessions, for
example, are offered at local community access centers or schools, where citizens
already feel comfortable, while others are offered online. Sessions can cover a variety
of topics, but tend to focus on the development of ICT skills with “real world”
application, including, but not limited to:

           Email
           Internet inquiry
           Job search
           CV creation

Many programs also offer certification options, providing participants with tangible
evidence of their acquired skillset. Further, as training programs become more
popular, they create more economic opportunity through the demand for citizens to
serve as trainers or project managers.

Box 6.3.18 – IT Mentor Program (Hungary)

In 2003, the Hungarian Ministry of Informatics and Telecommunications established the IT
Mentor Program as an answer to its national strategy, which addressed the significant digital
divide within the country. The program offered digital literacy training for those
disadvantaged members of society who had difficulty entering or re-entering the labor force,
such as unemployed and disabled citizens and those citizens over age 45.

After receiving formal certification, the mentors of the program served as social workers,
providing training and consultation services as they related to e-knowledge. Such training
incorporated basic digital literacy skills as well as awareness; mentors instructed participants
not only on basic computer functions but also promoted an understanding of the advantages
of such online features as e-Government services and job searches. Beyond addressing the
digital divide, the program in essence also created “local champions” and strengthened the
role of IT trainers in the workforce by offering them government accreditation and support.




                                                                                             66
The program recognized that these members of society did not have the same access to the
digital information and its benefits that could otherwise advance the country’s economy as
other groups in society. By creating equal opportunities to bridge the digital divide, the
program promoted societal and economical development and modernization. As a public
policy, the IT Mentor Program received its funding from the government and was managed
by the former Ministry of Informatics and Telecommunications.

By 2006, more than 5,000 IT mentors across the country worked with citizens at 20 locations,
typically community computer and Internet access points. By encouraging digital literacy
training and awareness of the capabilities of the Internet while also providing public access
points, Hungary’s IT Mentor Program addressed the three pillars of demand stimulation:
awareness, affordability, and attractiveness.

As a result of the program, “IT Mentor” became an official profession in the country,
allowing employers to search specifically for potential hires with this skill set. In anticipation,
an IT Mentor university certification program was established, training 300 mentors in the
first year. Since then, various government projects – such as the implementation of an online
tax filing system – have formally incorporated IT Mentors to promote citizen awareness and
serve as troubleshooters.

Box 6.3.19 – e-Diriya Program (Sri Lanka)

In November 2011, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Telecommunication and Information Technology
and the Hambonthota district inaugurated the country’s national ICT initiative, the e -Diriya
program. E-Diriya targets Samurdhi (welfare) recipients, many of whom have never before
touched a computer. The initiative aims not only to create more than 50,000 computer literate
citizens and enhance ICT infrastructure, but also to raise ICT awareness.

The program’s four-hour training workshops – which are held in public schools and IT
centers across 19 districts - teach basic computer skills to participants with no prior
knowledge of computers or the Internet. All centers come equipped with computers and
Internet connections. The second-longest segment, which lasts 70 minutes, covers word
processing software, functions, formatting, and outputs. The longest segment, which lasts 90
minutes, deals strictly with Internet and email, emphasizing the benefits of the Internet, the
components required for a connection, and how to utilize a web browser and email address.
The other two segments include a basic introduction to ICT and a “getting started” portion
that acquaints participants with the hardware, software, and operating system of a computer.

Following completion of the workshop, participants are better prepared to enter the global e-
community. As part of the e-Sri Lanka Initiative, e-Diriya uses ICT to “develop the economy
of Sri Lanka, reduce poverty, and improve the quality of life of the people.” The program
aims to reduce the digital divide, thereby creating an equal distribution of opportunity and
information.

The Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) manages e-Diriya with the
full support of the Sri Lanka Samurdhi Authority and the Ministry of Education. The


                                                                                                67
government fully funds the Samurdhi Program, which covers approximately one-third of Sri
Lanka’s population, or 1.2 million families. The program encourages poverty reduction by
providing disadvantaged groups with training, decision-making activities, and employment
opportunities. While the ICTA lists its financials in its 2010 Annual Report (the most recent
report released), it does not include a breakdown of expenditures by project.

Following its November inception, e-Diriya saw 50,000 participants in December 2011 alone,
including 23,000 women in the Samurdhi Program.

Box 6.3.20. – e-Ciudadano (Colombia)

In 2008, 200,000 Colombians completed the European Computer Driving License (ECDL)
Foundation’s global computer literacy survey, as administered by ICDL Colombia. Analysis
of the survey demonstrated the large social and economic divide between Colombians with
ICT access and understanding and those citizens who lacked ICT exposure. In response to
these findings, the Colombian Ministry for Information and Communications Technology
(MITIC) and the National Learning Service (SENA) partnered with ICDL Colombia to
increase digital literacy and encourage use of online services such as e-government and
banking amongst marginalized sectors of the population. This partnership led to the creation
of the e-Ciudadano project.

The project expects to provide 75,000 Colombians with basic ICT training and falls under the
Colombian national ICT plan Vive Digital, which aims to connect all citizens to the Internet
by 2019. Following the training, participants take a certification exam, which serves as
quantifiable evidence of their skills as well as the success of the program. E-Ciudadano
established 88 testing centers throughout Bogota’s two main urban areas and training was
available at facilities where the target group typically congregated, such as public libraries
and community centers. The program also featured e-learning courses so that citizens could
also participate online.

Implementation of the project was divided into three parts. The first two parts focused heavily
on marketing e-Ciudadano; part one addressed participant recruitment while the second
worked toward the utilization pre-existing public and private infrastructure to deliver the
training. The campaign initially targeted organizations via mail correspondence and phone
conversations, at which point senior-level members were directed to www.e-
ciudadano.org.co, the website created to serve as a central administrative hub. The last phase
of the project examined the candidate certification process.



                                                                                            68
The training portion of the e-Ciudadano program was provided at no cost to all participants
and the first 25,000 candidates took the certification exam free of charge. These costs were
covered in part by the Colombian government and also through the support of Fundación
Telefónica, Telefónica’s branch responsible for promoting educational, social, and cultural
growth through increased access to ICTs. The ECDL Foundation and Webscience A.I., an
automated test developer, provided funding for the management and maintenance of the
testing centers while volunteers conducted the training.

Initial analysis of the e-Ciudadano program demonstrated that successful candidates
displayed an increased awareness of the benefits of the Internet access, with many seeking
additional ICT training upon completion of the course. Further, participants demonstrated
higher confidence and reported less social exclusion than many of their peers in the same
social group.

Digital literacy for women

Digital divide based on gender differences has been studied in the emerging world
with a varying set of evidence about its level of importance. While explanatory
variables of this situation tend to be focused on socio-economic and occupational
factors, digital literacy programs with a women focus could act as a contributor to
addressing some of the gender barriers.

Most of the digital literacy programs targeted to women have as primary objectives,
reduce the digital divide, promote social inclusion and improve the employability
profile of women. Alternatively, the program can be focused on educating
homemakers (married women no in the labor force) under the assumption that, as
principal decision maker regarding household finances, the path to broadband
adoption in the home is led through women. Such as the case of the Ten Million
People Internet Education project in Korea.

According to Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009), there is no consistent content structure of
women digital literacy programs: some involve standard computer courses while
others entail courses tailored to specific users’ needs. This lack of standardization of
program content is because it is common to find users in this group that have strong
skills in very narrow ICT areas (e.g. social networking, text messaging), while being
weak in others (e.g. conducting Internet queries). In fact, it is very common to find
situations where the household already has a computer and broadband access, but due
to limited digital literacy on the part of women, the technology is only accessible to
the children or their father.

In general, the target of digital literacy programs focused on women comprises the
unemployed, low income, low schooling, at home with small or ill children, living in
settlements, belonging to marginalized ethnic groups, and the elderly. In many cases,
the pressure to be included in the digital society is increasing for mothers of children

                                                                                         69
in school since teaching institutions often use broadband for communicating with
parents.

The following best practices in this kind of programs have been identified:

      All instructors should be females with experience in teaching computer skills;
       students appreciate the notion of “women teaching women”, addressing not
       only a skills gap but providing a remedy to unequal opportunities in the
       workplace
      Additionally, the instructors could be unemployed women with prior
       computer experience; as a result, the program could also become a vehicle for
       reintegrating unemployed women in the workforce
      Include a mentoring process in the program, which is based on younger peers
       or attendees to prior sessions
      Advertise programs in order to promote enrollment at places such as nurseries,
       schools, playgrounds, and markets
      Alternatively, kindergartens and schools could become places for recruiting
       program participants
      Provide flexibility in course delivery to allow for occasional absences
      Structure lessons as “learner-centric” rather than “curriculum-centric”,
       building the program around what attendees say they want to learn (e.g. use
       online search of job opportunities)
      Consider partnering in delivery of the program with associations or non-
       governmental organizations focused on advancing women welfare and/or
       enhancing the social inclusion of women by means of technology
      If focusing on women belonging to a specific ethnic group, tailor the material
       to be delivered in suitable language, and customize it to the cultural
       idiosyncrasies of the targeted group
      In some cases, it could be very productive to involve the whole family in
       learning ICT skills in order to motivate mothers to participate

Box 6.3.21. – Telecentre Women: Digital Literacy Campaign (global)

Partnering with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its 192 Member States
and 700 Sector Members, the Telecentre.org Foundation announced in April 2011 the
commencement of its global Women’s Digital Literacy Campaign. The Philippines-based
NGO will utilize its 100,000 worldwide telecenters to provide one million disadvantaged
women with basic ICT training by the end of 2012. Over 300 organizations and 200,000
individuals power the telecenters. The program addresses two types of women: a) the women
who will gain employment serving as trainers and managers at the telecenters and b) the
women who lack formal education and literacy and will benefit from basic ICT skills.

According to the United Nations, 60% of women in developing countries serve as unpaid
workers in their family homes. This program asserts that basic digital literacy will connect
women to the technological revolution, offering the opportunity to participate in the global
economy. Female agricultural workers, for instance, can use new technology to find market
information and better gauge the prices they charge for their products and pay for supplies.
Women who stay at home with their children can utilize the Internet to become
“homepreneurs” or find Internet-based income opportunities. Per ITU Secretary-General Dr.
Hamadoun Touré, “With technology now widely recognized as a critical enabler for socio-
economic development, this campaign will further reinforce ITU’s global efforts to promote

                                                                                         70
the digital inclusion of women, and will be a key element in achieving Millennium
Development Goal 3 on gender equality.”

The total budget for the campaign is US$ 149 mn. The largest expenditure comes from the
US$ 110 mn investment in the development of community ICT centers. Facility rentals will
cost an additional US$ 12.5 mn and trainers’ salaries will total US$ 25 mn. Project
management and the creation of training materials will account for the remaining US$ 1.5
mn.

The ITU and the Telecentre.org Foundation will encourage national governments, private
corporations, and international organizations to contribute to the campaign by offering the
telecenters such resources as digital curricula in local languages and trainers. The ITU’s
Telecommunication Development Bureau (BDT) will also supply digital literacy training
materials and curricula, much of which was developed for use in community centers and
telecenters. The ITU will also offer its distance-learning platform. Trainers receive training
through the telecentre.org Foundation network, offered at academies, universities, and other
training centers. To ensure quality standards, the Foundation will monitor all training and
track progress on a joint ITU-telecenter.org website.

By September 2012, the telecentre.org website reported that the program had trained 384,062
women, though countless additional women have likely benefitted from the campaign. The
program is built on the “Train the Trainer” model, which encourages participants to then train
their peers.

Box 6.3.22. – eHomemakers (Malaysia)

Between 1998 and 2000, the Malaysian grassroots organization “Mothers for Mothers” held
six conferences, all of which featured the stories of successful women “homepreneurs.” The
events allowed like-minded women to network and pool resources, sharing their experiences
with home-based work.

As the demand for additional conferences continued to grow, a small group of volunteers
created the “mom4mom.com” website to provide mothers and homemakers with the platform
to network and access information without attending the physical conferences. Unfortunately,
many women in the country did not have access to computers and Internet. Even amongst
those women who did have access, few possessed the technological savvy to access the portal
and employ the Internet’s benefits productively in their work. Without this access, women
faced even fewer employment opportunities than their male counterparts.

In response, Mothers for Mothers submitted a proposal in 2001 for the eHomemakers
grassroots community to the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment. The
ministry subsequently awarded the organization with the Demonstrator Application Grant
(DAG). With this funding, mom4mom.com evolved into the website ehomemakers.net,
which links homeworkers into an e-community and, at the time, employed more than 60 full-
time workers at its virtual office.


                                                                                           71
Among other services, the website offers interactive tools and chat rooms. More than 7,000
members receive its monthly e-newsletters. eHomemakers has evolved into an e-network
connecting more than 15,000 Malaysian women that promotes the use of ICT such as mobile
phones, the Internet, and the Distributed Work Management Application (DWMA) web-to-
hand platform. DWMA relies on ADSL, Internet access, and mobile SMS to connect the
women to the larger network. With this technology, the women can then participate in the
economy as homeworkers, tele-workers, or business owners. Members of the community also
receive – and assist in – the training, mentorship, and counseling that encourages self-
sufficiency. The majority of members is located in urban areas and is in the 30 – 50 year age
range and has grown to include grandmothers, unmarried women, and even some men who
work from home.

While the Malaysian government provided the initial funding through the one-year DAG
grant, eHomemakers has generated additional revenue through advertisements on the website
and consultancy fees and private contributions have come from corporate sponsorships and
member donations. As a social enterprise, it supports itself by providing services for a social
purpose.

Box 6.3.23. – DigiGirlz Day (United Arab Emirates)

At DigiGirlz Day, a one-day conference held at multiple locations around the world, high
school girls interact with Microsoft employees to learn about the technology industry. Girls
also receive career planning assistance and information about technology positions and attend
Microsoft product demonstrations. In its mission to encourage girls to consider working in
the industry, DigiGirls also hosts its High Tech Camps, offering girls a glimpse into the high-
tech product development process. Beyond the conferences and camps, the program also
offers online courses with instruction on how to build websites with HTML or create
podcasts.

In April 2009, Microsoft partnered with the UAE Ministry of Education and the Center for
Women and Technology for the Arab Region (CWTAR) to host the Gulf Region’s first ever
DigiGirlz Day at Dubai Women’s College. 200 girls from 25 Dubai high schools attended the
event, where they each participated in one of five product workshops: Microsoft Research
AutoCollage, Windows Movie Maker, Windows LiveTM, PopFlyTM, blogging, and
Microsoft Expression® Web. Many of the girls admitted that they rarely used computers, and
that the program raised their awareness of computer-based services and technology-related
career opportunities.

The girls all had the option to take the Microsoft Digital Literacy Certificate Test at one of 10
proctored testing stations. 30 questions covering basic computing skills comprised the exam,
and those girls who passed it received a Microsoft Digital Literacy Certificate. Of the 200
girls in attendance, 50 took the exam but very few scored high enough to receive the
certificate.



                                                                                              72
Following the success of DigiGirlz Days Dubai, Microsoft planned an additional five
conferences throughout the region. The low scores on the certification exam signaled a lack
of quality digital literacy education, and in response, Microsoft included testing stations at

Digital literacy programs in rural isolated areas

Programs focused on rural isolated areas represent a particular case of the examples
presented above. As such, they address the complexities of delivering training in
underserved regions of a country. The primary foci of these programs is bridging the
digital divide and enhancing the employability profile of the targeted population. In
this case, the initiatives tend to be large scale and centrally managed and focus on
accessibility. While the central government plays a prominent role in program
management, it is not unusual to find private sector participants or NGOs.

In many countries, the rural population faces multiple disadvantages over its urban
counterparts: higher unemployment rates and fewer employment opportunities, lower
literacy rates, and a larger proportion of citizens living below the poverty line. To
make matters more complicated, these regions have been traditionally underserved in
terms of ICT and reflect lower broadband penetration rates. At the same time,
broadband connections could potentially reduce these disparities and the digital
divide. Unlike voice services, it has become increasingly less expensive to
communicate and stay in touch over broadband as well.

Connectivity offers access to services that may otherwise be inaccessible due to
geographical limitations, opening the opportunity to such tools as e-health, e-
government, and e-education. Further, it allows residents to stay connected with
friends and family and informed of current events. Connectivity also means more
employment opportunity, offering the means for citizens to search for and apply to
jobs.

Without a perfunctory knowledge of how to use computers and broadband, however,
the advantages of these tools are lost. While government involvement may spur the
development of infrastructure in many instances – particularly as the private sector
sees less financial incentive to invest in areas with more geographical barriers and
less disposable income – successful rural training programs many times require
assistance from corporations or organizations. The corporations can offer financial
support and the benefit of experience, while grassroots organizations may have more
success in engaging the people.




                                                                                           73
As many rural communities may not “be commercially viable on their own,”
broadband access can afford the utilization of a variety of tools to promote
development and sustainability. Rural farmers, for instance, can access weather
reports and market information while utilizing agriculture software to improve their
business production. Similar examples have been seen for fishermen, basket weavers,
health care workers, and the like.

Access is key, as this population cannot easily utilize the physical resources found in
urban areas. To this degree, successful programs have:

           Offered online training
           Built local access centers or cybercafés in areas with limited ICT
           Implemented initiatives in public schools or safe houses
           Partnered with local governments
           Deployed trainers to rural areas

Rural broadband training programs bridge the digital divide, ultimately reducing the
disparities between the urban-rural populations.

Box 6.3.24 – Intel Easy Steps Program (Philippines)

The Intel Easy Steps Program offers basic digital literacy training to adults with very little
computer exposure. Topics focus on everyday computer use, from Internet searches to word
processing to email. As a result, participants leave the program with the necessary skillset to
communicate with friends and family and also to research and apply for jobs, draft resumes,
and create presentations. With an increasing number of positions requiring ICT skills, this
knowledge increases citizens’ employability and self-sufficiency while enhancing the
country’s economic competitiveness in the international market.

Intel provides the program free of charge to governments and NGOs, which then implement it
on a local basis. In November 2010, at the 6th Knowledge Exchange Conference on
Community eCenters in the Philippines, the country’s Commission on Information and
Communications Technology (CICT) signed a memorandum of understanding with Intel
Microelectronics Philippines to deploy the initiative. This agreement followed Intel’s push to
address the lack of digital literacy of the region’s government employees and adults in rural
communities.

Instruction is offered in a variety of environments, from vocational training centers, to
shared-access centers, to the workplace. Intel identified 1,000 community eCenters across the
country to host the training and the program considered additional locations for new centers.
The small countryside town of Tanuan, for instance, partnered with Intel to create its
Community e-Center (CeC), using the Easy Steps program to bring basic digital literacy
instruction to its citizens. The manager of the center reported that, since the program’s
inception, the town saw a rise in the number digitally literate farmers, fishermen, and health
workers.

For those citizens unable to attend a workshop in person, Intel Philippines now offers
practical digital literacy training through 10 Intel Easy Steps Facebook applications. Each
application simulates a real world situation – such as the behavior of a word processor or
spreadsheet – allowing users to create such products as resumes and budget plans via the
social media website. They can then post their progress as a status message to track
accomplishments and share with friends.


                                                                                            74
The country’s Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) –
responsible for the vocational programs in thousands of institutions across the country -
partnered with Intel to expand the reach of the program and improve the digital literacy skills
of its students. By December 2011, TESDA trainers worked with a total of 3,300 grassroots
users hailing from 17 regional training centers.

Box 6.3.25 – Grameenphone Community Information Centers (Bangladesh)

In late 2009, Grameenphone - Bangladesh’s largest mobile operator – partnered with
Microsoft to implement a digital literacy program developed specifically for the country’s
rural students. As a joint venture between international telecommunications provider Telenor
and the non-profit Grameen Telecom Corporation, which is affiliated with the micro-finance
pioneer Grameen Bank, Grameenphone has a history of promoting affordable telecom
services throughout the country.

This partnership took Microsoft’s well-established international digital literacy curriculum
and first reproduced it in Bengali and then targeted the country’s rural students, unemployed
youth, and women. The module focuses on basic IT skills such as Internet access,
applications to increase workplace productivity, and computer security. Beyond coursework
and training, the program also offers related resources for further learning and self-
assessment exercises. Each section concludes with an examination, and students who
successfully pass receive a certificate.

Citizens can access the curriculum through other Grameenphone projects such as school
cyclone shelters, Information Boats, and education institutions as well as through the more
than 500 authorized Grameenphone Community Information Centers (GPCICs). Since 2006,
GPCICs have provided the rural population of Bangladesh with access to Internet, voice, and
video conferencing services. Each center houses at least a computer, a printer, a scanner, a
web cam, and an EDGE-enabled modem that allows for Internet connections. While the
centers receive technical support from the GSM Association, local entrepreneurs manage and
run them like small businesses. Grameenphone provides these managers with training and
support.

The vast majority of the country lives in rural areas; by targeting this sector and providing
them with ITC access, the program effectively reduces the geographical digital divide. In
turn, the GPCICs aim to alleviate poverty, bring education to the underprivileged, create
employment opportunities for the youth, and promote local entrepreneurship. Grameen has
worked with many international corporations, organizations, and multilaterals in support of
this mission. Microsoft provides citizens with the digital literacy curriculum and the
examination free of charge. In the partnership, Grameen is the licensee, Microsoft the
licensor, and the GPCICs and other Grameen centers the authorized centers.

Box 6.3.26. – Ford-Rotary Digital Literacy Program (India)

In 2010, Tamil Nadu’s Ministry of Information Technology commenced its digital literacy
program targeting the state’s rural population. The program – a partnership between Ford
Business Services and Rotary International – provides beneficiary institutions with the
hardware and software necessary to provide digital literacy training.

Through the alliance, Ford Business Services - a subsidiary of US-owned Ford Motor
Company - initially donated 150 computers to 11 partner groups. The groups included
organizations that focused on women empowerment, underprivileged youth, and rural
communities as well as vocational training institutions. Computer novices can now access the
20-hour training online through any of the participating institutions. The curriculum includes
six modules and uses the digital literacy CD “Know It,” designed to train citizens in basic
computer functions, such as the use of the Microsoft suite, Internet, and email. Users interact
with the CD’s step-by-step online teaching tool that also offers practice quizzes and activities.
All software was locally developed with rural users in mind.

The State of Tamil Nadu has demonstrated a commitment to enhancing ICT access and
understanding throughout the region, recognizing the potential for this technology to bridge
the digital divide. Prior to this initiative, it had already created an IT plan and an e-waste
policy while investigating ways to increase e-government services. While Tamil Nadu is one
of India’s most urbanized states, its rural village population is marked by lower levels of
literacy and fewer employment opportunities, both of which affect economic development in
the region.

Since the program’s inception, Ford has donated more than 700 computers and connected
with nearly 10,000 people in the state. In September 2012, Ford India inaugurated the Ford-
Rotary Digital Literacy Center. The center provides the underprivileged population with the
computer literacy training necessary to enhance their employment options. The center offers
multiple courses throughout the day, instructing participants on basic computer use.

Digital literacy for persons with disabilities



                                                                                              76
Recent literature has highlighted the need to deploy digital literacy programs targeted
to persons with disabilities (e.g. visually impaired, hearing impaired, etc.). Most of
these programs respond to the need of improving the quality of life and promoting
social inclusion of the disabled population. Their focus is to build broadband and
Internet usage capabilities. Courses are tailored to the specific needs of the
disadvantaged population.

While most of these programs are implemented at the national scale, it is not
uncommon to observe the participation of non-government organizations (e.g. interest
groups, community organizations) as program stakeholders. Their participation is
structured around partnerships with public agencies. The advantage of including these
types of organizations in the structuring and delivery of digital literacy programs is
that they tend to have a better understanding of the needs of the group being targeted.

While most programs of this type have been deployed in the industrialized world
(Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009) surveyed 95 such programs in their review of EU
initiatives), the examples provided below are used to demonstrate the benefits of
extending these initiatives in emerging countries.

Among the best practices in the deployment of digital literacy for persons with
disabilities, the following have been highlighted:

       Organize the digital literacy programs in centers already focused in helping
        disabled citizens
       If physical facilities focused on the disabled do not pre-exist, ensure that new
        centers are handicap friendly, equipped with special tables, with plenty of
        room allowed for wheel chairs. Computer should also be designed to fit the
        needs of the disabled
       From an equipment perspective, special customized hardware should include
        voice output devices, special large-surface keyboards, trackballs, voice
        activated devices, etc.
       The centers and digital literacy training should be opened to people with all
        kinds of disabilities: physical, psychosocial, hearing impaired, cognitive
        difficulties like dyspraxia, dyslexia, dysorthography, intellectual disabilities,
        etc.
       Training should be adapted to each disabled situation, resulting in the
        development of special training materials
       However, start-up training modules should include internet access, word
        processing, spreadsheet usage, e-mailing, digital presentations, information
        search, and web-banking
       Try to enroll professionals trained to work with people with disabilities (e.g.
        special needs teachers, occupational therapists, social workers, etc.); these
        professionals should be trained to deliver ICT literacy programs
       Be prepared to handle individualized coaching
       Consider distributing used computers donated by private companies that
        participants could take for use in their homes and workplaces
       While computers are provided free of charge, consider charging a nominal
        fee for course attendance to create an incentive for ongoing participation



                                                                                      77
        Conduct on-going monitoring of the latest development of technologies to
         support people with disabilities
        Structure a feedback mechanism, where participants fill out feedback forms
         to improve training and adapt it to the needs of attendees; this could be
         complemented with random follow-up calls to former participants
        Consider organizing a placement function to help participants find jobs; the
         placement function could organize a portal to link up with companies
         interesting in providing employment opportunities to disabled individuals
        Funding could be organized with contributions from the private sector (a
         telecommunications company provides broadband access, a software
         company provides the training modules, one-time contribution for hardware
         acquisition) and the educational system (universities could supply technical
         support and pro bono training staff); this could allow programs to be set up
         without any dependence upon government funding

Box 6.3.27. – DICOMP-S.NET Project (Europe)

The Digital Competence Screenreader Network – or DICOMP.S-NET - project ran from
January 2007 through June 2008, focusing on increasing digital literacy within Europe’s blind
and visually impaired population. The project targeted the blind after acknowledging that this
sector faced educational and professional discrimination as a result of their disability.
Similarly, they could not benefit from many of the other digital literacy training initiatives
across the region that would potentially increase their opportunities for economic
advancement.

To address this issue, the project provided participants with a screen reader designed for the
blind and visually impaired free of charge. The screen reader was compatible with the
Microsoft suite to promote the utilization of technology applicable to every day life. To offer
ICT use instruction and support, the program recruited blind and visually impaired tutors and
provided them with training so that they could in turn assist participants with implementation
of the screen reader and demonstrate its functions. Tutors were trained using an e-learning
application.

The product dissemination phase of the project took considerable planning, and first began by
distributing the screen readers to partner groups in supporting countries, which then
conducted pilots and testing to suggest necessary adaptations for their specific populations.
All content, such as texts and tools, was translated into the most relevant language of the
country so as to reach and appeal to the largest possible group.

The European Commission funded the project in part and partners included training
institutions and non-profit organizations across Europe. Berufsförderungsinstitut Steiermark
(Vocational Promotion Institute) took ownership of the project. Founded and owned by the
Austrian Federation of Trade Unions and the Chamber of Labor, the non-profit has offered
vocational training and adult education for more than 50 years and the European Union has
commissioned many of its projects. While specific financial data was not released, the
approximate implementation costs fell in the €300,000 – €499,000 range. The economic
impact was valued in the €49,000 - €299,000 range.

Per an assessment by the European Union, the program produced the following results:
         Creation of a free screen reader in all partner languages, including all
            accompanying documents (menu navigation, help texts, manuals);
         Tutor training for blind and visually impaired people for the screen reader,
            partially via an e-learning application

                                                                                            78
           Dissemination through national information campaigns
           National road - shows for the screen reader
           International conference and symposium

This assessment concluded that the successful training of tutors had the most significant
impact on the DICOMP.S-NET project.

Box 6.3.28. – National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program (United States)

In October 2010, President Barack Obama signed the 21st Century Communication and Video
Accessibility Act (CVAA), ensuring that the visually and hearing impaired population had
access to communication technology such as “video, voice, text, and other capabilities of
smartphones, digital television, and internet-based video programming.” The Act serves as
an extension of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which addressed
discrimination in a variety of sectors, including telecommunications. The ADA resulted in,
among other requirements, closed captioning for television programming and hearing aid
compatibility for telephones.

As the means of communication continue to change rapidly, the CVAA addresses such
technology as VoIP, Internet streaming, and smartphones. The same requirements for
televisions and telephones will now apply to cell phones, smartphones, and IP-enabled
phones as well as specified communications devices. Manufacturers must now also create
devices with the needs of the disabled population in mind, incorporating, for instance, means
for the visually impaired to view Internet pages and emails. The act also targets video
programming, including digital television, set-top boxes, DVR devices, and streaming
Internet, though it does not place requirements on user-generated programming sites like
YouTube. All devices that receive or play video programming must have closed-captioning
and video description capabilities and provide access to emergency information.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages the multi-year implementation of
the CVAA, creating advisory committees to oversee the progress and reporting to Congress.
In 2012, the agency established the National Deaf-Blind Equipment Distribution Program
(NDBEDP) as part of the CVAA. In partnership with the Helen Keller National Center and
the Perkins School for the Blind, the program provides the necessary equipment and training
to help the low-income blind-deaf population connect with the community through the use of
ICT. Equipment can include hardware, software, and applications so long as it is designed to
address telecommunications accessibility.

The FCC began the program’s pilot by designating one certified entity in each state plus the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (53 in total) to distribute the
equipment. Certified programs may also provide training on how to use the equipment as
needed. The iCanConnect campaign provides outreach, assessments, telecommunications
technology, and training free of charge to individuals who qualify for the NDBEDP. Only
low-income deaf-blind individuals may participate in the program; the Helen Keller National
Center Act and the Federal Poverty Guidelines determine these qualifications.



                                                                                          79
The CVAA permits the FCC to spend up to US$ 10 mn per year from the
Telecommunications Relay Service Fund to support the program. The pilot program allocated
a minimum US$ 50,000 to each certified distribution entity with additional funding
commensurate with state population size. The Perkins School for the Blind will also receive
US$ 500,000 annually to coordinate and promote the program.

The program will run from July 2012 through July 2014 with the potential for extension.

Digital literacy for the elderly

Generational differences represent another major barrier to broadband adoption.
Typical age cohort where adoption starts declining dramatically in emerging countries
is 40 years old (when controlling for income). In that sense, digital literacy programs
conceived as extension of either universities or secondary schools have proven to be
very valuable in bridging the generational gap. The overall long-term goal of these
programs is to improve social inclusion of the elderly population. The primary
content delivered in this type of programs are standard computer courses, in some
cases tailored specifically to the needs of the elderly (e.g. email to communicate with
the family, photo sharing, use financial applications, purchasing tickets online, etc.).
However, in addition, digital literacy courses for the elderly give seniors an
opportunity to meet people and develop a social network.

The advantage of including non-government organizations in the case of programs for
the handicapped population discussed above is also applicable to initiatives focused
on the elderly.

Among the best practices in the deployment of digital literacy for the elderly, the
following have been highlighted:

       Carefully determine needs of targeted population given the different
        requirements that have been observed across the segment
       Create a website supporting the program, which would include self-study
        course modules for use on an ad-hoc fashion in community centers
       Self-study programs should comprise online courses, complemented with
        traditional printed materials
       Include an entertainment section (media, music) in the website to enhance
        attractiveness


                                                                                          80
       Strive to coordinate the program with cultural organizations that are part of
        the user community (for example, they can act as advertising vehicles for
        digital literacy programs)
       Equip program with self-contained units that could be used via touch screens
        and a simple menu system
       If program is offered at a community center, ensure continuous presence of
        host instructors that can answer inquiries, take registrations, and be
        responsible for all technical logistics
       Make sure that instructors stay after classes to act as tutors for the seniors that
        stay in the center working on the computers
       Provide an environment where users can share their experiences in dealing
        with technical issues with peers, which constitutes an important retention
        mechanism
       Digital literacy programs for the elderly attain better results when they are
        delivered in an environment that provides the opportunity to meet other
        people and break their social isolation
       It is sometimes useful to involve students of upper secondary schools in the
        role of volunteer “digital facilitators” to teach internet browsing and e-mail
        use to the elders; the one-to-one relationship between the young tutor and the
        trainee (a concept called “intergenerational learning”) improves the learning
        experience
       Focus on teaching material that is immediately transferable and applicable to
        the senior everyday life

Box 6.3.29. – Senior-Info-Mobile (Germany)

In 1996, the German federal government established a task force to promote the inclusion of
various sectors of the population into the growing information society. Under this task force
emerged the “Older People in the Information Society” working group, which brought to
light senior citizens’ lack of exposure to ICT otherwise found in an educational or
professional context. To address the disparity, members of the committee proposed the
Senior-Info-Mobile project, which came to fruition in 1998. By establishing a mobile Internet
café, the project served to bring the technology to people. Offering exhibits and training
inside the “café” further raised awareness of the capabilities of ICT.

Most of the tutors involved in the project were also senior citizens, which resulted in little
resistance to the training on the part of participants. The group-oriented instruction also
created a more comfortable environment in which to learn about and adapt to the new
technology. Many of the senior citizens who participated in the program reported that prior to
Senior-Info-Mobile, they had never before used a computer or the Internet. A study revealed
that, following the project, 50% of participants had interest in learning more about the
Internet. Many respondents said that they would have more of an inclination to invest in their
own computers if they could access customer service when needed. 70% of visitors to the bus
were over age 60, and more than 20% were at least 70 years old.

The Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs provided financial support for Senior-Info-Mobile.
Partners IBM Germany and German Telecom donated the two-level omnibus and telephone
connections, respectively, while T-Online sponsored the Internet accounts. The bus was re-
designed and equipped with a Local Area Network (LAN) and six Internet terminals. It also
featured a PC designed specially for blind and visually impaired people. An additional PC
and AV equipment allowed tutors to host presentations.


                                                                                           81
Additional multi-sector private sponsors funded and managed promotion campaigns, public
relations, and volunteer coordination. As a result of much media attention and advertisement,
more than two million citizens over age 50 heard of the program through television or radio.
Nearby European countries requested that the bus travel to their countries following this push
in advertising.

Despite its success, at the end of the program, the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs
reduced its funding. The program attempted to refinance its costs by requiring fees from local
municipalities, but many of these regions had tight budgets and could not afford to offer
assistance.

In the first three years of the project, the mobile café traveled to more than 60 German
municipalities, with over 60,000 citizens between the ages of 50 and 96 visiting the Senior-
Info-Mobile bus and taking part in trainings and demonstrations. Beyond directly impacting
participants who visited the bus and took part in the demonstrations and training, the project
inspired organizations to incorporate senior ICT training into their work plans.
Despite the long reach of the program, many rural areas expressed disappointment that the
bus did not reach their citizens. Some cities where Senior-Info-Mobile saw a high demand
subsequently designed Internet cafes and ICT training programs with the older population in
mind.

Box 6.3.30. – SeniorWeb (Netherlands)

In the 1990s, the Netherlands’ Ministry of Economic Affairs partnered with the Ministry of
Health, Welfare, and Sport to finance a program that would promote ICT use amongst its
older population. Along with other suggestions on how to address this goal while at the same
time providing digital literacy training came the SeniorWeb portal, which offered activities
and campaigns designed with senior citizens in mind.

Launched in 1996, the website seniorweb.nl now serves as a home page for citizens in the
Netherlands over age 50, offering information, advice, and links to Internet-related websites.
It emphasizes user interaction, encouraging members to place advertisements or take part in
activities like photo sharing contests. On their own, users have developed chat rooms,
discussion lists, and “web families.” Seniors can customize their individual experiences by
choosing to utilize different features ranging from the helpdesk to email listservs that connect
members with similar hobbies and online courses.

Membership includes digital literacy training courses conducted by SeniorWeb
“ambassadors.” The ambassadors are all volunteer senior citizens who understand the needs
of this age group. They not only teach the lessons, but also organize the courses and make
arrangements with local educational institutions or Internet cafes while offering technical
support as needed. The face-to-face lessons are especially valuable for those senior citizens
with low education and literacy levels who may otherwise not benefit from on-screen
instruction requiring considerable reading comprehension skills.

The ultimate goal of the program is to promote online participation amongst senior citizens.
The project recognizes that the older population may require additional training to increase
ICT awareness amongst the older population, which did not grow up using computers or
benefit from digital literacy courses in the education system. The government sees the elderly
as a high priority, as the country will have over four million citizens over the age of 65 by the

                                                                                              82
year 2030, amounting to nearly one-quarter of the population. In comparison, only 14% of the
population was over age 65 in 2005.

To join SeniorWeb, each member pays an annual 24 Euro (US$ 31) fee. The fee includes
access to all areas of the website as well as a subscription to the quarterly magazine, Enter,
and an annual CD-Rom. Partner organizations offer discounts on their products to members.

SeniorWeb’s network now includes 2,500 ambassadors and 110,000 members and the site
sees more than 20,000 visitors per day. Research and analysis of the program indicates that
the program has increased digital literacy amongst an even higher share of the population as
members informally share their learned knowledge with their families, friends, and members
of the community. The program has expanded to reach the 50+ population in Germany,
Austria, and Switzerland.

Box 6.3.31. – Senior Connects (United States)

The Senior Connects Corporation has offered digital literacy services to senior citizens since
2003, increasing their computer access and ICT skills by working with senior centers,
retirement apartments, and independent living facilities. High school student-volunteers teach
basic computer and Internet courses and in some instances, their schools provide the
computers and broadband access necessary for the training. The program is based on the
“train the trainer” premise; volunteers first receive training before working with participants.

Participants do not pay to take the classes, which typically only have one or two students per
tutor. The program is customized to fit the needs of the participants - who may have little or
no experience with computers – using the pre-established Senior Connects Methodology.

Starting a Senior Connects program at a living facility, senior center, or senior apartment
complex does not require any cost. Ideally, the chosen facilities will already have computers
and Internet access. If the facility does not have such capabilities, Senior Connects offers
resources for individuals or organizations looking for funding. While Senior Connects
operates as a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation and does accept donations, it does not
permit volunteers to ask for compensation from participants in the program.

The Senior Connects website offers instructions for potential volunteers, with topics ranging
from establishing contact with senior centers to interacting with students to conducting the
actual training. It also provides detailed surveys and lesson plans that the volunteers can use
as well as information on college scholarships, whitepapers, and useful resources.

In the first year alone, the Senior Connects program worked with more than 11,000 residents
and this number exceeded 50,000 in 2010. By 2008, the program had provided computers to
more than 100 senior citizen facilities. Senior Connects now operates as part of the Net



                                                                                             83
Literacy project, a larger initiative that came to fruition as Senior Connects offered more
services to other sectors of the population.

Studies of Senior Connects found that not all citizens had the same needs or experienced the
same rewards from the program. Participants living in independent living facilities tended to
be a) older and b) more likely to have some sort of physical or mental impairment as
compared with their counterparts living in retirement apartments. As a result of these factors,
residents of independent living facilities typically entered the program with less technology
know-how and tended to be more technophobic. The program plans to use these findings to
modify its program to train this sector more efficiently.

In general, however, the study demonstrated the achievements of Senior Connects. 80% of
participants had never before used a computer prior to the program, but one year following
the course, 93 – 96% of senior students reported using the Internet more than twice a month.
The study attributed the following factors, amongst others, to the Senior Connects’ success:
one-on-one training, training provided free of charge, building computer labs where seniors
already lived, modifiable training materials, and emphasizing the value of Internet use in
connecting with friends and family.

6.3.2. Community Access Centers

Deployment of community access centers can assume different forms. In some cases,
broadband access centers are installed in existing facilities as a complement of
activities already performed at those locations (e.g. public libraries). Other practices
point to the creation of stand-alone access centers exclusively focused in providing
free access to broadband services.

This section will review the different options, paid or free, for providing broadband
access. The objective is to enhance Internet access in contexts where affordability
represents an insurmountable barrier to adoption.

6.3.2.1. Types of shared or community access centers

Digital Community Centers

Digital community centers represent the most common approach to providing public
access to broadband, while organizing technology awareness and education programs.
The deployment of community centers combines a top-down and bottom-up
governance framework, whereby a public policy initiative triggers the involvement of
communities in the management of each unit. The sum of grass-root community
organizations dedicated to managing each center is coordinated by a steering
committee, who works with each center to develop plans for extending broadband
service, and providing technology awareness and training programs. In some cases,
the steering committee works with a dedicated staff that acts as a resource. In that
sense, the central dedicated staff becomes an enabler of the community-based effort
rather than an implementer.


                                                                                            84
By virtue of their decentralized governance framework, centers become independent
from contributions of the national government, with all funding support being
provided by either local governments or the private sector. This structure appears to
be also scalable across regions of a given country.

Digital Community Centers have become highly suited to tackle technology and
economic development programs within rural contexts.

The following best practices have identified in this domain:

       Establish a permanent channel of communication between the community and
        the managers of the community access center, involving the community
        directly and encouraging to take ownership of the activities of the center
       Community involvement could entail nominating local technology champions,
        who assemble community support, lead technology needs assessment and
        planning efforts, and work to introduce technology initiatives to meet
        community needs
       Construct digital community centers as a technology and entrepreneurship
        hubs within communities; as such, the centers provide free broadband access
        to the public, and, at the same time, a variety of fee-based business and
        technology services to local non-profits and businesses
       Among the entrepreneurship services that the digital centers can provide are
        employee training, modern office space, technology expertise and business
        consulting
       Put in place a full technical service team that ensures that all equipment is
        always working properly
       Besides hosting IT courses and provide access, make sure that the center
        functions as venues where people can meet and enjoy other cultural activities
        and entertainment
       In terms of advertising and promotional activities, the center should post
        monthly newsletters on its website, addressing issues for small businesses,
        such as fundraising opportunities, or dealing with foreign worker
        authorization permits
       Consider outsourcing some of the center functions

Box 6.3.32. – Pontos de Cultura (Brazil)

As part of the Brazilian Ministry of Culture’s larger program, Cultura Viva, the Pontos de
Cultura initiative is a socio-digital inclusion program that develops public digital spaces
throughout the country to encourage citizens to create digital culture. By providing citizens
with free, open-source software and broadband access at these telecenters, the initiative
promotes technology as a tool to spur the spread and creation of digital culture, thereby
affirming Brazil’s cultural identity.

Individual communities take charge of their ponto’s financial matters, managing the center
autonomously, although they all have access to a network over which they can work together
to share ideas and problem solve. The pontos have the potential to generate income for these
communities, which can customize the services of the centers to fit the needs of their
residents. Once the Ministry of Culture deems it an official Ponto de Cultura, the center
receives a digital multimedia kit, which guarantees users broadband access so that they can
share their work. It also includes a multimedia studio complete with professional-grade audio,

                                                                                           85
video, software development, text, and imaging technology. Equipe Cultura Digital and local
grassroots organizations offer training on how to use these tools and also on the benefits of
broadband in transmitting their ideas.

As part of the program, the Cultura Digitale Equipe (digital culture team) hosts workshops
that focus on educating the community on how to use new technology to best suit their needs.
The pontos de cultura receive a monthly stipend of €1000 for the first two years, at whi ch
point they should sustain themselves. The GESAC Program of the Ministry of
Communications provides this funding as part of the aforementioned media kit.

While the centers are run autonomously and funding lasts for two years, the pontos must
continually report their progress to the Ministry of Culture to ensure that they stay on track
and align with the Ministry’s overall mission of promoting digital culture. The program has
faced criticism for not establishing qualitative indicators by which to judge its efficacy. There
are currently 1,000 pontos de cultura throughout the country, but the government plans on
building an additional 9,000 within the next two years.

Box 6.3.33. – Puntos de Acceso (Venezuela)

Venezuela’s Puntos de Acceso program marked the country’s first step toward the provision
of universal telecom services. Each punto de acceso provides citizens with access to ICT
services and training, which focuses on building ICT skills that enhance users’ educational,
cultural, and economic activities while encouraging information exchange and increased
communication. Each center is designed with the needs of various members of the
community in mind – from workers, to students, to professionals – and also makes provisions
for the people with handicaps or special needs.

Universal access is expected to decrease the social divide by allowing all citizens – regardless
of their geographical location on socio-economic situation – equal access to information and
telecommunications. To do so, the plan must work to provide the necessary infrastructure
while also incorporating the proper training and education as it relates to ICT. The Puntos de
Acceso project specifically aims to bring fixed-line and Internet services to the general public
while ensuring that proper training accompanies these services. Proper training, the plan
follows, will allow citizens to use ICT effectively and ultimately increase productivity and
improve their quality of life.

Per the Venezuelan regulator, CONATEL, the sectors of the population who do not have
access to ICT services also tend to suffer from social exclusion, economic insufficiency, and
a lack of basic essentials like food, shelter, and education. These struggles manifest in high
unemployment rates, lack of infrastructure and public services, and sanitary deficiencies. The
population groups most likely to face these issues include ethnic minorities, handicapped
persons, the elderly, and communities in disaster zones or geographically isolated regions.
CONATEL sees the Puntos de Acceso project as a means to providing telecom access to
these groups.



                                                                                              86
In order to ensure that the disadvantaged members of society realize the maximum potential
of increased ICT access, the project offers ICT training and technical qualification courses.
Workshops and seminars are available to teachers and professors, who can in turn share this
instruction with their students.

Prior to implementation, the project first examined the demographics of the country as well as
its existing ICT infrastructure, electricity supply, and potential demand. The Puntos de
Acceso initiative then targeted four states within the country based on these factors,
strategically choosing locations equidistant from areas void of ICT services.

The proposal for the project does not list costs specifically, as the cost of the infrastructure
and operation vary by operator. Per the Telecommunication Statutory Law (LOTEL), the
country’s Universal Service Fund will subsidize the project’s infrastructure expenditures
while promoting market competition. The law requires telecom operators doing business in
the country to contribute 1% of their gross income to the fund in order to finances these costs.
The fund, established in 2000, serves to “offer minimum penetration, access, quality, and
economic accessibility standards, regardless of geographical location” throughout Venezuela.
CONATEL sets the standards for quality and technical requirements. Venezuelan legislation
considers Internet access a necessary factor for development.

To fulfill the obligations of the Universal Service project, Puntos de Acceso addresses:
international standards, functionality, scalability, adaptability, and facility of administration.
Each punto must provide a two-way traffic IP to assure accessibility. For the purpose of the
project, CONATEL made available the following frequency bands: 2300–2400MHz, 5725–
5850MHz, 10,27–10,30GHz, and 10,62–10,65GHz. The program also makes provisions for a
Social Management Program (SMP) to serve as a methodological tool to stimulate new
projects and oversee qualitative evaluation.

Box 6.3.34 – Argentina Conectada (Argentina)

In October 2010, Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced a five -
year plan – and an initial investment of US$ 1.7 bn – for its “Plan Nacional de
Telecomunicacion,” also known as “Argentina Conectada.” Backed by public investment, the
plan covers the deployment of necessary equipment, infrastructure, and services to provide
ICT equipment and training to public school students, extend connectivity to remote areas,
and establish public access ICT centers. Through this initiative, the government dictates the
promotion of broadband growth and the equitable distribution of such services.

The first phase of Argentina Conectada deployed 28 knowledge access centers – known as
Nucleos de Acceso al Conocimiento, or NACs – in public areas throughout the country. Each
NAC provides ICT access and training as well as entertainment and cultural applications. The
training increases skill development while promoting engagement in community affairs.
Through the NACs, users have access to WiFi Internet, personal computers, audio-visual
equipment, and gaming consoles. The plan developed the NACs not only to provide Internet
access, but also to promote e-inclusion and community participation. They offer educational
tools and technology and serve as a point of contact between citizens and their government.
Once this first phase of Argentina Conectada reaches completion, the country will see a total
of 250 NACs.


                                                                                               87
By the end of 2010, the total number of broadband connections in the country rose to 5.22
million, up from 4.26 million one year prior. Residential connections accounted for 4.51
million of the connections while business broadband connections contributed an additional
715,955. In 2012, Argentina now boasts one of the most developed broadband markets in the
region coupled with some of the fastest and least expensive plans.

Box 6.3.35 - Case Study: Thaicom Digital Communities (Thailand)

In 2009, the satellite provider Thaicom launched its Kids Thaicom Project, donating satellite
dish televisions throughout schools in Thailand’s remote regions. Deemed an example of
“innovative corporate social responsibility,” the program not only focuses on the provision of
the equipment, but on fostering an understanding of the benefits of technology amongst the
country’s students by connecting them with worldwide mentors, teachers, and leaders. As the
president of the corporation explained to the children, “They are tools f or you too. Not just
city kids with money.”

Prior to the project, Thailand identified 10,000 rural schools with an inadequate teacher :
student ratio. By virtue of their location, these schools did not have the means to benefit from
the technological advances of the 21st century and its resources. Thaicom then selected 999
schools based on the below criteria, per its website:

• Elementary or secondary school with at least 80-100 students
• Ratio of students per teacher of 20 to 1
• Located in the remote areas and far from the city center
• Does not have a satellite dish to receive educational programs


The participating schools each received a Thaicom satellite dish, DTV receiver, and a TV.
The equipment was installed by both providers hired by Thaicom and by the corporation’s
more than 300 volunteers who donated their time to work with the schools. Thaicom also
covered the connection costs and offered ongoing training and technical support as needed.
Once connected, the schools could access the Internet and educational programs, while
having the freedom to incorporate the technology into the curriculum as they saw fit.

Within a year and a half of the project’s implementation, the project had connected more than
759 schools. By mid-2011, Thaicom expanded the program to use the connected schools as
“sustainable knowledge centers,” utilizing the tools to develop vocational training and small
businesses in rural areas. The project recognized that providing the schools with the
technology not only improved the education of the students, but also raised community
awareness of its benefits.




                                                                                             88
The project selected 2 of the schools to serve as sustainable knowledge center pilot schools,
encouraging the school directors, teachers, and community leaders to work together to
develop a digital community most relevant to local needs. One of the schools, for instance,
considered incorporating such topics as herb processing and mushroom growing. The
involvement of local volunteers and Thaicom employees is credited with the program’s
success, creating a sense of pride amongst the community.

Box 6.3.36 - Case Study: e-Mexico National System (Mexico)

In 2003, under the direction of President Vicente Fox, Mexico launched its “e-Mexico”
initiative, developing 10,000 “Digital Community Centers” in an attempt to connect 90% of
the country to the Internet. From the outset, e-Mexico projected that it would increase the
number of Internet users within the country from 4.5 million to 60 million users. The project
integrated the below objectives:

• Develop the e-México National System as a technological system with social content to
  have a profound impact on the society development.

• Eliminate access barriers to information and services, and reduce the Mexicans digital
  divide between them and with the rest of the world, that through the voice, images and
  data transfer, allow the access to the information delivering, related with education,
  culture, health, government, commerce and other services.

•   Achieve the integration of the more isolated communities with the rest of the country, by
    making accessible to all population the use of new Information and Communication
    Technologies in their multiple purposes increasing their development.

•   Integrate efforts with the different government levels, social and private sectors as well as
    telecommunications network operators of the country

•   Encourage digital connectivity services penetration and promote the use of information
    and communication technologies, and computers industry among the population,
    especially in the localities with less development level and where more attention to their
    impulse is required and integrate them to the new economy.

•   Accelerate the historical tendencies in the services penetration in telecommunication and
    informatics with the objective to guaranty the social services and contents coverage of the
    e-México National System and to be present in all the national territory and at the reach
    of population.

The project was developed to reduce the country’s digital divide, making Internet access
universal regardless of location or socio-economic factors. President Fox recognized the
benefits of connecting citizens to the Internet, including increased development opportunities,
a more informed and political populace, enhanced competitiveness, and a higher quality of
life.

                                                                                              89
E-Mexico focused on three overarching themes: connectivity, content, and systems. It not
only offered the provision of physical centers where citizens could access the Internet, but
also promoted its application through e-government, e-health, e-economy, and e-learning
services. It also encouraged knowledge sharing through increased connectivity. Nearly three-
quarters of all center activity was based on some form of digital literacy training or learning
service.

The project did not have a specified budget, but rather focused on developing partnerships
with various sectors to achieve the most cost-efficient deployment as possible. Mexico’s
ministries and foundations collaborating on this project included the Public Education
Ministry, the Latin American Institute of Educational Computing, the Health Ministry, the
National Federalism Institute, the Education for Life and Job National Council, and Adults
Education National Institute.

Within a matter of months, the project had completed the installation of more than 3,000
sites, mainly within schools, libraries, medical clinics, and post offices. The second phase of
the project installed an additional 4000 network access points, and by the end of 2004, the
project had brought a total of 7200 CCDs to the country. E-Mexico reached its goal of 10,000
CCDs by 2006. Its interactive portal was featured at 7500 sites and saw more than 5 million
monthly visitors.

Box 6.3.37 - Case Study: Hewlett-Packard Digital Community Centers (Hungary)

Over the course of four years, Hewlett-Packard implemented Digital Community Centers in
twelve countries throughout the Europe and MENA region as part of its commitment to
provide underserved communities around the world with the necessary tools and
infrastructure for learning and development. The centers provide low-income communities
with basic computer, Internet, and business skills to help its citizens find employment. The
project typically targets teachers, health care providers, students, and the unemployed.
Participating communities were selected based on the capacity of ICT to further their
development as well as “their capacity to execute and sustain their vision and plans.” Hewlett
Packard’s presence in the region also contributed to the selection process, as did its
relationship with local organizations and businesses, many of which contributed to the
project.

December 2002 marked the launch of the Hungarian Digital Center in the city of Miskolc at
the country’s Petroleum and Gas Institute. The DCC offered the country’s first multimedia
center of its kind to train teachers and students on how to implement online training within
the environmental industry. In 2005, the center launched its “Envirotrainer” program, a
distance-learning program designed to train secondary school teachers on the implementation

                                                                                            90
of environmental technology into the classroom. Program topics include water and waste
management, technology, and innovation.

While Hewlett-Packard provides the initial funding and is actively involved with each center
for three years, it keeps long-term sustainability in mind, collaborating with local
governments and agencies to ensure additional ongoing funding. Like many other successful
initiatives, it promotes the “train the trainer” model, involving local IT experts to work with
members of the community to enhance digital literacy and also serve as role models.

Cybercafés

Cyber cafes remain a very important public Internet access point around the world,
particularly in emerging countries. A database tracking cyber cafes deployment
compiles data on 3,959 facilities14 broken down as follows (see table 6.12):

              Table 6.12. Cybercafes by Continent and Region (2012)
               Continent                 Number          Percent

While incomplete in terms of the total population, the statistics in table 6.12 are
important in terms of pointing out that even in countries with high broadband
penetration, cybercafés remain quite popular. For example, the database includes 308
cybercafes in the United Kingdom and 149 in France alone.

Local Area Network Houses

In developed and developing countries alike, privately owned local area network
(LAN) houses not only promote broadband access, but also foster a community of
online gamers who can connect and compete with each other. Many centers now offer
digital training and other services as well, but in the least, they promote the social
aspect of high-speed Internet use and increase the demand for such services. LAN
houses typically consist of a network of connected computers where users can
congregate to play the games, though many have expanded to offer additional
services.



14Cybercafes compiles only advertising locations, which means that it underestimates
considerably the total population. Nevertheless, it provides a sense of the popularity of the
access medium.

                                                                                                91
In some instances, they serve as the only point of access for many citizens, while in
others they supplement household broadband access, serving a more social function.
Most LAN houses charge users an hourly fee and the popularity of the houses keeps
the prices down as owners compete with each other to attract more customers and
drive business. They have been credited with driving digital inclusion, particularly
important in countries with little public investment in broadband access and low
penetration rates.

Box 6.3.38 - Case Study: LAN Houses (Brazil)

Throughout Brazil, citizens access the Internet at Local Area Network (LAN) Houses, a
concept that has taken the country by storm since 1998. As the name implies, each house
consists of a network of computers assembled together. Previously found exclusively in
wealthy communities, the LAN houses are now most popular in poor, rural regions where
computers and broadband are not easily accessible. Beyond offering ICT tools, the houses
also serve as social meeting points. While the houses were originally designed to support
multi-player video gaming, and nearly half of all users report going to the LAN houses to
play video games, an equal amount also use the services to access social networks, stay
informed, and conduct job searches or work on school projects.

The LAN Houses serve to reduce the country’s digital divide, offering affordable ICT and
broadband access to Brazil’s citizens regardless of their location or socio-economic status.
They have been attributed to increased sociability, and serve as a means to promote such
tools as e-governance and e-education. Many also offer computer training courses and help
with creating resumes and searching for jobs.

While owners choose their own pricing strategies, LAN houses typically charge between US$
0.40 and US$ 1.50 per hour. Some neighborhoods have more than 100 LAN houses, many of
which stand side by side and still have lines of residents waiting to use computers throughout
the day.

The LAN houses came about in part as a result of the federal government’s Computers for
All development project, which created credit lines allowing low-income families to purchase
computers in small monthly installments. In some instances, citizens would purchase a
computer and charge people to use it. As they accrued profits, they would purchase more
computers and broadband access.

By 2008, the country held more than 90,000 LAN houses, accounting for half of all Internet
access in Brazil and 79% of all Internet access amongst the two poorest classes. For many of
these citizens, the LAN houses were their only means of accessing the Internet. By 2010, an
estimated 35 million citizens utilized LAN houses, a number slightly below previous years
due to increased mobile phone penetration.

Box 6.3.39 - Case Study: PC Bangs (Korea)

The Korean model of PC Bangs inspired the Brazilian LAN Houses. These LAN gaming
centers allow multiple users to play video games simultaneously for a low fee. Unlike the
typical notion of a cyber café, PC Bangs do not merely offer Internet access, but rather foster
online and offline social gaming communities. When the centers were first established, they
were described as being similar to a quiet library, but have since evolved into an “ope n,
frenetic coin-operated setting” that also offers food and beverages. By 2008, Seoul alone
housed more than 22,000 PC bangs. Even as household broadband penetration rates in the
country increase, the popularity of the PC bang remains stable.

The PC Bangs are especially popular amongst the country’s youth population, with many
students spending their afternoons playing online games with their friends after school before
homework and evening family obligations. The rates of play – typically between US$ 0.40
and US$ 2.00 - are targeted for this age group, with many PC bangs offering rates that get
incrementally lower with usage.

That said, because PC Bangs are typically open 24 hours a day, the demographics change
based on the time of the day. The average user in the mornings, for instance, is a male
between the ages of 30 and 50. Many of these users also come to the room to day trade or
search for jobs.

Korea saw its first Internet connections in 1994, and within a year, Internet cafes emerged to
offer individuals the high-speed access previously afforded only by universities and research
institutions. In 1997, the government ended the monopoly of the country’s only telco, Korea
Telecom, which gave birth to competitors like Hanaro Telecom, which built its business on
broadband connections. At the same time, software developer Blizzard Entertainment
released its game StarCraft for Microsoft Windows, and many users felt that they could not
play the game adequately without a broadband connection, thus increasing the demand for
such services and giving rise to the PC Bangs. To drive demand further, many of the bangs
also offered StarCraft competitions and events.

Because the popularity of games drives the demand for the PC Bangs and vice versa, it is not
uncommon to see partnerships between manufacturers and PC Bangs. Many rooms have
contracts with the gaming distributors to offer select games on their machines and prohibit
users from downloading other games. To keep rent low, most rooms are located on the
second or third floors of commercial buildings, where real estate is typically cheaper than
more valuable first-floor or top-floor space, although high-rise building space is typically not
available in rural areas.

6.3.2.2. Economics of shared public access centers

In general, access to shared public access centers is free, with two exceptions. In the
case of government or NGO-sponsored cases, SME access could be charged. If the
center is a for-profit enterprise (e.g. cybercafé), user access is charged. An informal
survey of cybercafés access rates around the world indicate that, while these for-profit

                                                                                             93
centers are often presented as an affordable means of gaining Internet access, the rates
remain significantly high for large portions of the population (see table 6.13).

6.3.2.3. Ancillary access centers

Research conducted in some industrialized (e.g. United States) and emerging (e.g.
Mexico) countries would indicate that broadband access centers located as adjacent to
existing facilities (such as libraries, cultural centers, and youth centers) register higher
usage and citizen engagement than standalone centers. The experience of this type of
center will be reviewed, including the factors leading to a higher success rate, as
measured by frequency of attendance and operational sustainability.

By offering broadband access and related training in youth and community centers as
well as in libraries and even post offices, the initiatives have the following
advantages:

       Citizens already utilize these venues and are comfortable coming here
       Beyond the physical infrastructure, the centers have resources and staff, which
        means less overhead for the program
       Many of the centers already offer broadband access; digital literacy promotion
        can be as simple as offering support or advice to users, but can also include
        formal workshops or one-on-one training


                                                                                         94
       Depending on the staff at the center, trainings can incorporate basic skills
        (email, Internet searches) as well as skills more relevant to the workplace or
        center
       Programs can simultaneously address digital literacy, awareness, and access

In instances where government centers, like post offices, are used as points of access,
they not only serve to provide the public with broadband access, but also promote e-
Governance and allow the government to deploy online services and better connect
with the community. Other instances work with centers as a result of partnerships
between local, federal, and national governments and international corporations and
grassroots organizations.

Ancillary access centers play a significant role in communities where the population
has limited broadband access in the home. Similar to aforementioned initiatives, as
citizens become more comfortable with the technology through the access afforded
by these centers, they will likely pass down their learned skills to family members,
friends, and coworkers.

Box 6.3.40 – Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (United States)

The United States’ Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) oversees grant making,
policy development, and research to support the country’s 123,000 libraries and 17,500
museums in providing public access to knowledge, culture, and learning. In June 2012, the
IMLS awarded a $250,000 grant to WebJunction, a non-profit that offers online training and
networking to library staff with a focus on workplace-applicable skills. The organization
promotes library technology and management as well as increased public access in small and
rural locations. With this grant, WebJunction established a partnership with select state
libraries, federal policy makers, and the national non-profit Connect2Compete, which
provides free digital literacy training, discounted high-speed Internet, and low-cost computers
to promote increased technology access and economic competitiveness.

This partnership facilitates digital literacy training at the libraries and will serve as a model
for future initiatives in other states. The grant not only factors in the infrastructure costs, but
also the expenditures related to planning and promoting the program. Ideally, with proper
preparation, this project will spur future initiatives with support from the private and public
sector.

Per IMLS, one-third of Americans do not have home broadband access. The foundation
recognizes that low digital literacy rates act as a barrier and contribute to this deficiency. The
grant promotes ICT skills at the local level through public libraries, which have historically
served as “the nation’s de facto digital literacy corps.” For millions of Americans, the only
exposure to broadband is at the public library, so it follows that digital literacy training
should occur here. Prior to this initiative, the United States’ National Broadband Plan
acknowledged the role that libraries could and should play in increasing digital proficiency in
their respective communities.

78% of libraries already offer informal digital literacy training – helping patrons to use
computers and perform basic Internet searches – and 38% host formal workshops. This
project will raise awareness and support of these endeavors and promote effective
engagement and instruction.

Since its 2003 launch, WebJunction has reached more than 70,000 library staff members.
This grant only covers library training in the states of Illinois, Mississippi, and West Virginia,

                                                                                                95
with the hopes that other states will use this experience as a roadmap in engaging in similar
projects in the future.

6.3.2.4. Stand-alone public access centers

Complementing the review of ancillary access centers, the experience of stand-alone
community access units will be reviewed, focusing on some of the “do’s and
don’ts’s” that will enhance their success rate. In general, some of the practices for
access centers:

       Ensure that centers issue annual or semi-annual reports informing about
        activities being held, courses, results, topics taught, number of participants,
        etc.
       Conduct internal evaluations of access centers every six months, measuring
        and comparing indicators such as number of visits per month, number of users
        per month, indicating gender, age, email accounts, blogs, and websites being
        created, etc.
       Make sure that qualified personnel design the training activities and train the
        users

Some of these stand-alone mobile facilities take the form of an “Internet bus” which
goes to the neighborhoods to provide training upon request. An effective measure of
ownership is when a group neighbors, a club or an association make a reservation for
the bus to come to their community.

Among best practices in the case of mobile access centers:

       Hold training sessions in small groups in a non-formal atmosphere
       Faculty to student ratio should be 1:5, for sessions of no more than 10
        attendees
       Courses are typically held for two hours and entail 5 sessions
       Courses should follow a basic frame, that can be modified based on the
        knowledge level of participants
       It is advisable to manage mobile programs in coordination with a community
        library services which, in many cases, already operate library buses and
        stationary internet access centers

Box 6.3.41 – Community Technology Access Centers (Rwanda)


                                                                                          96
In 2009, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) launched its Community Technology
Access (CTA) project to give refugees and displaced individuals access to computers. The
goal is to increase educational opportunities for this disadvantaged group, particularly women
and girls. The access centers offer formal education, basic digital literacy course, long-
distance learning programs, vocational training, and assistance with job applications. Further,
access to Internet enables refugees to stay in contact with their family by way of email. In
many ways, access to ICT tools will return some degree of stability to the refugee’s lives.

Following training, refugees and members of the local community have the opportunity to
work with the CTA as facility managers, technicians, and trainers. The program focuses on
long-term sustainability, and hopes to create a design that will allow for seamless replication
and scaling.

The project piloted in 2009 in Rwanda’s Kiziba camp, where refugees fleeing the Democratic
Republic of Congo had lived for more than 12 years at that time. Within the camp, refugees
had very little access to educational opportunities and many had never seen – let alone used –
a computer. With little likelihood of returning to their home countries, the refugees required
the tools and skillsets necessary for self-sustainability, which came with increased access to
and understanding of ICT.

The partnership between the UNHCR and corporate sponsors makes the program possible. As
a proponent of renewable energy, UNHCR provides rural CTAs with solar power as
necessary. Microsoft offers expert advice for the project and donates software while Hewlett
Packard donates computers and hardware. PricewaterhouseCoopers offers pro bono staff and
project management consulting and the Motorola Foundation provided the funding for the
centers in Rwanda and Bangladesh.

UNHCR did not release information regarding the exact financial cost of the project, but its
2011 budget for all projects within Rwanda totaled US$ 35.2 million.

Since the success of the initial 2009 pilot, the CTA program has expanded to include 31
centers in 13 countries: Azerbaijan, Armenia, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Georgia,
Kenya, Mauritania, Nepal, Rwanda, Uganda, Sudan and Yemen.

6.3.3. Advanced ICT Training

As a complement to the digital literacy programs examined above, this section will
review initiatives regarding advanced ICT training, focusing on workforce
development, development of capabilities of SME personnel, and creating awareness
of the potential of broadband among government employees.

Beyond fomenting perfunctory skills, advanced ICT training can allow individuals to
establish a career in the ICT industry, which typically offers higher quality and higher
paying job opportunities. As such, this type of training ultimately allows a country to

skills. Further, advanced ICT skills can permeate other industries, improving business
practices in, for example, the healthcare and finance segments.

One of the most obvious targets for this type of training is colleges, universities, and
select vocational institutions. Depending on the level of training, programs can be
offered as college majors geared toward employment in the IT sector or incorporated
into a more general curriculum. Other programs may work with employees within a
corporation or government workers. Given that many students or participants are
likely older or already employed, advanced ICT training programs need to emphasize
flexibility and convenience. While face-to-face training may work best in some
instances, distance training and online programs may better suit other individuals.

Apart from programs integrated into the education curriculum, successful initiatives
have included arrangements with government bodies, corporations, and international
organizations. Emerging markets in particular have benefited from the leadership and
direction of such organizations and partnerships with more advanced countries. While
basic skills should remain a standard part of any ICT training program, more
advanced courses may also include topics most relevant to the national economy.

Box 6.3.42.– APCICT (Asia)

In June 2006, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
(ESCAP) inaugurated its United Nations Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information
and Communication Technology for Development (UN-APCICT/ESCAP). Located in
Incheon, Republic of Korea, the Center aims to encourage member countries’ efforts to
increase ICT use. To do so, it promotes human and institutional capacity building by focusing
on three key areas: training, research, and advisory services.

The region’s developing countries suffer from lower ICT penetration rates than many of their
developed counterparts. These rates, however, are not so much reflective of lack of access
and connectivity or insufficient infrastructure, but rather of the fact that most countries do not
have the technical human capital necessary to utilize these tools. The program, therefore,
concentrates its efforts on advancing digital literacy to promote ICT use and understanding.

Launched in 2008, the APCICT Academy – APCICT’s flagship training program - targets
government leaders through its modular training program, promoting a higher understanding
of the role ICT can play in development areas such as governance, education, health,
business, and trade, amongst others. The Virtual Academy serves as its distance-learning
platform and was established to maximize access to the academy’s course materi als and
presentation. It also offers learning management tools and certifications. Users can access and
download all Academy materials and course trainers can customize them to fit the needs of
their training sessions. One module awards an e-certificate of completion to users who
answer more than 80% of final module quiz questions correctly. Print certificates are awarded
to users who complete the final quizzes of all eight modules in the Academy of ICT
Essentials for Government Leaders Program.

Beyond training programs, APCICT published its Knowledge Sharing Series (KSS), which
offers case studies and best practices research to raise awareness of and spread ideas related
to ICT for development (ICTD). It also launched its online Communities of Practice (CoP), a
portal facilitating knowledge sharing amongst experts, field practitioners, and students.

To support its socio-economic development goals, APCICT engages with other UN bodies,
government and non-government organizations, private sector corporations, and training

                                                                                               98
institutions. These partnerships all work toward increasing national ICT capacity and
providing government leaders with the ICT understanding and know-how necessary to reach
their development objectives.

Since 2006, APCICT has rolled out capacity building programs in 29 countries throughout
the region as well as additional programs in Africa with plans to extend to the Middle East.
The Center’s efforts have reached nearly 12,000 individuals through face-to-face and online
trainings and it has worked with more than 80 national and regional partners from
government, civil society, academia, and private sector institutions. APCICT has also
published or contributed to over 90 ICTD resources.

6.3.4. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

Building digital literacy among SMEs is directly linked to the improvement of a
nation’s economic performance. As reviewed by Katz (2012), broadband adoption
contributes to economic growth. Considering that SMEs represent the majority of
establishments in any given country, and the size of their participation in the national
product, programs that target SMEs should have a significant economic return.

Broadband and ICT awareness development among SMEs is based on two distinct
types of efforts: training of both personnel and management, and the provision of
consulting services to facilitate broadband adoption.

6.3.4.1. Training for SMEs

By its own definition, SMEs tend to be later adopters of broadband and ICT in
general in the enterprise universe. In this context, the potential training initiatives
focused on SMEs will be reviewed, ranging from efforts conducted within economic
development units to industrial promotion administrations. Examples will be provided
of types of programs and curricula that have proven to be particularly effective.

Because of its economic rationale, training on IT and broadband focused on SMEs is
typically linked to large-scale national or regional initiatives. Some initiatives could
entail formal certification of skills acquired, although others provide informal training
on computer and Internet use. SME training programs are primarily focused on
improving usability of the technology. As such, they tend to comprise standard
computer courses and, in some cases, applications that fit onto existing enterprise
work processes.

Given that these types of initiatives are economically focused, it might be pertinent to
consider whether the programs should be offered free of charge or require some
payment. In general, while training is provided for free, there are programs where
users are asked to pay a symbolic fee, or even contribute to program expenses by
acquiring training material (which in some cases could be reduced through a subsidy).

SME training programs should address the following concerns:

                                                                                         99
           Skill development: training should emphasize skills relevant to the
            workplace
           Target audience: to the above point, the skills emphasized should focus on
            local relevancy (e.g. as they would relate to textile or coffee production in
            the case of a small village in Africa) rather than standard ICT skills
           Convenience: offer trainings in areas that are easily accessible to the
            largest segment of the population; beyond physical workshops, consider
            the transmission of training through websites or video distribution to reach
            a larger audience that may not be able to attend the training due to time or
            location constraints
           Purpose: while these trainings will ideally create a workforce capable of
            integrating ICT tools into the workplace, these trainings must also
            effectively raise awareness of their benefits

As SME training programs have similar objectives to basic digital literacy programs,
it may make sense to incorporate the two, with SME trainings acting as extensions of
more basic programs that are tailored to the needs of business owners and employees.
By enhancing the ICT awareness and capability of SMEs, successful initiatives can
enhance competiveness and productivity while allowing SMEs to compete with larger
MNCs that have the staff and resources to utilize ICT and broadband.

Box 6.3.43. – District Business Information Centers (Uganda)

As a technical cooperation agency, UNIDO’s activities fall into three categories: poverty
reduction through productive activities, trade capacity building, and environment and energy.
By introducing productive activities to countries, the organization in turn allows their citizens
to find a path out of poverty. Customized services to this end include – amongst others -
industrial policy advice, technology diffusion, and SME development.

By 2008, many African countries had not yet reached their Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) despite the approaching 2015 deadline. The organization found that these countries
relied on the success of SMEs to strengthen their economies and reduce the socio-economic
divide. UNIDO argued that in order to enhance their productivity and competitiveness, SMEs
must see increased ICT access.

In 2006, UNIDO and Microsoft signed a Memorandum of Understanding that led to the
development of the District Business Information Center (DBIC) program in Uganda. For its
part, Microsoft developed ICT-related services, training, and awareness for the rural business
community through its Digital Literacy program and SME training curriculum. The program
focuses on providing the DBICs with the tools and skillset necessary for entrepreneurship
development and sustainability. UNIDO trains two staff members per center - a business
information officer and an ICT trainer – in technology and entrepreneurship, allowing them
to access information on markets, customers, and technologies and open doors for business
development. The project was financed by UNIDO and a grant from the Austrian
Development Agency.

In 2007, the DBIC project received the Africa Investor Award in the “Best Initiative in
Support of Small and Medium Enterprise Development” category. Since the project’s
implementation, UNIDO has cited the following benefits:

       Improved decision making through tailor-made business information


                                                                                             100
       Relevant ICT training, entrepreneurial advice and ICT support
       Unprecedented access to new markets, technologies and services
       Increased competitiveness and productivity

As of 2008, the initiative had developed eight DBICs throughout the country, training 315
men and 226 women across industries such as food processing, textile, and coffee.

Box 6.3.44. – Ecaustria and TELEFIT (Austria)

Established by the Federal Ministry for Economy and Labor and the Austrian Chamber of
Commerce, Ecaustria serves as an online information and communication platform. It falls
under the Federal Ministry’s larger “Let’s e-biz” initiative, which aims to promote and
support e-business. The interactive ecaustria.at website offers users news pertaining to the e-
business sector as well as best practice case studies, information on starting a new e-business,
and an annual awards section recognizing the best e-business and multimedia products in the
country. It also provides e-learning and IT-training courses.

The government created the website in an effort to transform Austria into one of the world’s
Information Age leaders. This initiative has two main objectives: raise awareness and provide
effective training. These resources demonstrate how an Internet connection can assist
businesses in establishing relationships with both customers and suppliers and in entering the
global marketplace. At the time of the project’s inception, many large companies already
conducted business over the Internet, with small and medium-sized enterprises acting as their
suppliers. By learning how to use this tool effectively, SMEs could more easily connect with
these businesses and also become more competitive in the market. Further, Ecaustria places
high value on user interaction and best practices examples. The unrealistic expectations and
propaganda on the part of the Information Technology community proved detrimental to the
economy in the Internet’s early stages, and the website served to convince SMEs of the
benefits of e-businesses.

To develop the Ecaustria platform, planners spent six months working with more than 300
experts from business, science, and administration industries. This consultation resulted in
specialized services covering all topics relevant to e-business, such as e-content, e-
employment, e-location, etc. The success of the project has been attributed to its sophisticated
marketing techniques, which include traditional advertising, Internet and event marketing,
and extensive public relations targeting the business-to-business segment. In 2002, the
European Commission nominated Ecaustria for its exemplary project award.

Complementing the “Let’s e-biz” platform, TELEFIT also serves as an information platform.
The initiative targets SMEs in remote regions, offering videotaped trainings of its live “e-


                                                                                            101
business road show,” which takes place in urban areas and highlights best practices and
guidelines to encourage SMEs to take advantage of the e-economy. TELEFIT aims to prepare
SMEs for the changes in telecommunications by providing the necessary tools and
knowledge to profit from this new technology. The program addresses the specific needs of
SMEs and also offers financial support as necessary.

TELEFIT’s services are delivered through the Institute of Economic Promotion’s network.
The European Funds for Regional Development (EFRE) works with the Federal Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the Economic Chamber of Austria to fund the project. Each event costs
approximately EUR 11,000.

When TELEFIT first began, approximately 30% of SMEs in the country operated online.
Within three years, this number had increased to 80%. In four years’ time, the TELEFIT
roadshow made 70 stops, connecting directly with 40,000 SMEs and providing more than
300,000 with relevant information.

Box 6.3.45. – SVEA (Sweden)

Established in 2000 by the Swedish Alliance for Electronic Commerce (GEA), the SVEA
program aims to raise awareness of the benefits of e-commerce for SMEs. Targeting those
businesses with little IT knowledge and no prior e-business experience, SVEA focuses more
on the evolving business processes than the actual technology. By demonstrating the
commercial advantages of engaging in e-business, the project encourages these companies to
join the digital economy.

To achieve this goal, SVEA utilizes best practice research to demonstrate specific uses of e-
commerce for companies in all sectors and regions. Within each SME, SVEA works with
select “ambassadors” who can then train and educate other employees in their respective
companies. By utilizing the train-the-trainer model, the benefits of the trainings are more
easily diffused across organizations to reach a larger number of employees, who can then
benefit from expertise in e-business application. Further, any member of the SME can access
the SVEA database, which serves as a knowledge exchange tool and also offers analysis of
the company’s day-to-day operations and case histories. The program also utilizes
conferences and seminars and works with IT solutions providers to demonstrate how e-
business can positively impact SME operations.

Beyond these mechanisms, SVEA offers interactive, informal training over existing URLs
that cover such topics as billing, exports, and logistics. Business associations, local
consultants, partner companies, and research firms work with the program to offer these
services and such partnerships allow SVEA to adapt more readily to the various demands of
different SMEs. Funding for the project comes from private sector partners that have an
interest in supporting SMEs. This partnership also serves to enhance the reputation of SVEA.
The initial two-year budget for the SVEA project was EUR 1.8 mn total, with an additional
EUR 400,000 set aside for the third year.

When the program first began, it aimed to educate 100,000 SMEs on the benefits of e-
business and to see 30,000 utilizing this tool. In the first two years, the e-business increased


                                                                                            102
from 26% to 54%. The number of SMEs utilizing the Internet to purchase supplies reached
41%, and nearly one-quarter of SMEs sold their products and services online.

6.3.4.2. Consulting services for SMEs

Complementing SME training, the provision of subsidized consulting services to
SMEs has proven to be a powerful tool to increase awareness and promote adoption
of broadband services and ICT, in general. Consulting can be provided by different
entities: government-sponsored units, university students supervised by faculty (for
practical training purposes), and pro-bono private sector firms. As opposed to the
aforementioned training programs, however, consulting services tend to go beyond
overarching basic training and awareness raising, focusing more on the
implementation of ICT into individual SME business. In many instances, this
implementation not only affords higher levels of productivity and competency, but
also allows SMEs to enter the e-commerce arena.

These types of programs are especially popular in the European Union, which, by
2000, housed nearly 19 million SMEs. Examination of such programs has yielded the
below recommendations:

          Employ independent consultants who can offer their unbiased opinions
           and bring their professional experience to the table
          Programs that deploy consultants to individual SMEs should work to
           establish an overarching standardization to ensure quality and equity of
           service
          Establish local centers in convenient locations where SME owners can
           seek tailored advice
          Incorporate some degree of flexibility into the budget; as SME
           consultancy programs grow and more SMEs seek their services,
           expenditures tend to increase
          To finance the project, partnerships with private entities (e.g. financial
           institutions or consulting firms) may take some strain off government
           resources
          Programs should also offer to SMEs such resources as databases of best
           practices information, online support staff, and a means for SMEs to
           communicate with and learn from each other

An important aspect of consultancy programs is the ability to provide customized,
tailored support to SMEs. Such services may include the establishment of a long-term
business model based on the integration of ICT while others should target the needs
of each SME to integrate such technology as necessary. These services should
consider such factors as an SME’s available resources, limitations, and future goals.

Box 6.3.46. – eASKEL (Finland)



                                                                                   103
The Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry developed the eASKEL program to enhance
SME e-business development by increasing management competency, implementing
profitable e-business opportunities, identifying core e-business needs, and producing a
development program for participating companies. The service trains private-sector
consultants specifically for this project, who then work with SMEs who have little IT or e-
business experience. The consultants spend 2 – 5 days with their clients to develop an e-
analysis and offer advice on how to integrate new technology into their operations.

This method allows consultants to design a strategic plan based on the individual needs and
resources of each SME. For instance, if a company only has one computer, a CRM solution
would not be the most appropriate option. Employing independent consultants allows the
SMEs to benefit from professionals with extensive IT and e-business knowledge, who can
also use their prior experience with other organizations in formulating their analyses. As a
“Branded Expert Service,” the program’s standardized format ensures accountability and
quality for all participating SMEs.

Prior to eASKEL, Finland’s Ministry of Trade and Industry partnered with the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Labor to create regional Employment and
Economic Development Centers (T&E Centers). These fifteen centers located throughout the
country offer businesses and individuals advice and development services. After the T&E
centers reported that SMEs needed more support in utilizing e-business tools, the eASKEL
program was piloted.

The project’s budget depends on the number of participating companies, with EUR 320,000
allocated for every 500 companies, the annual target. Each company pays approximately 35%
of the consultants’ fees and the remainder is funded by the government’s T&E Centers, which
have a budget specifically for consultation services. The government ultimately subsidizes
85% of the consulting fees associated with the project.

Box 6.3.47. – b-online (Germany)

The government of the German state Lower Saxony implemented the “b-online – Lower
Saxony supports e-commerce” initiative in 2000 to encourage SMEs to take advantage of the
Internet and e-commerce capabilities. At the time of the project’s inception, the region had a
very high number of SMEs, yet very few used the Internet to its full capabilities.

The network consists of seven local centers – known as “b-online-junctions” – throughout
Lower Saxony that are each built and managed locally. Each center employs b-online
consultants to offer SMEs assistance in utilizing Internet and ICT tools and implementing e-
commerce strategies. The consultants also raise awareness and conduct ICT skill-building
training for SMEs through local workshops, special events, and demonstration projects. The
project’s annual “e-commerce in Lower Saxony” roadshow brings to light the best practices
at each center and the annual “e-business Prize Lower Saxony” recognizes innovative e-
business projects.

To encourage SMEs to use e-commerce services, b-online first focuses on raising awareness
of the advantages of Internet use for these businesses. Consultation is available for businesses
on a walk-in basis or through scheduled appointments. This consultation allows SMEs to
benefit from tailored information, which can cover all topics related to e-commerce,
particularly legal and security matters. For those businesses that have already begun to use

                                                                                            104
these tools, the consultants can provide industry-specific advice and encourage cross-sector e-
business applications. The project also encourages businesses to network together to share
their experiences and best practices.

The b-online centers work with Federal Government competence centers to offer a central
database of service providers, which is accessible by all affiliated organizations. The project
also serves as a filter of all available e-commerce related information so that SMEs can better
utilize the resources most relevant to their individual needs.

The project is supported by the Lower Saxony Chambers of Commerce and Trade and the
Technology Agency of Lower Saxony (NATI). The chamber of commerce deals with the
content aspect of the project while NATI handles all PR and administrative matters. The
project was funded by a government contribution of EUR 2.15 mn, which was divided
between the chambers of commerce and NATI. While the b-online project was projected to
take place for two years, it was continued for an additional year.

In its first two years, b-online organized 337 events and training workshops that reached more
than 14,000 SMEs. The project initiated 600 consulting projects that focused specifically on
those small enterprises with less than 20 employees.

Box 6.3.48. – Opportunity Wales (United Kingdom)

With a focus on access, usability, quality of service, and cost, the Opportunity Wales program
promotes SME support networks by providing e-commerce consulting and implementation.
The Wales Trades Union Congress partnered with British Telecom and HSBC Bank in 1999
to address the attitudes toward e-commerce in Wales while raising awareness of the tangible
benefits it can offer businesses. The project offers SMEs customized support based on each
enterprise’s individual needs. The advisor works with the company to develop the necessary
steps to introduce e-commerce into its business.

The initiative emphasizes the importance of offering businesses one-to-one support by
advisors with proper training and experience in implementing e-commerce models. Advisors’
consultation services utilize the research and lessons learned from the replication and
feedback of similar projects in other parts of the region. Prior to the commencement of the
initiative, advisors and planners conducted in-depth consultation to ensure the incorporation
of these lessons.

The e-commerce Innovation Center provides formal standardized training and accreditation
to the advisors and also makes available relevant resources and knowledge. A contact center
and 24-hour Internet portal provide a guide to best practices and Better Business Wales
serves to offer advice as needed.

Opportunity Wales recognizes that as SMEs become more comfortable with e-commerce,
they will experience increased sales and higher levels of efficiency. In turn, the region will
benefit from prosperity and increased employment opportunities. Research conducted by the
nationally recognized survey organization, National Opinion Polls, in 2000 demonstrated that
while businesses in Wales knew about e-commerce, few had actually utilized it. In-depth
analysis showed little knowledge when it came to the implementation process, and the low
Internet penetration rates in the region further hindered e-commerce uptake.


                                                                                           105
The National Assembly for Wales provided the initial funding for the project, though the
partnership grew to include additional private sector, government, and university partners.
The project first applied for funding from the European Union in 2000 and received approval
from the Wales European Funding Office (WEFO) in 2001. WEFO supplied EUR 17 mn of
the EUR 33 mn budget, with the remainder coming from partner organizations and the
National Assembly. The majority of the budget went toward face-to-face SME consultation
services and implementation support, with a very marginal amount left over for grant aid.

Opportunity Wales aimed to train 130 advisors and directly reach 35,000 companies within
the first three years.

6.3.4.3. Broadband and new firm formation:

Broadband technology is a contributor to economic growth at several levels. First, the
deployment of broadband technology across business enterprises improves
productivity by facilitating the adoption of more efficient business processes (e.g.,
marketing, inventory optimization, and streamlining of supply chains). Second,
extensive deployment of broadband accelerates innovation by introducing new
consumer applications and services (e.g., new forms of commerce and financial
intermediation). Third, broadband leads to a more efficient functional deployment of
enterprises by maximizing their reach to labor pools, access to raw materials, and
consumers, (e.g., outsourcing of services, virtual call centers.). The study of the
impact of broadband on economic growth covers numerous aspects, ranging from its
aggregate impact on GDP growth, to the differential impact of broadband by
industrial sector, the increase of exports, and changes in intermediate demand and
import substitution.

In the area of productivity enhancements, it is logical to assume that productivity of
information workers, defined as the portion of the economically active population
whose working function is to process information (administrative employees,
managers, teachers, journalists) depends directly on the investment in ICT capital
(and particularly broadband). The studies conducted by this author 15 have, in fact,
concluded that the larger the per cent of the workforce dedicated to information
generation and processing is, the higher the proportion of capital stocks invested in
the acquisition of ICT infrastructure (see Figure 6.23).

Figure 6.23 and the corresponding regression coefficient indicate the existence of a
direct relationship existing between the amount of information workers and IT capital
investment in a given economy: as expected, the larger the proportion of information
workers in a given the economy, the more capital is invested in information
technology.

How can one theoretically explain the relationship between ICT and productivity? In
his economics dissertation at Harvard University (1982), Charles Jonscher raised the
hypothesis that if we can measure the micro-economic impact of ICT on firm
productivity, then we should also be able to link the growth in informational
occupations and the adoption of technology to improve their productivity at the
macroeconomic level. According to Jonscher, economic growth logically leads to
increasing complex production processes. In turn, complexity in production processes
results in increasing the functional complexity within firms (e.g. more inputs to be
combined, more steps to be scheduled in a timely manner, more interactions
occurring with suppliers of raw materials and with buyers of the end product). The
first response of economic organizations to this effect is the creation of “information
workers”—workers whose primary function is the manipulation of information for
purposes of organizing the production of goods. At some point, however,
information-processing workers become a bottleneck in the economic system. They
cannot grow forever because this process reduces the overall availability of resources
in other occupations. Furthermore, when information workers become a large
proportion of the workforce, the complexity of information processing becomes a
bottleneck itself. In other words, there is a limit to the possibility of manually storing,
transferring and processing the growing amounts of information. This is where
information and communication technologies come in. Their development and
adoption is aimed at increasing the productivity of information workers and
addressing this bottleneck. The availability of computing and communications allows
firms (and their information workers) to be more productive in their manipulation of

                                                                                                                            107
information. Broadband is a specific component performing this important
productivity enhancement.

For example, research on the impact of broadband on productivity has successfully
identified positive effects. For example, Waverman et al. (2009) determined the
economic effect of broadband on the GDP of 15 OECD nations for the time period of
1980 to 2007. These included 14 European countries and the United States. By
relying on an augmented production function derived from Waverman et al. (2005),
the authors specified two models: a production function and a hedonic function for
ICT capital stocks. Broadband impact on the productivity of the more developed
nations in the sample was found to be 0.0013 and was statistically significant at the 5
per cent level 16 . In other words, Waverman estimated that for every 1 per cent
increase in broadband penetration in high and medium impact income countries,
productivity grows by 0.13 per cent. In another document, the authors commented
upon the productivity effect in the countries of their sample with relatively low ICT
penetration (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium.). They found that broadband
impact on productivity was nil, which indicated the high adoption costs, and critical
mass thresholds17. In other words, for broadband to have an impact on productivity,
the ICT eco-system has to be sufficiently developed18. It would appear, therefore, that
in developed countries with high broadband penetration, the technology has an impact
on aggregate productivity levels.

Evidence that broadband facilitates entrepreneurship

Beyond the employment and output impact of network construction, researchers have
also studied the impact of network externalities on employment, derived from firm
formation. This has been variously categorized as “innovation”, or “network
effects”19. The study of network externalities resulting from broadband penetration
has led to the identification of numerous innovation effects:

        New and innovative applications and services, such as telemedicine, Internet
         search, e-commerce, online education and social networking20.
        New forms of commerce and financial intermediation21.
        Mass customization of products22.
        Reduction of excess inventories and optimization of supply chains 23.
        Business revenue growth24.


16 The original regression yielded a coefficient of 0.0027 for the 2/3 more developed countries
   in the sample and negative effect for the lower third. A negative effect did not make sense so
   the authors constrained the effect for the lower third to zero. At that point the coefficient for
   the full sample moved to 0.0013.
17 See Waverman, 2009.

18 For example, Waverman et al. estimated that in the United States broadband penetration
   contributed approximately to 0.26% per annum to productivity growth, resulting in 11
   additional cents per hour worked (or USD 29 billion per year).

           Growth in service industries25

   Most of the research regarding the impact of broadband externalities on employment
   has been conducted using US data. There are two types of studies of these effects:
   regression analyses and top down multipliers. The first ones attempt to identify the
   macro-economic variables that can impact employment 26, while the second ones rely
   on top-down network effect multipliers.

   Among the econometric studies of employment impact, are Gillett et al. (2006),
   Crandall et al. (2007), Shideler et al. (2007) and Thompson and Garbacz (2008). The
   evidence regarding broadband employment externalities appears to be quite
   conclusive (see Table 6.12).

   Again, the impact of broadband on employment creation appears to be positive.
   However, as the data indicates, the impact on employment growth varies widely,
   from 0.2 per cent to 5.32 per cent for every increase in 1 per cent of penetration.
   There are several explanations for this variance. As Crandall indicated, the
   overestimation of employment creation in his study is due to employment and
   migratory trends, which existed at the time and biased the sample data. In the case of
   Gillett et al. (2006), researchers should be careful about analyzing local effects
   because zip codes are small enough areas that cross-zip code commuting might throw
   off estimates on the effect of broadband. For example, increased wages from
   broadband adoption in one zip code would probably raise rent levels in neighboring
   zip codes prompting some migration effects. Finally, the wide range of effects in the

   25      See Crandall et al. (2007).
   26      In general, studies based on regression analysis do not differentiate between
   construction and spill-over effects.

                                                                                           109
case of Shideler et al. (2007) is explained by the divergent effects among industry
sectors.

Beyond regression studies, “network effect” multipliers have been used to assess the
impact of broadband on job creation in a top down fashion. Within this group, key
studies are Pociask (2002), Atkinson et al. (2009) and Liebenau et al. (2009). Pociask
(2002) and Atkinson et al. (2009) studies relied on an estimated “network effect”
multiplier, which is applied to the network construction employment estimates. For
example, Pociask relied on two multiplier estimates (an IT multiplier of 1.5 to 2.0
attributed to a think tank and another multiplier of 6.7, attributed to Microsoft) and
calculated an average of 4.1. Similarly, Atkinson et al. (2009) derived a multiplier of
1.17 from Crandall et al. (2003). Though the top-down approach allows estimation of
the broadband impact, it does not have a strong theoretical basis. Network effects are
not built on interrelationships between sectors. They refer to the impact of the
technology on productivity, employment and innovation by industrial sector.

The methodological implications of these studies are that in order to properly measure
the contribution of broadband to job creation, it is advisable to have datasets that
include time series for employment level, broadband penetration, and related human
capital statistics at a disaggregated level, such as counties, departments, or
administrative district27.

Like the relationship between broadband and GDP growth, the contribution of
broadband to employment is also conditioned by a number of special effects. Studies
have particularly focused on two specific questions:

        Does the impact on employment differ according to industry sector?
        Is there a decreasing return in employment generation linked to broadband
         penetration?

As with GDP, the spill-over employment effects of broadband are not uniform across
sectors. According to Crandall et al. (2007), the job creation impact of broadband
tends to be concentrated in service industries, (e.g., financial services, education,
health care, etc.) although the authors also identified a positive effect in
manufacturing. In another study, Shideler et al. (2007) found that, for the state of
Kentucky, county employment was positively related to broadband adoption in the
following sectors. The only sector where a negative relationship was found with the
deployment of broadband (0.34% – 39.68%) was the accommodations and food
services industry. This may result from a particularly strong capital/labor substitution
process taking place, whereby productivity gains from broadband adoption yields
reduced employment. Similarly, Thompson and Garbacz (2008) conclude that, for
certain industries, “there may be a substitution effect between broadband and
employment” 28 . It should therefore be considered that the productivity impact of
broadband can cause capital-labor substitution and may result in a net reduction in
employment.



27       See examples in Katz (2010)
28       This effect was also mentioned by Gillett et al. (2006).

                                                                                    110
In summary, research is starting to pinpoint different employment effects by industry
sector. Broadband may simultaneously cause labor creation triggered by innovation in
services and a productivity effect in labor-intensive sectors. However, given that the
sectoral composition varies by regional economies, the deployment of broadband
should not have a uniform impact across a national territory.

However, for this to materialize, resources coming from business incubation
programs set up by local governments, development agencies or multinational
corporations are required. For example, mLab business incubators provide the
following services29:

            physical workspace
            business training
            tech training
            testing and certification
            business mentoring
            market intelligence
            competitions
            funding
            professional services
            tech outsourcing
            code repository

Virtual business incubation

The current conditions of digital innovation, particularly in emerging markets, reflect
four shortfalls:

        Low liquidity (e.g. low depth of the market) flowing to innovation driven
         companies
        Low volume of innovation companies
        Lack of interest from domestic and foreign investors due to the market risk
        Low turnover of companies in terms of launching and decantation of the
         number of start-ups

At the highest level, business innovation in emerging markets faces supply side and
demand side inefficiencies.

Supply side inefficiencies comprise limited availability of inputs. For example, start-
ups are confronted with limited access to capital, due to the low availability of
venture capital, and angel investors. As a result, small digital projects are difficult and
costly to finance individually. In addition, start-ups might experience limited access
to technology infrastructure, and human capital. These supply-side innovation
“failures” are of three types:

      Externalities in the innovation process: this means that it is common for a
       potential investor not to know the potential opportunities that might exist
       among innovative digital start-ups
      Information asymmetries: These work two ways
           o For liquidity, in a replication of the adverse selection and moral hazard
               problems highlighted in financial services, the lack of full information
               makes it hard for outside investors to evaluate the quality of the new
               ventures
           o For inputs, even when the infrastructure or inputs exist, innovative
               start-ups do not have information on their existence, which prevents
               them from making the right decisions to access the required
               development tools or infrastructure
      Coordination failures: limited access to inputs of other firms that would yield
       productivity enhancements
      Most importantly, how to commercialize products/solutions/applications
       developed from innovation, how to ensure delivery (distribution channels) and
       actual utilization by citizens

Demand side inefficiencies revolve around the limited size of the domestic market.
For example, the domestic market is not large enough to provide the necessary scale
to affront the development of a technology firm. In this context, demand side
inefficiencies can be overcome by export-oriented policies targeting outside markets.
India and Malaysia address the technology demand gap by focusing on international
software, IT outsourcing and technology markets, while Ireland and Israel solve the
size of the market inefficiency in software products by focusing on international
markets (Ireland addressing MNCs, Israel targeting primarily the US).

Building a vibrant innovation-prone environment requires addressing these two types
of gaps (see figure 6.24).

Broadband can have beneficial impact in the process known as virtual business
incubation. As defined by Stam et al. (2011), virtual business incubators provide
services beyond the confines of a physical building. This allows a start-up to use the
services of an incubator, without actually being located at the incubator site, for
instance through extension workers, online tools and off-site advisory services. They
can also serve a much larger number of companies over an extended geographical
area.

Virtual business incubation services, comprising business development support
(training, mentoring), access to business networks and funding sources can be
delivered through a variety of services:

      On-site virtual services: group training, workshops, presentations and events
       at which start-ups can participate
      Websites and E-learning: provide online training materials and information
      One-on-One exchange: traditional (E-mail, SMS, phone, Skype, and online
       collaboration tools)
      On-line staff recruiting: recruitment of mentors, staff, interns, investors
      Virtual communities and events: communities and online platforms where
       entrepreneurs meet, exchange knowledge and information and build
       collaboration networks
      Crowdsourcing and crowd-funding: support start-ups by mobilizing large
       numbers of knowledge and funding sources

Broadband is a critical enabling platform that will facilitate delivery of these services.
In fact, Stam et al. (2011) study of virtual incubators point out that unlimited supply
of fixed and mobile broadband represents a critical component of these services. For
example, a number of virtual incubators (Sofstart, BTI) have developed broadband
connected satellite offices that can offer remote training or assistance to events to
start-ups that are located in other geographies. Similarly, The Business Links website
of the UK government offers a wealth of online information, including checklists,
training materials and online instruction videos on practical issues, like business
registration, hiring a new employee, or assessing and improving business cash flow.

Online mentoring for startups

A particular example of virtual incubation is the provision of online mentoring. In
addition to access to finance and production inputs, start-ups are in great need of
mentoring that helps them address the development and scaling up challenges.

Typical scaling up challenges encountered by start-ups include the aggressive growth
of the customer base, assembling capabilities to support growth, modifying
communications and decision making processes, functionalizing roles, and building
cross-functional teams and processes. Given the limited experience often prevalent in
start-up firms, mentoring becomes a critical requirement. Sources of mentoring are
relatively scarce: experienced serial innovators, financiers, technology, and business
executives. Mentoring includes counseling support in areas such as recruiting,
organizational design, and professional development.


                                                                                      113
In this context, broadband can allow start-ups, particularly those based in remote
locations, to gain access to the much-needed mentoring. Mentoring provided through
on-on-one interaction tools saves time and travel costs and speeds up the provision of
counseling, which can be critical in some contexts.

For example, the Founder Institute – a global network of start-ups and mentors –
offers a four-month training program. Mentoring is provided through a global
network of over 400 mentors, who are normally the CEO or founder of a successful
start-up. The mentors are accessible both during the sessions and via email. Graduates
can present their companies at so-called Founder Showcase Events in order to attract
investors. Similarly, ParqueTec in Costa Rica has deployed a mentoring approach for
remote (rural) incubates one-on-one, based on regular face-to-face interactions
combined with phone, SMS, E-mail and Skype contact.

6.3.5. Sponsorship structures of awareness programs

Having reviewed the different awareness programs, this section will present the
different sponsorship options regarding implementation and funding. The review of
each option will include an examination of advantages and disadvantages, as well as
observed best practices.

Digital literacy program sponsorship is a critical component of its success. Research
conducted by Hilding-Hamann et al. (2009) found a direct relation between the
sustainability of a digital literacy program and the sponsors involved. Sponsorship, as
a term, entails more dimensions than funding. It addresses the parties to be involved
as stakeholders in the program. In general terms, they may include public
organizations, educational institutions, private industry (both domestic firms and
multinationals), non-governmental organizations, and local interest associations.

The sponsorship structure defines the contributions to be made by each stakeholder,
and, in particular, the financing structure of the program. Key decisions to be made in
this domain comprise the relative contribution of public and private funds, the in-kind
(e.g. equipment) contributions, whether users should pay for participating in the
program, and volunteer contributions. As mentioned above, the larger the group of
stakeholders involved, the more likely is the project to remain sustainable. Partly, this
results from financial support provided by private parties, which ensures long term
funding being less subject to the vagaries of government budgeting processes.

Box 6.3.49. – mEducation Alliance (International)

Comprised of 15 international organizations, foundations, and development banks, the
Mobiles for Education Alliance works with multilateral and bilateral donors to improve

                                                                                     114
formal and informal learning while making it more accessible, particularly in developing
countries. The alliance reduces the barriers to education by promoting the use of low-cost
mobile technology. To this end, the Alliance projects identify useful mobile applications that
can address literacy, educational content, accessibility, educator development, and workforce
training.

To support and advocate for m-education practices, the Alliance aims to do the following, per
its website:
     - Improve research, for example in the areas of mobiles for reading and content
        mastery via mobile delivery
     - Perform a catalytic function by leveraging the Alliance’s brand to promote and
        advocate for coordinated support of the effective use of mobiles in the administration
        and delivery of education
     - Spread knowledge and awareness of the broad spectrum of available, accessible and
        affordable mobile technology tools available which can and/or have a proven positive
        impact on education outcomes
     - Serve a convening function for practitioners, funders and leaders of the public and
        private sectors, to promote cooperation and coordination of efforts and knowledge in
        order to spur the innovation, affordability, and accessibility of mobile technologies
        for improved learning outcomes
     - Explore opportunities to jointly fund specific activities of shared interests (e.g.
        evaluations of pilot projects, additional events focused on particular areas, etc.).

The Alliance also sponsors and backs a number of organizations and events that work toward
its goal of improving education through mobile technology. Such funding may go toward
international workshops and symposia, research roundtables, monthly seminars, and working
groups. The mEducation Alliance website feature information about these events and related
resources.

Many developing countries suffer from a lack of resources that in turn impact the availability
of quality education. As mobile devices – including phones, e-readers, tablets, and projectors
- become more prevalent, they create an opportunity to support education initiatives and
reach citizens who may otherwise not have access to quality learning material.

Box 6.3.50. – Asian Development Bank (Uzbekistan)

In 2005, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a regional technical assistance grant
(RETA) targeting ICT investment in basic education within Central Asian countries. As part
of this grant, the bank approved a US$ 600,000 budget for project implementation in
Uzbekistan. Through this grant, a team created an ICT in education development strategy for
the country, focusing on the introduction of ICT into lesson plans.

The project addressed not only digital literacy, but also the potential for ICT to improve the
overall quality of the education system. The first step of the plan raised awareness of the
benefits of – and barriers to – bringing ICT into the classroom and its potential to reduce the
country’s digital divide. In this process, it also considered potential partnerships between the
public and private sectors and international organizations. Ultimately, by improving
Uzbekistan’s education system, the project aimed to increase the country’s competitiveness in
the global, knowledge-based economy.


                                                                                            115
At the time of implementation, Uzbekistan boasted high net enrollment rates – 99% - but its
basic education lacked quality and relevance. In 2002, the country established a national ICT
strategy with the intention of increasing the computer student ratio from 1:110 to 1:20 and to
bring Internet access to 63% of all schools by 2010. This strategy recognized that other
countries that had increased ICT use in the classroom boosted students’ test scores and
increased education access for those students located in rural areas.

The ADB grant followed the United Nations Development Program’s (UNDP) finding that
Uzbekistan lacked sophisticated ICT development. The program’s research demonstrated that
over 80% of the nation’s ICT infrastructure was outdated and that the country did not have
enough computers to host computer classes, let alone to integrate this new technology into the
curriculum. Only half of all schools in the country offered computer classes, and many did
not have access to any computers.

In addition to the ADP’s US$ 600,000 grant, the government of Uzbekistan contributed US$
150,000 toward the initiative. The Ministry of Education managed the project, which took
place from March 2005 through February 2006. Beginning in 2006, the Government of
Uzbekistan’s National Program for Basic Education Development began another phase of
introducing ICT into the education system, with this push focusing on Internet deployment in
classrooms. ADB funded US$30 million of the US$43 mn budget.

The first round of the project brought computers to 300 “cluster” schools , with an additional
560 schools receiving computers in 2010. These schools were chosen to serve as resource
centers for surrounding schools within a 30km radius. Each of these schools offered two
separate computer classes: one designed for students and the other for teachers. Teachers
from nearby schools could utilize cluster schools’ resources while benefitting from shared
training and collaboration. In developing this initiative, the Ministry of Public Education
conducted consultations and meetings with more than 60 schools and 180 focus groups
comprised of local teachers, parents, and students. This process concluded that the project
must strengthen teacher development, establish management support, and develop e-learning
materials to achieve success. The ministry produced educational software and Internet-based
learning materials. The cluster schools also received ICT and AV equipment. By 2010, more
than 540,000 students directly benefited from the program. 90,000 teachers and staff from the
cluster schools and select non-cluster schools received specialized training in the introduction
of ICT into the curriculum.

This round of the project paid particular attention to disadvantaged students, with an
estimated 165,000 students from poor and rural areas in grades five through nine benefiting
directly. 70% of the cluster leader schools were located in these areas. The initiative also
served as a test in tackling Internet connections in rural classrooms through the use of mobile
and wireless technology. The schools served as community ICT facilities, with 25% of
schools making the technology available to the public.

6.3.5.3. Public-private associations:



                                                                                            116
These efforts comprise partnerships between public and private sector parties. In
setting up these associations, it is very useful to attract private parties, whose
contribution is related to the core business of the participant. For example, in the
Digital Communities Program in Dublin, Ireland, Hewlett Packard provides computer
hardware, Eircom (the telecommunications carrier) provisions broadband
connectivity, Microsoft supplies software and training support, the Dublin Institute of
technology supplies staff, premises and administrative facilities, the Dublin Inner City
Partnership contributes funding for salaries, and the Dublin City Council provides the
premises for all the centers.

Best practices for managing public-private partnerships include:

       Set up an overseeing structure, such as a Management Board that meets
        regularly to discuss and manage progress of the program. The Board should
        comprise a senior executive from each of the partner’s organizations, plus a
        representative from the community
       Additionally, the community should have a coordinator from each center, all
        of whom meet regularly to discuss issues faced in running their centers

Box 6.3.51. – Pasha Centers (Kenya)

In response to the World Bank’s Regional Communications Infrastructure Project (RCIP), the
Government of Kenya developed a program in 2007 to create “digital villages” that would
connect rural areas to the Internet. To make this program a reality, the Kenya ICT Board
(KICTB) partnered with the Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group (IBSG) to develop an
understanding of the issues involved. Throughout the course of two years, this team
established a briefing of the key challenges and the solutions and tools needed to address
them that it presented to the government. Through this work and the lessons learned, Cisco
established a toolkit that it now uses to implement digital villages in other emerging markets.

As part of the RCIP, the World Bank suggested that Kenya serve as a “proof-of-concept”
country to determine the feasibility of and justification for digital villages in similar regions
of the world. This decision came as a result of plans to construct submarine fiber-optic cables,
which would bring broadband connectivity to the country. Once the first of the submarine
cables was complete, in 2008, the assessment of the project began.

While the government had developed the plan on its own, it ultimately turned to Cisco for
assistance in large part because of the pressure the KICTB felt to construct the digital villages
as quickly and cost efficiently as possible. As the first phase, Cisco identified key questions
that the assessment should ask and answer:

           Which services did villagers want or need most?
           How would villagers use these services?
           How much capability did each village require?
           Which service model would be most successful in Kenya’s culture and
            environment?
           How would each digital village be set up and manned?

While Kenya experienced a great deal of private-sector interest in investing in these villages,
Cisco recommended that the KICTB should first run a pilot program to understand fully the
implications of the project. The board agreed that rolling out digital villages prior to testing
the initial concepts could prove disastrous. Thus, the “Pilot Pasha Centers” (PPCs) – the
Swahili word meaning “to inform” – were launched in January 2009. The committee selected

                                                                                             117
5 cyber cafes in rural areas across the country to serve as a test bed for the research that
would build the model for large-scale deployment. By April 2010, these 5 PPCs featured
512K connectivity, Cisco WebEx online conferencing, surge protectors, and various ICT
equipment. Cisco also provided content from its Connected Knowledge Centers program.
Following an initial third-party evaluation, the KICTB identified the factors necessary in
ensuring Pasha Center success:

           Physical infrastructure such as reliable power supply and connectivity
           Auxiliary services
           Marketing for awareness and education
           Entrepreneurial initiative in customer service and experience
           Innovative new uses of the Internet for business collaboration and “edutainment”
           Training accreditation for various vocational e-learning courses

In response to these findings, Cisco developed tools to establish a business-planning model.
To break even, Pasha Centers could generate an income of US$ 550 per month by offering
the use of five computers for eight hours a day and charging one cent per minute of use.
When looking at the cost of broadband, salaries, rent, etc., however, the US$ 12 balance was
determined to be unsustainable and other options for income generation grew to include the
selling of airtime, printing, binding, etc. and then expanded to incorporate services such as
computer training, CD burning, and photocopying.

Following the PPC program, Cisco developed a toolkit for Pasha Center managers and used
the knowledge gained to scale and roll out a larger digital villages program. Part of the toolkit
offers recommendations in establishing public and private sector partnerships to support the
mission. Kenya’s Ministry of ICT announced in March 2010 that service providers
“Safaricom, Telkom Kenya, Zain Kenya, and Essar telecoms would be required to roll out the
five digital villages each per constituency,” totaling 4,200 centers throughout the country. In
2012, the KICTB set aside a US$ 315,000 loan for 26 entrepreneurs looking to build pasha
centers. In the first six months of that year alone, Kenya saw the creation of 63 new pasha
centers, which provide approximately 30% of the country’s total ICT coverage. In order to
qualify for the loan, entrepreneurs must undergo a training certification program.

Box 6.3.52. – Computer Literacy and Training Program (India)

In recent years, India’s economy has transformed as a result of the rapid growth seen in its IT
sector. Paradoxically, by 2004, many of its citizens still lacked access to this technology, in
large part due to geographic barriers. The nation’s rural villages, for instance, tended not to
have basic telecommunications infrastructure. At this point, IBM partnered with Department
of Information Technology (DIT) in West Bengal – an agriculture-dependent state in Eastern
India with just under 100 million inhabitants – to implement the same IT workforce-training
programs that the corporation had deployed in countries such as Venezuela, China, and
Egypt.

At this point in time, the DIT already made commitments to increasing IT access and training
within its education system at the middle school and high school levels to prepare students to


                                                                                             118
enter the workforce with the skills necessary for IT-related careers. The initiative, known as
the Computer Literacy and Training Program, was credited with the region’s s ector growth
and highest IT revenues in the country, but economists feared that the availability of skilled
labor would not match the demand for such services for much longer. By investing in the
training of all students, the government hoped to narrow the digital divide and also create the
workforce supply necessary to strengthen its high-tech outsourcing economy.

To enhance the program, IBM Learning Solutions brought IT infrastructure, support, and
management as well as education services to 400 schools in the state, which then aimed to
reach more than 150,000 students within the first 3 years. Within each school, select teachers
received IT training and certification so that they could act as instructors for students and
other faculty members. Each school received 10 computers equipped with Intel processor
servers and Red Hat Linux 8.0.

Those students interested in more high-level careers had access to advanced IT training. All
instruction took place face-to-face in the local language across multiple platforms. Students
took part in annual assessments and received formal completion certificates. IBM also offered
orientation sessions for teachers who could continue the program following the end of the
corporation’s contract with the Government of West Bengal. The program was sustained by
charging students US$ 0.75 per month.

IBM mangers keep the project on track through mechanisms such as delivery milestones, user
satisfaction, and performance parameters while ensuring an adherence to class schedules,
machine uptimes, and annual exams. The managers also take responsibility for keeping the
government informed through reports and briefs.

By 2009, the program trained nearly 6,200 teachers in 330 private and public schools across
19 districts and enrolled 160,000 students. Evaluations have attributed an increase not only in
IT skills amongst students, but also in overall academic performance as well to the program.

6.3.5.4. Private efforts:

While awareness efforts promoted by public sector are critical, they do not ensure
automatic success. Administrations change due to electoral cycles and what could
have been important for one party is not for another. Furthermore, public sector
support does not necessarily mean unlimited funding. Finally, sometimes central
governments are far removed from special groups to be targeted and, therefore, lack
proper understanding of their specific needs.

In that context, support from the private sector might prove beneficial to improve
sustainability of demand stimulation programs. For example, ZeroDivide is a
philanthropic organization that seeks to increase digital inclusion in low income,
mostly non-white communities in the United States. The program comprises a
number of projects, such as training community members in the use of technology,

                                                                                           119
increase household computer ownership through the provision of free or low-cost
equipment, and develop community-focused content. The projects also included
deploying Wi-Fi broadband networks and a community technology center for training
and Internet access.

The Digital Inclusion project is a similar program. In this case the private non-profit
organization partners with community organizations to distribute low-income
households an ultra-portable laptop, high-speed broadband access, couple with digital
literacy training, and content aimed at low-income households.

There are two types of benefits potentially derived from private efforts in broadband
awareness. First, local companies can provide not only funding but also a good
understanding of the needs of local groups. Secondly, multinational corporations can
provide funding but also the possibility of cross-fertilizing experiences from one
country to another in terms of “what works and what doesn’t”.

Box 6.3.53 – Google ‘Good to Know’ Campaign (United States)

In early 2012, Google launched its “Good to Know” campaign focusing on educating
consumers about web-related privacy issues and the ways they can make the experience safer
and more secure. Topics include privacy and security tips, such as how to use two-step
verification, the way to lock a public computer, and how to make sure website connections
are secure. Google not only published a Good to Know book on its website, but also ran ads –
all of which are accessible for download on the website - in newspapers and magazines,
websites, and subway cars in the New York and Washington, D.C. metro areas. The website
covers four main: “Stay safe online,” “Your data on the web,” “Your data on Google,” and
“Manage your data.” It also features sections that focus on online safety for the family and
offer resources such as explanations of technical jargon, links to related Google services, and
a list of organizations dedicated to providing help and advice online.

While informative, the ads are written in an entertaining, light-hearted manner, but with
enough condescension to make readers realize that they need to pay more attention to how
they use the Internet. Google’s director of privacy described the campaign’s target audience –
the casual Internet user who may not be as savvy when it comes to online safety as he or she
should be - in a corporate blog post. “Does this person sound familiar?” she asked. “ He can't
be bothered to type a password into his phone every time he wants to play a game of Angry
Birds. When he does need a password, maybe for his email or bank Website, he chooses one
that's easy to remember like his sister's name-and he uses the same one for each Website he
visits. For him, cookies come from the bakery, IP addresses are the locations of Intellectual
Property and a correct Google search result is basically magic.”

Prior to its launch in the United States, Google first debuted the multi-million campaign in
October 2011 in the United Kingdom through its partnership with the Citizens Advice
Bureau.

6.4. ACHIEVING AFFORDABILITY

This chapter focuses on one of the three dominant adoption obstacles needed to be
tackled to achieve broadband diffusion among residential subscribers: limited
affordability. The research reviewed in section 6.2 indicated that while price does not
play a significant role among early adopters of broadband, once service coverage has
reached a tipping point, affordability becomes the most important variable driving
penetration. Moreover, research also indicated that, at higher penetration levels of
broadband, price elasticity coefficients start to decline, indicating the lower
importance of affordability as an adoption factor. In that regard, research indicates
that limited affordability is a critical adoption obstacle when broadband penetration
ranges between 3% and 20%, which is the stage at which most emerging countries
are.

In the first section of this chapter, the economics of broadband adoption will be
presented. The section will introduce all the components driving the total cost of
ownership of the technology. They comprise device acquisition and other on-time
costs, service subscription retail pricing (with multiple sub-components), and service
taxation. This introduction will serve as a basis to discuss the potential policy
initiatives addressing the broadband affordability obstacle.

Three types of initiatives, targeting the affordability obstacle will be reviewed (see
figure 6.25).

      Figure 6.25. Affordability Policy Initiatives in Residential Broadband




The second section will review the service pricing obstacle and policies to tackle it.
Service pricing will be discussed in terms of fixed and mobile broadband
independently. It will first introduce an approach for conducting comparative pricing
analysis, followed by presenting models of service price elasticity, ending with a
review of potential policy initiatives to reduce service pricing.

The third section will turn to device pricing. Broadband access requires devices
capable of accessing the Internet. They range from computers supplemented with a
modem (called USB modem, dongle, or air card) to smartphones, netbooks, and
tablets. Since pricing dynamics (and capabilities) vary greatly across devices, the

                                                                                   121
demand structural factors linked to device access will be discussed in two distinct
sections: personal computers and mobile devices. In this context, several potential
programs aimed at reducing device pricing will be presented.

The fourth section will focus on taxation. This area will review the different
equipment levies (import duties, value added taxes, and sector specific) and service
taxes (value added and sector specific). This review will serve as a basis to discuss
the impact of taxation on total cost of ownership of broadband, and present examples
of policy initiatives to tackle broadband taxation.

6.4.1. Economics of broadband adoption

The economic structural factors driving broadband purchasing need to be assessed in
terms of the total cost of ownership, a concept that allows factoring in purchasing cost
of devices, initial activation costs, as well as the recurring costs resulting from
monthly service charges. Total cost of ownership is the sum of the cost of usage
(service) plus part of the cost of the access device, which is assumed to be amortized
throughout its lifetime, usually between two and four years, depending on the
device30.

As a general principle, telecommunications services have negative elasticities: higher
prices imply lower demand. However, pricing needs to be decomposed among its
different elements because they affect broadband initial adoption and usage in
different manners. Initial adoption is constrained by device acquisition, its
corresponding tax burden, service activation cost, and expected recurring costs
derived from subscription retail fees and taxes.

Device retail prices and their corresponding taxes vary between fixed and mobile
broadband. Fixed broadband requires the acquisition of a personal computer, while
mobile broadband could be supported through either a personal computer or a
smartphone. Retail acquisition prices of this type of equipment are driven by supply
and demand conditions, in particular manufacturing economies of scale and
component costs. While device retail pricing is typically out the realm of policy
control, taxation is not. Final price of devices is affected by a set of different taxes,
which vary by country and year. As will be shown below, taxes can, in some cases,
add a significant burden to the retail price.

The importance of expected recurring costs on initial adoption varies by type of
device. For example, in general, service subscription for a wireless modem is
generally stable, representing a monthly rate for an expected type of service plan. As
a result, subscribers can easily factor in the monthly subscription cost on the total cost
of ownership and make an informed decision regarding adoption. In the case of
smartphone access to mobile broadband service, prepaid subscription allows
subscribers to purchase service while limiting total cost of ownership to a minimal
amount. In this case, taxes play a more limited role than in the case of service
activation and postpaid usage rates.



30The average replacement cycle of a personal computer is 3.5 years, while the cycle for a mobile
handset is 18 months.

                                                                                                    122
6.4.2 Broadband service pricing as a barrier to adoption

In section 6.2.2, the structural factors and obstacles affecting residential broadband
penetration were reviewed. Among them, limited affordability was highlighted as a
critical factor, according to which certain portions of the population either cannot
acquire a device or purchase the subscription needed to access the Internet.

This section will focus on broadband service pricing, analyzing the impact of service
activation and monthly subscription on demand. It begins by reviewing the current
situation and trends regarding broadband pricing. At the same time, it presents a set of
approaches for comparing broadband prices. Based on pricing data, it provides an
analysis of price elasticities and presents tools for estimating increases in service
penetration based on price reduction. The analysis of price elasticity will set the
context to the review of different policy initiatives to reduce service pricing, as a way
of stimulating adoption.

6.4.2.1 Cross-country comparisons of fixed and mobile broadband pricing

Broadband pricing does not lend to easy comparisons within and across countries.
Operators tend to include different components in the price structure, ranging from
speed (download and upload), limits on content download (known as CAPs),
hardware costs (such as the modem and router), and activation costs (including
installation charges). In addition, monthly prices can include voice subscription
charges if broadband is offered within a service bundle. As a result, comparative
analysis needs to normalize all of these components, in addition to control for
purchasing parity differences across world regions. This section provides examples of
pricing differences and presents an approach for developing price comparisons useful
for serving as an input for developing policy initiatives.

Cross-country comparisons of broadband prices require implementing a consistent
approach for collecting pricing information and a methodology for
normalizing/standardizing data. In the first, domain, the OECD has generated a
methodology 31 for gathering broadband prices that comprises the following
recommendations:

        If possible, data should be collected for three country operators (the
         incumbent telecommunications operator, the largest cable provider (if there is
         cable coverage) and one alternative provider, if available) offering service
         over DSL, cable or fiber. Offers should be advertised in the respective
         operator websites, be available in the country’s largest city (or region if it is a
         regional carrier), and be communicated as monthly subscriptions 32 . It is
         usually the case that advertised speed is not similar to service throughput.
         Given the difficulty in collecting reliable service quality data, it is preferable
         to develop comparisons based on advertised speeds (although it would
         penalize the higher quality providers)
        In collecting pricing data, the following elements should be addressed:

31http://www.oecd.org/internet/broadbandandtelecom/criteriafortheoecdbroadbandpricecollections.htm
32While the OECD methodology excludes all offers under 256 kbps, a comparison across emerging
countries might require including below 256 kbps products.

                                                                                              123
             o Is broadband pricing a stand-alone offer or is it sold as part of a service
                bundle including voice communication, and/or television service?
             o Do offers include discounts for long-term commitments33? The OECD
                methodology recommends that, for standardization purposes, only
                commitments of 24 months or less should be included
             o Treating voice components of a bundle: Some plans offer a number of
                included phone calls as part of the broadband plan, discounts for
                carrier pre-selection, or require a certain amount of phone use per
                month. The OECD methodology typically tries to exclude, if possible,
                all ancillary pricing elements from the broadband price
             o Finally, while the OECD methodology converts pricing data to
                purchasing power parity (PPP), it is worth mentioning that if
                comparisons are made within a certain region, depicting similar
                income per capita levels (e.g. Latin America), this conversion is not
                needed
        In collecting data for comparing CAPs (the limit on information to be
         downloaded from the Internet), the following recommendations should be
         followed:
             o Present caps in megabytes per month
             o Caps should be compiled for all domestic and international traffic.
                However, in cases where national and international traffic are capped
                differently, the caps for international traffic should be considered for
                comparison
             o Costs for additional traffic should be accounted for in price per
                additional megabyte
             o When operators offer additional monthly traffic in different bundles
                the price should reflect the lowest price per MB across offers
             o When prices per additional megabyte are on a graduated scale, the
                average of all prices should be used
             o Prices and bit cap measures should not take into account bandwidth
                offered during specific times of day
Once data  is collected, its normalization for comparison purposes needs to follow a
set of standard procedures:
        Use average pricing for the first 24 months of service purchase
        Use a common set of offers:
            o For fixed broadband, start with a basic plan with a 2 GB cap
            o However, in some countries the basic plan (which is offered at a low
                download speed) could have been withdrawn from the market; in that
                case, it could be preferable to measure a service that is likely to stay in
                the market for an extended period of time: 2.5 Mbps download speed
                and 6GB cap. This choice normalizes product selection eliminating the
                low performance products, that could be offered in certain countries as
                the “Basic” plan



33
  In some countries, operators offer significant discounts to subscribers who commit for long periods.
These longer-term subscribers can often comprise a large majority of all broadband subscribers in a
country (e.g. in the Republic of Korea it is possible to benefit from further discounts for commitments
over 24 months)

                                                                                                   124
             o The OECD recommends 34 the usage of broadband price baskets for
               comparison purposes. For example in fixed broadband, basket 3 is
               defined as services with at least 6 Mbps of download speed and a 6 GB
               cap. In the case of mobile broadband, the OECD differentiates
               between laptop, tablet, and handset use, proposing five baskets per
               device (see table 6.13).

6.4.2.2 Broadband price elasticity

As reviewed in section 6.2.2.4, broadband price elasticity is a function of service
adoption. At lower levels of service adoption, broadband is price inelastic. This
means that early adopters are not sensitive to price declines. Beyond a threshold point
near 3% adoption, price elasticity increases significantly and persists at high levels up
to 20% penetration, when it starts declining again.

Evidence of this behavior has been identified in a number of studies of fixed
broadband pricing. On the other hand, research on mobile broadband pricing is not
conclusive as of yet in terms of estimating service price elasticity. This is due to the
technology’s recent deployment, compounded by the complexity of estimating cross-
elasticity between fixed and mobile broadband (two services that will be increasingly
becoming substitutes).

The following section reviews evidence of price elasticity in each service and
presents a model that could serve as a tool for estimating service adoption as a result
of potential price reductions.

Fixed Broadband price elasticity

There are several studies that shed a light on the potential price elasticity of
broadband services. For example, by relying on data from a survey of approximately
100,000 US households, Goolsbee (2006) found fixed broadband service demand
between 1998 and 1999 to be fairly elastic. According to the author, for levels of
penetration between 2% and 3%, price elasticity was between -2.8 and -3.5.

In another study, Galperin and Ruzzier (2012) utilized data for the OECD and Latin
America to estimate the elasticity of fixed broadband service in 2011. Their main

Economy Papers, No. 205, OECD Publishing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5k92wd5kw0nw-en.

                                                                                           125
finding is that the elasticity of both regions varies. In the case of Latin America,
where penetration averaged 7.66% in 2011, broadband price elasticity was -1.88. In
the case of the OECD, with an average broadband penetration of 27.48%, price
elasticity was -0.53. This result begins to point out that, as expected, mature markets
tend to be more price inelastic. Coincidentally, Lee, Marcu and Lee (2011) found that
for OECD countries between 2003 and 2008, elasticity was -1.58 (lower than for
Latin America). Confirming the inverse relation between penetration and elasticity,
Dutz, Orszag and Willig (2009) analyzed the elasticity of broadband service in the US
between 2005 and 2008. They found that in 2005 the elasticity was of -1.53 but
declined to -0.69 in 2008, confirming the declining elasticity trend at higher
penetration levels.

Considering the level of service adoption at the time each of these studies was
completed allows estimating the relationship between fixed broadband penetration
and elasticity (see figure 6.26).

            While the elasticity data in figure 6.26 is presented in absolute values, the price
            elasticity coefficient is always negative indicating the indirect relationship between
            price and demand. Thus, the relationship between both variables indicates that a
            change in the price level would have a positive impact in the level of penetration of
            fixed broadband. By relying on the estimates depicted in figure 6.26, the effect of a
            price reduction between 5% and 25% was estimated for different regions of the world
            (see table 6.15).

            As indicated in table 6.15, the price elasticity is higher for the regions with lower
            levels of penetration. As a result, in regions like Sub Saharan Africa or South Asia, a
            25% price decline could yield an approximate doubling of current penetration levels.
            The increase in fixed broadband penetration is substantial in other emerging countries
            as well (see table 6.16).

                                                                                                                  128
     In the section above, the evidence provided showed that fixed broadband service
     pricing was indirectly linked to penetration levels. Unfortunately, given the recent
     deployment of mobile broadband there is still no substantial evidence linking pricing
     and penetration 35 . However, existing pricing data for OECD and Latin American
     countries allows estimating the elasticity for a 3G connection. For this purpose, six
     models were specified for mobile broadband plans dongles/ air cards and
     smartphones:

             Smartphone plans with 500 MB monthly cap
             Smartphone plans with 1 GB monthly cap
             Smartphone plans with 2 GB monthly cap
             Air card/dongle plans with 1 GB monthly cap
             Smartphone plans with 2 GB monthly cap
             Smartphone plans with 5 GB monthly cap

     Data used for estimating elasticity coefficients comprised the following:

According to these models, a 10% price decline in the mobile broadband plan for a
smartphone connection would generate a penetration increment between 2.35% and
3.20%. On the other hand, a 10% price decline in air cards / dongles plans for
personal computer connectivity could yield an approximate increment of penetration
level between 6.33% and 6.73%. In the second situation the increment would not only
come from new broadband subscribers; it would comprise a substitution effect from
fixed broadband to mobile broadband. Finally, elasticity coefficients for handsets
with higher CAPs tend to be lower than the basic plans because high volume
subscribers are less price sensitive, while lower CAP subscribers are primarily email
and Facebook users, implicitly low value subscribers.

6.4.2.3.The effect of competition on broadband pricing

Having reviewed the importance of service pricing in limiting adoption of broadband,
it is relevant to address potential policy initiatives that could yield a reduction in
tariffs. As it has been considerably researched, the development of competition is one
of the major tools for affecting a reduction in telecommunications service pricing.
The theoretical basis of competition is the notion that, in the telecommunications
market, multiple operators can compete among each other and generate sufficient
benefits for consumers in terms of price-reductions, while guaranteeing an
appropriate rate of innovation. The following features characterize a
telecommunications competition model:

      Existence of multiple operators serving the same market based on their own
       network.
      Existence of multidimensional competitive dynamics (prices, services and
       user service quality) among industry players.
      Reduction of retail prices for consumers, and intense competition in product
       differentiation (dynamic efficiencies), resulting in additional consumer surplus
      Competitive stimulation for each operator to increase the level of investment
       in its own network


                                                                                   130
                      Absence of tacit collusion between operators due to the high rate of
                       innovation and competition based on product differentiation

               A number of countries around the world have already implemented this list of
               principles resulting in competition for broadband as a model for organizing the
               industry (see table 6.19).

               The industry structure in these countries not only includes a facilities-based
               telecommunications operator and one (or more) cable operator, but also a second
               mobile/landline telecommunications operator and at least one mobile operator
               competing with the landline operators on an intermodal scale.

               A competitive market structure has a positive influence on the reduction of broadband
               prices. For example, this author determined that in Latin America, the average
               monthly price of a basic fixed broadband price declined from US$21.06 in 2010 to
               US$17.46 in 2012 (a reduction of 17% in two years). Table 6.20 presents price
               reductions in the region across fixed and mobile broadband plans.

            As table 6.20 indicates, broadband prices in Latin America have been declining,
            albeit at different rates. To understand the importance of competition in driving the
            price reductions, Katz (2012) completed an analysis of the relationship between
            competitive intensity (as measured by the Herfindahl Hirschman Index) in the Latin
            American broadband industry and retail prices (see figure 6.27).

            prices is 0.63%. The figure 6.27 also indicates that, even at moderate competitive
            levels (HHI <4000), prices tend to cluster at the lower levels within the region. A
            similar analysis was conducted but in this case, the HHI index was calculated by

Figure 6.28 depicts a directional correlation between the index of competitive
intensity in the broadband market and prices of fixed broadband offerings at the 6
Mbps download speed level. This relationship indicates an embryonic convergence
between the fixed and mobile broadband markets that is having a positive influence in
the price of fixed broadband. In this context, one can point out at the positive
influence that mobile broadband launch has had on overall service prices.

As a side note, it is important to mention that it is common in the developed world
and some emerging countries that telecom operators, in the context of competitive
pressures, offer first-time customers discounts and free promotional offers covering
activation fee, first-year monthly subscriptions, etc. This marketing effort, resulting
from competitive incentives prevalent in the market, has also a positive contributing
impact on total cost of ownership.

6.4.2.4. Policy initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of broadband service

Beyond the competitive stimuli, the reduction of broadband service prices can be
achieved through a number of targeted policy initiatives. These initiatives are
generally implemented with the objective of achieving universal broadband adoption
(see Module 4 – Extending Universal Broadband Access and Use). The underlying
rationale for these policies is that, beyond a competition model, government policies
should be implemented to further price reductions of broadband in order to make it
accessible to segments of the population affected by limited affordability.

This section will examine four policy options. The first one relies on state-owned
telecommunications operators to offer, under their public service imperative, a low-
priced broadband service. Obviously, this option is only viable in those countries that
have not completely privatized their telecommunications industry. The second option
entails a negotiation between the government and private operators for them to offer a

                                                                                                   133
low-priced broadband service targeted for disadvantaged segments of the population.
The third option is also an agreement between the government and private sector
broadband providers to offer low-priced services, but in this case limited to
institutions (such as schools, libraries, or health clinics). The fourth option comprises
offering free Internet access through WiFi services located in public areas, such as
squares, libraries, and transportation hubs.

Launch by a publicly owned service provider

Under this option, a state-owned broadband provider assumes responsibility, as a
public service entity, for providing a low-price broadband service. The advantage of
this option is that, in addition to fulfilling the objective of tackling the economic
barrier, the offering can act as an incentive for other private operators to launch their
own more affordable service. Services under this option range from a 256 Kbps line
offered for free to existing wireline customers (Uruguay) to a prepaid broadband plan
(Venezuela).

Box 6.4.2. - Antel (Uruguay)

In a country where the fixed-line market is not privatized, government-owned Antel has long
enjoyed a monopoly on the Uruguayan telecom market. As such, the telco charged some of
the highest prices for broadband in the region, despite the fact that Uruguayan wages are less
than those rates found in some of its neighboring countries. These high fees were blamed for
the country’s lower broadband penetration rate.

In May 2011, Antel launched its “Servicio Universal Hogares” – or “Internet for All” - plan,
aiming to bring Internet access to every home in Uruguay. For a one-time payment of US$30
– the cost of a modem - all fixed line phone customers qualified for free ADSL service. The
package offered a basic connection of 256 Kbps and targeted the low-income segment to
which the price of broadband represented a barrier to connectivity. At the time, those homes
and businesses with basic Internet connections paid approximately US$ 150 monthly. In a
similar push to expand connectivity, the Uruguayan government also planned to reach
schools and educational institutions with Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) technology.

In June 2011, Antel announced plans to connect more than 80,000 Uruguayan households
with FTTH by the end of the year. This project initially targeted higher-income, urban areas
but incorporated plans to expand to the lower socioeconomic groups following the initial
rollout. The rollout incorporated an investment of more than US$100 million and a
partnership with the Chinese technology firm ZTE. Described as “the most ambitious
broadband effort in Latin America,” the FTTH project as well as the opening of the
Bicentenario submarine cable in early 2012 not only increased broadband access, but also
enhanced broadband speed and service quality.

By the end of 2011, however, the broadband penetration rate in Uruguay hovered at 36%
(22% of which was mobile), compared to a mobile phone penetration rate of 141%. In an
attempt to address this disparity, Antel focused on the provision of mobile broadband
services. The December 2011 launch of its commercial LTE services allowed the telco to
offer broadband connections to those regions not yet impacted by the FTTH rollout as well as
those customers who could not afford the connectivity costs of fixed Internet.

Following initial pilots in trials throughout 2011, Antel began the rollout and expansion of
LTE services, offering customers two package plans from which to choose. By signing a 2-
year contract, customers could pay US$ 90 per month for 30 GB. For US$ 76 per month plus


                                                                                          134
an additional $6 in modem rental fees, customers could access 15GB through a 15-day auto-
renew contract.

Box 6.4.3 – Plan ABA de CANTV (Venezuela)

In May 2008, state-controlled incumbent fixed-line operator CANTV launched its prepaid
broadband Internet access plan known as Plan ABA. The plan targeted Venezuela’s lower -
income population and those citizens who did not already have the technology, offering
“social rates” to make broadband more affordable and accessible. The plan not only served to
increase subscribers for CANTV, but to improve the provider’s image as “a company
belonging to the state of Venezuela” with the goal of reducing the digital divide. The operator
began focusing more of its attention on the provision of more affordable basic services
following its 2007 renationalization.

Customers can pay for and manage their broadband usage through CANTV’s prepaid calling
card, known as the Un1ca card. Launched in 2001, the card offers access to fixed, wireless,
and public telephony and Internet services without the obligation of upfront payments or
commitments. The card was credited with providing Venezuela citizens with one-stop access
to a wide range of services and products, acting as a “communications passport.”

Basic services – which included a 256 kpbs connection and a 100 Mb download limit- cost
US$ 9.31 monthly, but users could increase capacity for an additional US$ 0.08 per Mb.
Users were also supposed to pay the US$ 30 Aba subscription fee, which included a modem,
but the operator waived the fee. The plan is aimed at prepaid customers; postpaid broadband
customers will also require an Un1ca card and must purchase or rent their own modems in
order to use the service.

Agreement reached by private operators




                                                                                           135
In this case, government policy makers negotiate with private broadband providers
the offering of a low-priced plan. This can be achieved in the context of the
formulation of a national broadband plan. Such has been the case of the Brazilian
National Broadband Plan, which triggered a negotiation leading to the launch of the
“Banda Larga Popular”, offered by several operators.

Another option to reach such an agreement could be to attach the offering of a low-
priced plan as a sine qua non condition for providing regulatory approval of an
incumbent plan. Such was the case in the United States, where the government
determined that Comcast should offer a low-priced broadband service if it were to
receive approval for acquiring NBC Universal. This triggered a process that led all
other major cable TV operators to join in the initiative.

A slight variance of this option entails a move by an incumbent wireline operator to
offer a low priced plan and create good will in order to pre-empt a threatening
government regulatory move.

Box 6.4.4 - Internet Essentials (United States)

In September 2011, cable giant Comcast launched its “Internet Essentials” plan to offer
broadband to as many as 2.5 million low-income families for a monthly rate of US$ 9.99. The
plan came as part of the approval process in its acquisition of the media and entertainment
company, NBC Universal. Beyond the 1.5 Mbps Internet connection, eligible customers will
also qualify for $150 refurbished computers, which will come with software donated by
Microsoft. Comcast will also offer digital literacy training to these users free of charge.

To qualify for the plan, households must a) not yet have a broadband connection and b) have
a child enrolled in a school lunch program. The US$ 9.99 monthly rate lasts for two years, at
which point customers will likely have the option to renew at a higher – but still discounted –
price. Because the US$ 9.99 covers the companies’ overhead costs, providers will likely not
experience a significant loss in earnings nor will the government need to provide
supplemental funding.

In late 2011, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that
most of the country’s major cable companies partnered to join the initiative. These companies
included Time Warner, Cox, and Charter, though AT&T and Verizon chose not to participate.
The low prices will likely attract new subscribers who previously could not afford the cost of
an Internet connection. Morgan Stanley is working with the cablecos to develop a microcredit
program while partnering employment and education companies will offer specialized
content to make Internet access more attractive to these users.

The FCC said that it supported the partnership as a means to increase the country’s broadband
penetration, particularly amongst this otherwise underserved segment of the population, and
praised its potential to guarantee digital literacy amongst the country’s students. It hopes that
by increasing Internet access and digital literacy, high school graduates will be more hirable,
as even entry-level jobs typically require basic ICT skills, which also help employees in the
online job search.

Box 6.4.5. Banda Larga Popular (Brazil)

In 2009, only one-third of households within the Brazilian state of São Paulo had access to a
broadband connection. Of the remaining two-thirds, nearly 60% blamed that the high cost of
Internet services. That year, the governments of São Paulo, Pará, and Distrito Federal
partnered together to offer low-income citizens in these districts affordable broadband. The
social inclusion program, dubbed Banda Larga Popular, provided Internet connections for
US$ 17 per month (35 reals, or 29 reals in those states where ICMS taxes do not apply). The
Ministry of Communications oversees all monitoring and compliance while the operators are
in charge of the provision of broadband and the promotion of such services. Inked in 2011,
the initiative falls under the umbrella of Brazil’s National Broadband Plan (PNBL) and will
run through 2014.

Telefónica Brasil delivered the service, which reached speeds up to 256kbps using wi-mesh
technology. To ensure that the telco could cover its costs while charging such a low price, the
government waived the 25% ICMS tax. While the government invited other telcos to
participate, only Telefónica chose to do so.

Within São Paulo, the project target low-income households that already owned a computer
but did not have an Internet connection. Initial analysis estimated that this criterion would
include approximately 2.5 million households.

In December 2010, Cisco announced the results of its Broadband Barometer study, showing
that Brazil had reached 16.2 million broadband connections earlier in the year. This number
reflected an increase of 7.9% over the previous half year and 18.1% over 2009. The study
credited the growth in home computers with the rise in broadband subscribers, which it said
came as a result of lower tax rates on ICT equipment and by the increase in low-cost
broadband plans available to new users. Cisco directly cited the success of the Banda Larga
Popular initiative.

Box 6.4.6 - Projecto Banda Larga nas Escolas Publicas Urbanas (Brazil)

The government of Brazil launched its initiative Projeto Banda Larga nas Escolas Públicas
Urbanas (PBLE) in 2008, committing to the provision of free broadband connections to a
minimum of 90% of urban schools. The communications ministry established the project as a
partnership with the ministry of education and the telecom regulator, Anatel. The Brazilian
telcos signed concession agreements with the government agreeing to support the program as
a term of rolling out their broadband backhaul infrastructure. As part of the agreement, the
operators are required to provide the broadband, an agreement that critics argue forces
customers to bear the costs.

Per the country’s communications ministry, by year -end 2010, 91.6% of urban public schools
(or 57,586 institutions) received free Internet connections. The project targeted the remaining
5,278 urban schools in 2011 and by October 2012, a total of 63,394 public primary and
secondary schools offered broadband access to students. Of these schools, 37,773 are
municipal, 25,363 are state-owned, and 258 are federal. In 2012, the project connected an
average of 17 schools per day. It will likely continue through 2025 to impact a total of 70,000
schools and update connection speeds, which at present are between 2 Mbps and 10 Mbps.

Free Wi-Fi access points

The provision of free WiFi Internet access is being conceived as one of the building
blocks needed to build a city’s international competitiveness. There are several
features and options of a free WiFi program:

       Coverage of public spaces: squares and parks, public transportation, including
        metros, public libraries
       Type of service: amount of time provided for free access (1hr. limit while
        commuting, open unlimited access)
       Type of service provider: under contract with telcos or other broadband
        player, offered by the city administration

                                                                                           138
       Quality of service: basic 128 kbps, video streaming quality
       Business model: free provision based on a singular event, then moving to a
        pre-paid offering, potentially including customized interactive digital
        advertising

Box 6.4.7 - Free Underground and Overground Internet (London)

The government agency overseeing all forms of public transportation in the city, Transport
for London has increasingly demonstrated a commitment to providing IT services throughout
the system. The Summer 2012 Olympic Games only heightened this focus. Beyond using
advanced technology to improve its own operations, the agency stressed the importance of
data access to allow commuters to “make better travel choices.” Implemented innovations
included open standards, sensor networks, and “ubiquitous connectivity.”

In March 2012 – just months before the kickoff of the Summer Olympic Games in the city –
Transport for London announced that it awarded a contract to Virgin Media for the provision
of free WiFi within the London Underground. A similar contract was awarded two weeks
later to the Internet Services Provider Cloud for the London Overground. The project
provided commuters with one hour of free WiFi access per day to the more than 200,000
daily commuters. The providers promised speeds fast enough to stream video without delay,
but access was only available at the stations and not on the actual trains in the case of the
Underground due to technical reasons.

Virgin’s contract alone covered 120 London stations, 80 of which were wired in time for the
Olympics. The remaining 40 stations had WiFi access by the end of 2012. While the contract
stated that Virgin must supply the WiFi free of charge during the Olympic games, the
provider continued to offer the service for free through year-end 2012. Beginning in 2013,
Virgin Media customers will continue to access the network at no additional cost; all other
users will pre-pay by the minute. Access to online commuting information will remain free.

Neither the government nor the operators disclosed the financial arrangements beyond stating
that the contract covered the cost of deployment.

The project spurred interest from global advertising firms, which explored the potential to
display interactive ads and landing pages. At some locations, Nokia fully funded the project
as a way to market the launch of its Windows smartphone. This investment allowed the
Finnish ICT company to monitor users’ browsing trends throughout London and also helped
providers to gauge the best locations for future free WiFi hot spots. The trend in advertiser
investment will likely continue.

In late July 2012 Telefónica Europe’s subsidiary, O2, completed the deployment of hotspots
throughout the city to complement the London Underground and London Overground WiFi
networks. While the provider required users to register, they could continue to access the
network free of charge even once the Olympics ended. In order to justify this investment, O2
targeted local businesses for advertising revenue, with department store House of Fraser
immediately participating in the plan. The provider envisions customized advertising,
allowing restaurants and retailers to reach potential customers with discounts and information
based on their geographic location.

Box 6.4.8. - Public WiFi (France and Greece)

In 2006, Parisian mayor Bertrand Delanoe announced that free public access WiFi “is a
decisive tool for international competition.” One year later, the city launched its WiFi
network with access points in public parks, squares, and libraries. As part of a contract with
the mayor’s office, Alcatel-Lucent and wireless operator SFR partnered to build and manage
the network, which included more than 400 free public hotspots. Paris and the Ile-de-France
regions funded the project, which totaled approximately 2 million EUR plus an additional
500,000 EUR annually for maintenance. SFR won the contract through a public tender, but
France Telecom sued the city, citing “unfair competition,” despite its participation in the
tender.

This initiative was not the first of its kind in Europe. With more than 2 million residents of
Paris proper and more than 11 million residents in the Parisian suburbs, however, it perhaps
had the largest reach. In 2005, the Greek town of Trikala launched its 80 million EUR E-
Trikala initiative, which included the installation of the town’s first 10 free public WiFi
points. In its first year alone, it attracted 3,500 users. In 2007, the second phase of the project
went live, with Swedish telecom manufacturer Ericsson contracted to deploy the more
expansive infrastructure and improve service. E-Trikala also partnered with Cisco to build a
15-kilometer metro optical network linking city buildings and connecting additional hotspots.
By mid-2007, the number of registered users had doubled since year-end 2005, reaching more
than 6,000 users.

Following this project, seven additional Greek municipalities announced plans for similar
initiatives. These cities and towns signed an agreement to connect with each other to create
“the first digital community in Greece.” Sweden saw a similar model, whereby more than 150
individual towns built their own networks and connected through a shared IP backbone.

In 2008, Hong Kong finalized its revision of the 1998 Digital 21 Strategy, stating the
following objectives:

           Facilitating a digital economy;

                                                                                              140
           Promoting advanced technology and innovation;
           Developing Hong Kong as a hub for technological cooperation and trade;
           Enabling the next generation of public services; and
           Building an inclusive, knowledge-based society.

The strategy recognized the importance of investing in information infrastructure to promote
economic growth. Already boasting some of the world’s highest broadband penetration rates,
Hong Kong looked for additional ways to encourage Internet access. Incorporated into the
Digital 21 Strategy, the Government WiFi Program – known as GovWiFi – installed Wi-Fi
hotspots in government locations to offer free broadband access.

Later that year, the program began the installation process throughout all 18 districts.
Locations included public libraries, public enquiry service centers, sports venues, cultural and
recreational centers, cooked food markets and cooked food centers, job centers, community
halls, major parks, government buildings and offices

Per its website, through GovWiFi:

           People can surf the web freely for business, study, leisure or accessing
            government services whenever they visit the designated Government premises
           Business organizations can extend their services to a wireless platform to reach
            and connect with their clients.
           ICT industry players can make use of this new wireless platform to develop and
            provide more Wi-Fi applications, products and supporting services to their
            clients, and open up more new business opportunities.
           Foreign visitors can enjoy Internet access at the designated tourist spots

By mid-2012, the program offered services at more than 400 locations. Its website allows
users to search for locations and also offers security tips and addresses the WiFi-related
health concerns that have been raised. To encourage use of the WiFi spots, the program
periodically holds events, contests, and promotion campaigns.

Box 6.4.10 - Google’s “Free WiFi” Project (Brazil, India)

In December 2012, Google announced its partnership with Enox, the Brazilian advertising
firm, to launch its “Free WiFi” project, allowing users to access the Internet from their
personal smartphones, tablets, or computers in bars throughout seven cities in the southern
region of the country.

Google Brazil stated that, “"The number of people with smartphones in Brazil is greater than
in Germany, France and Australia, and most of them use their devices every day to read
news, watch video clips and connect with their friends. By means of this project, we're sure
that the Brazilians will be able to enjoy better their friends when they are at the pub, besides
creating and registering memories of their moments.”




                                                                                            141
The connection utilized a WiFi or fiber optic connection depending on the bar, offering
connections between 10 Mbps and 30 Mbps. Users did not face time limitations or browsing
restrictions.

Beyond offering citizens free Internet services, the project also promoted the Google brand.
When users activated the WiFi, their devices automatically launched the Google home page,
which displayed the company’s products and download suggestions.

Free WiFi ran for 90 days during the Brazilian summer.

The multinational Internet company had experimented with a similar project in India in
January 2012, when it partnered with O-Zone Networks to offer free WiFi in an attempt to
increase the user base of its social network, Google+, and the video site YouTube, which it
acquired in late 2006. While Internet use in Brazil was unlimited and unrestricted, users in
India had to pay to access any sites beyond Google+ (unlimited) or YouTube (10 minutes per
week for free). The partnership between Google and O-Zone also lasted 3 months.

While critics of the program saw the initiative as a marketing ploy to promote Google’s own
projects in India, proponents saw its potential for increasing Internet access in a country with
less than 10% Internet penetration. Prior to the launch of this project, Google cited that 40%
of Internet searches and 67% of e-commerce came from mobile Internet use and that free
WiFi access would only further encourage this trend of accessing the Internet from portable
devices.

This project bears similarity to Google’s collaboration with Boingo Wireless in the United
States, when it sponsored free and discounted WiFi throughout New York City hot zones and
subway stations. Following its initial success, the offering expanded to reach Internet users in
other metropolitan areas, including Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Seattle, and
the District of Columbia.

Box 6.4.11 - Free Public WiFi (Thailand)

In January 2013, Thailand’s regulator, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications
Commission (NBTC), announced that it had awarded a grant of US$ 32 million from its
Universal Service Obligation (USO) budget to the ICT Ministry to further its free public
WiFi project. The project aims to create 40,000 public WiFi spots by the year’s end, with
250,000 spots slated for 2018. The initial locations will include public universities and
hospitals, city halls, and major tourist destinations. The installation of 150,000 access points
will include five access points per location with speeds of 2Mbps per second. Each access
point can accommodate 15 users at 20 minutes per access.

                                                                                            142
CAT Telecom (the state-owned telecom infrastructure company) and TOT Corporation (the
state-owned telco) will provide the service. The project represents collaboration between the
ICT Ministry and service providers, focusing on the country’s large cities and the “last-mile
areas” that currently lack fiber optic networks.

Per the ministry, the expansion of the Free WiFi project will accelerate the Smart Thailand
project, which falls under the national ICT framework. Known as “ICT2020,” it serves as a
development strategy highlighting the government’s commitment to ICT infrastructure and
services. To ensure its success, ICT2020 emphasizes universal Internet access and device
affordability as well as government organization collaboration and support. Under Smart
Thailand, the government has committed to offering broadband coverage to 80% of the
population by 2016 and 95% of the population by 2020. In early 2012, only one-third of the
population had access. Ultimately, the initiative aims to increase Thailand’s gl obal
competitiveness by improving education and business sectors and encouraging investment.

The first phase of Smart Thailand, which runs until 2015, will upgrade the existing telecom
networks to cover the aforementioned 80% of the population. The second phase, which runs
from 2015 to 2020, incorporates broadband network installation in regions not yet covered by
a fiber optic network. The National Broadband Network Company (NBN Co) will operate the
nationwide network as part of a joint venture between existing private and public sector
operators. The venture will reduce investment duplication and separate the installation and
service provision functions. Combined, the two phases will likely total US$ 2.7 billion.

Box 6.4.12 - Public WiFi (Estonia)

By 2008, nearly all of Estonia – a country that spans 45,000 square-kilometers and has a per
capita GDP of just $14,300 - had WiFi access following a nationwide push to install access
points throughout the country. Colloquially known as “E-stonia,” by this point 1.4 million
residents – 50% of whom resided in rural areas – were connected to wireless Internet and
70% of the population conducted personal banking transactions online.

Beginning in 2002, volunteers with the WiFe.ee organization lobbied for local cafes, hotels,
hospitals, parks, and so on to offer Internet access, working with them to design and
implement the necessary networks. WiFi.ee stressed the importance of working with locals in
the deployment process, as they feared outsiders would not understand the needs of the
people nor the geographic or political issues that could potentially cause roadblocks. In fact,
once established, nearly all wireless connections were managed by local business owners who
recognized that not having WiFi was akin to encouraging customers to go elsewhere.

                                                                                           143
With few exceptions, access came at no cost to the user. Further, with the exception of public
schools and libraries, the entire network deployment was made possible without government
assistance. Local businesses took responsibility for the creation of the more than 1100
hotspots throughout Estonia. Additionally, by 2005, nearly all schools had Internet access.
From their home computers and mobile phones, students could access their schools’ servers
and connect to national libraries.

In 2010, Veljo Haamer, the creator of WiFi.ee estimated that his organization had set up the
WiFi found in 75% of the bars and cafes in Estonia’s capital, Tallinn. WiFi.ee charges local
business owners between US$ 300 and $500 for the connection setup and maintenance. As
more businesses adopted the model of offering free Internet services to customers, other
businesses had to follow suit to remain competitive. As the service became more ubiquitous,
even train and bus lines began offering WiFi connections.

Box 6.4.13 – Fon (Spain and international)

Created in Madrid in 2005, where it is headquartered, Fon Wireless is now incorporated and
registered in the United Kingdom with offices in both Spain and the United Kingdom as well
as in the United States, Brazil, France, Germany, and Japan. Its investors include such names
as Google and Skype. Described as “crowdsourced WiFi,” Fon allows its members to access
free roaming through Fon WiFi Spots by sharing their own home WiFi. In essence, these
access points combine to create a “network where everyone who contributes connects for
free.” At present, Fon has more than 5 million “Fon Spots” around the world.

Accessing Fon WiFi requires either a Fon WiFi router with a broadband connection or
membership with one of Fon’s telco partners, which have Fon integrated into their CPE
devices and offer customers DSL/Cable modems with the pre-installed Fon feature. Non-
members can also access a Fon Spot by purchasing an access pass once connected to the
WiFi signal. The passes are only available on the login page of each individual hotspot.

Each Fon Spot consists of two separate, dedicated WiFi signals, one for the home user and
the other for other members and visitors of the network. The home traffic is prioritized so as
not to slow down home Internet use. Further, to guarantee security, a firewall separates the
home signal from the guest signal. Fon also encrypts user login information.

While Fon began as a small startup in Spain, it has since grown into a service accessed
around the world and now with large-scale broadband providers in several countries. In 2007,
for instance, it formed a partnership with British Telecom (BT), giving the telco’s three
million broadband customers the option to join the network, which had nearly 200,000 global
WiFi hotspots - the largest network of WiFi hotspots in the world at the time. Prior to BT,

                                                                                          144
Fon also secured partnerships with such providers as the United States’ Time Warner Cable
and France’s Neuf. While some Internet Service Providers continue to prevent their
customers from sharing broadband, others recognize that including access to free WiFi
hotspots outside of the home makes broadband packages more appealing to potential
customers. BT, for example, boasts that its subscribers don’t just get a broadband connection
in their house, but also access “from a park bench in New York, to a bus stop in London, to
an apartment in Tokyo.”

Service subsidization

Under service subsidization policies, the government offers a refund on the cost of
broadband access.

Box 6.4.14 - Education Tax Refund (Australia)

The Australian Government’s Education Tax Refund (ETR) offers parents, caregivers, legal
guardians, and independent students refunds on the education expenses of primary and
secondary school children. These costs can include computers and Internet connections, as
well as such items as educational software, textbooks, and school supplies. Recipients for this
tax refund qualify based on their Family Tax Benefit (FTB) eligibility. Beneficiaries of FTB
must demonstrate that they:

           Have a dependent child under 16 years of age  or
           Have a dependent child between the ages of 16-20 years who has completed a
            Year 12 or equivalent qualification, or who is undertaking full-time education or
            training leading to a Year 12 or equivalent qualification, or who is exempt from
            this requirement, or
           Have a dependent full-time student 21–24 years of age,   and
           Have care of the child for at least 35 per cent of the time,   and
           Meet the income test,   and
           Be an Australian resident, or a special category visa holder residing in Australia,
            or the holder of a certain type of temporary visa.

Claimants of the ETR must demonstrate that they have qualifying education expenses and
received FTB. In order to receive the refund, eligible candidates must keep their receipts,
which serve as proof of their claims. Before claiming the refund, individuals must first have
their FTB Part A claim approved. They can then either submit the claim with their individual
tax filings or complete a separate ETR request form.

Per the ETR website, the refund covers the expenses of the following items, many of which
encourage students’ home computer use:

           Home computers and laptops
           Computer-related equipment such as printers, USB flash drives, and disability

                                                                                           145
            aids to assist in the use of computer equipment for students with special needs
           Computer repairs
           Home internet connections
           Computer software for educational use
           School textbooks and other printed learning material, including prescribed
            textbooks, associated learning materials, study guides and stationery, and
           Prescribed trade tools for secondary school trade courses.

While the website provides an ETR calculator, it also offers guidelines in terms of what items
can be claimed and the amount of the deduction. A full-time caregiver, for instance, can
claim 50% of eligible education expenses up to $794 (to receive $397) for each primary
school child and $1,588 (to receive $794) for each secondary school child. The same amounts
apply to individuals who share the care of a child.

In 2011, the program cost approximately $4.4 billion and reached 1.3 million Australian
families. The government used television, print, radio, and online advertising to target
eligible families. The 2012 Budget introduced the new Schoolkids Bonus, which will replace
the Education Tax Refund. Through this new item, eligible families will automatically
receive annual payments of $410 for each primary school child and $820 for each secondary
school child.

6.4.3. Device Ownership as a barrier to adoption

In the introduction of this chapter, it was indicated that broadband access requires
devices capable of accessing the Internet, ranging from computers supplemented with
a modem (called USB modem, dongle, or air card) to smartphones, netbooks, and
tablets. Beyond service pricing, broadband economic adoption obstacles are linked to
device prices. This section reviews the trends in device pricing and presents policy
initiatives aimed at reducing the purchasing cost. It focuses on two areas: personal
computers and mobile devices.

Before reviewing the policies that could be potentially implemented for reducing the
access cost of devices, it is important to mention that device pricing has been
consistently declining driven by a reduction of production costs (manufacturing
economies of scale and component costs) and increasing demand. The decline has
been even more abrupt if quality and performance improvements are factored in. For
example, Kopecky (2008) compared the personal computer price index with its
quality index between 1977 and 2004, and pointed to a 25% per year decline in
quality-adjusted prices with an equal rise in demand (see figure 6.28).




                                                                                          146
     Figure 6.29. Price and quantity Indices for Personal Computers (1977-2004)

Retail pricing of personal computers ranges currently between US$ 275 and US$
1,600, a decline from US$ 800-US$ 2,50037. Moreover, prices for refurbished devices
can reach between US$50 and US$ 100.

The decline in smartphone prices has been significant, if not more dramatic than in
the case of personal computers. Table 6.21 presents pricing and performance data for
the different generations of the popular Apple iPhone.

       While introductory subsidized price of the first iPhone model was US$499 (with 4
       GB of memory), the current model (iPhone 5) starts at US$199 (with a minimum of
       16GB and a wide range of features.

       Even if the iPhone is targeted at higher income segments in the emerging world,
       manufacturers such as Huawei and Nokia are offering low-priced smartphones. For
       example, Huawei in partnership with Safaricom launched an US$ 80 Android phone
       in Kenya. Still, carriers in the emerging world consider that $50 is a suitable price
       point for a smartphone.

       In late-2012, the Samsung Galaxy overtook the iPhone as the world’s best selling
       smartphone, a reflection of its efforts to target a larger user base though phones with a
       broad range of features at various price points. Apple has released 6 models of the
       iPhone since 2007, with each version seen as a successor to the previous model. In
       contrast, since 2009 Samsung has released more than 20 versions of the Galaxy with
       models and prices varying for targeted demographics. Much of the success of the
       phone has been credited with its ability to simultaneously market the high-end models
       in developed economies while pushing cheaper models to capture key markets like
       India, China, and Brazil39.

The iPhone operates on the iPhone Operating System (iOS), but all Galaxy phones
feature the Android operating system and thus compete with other Android
smartphones. Considering that certain Internet access devices still remain out of reach
of disadvantaged segments of the population in the emerging world, governments
have at their disposal a range of policy models aimed at tackling the device
affordability barrier. The following sections review first programs aimed at reducing
the purchasing cost of computers, and then present initiatives focused on handsets,
primarily smartphones.

6.4.3.1 Programs to reduce the cost of purchasing Personal Computers, Laptops,
        and Netbooks

Three types of programs have been implemented to overcome the personal computer
ownership barrier. The first one focuses on the provision of subsidies to reduce the
acquisition price of devices. The target in this case could be either households at the
lower end of the socio-demographic pyramid, students all the way from primary
school to university, and SMEs, especially micro-enterprises.

The second program is typically targeted at students in primary education, with
governments distributing “one Computer per Child”. In this case, computers are
provided free of charge to students in public schools.

The third type of initiative entails a reduction of the access price by eliminating or
decreasing taxes paid at time of purchasing. Levies affected by this measure could
range from sales tax, import duties, and even sector-specific levies.

Targeted subsidies

While tax reduction could be an indirect subsidy, this section will address initiatives
such as vouchers or the provision of lower priced devices for qualifying segments of
the population (e.g. students).

Box 6.4.15 – Computer Subsidies (China)

In 2009, more than half of China’s population lived in the rural parts of the country, where
the average per capita annual income was a mere US$ 700 (approximately 25% the average
income of urban residents), broadband penetration rates were lower than in the urban areas,
and the region’s personal computer market was nearly untapped. During this time, on a global
level, PC shipments had decreased and both company and consumer spending had dropped.
In China, however, 40 million PCs were sold annually and it remained the world’s second
largest computer market behind the United States, a trend the Chinese government hoped to
continue to prevent the country from falling into a recession. As layoffs became more of a
reality, the government feared that further economic downturn could lead to social unrest.

To support economic growth and stimulate spending in rural areas, the Chinese government
announced a subsidy program offering a 13% rebate to rural residents buying select products.
The subsidies were designed to help domestic and multinational PC manufacturers alike
increase their sales to the country’s under-developed regions, particularly after national
computer demand fell in the last quarter of 2008. Forecasters had initially predicted a 9%
growth for 2009, but subsequently lowered that figure to 3%. The rural computer subsidy
project came as part of a larger US$ 586 billion subsidy program to increase demand for

                                                                                        149
home electronics, known as the Home Appliance Subsidy Program. Beyond directly
impacting the manufacturers, the component makers and retailers also felt the benefits of the
stimulus.

The government identified 14 vendors that could participate in the program and sell low-
priced PCs in rural China, which would not only make computers more affordable but would
also spur competition in the industry. The winning bidders included four large multinational
and ten local PC vendors. The tender was valid for one year in thirteen provinces.
Manufacturers created products specifically designed for the project in order to qualify and
two-thirds of the computer models offered were priced under US$ 500, with all models
ranging in price from US$ 290 to US$ 510. Lenovo, China’s largest PC maker, for instance,
offered 15 computer models beginning at US$ 365 and announced plans to expand its sales
network to 320,000 villages by 2012 as a result of the program. Competitor Hewlett-Packard
also offered 15 eligible desktop and laptop computers equipped with agricultural and
educational software.

In the rural market, vendors must tailor their advertising and products accordingly to meet
region specific demands. The PCs are built, for instance, with potential variations in power
supply voltage – a frequent problem in rural areas – in mind. The computers many times also
come with special software for farmers, like inventory management programs. Analysts say
that in order to see success in China’s smaller cities, PC vendors must ensure physical
proximity to their customers. Rarely will citizens in rural areas have the means or the desire
to drive for hours to buy a computer. To catch potential consumers’ attention, Hewlett -
Packard sponsors variety shows and film screenings and offers product demonstrations in
small towns. It also sent buses equipped with its products to elementary schools to advertise
and to train students on how to use their technology. Competitor Lenovo began marketing its
computers as luxury wedding gifts, employing the slogan, “Buy a Lenovo PC, Be a Happy
Bride,” and delivering them in large, conspicuous boxes. The company also has a flashy
showroom with a section of the store devoted to products designed specifically for rural use.

Nearly 60% of all rural residents – or 200 million households - qualified for a subsidy. Initial
estimates expected the program to generate the sales of 800,000 computers.

Box 6.4.16 – Kenniswijk Project (Netherlands)

The Dutch General Directorate of Telecommunication and Post (DGTP) partnered with the
Ministry of Economics to develop the Kenniswijk Project in 2001. Creating an experimental
environment, the project provided residents of Eindhoven, Helmond, and Nuenen with
innovative computers, mobile, and Internet products two years ahead of the rest of the
country free of charge, resulting in a “consumer market of the future.” Providers would offer
innovative ICT infrastructure and services while consumers had the opportunity to use them
and enjoy their benefits.


                                                                                            150
Deemed “a vision of the broadband future,” this experiment allowed the ministry to examine
the social and economic effects of increased ICT and broadband access within a community
as researchers closely monitored the impact digital service had on households. By
understanding the impact of broadband, this analysis of the project served as a best practices
guide and shaped the development of future technology. It also promoted a synergy between
infrastructure deployment and service provision. Ultimately, the government hoped that such
a project would increase the Netherlands’ international competitiveness and attracts business
from international ICT firms.

The Kenniswijk.nl foundation organized the project. By 2002, however, Kenniswijk BV, a
public-private organization that coordinates broadband services and infrastructures though
subsidies for companies and consumers took control of the implementation of the Kenniswijk
Project. Kenniswijk BV encouraged companies and institutions to make use of the subsidies,
and the project ultimately grew into collaboration between 27 private and public parties. The
organization oversaw the facilitation, motivation, and support of the involved organizations.

Participants in the project received triple-play broadband services, including TV/video,
telephony, and Internet. This physical network was open to multiple services providers,
which in turn stimulated competition and encouraged innovation, particularly in areas such as
e-health and distance learning. The technology also enabled citizens to change their services
to meet their individual needs without involving a third party.

In its part, the government allocated a total US$ 40.5 mn toward the project. Roughly US$ 11
mn went toward infrastructure development subsidies, which included a US$ 700 discount
per user and allowed for more than 15,000 connections. The national subsidies included US$
31,000 for “small services” and US$ 356,000 for “large services.” Regional subsidies covered
up to US$ 35,600. Participants in the program received a free 10 Mbps Internet subscription
for the first year and were not charged additional connection costs. The 10,000 subscribers
received newsletters every 2 – 4 weeks and had access to the project’s website and helpdesk.
Volunteer organizations and visitor centers were also encouraged to take advantage of
subsidies to put the technology to use.

In total, the endeavor spurred approximately 1000 new project ideas, 300 of which were
turned into concrete project plans and subsidy requests. 135 were ultimately approved.
Admittedly, the unstable economy in 2001 – 2002 resulted in delayed market investments,
initially hurting the project’s uptake. Prior to 2004, the project saw a low amount of services,
connections, and subsidy requests. Engagement with the private sector and the inclusion of
OnsNet Nuenen into the Kenniswijk project spurred the number of requests and connections
and contributed to growth.

The project ended in October 2005, resulting in a total 15,000 FTTH connections and 135
services in Kenniswijk. Through this experiment, policy makers learned a great deal
regarding motivating companies to install infrastructure and users to subscribe to a service.
Even once the project ended, more than 80% of households continued to use the fiber
connection. Following the success of this project, nearby towns implemented similar
programs based on the same approach.

Distribution of free devices

These programs are more prevalent with regards to computer distribution, although
they could be extended to other broadband access devices such as smartphones.

Box 6.4.17 – SchoolNet Project (Namibia)

Established in 2000 to offer sustainable, low-cost ICT and Internet services to all Namibian
schools, the not-for-profit organization SchoolNet Namibia also provided training and
support to empower youth through these tools. In partnership with local telcos and
international development agencies, it brought affordable computers and solar-power
computer labs to schools while promoting free and open source software solutions, Creative
Commons licensed educational content, and discounted flat-rate wireless Internet services.
Using free and open source software offered cost-reduction and scalability advantages and
made sharing and adaptation easier for local communities. Two years after its founding,
SchoolNet created its own ISP, XNet, allowing schools to access the Internet through dial-up
or wireless (spread-spectrum WIFI in the ISM 2.4GHz band and 2.6GHz band) connections.

Following the success of the program, SchoolNet took an active role in advising Namibian
policy makers on ICT matters. The national government recognized SchoolNet as a major
force in promoting ICT rollout and its role in job creation, all in line with the country’s
National Development Plans for 2000 – 2010. The organization also served as an example for
subsequent sustainable ICT in education projects undertaken in regions across Africa. On a
higher level, the initiative focused on digital inclusion and creating an effective ICT program
that could be easily replicated.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency offered ongoing financial
assistance, which totaled nearly US$ 3 mn. Funding also came from other government aid
agencies, including Canada’s International Development Research Center (IDRC) and the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Telecom Namibia, the
country’s incumbent telco, formed the aforementioned ISP, offering schools a flat -rate
Internet package for US$ 25 per month. The provider also brought free dial-up access to
schools for a discounted rate. Those schools that could not afford services qualified for cross-
subsidies from schools with more resources. ICT volunteers assisted in basic ICT and
support. Each of the labs held five computers - many of which were refurbished and came
equipped with the Open Source Linux 7 operating system – that were connected to a server
and a printer.

In just five years, the project afforded 300 schools the opportunity to set up computer labs
and connect to the SchoolNet ISP. The network also connected additional libraries, teacher
resource centers, and NGOs. By the end of the project, the ISP boasted more than 180,000
regular Internet users, compared to the 11,000 users of the next largest commercial provider.

The program ultimately dissolved in 2009 amidst criticism from the Ministry of Education.

Box 6.4.18 - Federal Computers for Learning Program (United States)

In 1996, United States President Bill Clinton signed the Executive Order 12999 “to ensure
that American children have the skills they need to succeed in the information-intensive 21st
century.” This order led to the enactment of the Federal Computers for Learning Program,
which donated “retired” federal government computers and ICT equipment to eligible schools
and education-related nonprofit organizations free of charge. The program targeted pre-
kindergarten (age 4) through high school (age 18) students located within the pre-determined
“federal rural empowerment zones” that consistently suffered from high poverty and
unemployment rates. In doing so, the program aimed to promote sustainability and economic
development in otherwise disadvantaged communities.

The program benefits the schools, many of which face shrinking budgets and cannot
otherwise afford computers to keep up-to-date with the changing environment of modern
technology. At the same time, the federal government disposes of approximately 10,000
computers – many of which are only three years old – every week. As such, it also supports
current President Barack Obama’s commitment to “zero waste in government,” ensuring that
this equipment is put to use.

When the program first began, most schools received basic IBM-compatible personal
computers, though Pentium-based systems and occasional Apple computers were donated as
well. Beyond computers, the government agencies also donated modems, routers, services,
ICT equipment, and research technology. While the agencies also offered software to some
schools, these donations were contingent on licensing and permits. The schools and
organizations did not pay for the computers or the equipment, but did pay the shipping and
handling costs as well as the refurbishing costs when applicable.

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) facilitates and sponsors the
program, but schools must be proactive and register for the program themselves. To
participate in the program, qualifying schools applied through the Computers for Learning
website. Once registered, the website offered tools and resources that enabled schools to:

           Create an overall plan for addressing computer needs
           Assess the suitability of different types of available computer equipment
           Request donated Federal computers
           Contact a member of the Computers for Learning Partnership for free shipping
           Find assistance if computers require upgrading
           Find National Tech Corps volunteers, and
           View other registrants' registration information

The CLP website offers a “Success Stories” section, where schools can write in to share the
impact the computers have had. One 9th grade teacher from Maryland wrote that after
spending just five minutes registering on the site, the school received 252 computers,
equipping every classroom with a computer and allowing teachers to incorporate the



                                                                                         153
technology into their lesson plans. Other teachers commented on the quality of the computers,
noting that not one required repair or lacked sufficient speed or memory capacity.

By mid-2012, the program donated nearly 360,000 computers and equipment – worth more
than US$ 317 million – to thousands of schools and organizations throughout the country.

Box 6.4.19 - Smartphones to the homeless (Republic of Korea)

In 2011, the Seoul government launched its “Smart Seoul 2015” program, expressing its
commitment to “making Seoul the ‘best smart technology’ city in the world by 2015.” The
program addresses infrastructure expansion and information security as well as ICT services
and e-government programs. To promote e-government services, for example, it focuses on
communication with citizens, convenience, and a campaign against the negative aspects of
increased information access. At the time, Seoul’s e-government had already ranked first
place amongst the World’s 100 Cities for four consecutive years, serving as “a benchmark for
countries and cities around the world.”

With an emphasis on ICT and smartphone use amongst all segments of the population -
regardless of factors such as age or income – Smart Seoul 2015 incorporated programs to
distribute technology to disadvantaged groups. For instance, the city provides Braille
terminals and magnifying devices to the disabled and the visually impaired. The program also
offers PC repair, Internet addiction projects, and training courses.

In August 2012, the government announced that it would provide homeless shelters with free
smartphones and wireless Internet services. The provision of ICT falls under the
government’s larger Social Networking Service Education Program, which focuses on
training and skill building amongst the city’s homeless population. The smartphones will not
only allow these citizens to search for employment opportunities from any location, but also
to reconnect with their families and friends and interact with other members of the
community.

Citizens of Seoul can donate their used smartphones to the Seoul Metropolitan Government,
which then distributes the devices to the residents of the shelters. The government also offers
workshops at the shelters, which residents must complete prior to receiving the phone. The
training encourages utilization of social networking services and mobile applications. Each
smartphone comes with a US$ 20 credit, but the phones will still work in free Wi-Fi areas
once all credit is used.

Box 6.4.20 - Reaching the Third Billion: Bringing the Prepaid Miracle to Broadband

The Intel World Ahead Program, inspired to enable more first time users online, and by the
low cost pre-paid mobile broadband programs in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, recognized the
opportunity for an affordable solution that includes connectivity, a computing device, and
beneficial content, to address all of the demand side gaps that consumers face. In fact,
through initial research, it was discovered that in the total cost of ownership, the largest
affordability gap was actually the cost of the broadband subscription, when compared over a
4-year period. In fast-growing developing countries (such as Brazil, China, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Mexico and Russia), broadband access can account for 60-80% of the total cost of
ownership of a PC. Often, only about 20% of citizens could afford the monthly plans.
Piloting the program in early 2011, working with service providers, equipment providers,
content providers, and governments, new low cost solutions were created, including entry-
level notebooks, compelling content, and prepaid broadband, accompanied by exciting
advertising, branding and marketing, to enable and encourage first time users to get online.

The pilot results were impressive, and by the end of 2011, all eight pilots were complete,
enabling more than one million people with entry level PCs, content, plus prepaid broadband
packages. These programs also encouraged the PC industry to aggressively lower prices to as
low as $200, and encouraged content providers to create exciting new content. In one
example in Vietnam, the telecom companies, Viettel and VNPT, offered 700MB of data
download for just $2 prepaid. At that price, broadband affordability surged from 12% to 70%
of citizens. Early results from the program also showed that stimulating demand is more than
just price; it’s also about delivering meaningful content and applications. For example in
Kenya, Safaricom package include not only entry-level netbooks, and pre-paid broadband but
valuable content, including British Council ‘Learn English’ software, Education applications
such as Intel® Skoool and Encyclopedia Britannica, as well as McAfee safety applications.
In addition, they come with 1.5GB of free data download. This is a very compelling offer that
enhances education and learning, and runs far better on a PC than over a phone or tablet.

Today, successful programs are running in over 45 countries worldwide, and have enabled
over 15 million new users to get online. With the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) often
reduced to 2/3 of the previous cost (see Table), over one billion people can now afford to
enjoy technology benefits for the first time.

 6.4.3.2. Programs to reduce the cost of purchasing mobile devices, smartphones,
and tablets

This section addresses issues similar to that of computer devices but for mobile
access equipment.


                                                                                         155
Box 6.4.21. – Free Devices (South Africa)

Every year, South African mobile phone subscribers on contract plans receive free or heavily
discounted top of the line devices from the country’s three main service providers, which
offer the perk in an effort to stay competitive in the market. Initially, this subsidy attracted
new users – particularly among the country’s lower classes - and encouraged contract plans,
but now that the market is well-established and South African mobile phone penetration rates
exceed 100%, providers are reconsidering this strategy. At this stage, the subsidies also pose
a problem for new entrants that may not have the financial backing necessary to give away
handsets to attract customers the way MTN and Vodacom can. When Cell C entered the
market in 2001, for instance, it had no choice but to offer handset subsidies, negatively
impacting the operator’s early earnings. By the time operators recouped enough money to
justify the subsidy, the contract was up and customers expected a new phone.

Further, rather than working to improve technology access amongst potential low-income
customers, the subsidies are more often used to attract high-end subscribers, particularly as
average revenue per user decreases with increased penetration amongst all socio-economic
classes. Lower end, prepay customers also have access to the originally subsidized phones
through the second hand market.

As providers expand their operations into other regions in Africa that typically come with
high business risks, they are forced to accrue large debts and thus cannot afford to lose money
in the relatively more lucrative South African market. With such a large proportion of their
earnings going straight to the bank to pay off interest loans, the operators must find a balance
in the cost of acquiring new customers. To this extent, while the device subsidies may have
initially increased mobile phone penetration in South Africa, these same subsidies may now
be responsible for holding back market growth in neighboring regions. Additionally, as
governments impose taxes, tariffs, and duties, the operators must continue to focus on cutting
costs. Ultimately, at this stage, profitability trumps subscriber numbers.

In the meantime, however, subsidized phones may soon lead to higher profit margins in
South Africa as operators push customers to utilize high value services like mobile broadband
and applications. These services will require smartphones, which most consumers cannot
afford without a discount. In many African countries, disposable income serves as the largest
barrier to broadband uptake. If providers continue to subsidize devices, particularly
smartphones, they could in turn increase Internet and broadband access in this region. If these
subsidies prove too costly to justify, providers could experiment with different pricing
packages or partner with the government to make the devices more affordable.

MTN, Vodacom, Cell C and others have invested heavily in their high-speed networks to
increase capacity and both meet and encourage the demand for high-speed broadband.
Declining prices – and incentives like device subsidies – are expected to contribute to a
growing broadband market.

Box 6.4.22 – Device Subsidies (United States)

In an effort to make broadband contract plans more appealing to consumers, many telcos go
beyond mobile phones, also subsidizing modems, computers, and tablet devices with high-
data contract agreements. With these contracts, subscribers may qualify for devices with no
up-front charge in exchange for committing to long-term plans that promote the use of high-
value services like Internet access. The revenue generated by these services justifies the cost
of the equipment for the providers, and contracts usually have high early termination fees to
guarantee that they can recoup the cost.

In 2008, for instance, AT&T Mobility began subsidizing laptops. As a result, data revenue in
the fourth quarter of that year rose 51.2% when compared to 2007’s fourth quarter results. To
do so, AT&T partnered with Lenovo to offer customers laptops with embedded 3G modems
for US$ 150 off when signing a two-year mobile data plan. To qualify for this offer, users
signed up for AT&T’s $60 / month service, “DataConnect.” The embedded modems could
handle download speeds up to 1.7 Mbps and uplink speeds up to 1.2 Mbps, but only worked
with DataConnect. As part of the contract, users could terminate the agreement early for
$175.

By 2012, however, this practice no longer produced the same returns, largely due to the
saturation of the market. While the subsidization of smartphones continues to make sense, the
practice does not hold for the tablet market, where consumers tend to buy models designed
for Wi-Fi and not cellular use. In August, AT&T announced that it would no longer subsidize
tablets. AT&T continues to sell tablets, however, but at non-subsidized prices. As a result, the
cellco’s tablet data plans do not have a built-in commitment and are slightly cheaper than
previous offers. The price point increases based on data; 3GB plans cost consumers $30 per
month while 5GB plans run for $50 per month. Shared data plans run for $10 / month plan.

Competitor Verizon has also faced recent financial challenges as a result of device subsidies.
In July 2012, the operator announced that it would no longer offer unlimited data plans to
new customers. While the operator insisted that subscribers would benefit from shared data
plans, amidst criticism, it reversed this decision. To compensate, subscribers who received
subsidized plans will no longer have the option for an unlimited plan.

Box 6.4.23 – Operator Partnerships (Uganda)

In an effort to increase their subscriber base, service providers and operators in Uganda have
entered into partnerships with each other to offer lower-priced devices and services. By
making such tools more affordable, cost of broadband becomes less prohibitive, in turn
boosting the country’s overall uptake of the technology.

International semiconductor manufacturer Intel introduced in 2012 a new sales model within
its developing market territories, working with telcos to offer high-speed broadband and
affordable computers. This strategy is expected to reduce the broadband and high speed
Internet divide and strengthen these countries’ economies. In some instances, the model
replicates the prepaid model that has boosted the demand for mobile phones, attracting first-
time buyers who can only pay for services they can afford at the time.

As part of this strategy, Intel partnered with Orange Uganda in May 2012 to offer subscribers
a variety of lower-priced personal computers and high-speed broadband packages – all
available at Orange retail stores. The arrangement benefits both the corporation and the telco;
Intel will experience growth opportunities in the computing sector while Orange will more
easily reach new users and increase subscriptions. As a result of increased access to ICT and
consumer spending, Uganda will likely see a rise in GDP and digital literacy as well as
integration of ICT into the education system. Further, as the populace becomes more
comfortable with this technology and access and skills increase, the country will become
more competitive in the global knowledge economy.

This model is not the first time Uganda has seen partnerships between service providers that
led to increased broadband affordability and adoption. In 2006, four of the country’s Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) – Bushnet, SpaceNet, Africaonline and One2Net, all members of the
Uganda ISP association – worked together to consolidate their purchase of bandwidth. This
consolidation led to a 25% reduction in cost, which enabled them to reduce the rates of
bandwidth purchased from them by schools by 75%.

Prior to this partnership, each ISP had acquired approximately 5 – 6 Mbps per month for
$5,000 - $6,000. When working together, they together acquired 50 Mbps at a wholesale
price for buying in bulk. The providers could then pass these savings along to potential
customers. One2Net, for example, had previously charged a flat rate of $600 per month for
64K speeds. Following the consolidated purchase, it reduced the price to $150 for individuals
and $250 for businesses and offered higher speeds.

At the time, the price of Internet to average individual users was prohibitively high and
blamed for the country’s low broadband penetration rates. Users faced charges of
approximately 14 cents per minute as a result of expensive bandwidth, which the ISPs also
said hurt their business.

6.4.4. Taxation as a barrier to adoption

The total cost of ownership of broadband is impacted by numerous taxes. On the
services side, three exist:

          Value added tax: most countries impose some form of value-added tax, a
           general sales tax or similar consumption tax as a percent of the total bill
          Telecom specific taxes: some countries charge an additional special
           communications tax as a percent of the service bill
          Fixed taxes: in addition to the tax as a percentage of usage, some
           countries charge a fixed tax that could be either driven by general
           communications usage or wireless usage

In addition to service-based taxes, other levies can be imposed on access equipment:

          Value-added tax: these represent the taxes paid directly by the consumer
           at time of purchasing a personal computer or purchasing and/or
           exchanging a smartphone
          Customs duty: this tax on imported equipment is already included in the
           retail price of the computer or the smartphone
          Other taxes: telecommunications specific taxes on smartphones or
           computers (e.g. royalties calculated on the cost of the equipment)
          Fixed taxes: special fixed duties on smartphones, such as ownership fees

Countries do not follow a uniform approach to mobile services taxation. While all
countries tax both services and equipment, the type of taxes selected and their amount
vary significantly, with the consequential varying impact on total cost of ownership
of a broadband device.

A scan of service taxation approaches across countries yields four categories:

          Universalization of service: Reduce taxes as much as possible to
           stimulate broadband adoption
          Direct taxation without sector discrimination: high VAT while
           recognizing the distortion effect of sector-specific taxes
          Direct taxation and sector specific taxes: combine VAT with a sector
           specific levy
          Service tax revenue maximization: leverage broadband communications
           as a source of direct taxation, by combining high VAT, high sector
           specific taxes and/or a fixed levy

While most developed and some developing nations reduce service taxes to promote
universalization of broadband service, the pattern is not consistent across emerging
countries. For example, the Africa and Asia Pacific continents comprise numerous
nations with taxation approaches aimed at universalizing mobile services, while this
approach is significantly less prevalent in Latin America (see table 6.22).

           Moving now to equipment (personal computers, smartphones) taxation approaches,
           four types can be identified, partly driven by the existence or not of import duty:

                      Sector discrimination based on moderate import duty: VAT combined
                       with low import duty
                      Sector discrimination based on high import duty but no telecom tax:
                       high import duty and VAT but no sector specific taxes on handsets


                                                                                                          160
                         Sector discrimination based on high VAT and import duty but low
                          handset specific tax: combine high VAT with a sector specific levy
                         Equipment tax revenue maximization: leverage broadband
                          communications as a source of direct taxation, by combining high VAT,
                          high customs duty and a high sector specific levy, or low import duty and
                          high sector specific tax

               The most prevalent equipment taxation model around the world is based on VAT and,
               in some cases, low sector discrimination through moderate import duty (see table
               6.23).

               The combination of service and equipment taxation approaches yield four distinct
               models:

                         Universalization and protectionism: this approach aims at reducing
                          levies with the purpose of decreasing total cost of ownership and
                          stimulating broadband adoption; it can include an equipment import duty

                                                                                                             161
           and a sector specific tax (which is relatively low and therefore has
           minimum distortion potential)
          Protectionism: this approach is similar to the one above, except that high
           value-added taxes on service increase substantially the total cost of
           ownership
          Sector distortion: this approach introduces sector specific service taxes
           with the objective of increasing government revenues but, in doing so,
           plays an economically distortion role by emphasizing taxes on the
           telecommunications sector
          Tax maximization and sector distortion: sector specific taxes are
           introduced not only on broadband services but also on equipment with the
           purpose of maximizing government revenues, with the consequent
           distortion impact

As pointed out before, prevalent taxation models tend to differ by region. As
expected, most developed countries have adopted universalization and protectionism
tax approaches given that they do not need to rely on the telecommunications industry
to increase revenues for the treasury. In addition, there are a number of emerging
countries, which have chosen a Universalization and Protectionism approach in order
to stimulate telecommunications service adoption. Notable examples in this category
are China, Angola and Malaysia.

In the next category of taxation approach -protectionism- emerging countries that
have adopted pro-active ICT development strategies: India, Rwanda, Egypt, Chile
and Kazakhstan can be identified. In other words, the first two taxation categories are
associated with technology development objectives.

At the other end of the spectrum there are also some significantly large emerging
countries - Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Pakistan -
where the taxation approach runs counter to maximizing broadband adoption.

          In this context, taxation could have a detrimental effect on the public policy strategy
          aimed at deploying broadband. The impact of these different taxation approaches on
          total cost of ownership of broadband service varies widely. For example, in Mexico
          the impact of taxes on total cost of ownership of mobile broadband is 18.4%, in South
          Africa it is 15.2 %, in Brazil it reaches 29.8 %, while in Bangladesh it is 54.8%. On

the other hand, in Malaysia, the effect of taxes on mobile broadband cost of
ownership amounts to only 6.1%.

Taxation appears to have an impact on the deployment of mobile broadband. For
example, ceteris paribus, there may be some association between the very high level
of taxes in Brazil and its very low penetration level of 3G handsets. On the other
hand, Malaysia shows a low level of taxes and a high 3G penetration rate. Similarly,
an inverse relationship appears to exist between tax burden and adoption of data
services when measured by wireless data as percent of service revenues (see figure
6.30).

If taxes limit adoption of wireless broadband, it is relevant to ask what the ultimate
impact of reduced penetration might have on economic growth. A reduction of
taxation on broadband devices, equipment and services could have a significant
economic benefit (see figure 6.31).




                                                                                              164

As figure 6.31 indicates a reduction of taxes on devices and service has a positive
impact on broadband penetration as a result of the elasticities of demand (as discussed
in section 6.4.3). The increase in broadband penetration improves the number of
households connected per households served (in fixed broadband) and the number of
mobile broadband subscribers per infrastructure deployed. This increase in
penetration enhances the return on the network capital invested. A higher return on
capital allows the broadband service provider to lower prices, which in turn has a
positive impact on penetration.

At the same time, an increase in broadband penetration has direct and indirect effects.
On the direct side, it means an improvement in the revenues of broadband operators
and ISPs. On the indirect side, it enhances the contribution of broadband to economic
growth and employment. Both effects increase the taxable base, which in turn grows
the collected taxes beyond the amount foregone by reducing taxes on broadband
devices and services. This effect yields higher welfare benefits.

6.4.4.1. Programs aimed at reducing taxation on access devices:

Some countries have reached the conclusion that while foregoing tax collections in
the short run, a tax reduction strategy can result in additional adoption of devices and
broadband usage, and consequently enhanced economic benefits in the long run.

                                                                                     165
In 1998, the Swedish government enacted its tax rebate program, which encouraged
employers to purchase home computers for their employees. The price of the computer was
deducted from employees’ salaries as monthly repayments over a three -year period and
employers received a tax credit for the purchase. The program was credited in part with the
country’s rise in home computer penetration, which reached 90% by 2006.

Amidst criticism, the government began scaling back in the program in 2004. It asserted that
the mission was to increase computer use that would in turn increase productivity, not to give
citizens top-of-the-line tax-free computers on which they could watch videos and play games.
From this point forward, employees could no longer deduct more than US$ 1500 for the
computers leased for them by their employers. As a result, employers then faced limits in the
amount of VAT they could deduct. In December 2006, however, parliament sided with the
government’s budget plan and eliminated the deductions all together. At this point, computers
were valued at approximately US$ 360 and were considered an employee perk not a right,
meaning that they had to pay tax on the assessed value.

Box 6.4.25 - Computer Purchase Program (Pakistan)

To promote economic growth and sustainability within its country, the government of
Pakistan committed to increasing ICT and broadband access through a universal service
policy. The policy, which launched in 2007 and reflects a partnership with public and private
companies, stressed affordable voice and data services, increased broadband access, and the
development of telecenters. Funding comes through operator revenues, access promotion
charges for mobile networks, and proceeds from spectrum auctions.

Amongst other projects enacted through the fund, the computer purchase program made the
home computers more affordable for students, government employees, and military
personnel. For instance, all members of the Pakistani military receive automatic approval for
a reduced-rate loan when purchasing a PC per a program established by Intel and the Ministry
of Defense. Government employees and citizens requiring a computer for educational
purposes qualify for a similar purchase program.

The Allama Iqbal Open University aims to foster a 1:1 e-learning environment. In doing so, it
launched a computer purchase program offering all of its 700,000 students – including its
many remote distance-learning students – below-market-rate loans for Intel-based laptop
computers. The program, which was created by the Higher Education Commission and Intel,
works with local banks to finance the loans.

In 2011, Intel partnered with Meezan, an Islamic bank in Pakistan, to launch “Laptop Ease.”
In its first four months alone, the program, which offers a “large-scale hire-purchase scheme
for personal computers,” provided 400 laptops to citizens with a 3 – 24 month repayment
schedule. By 2012, the program aimed to increase this number to 250 laptops per month.

Box 6.4.26 - Broadband Tax Relief (Malaysia)

In January 2010, the government of Malaysia began offering a 100% capital expenditure tax
allowance to operators investing in last-mile broadband equipment. This equipment and
consumer access devices also qualified for import duty and sales tax exemptions. Further, the
government offered an incentive to consumers, who received tax relief on the broadband
subscription fee up to US$ 165. The country’s Inland Revenue Board (IRB) announced in
2011 that these tax benefits extended to smartphone broadband use as well. While the actual
devices did not qualify for the additional personal computer tax incentive, tablets such as the
iPad did. The Malaysian Income Tax Act 1967 states that the cost of a personal computer –
up to US$ 1,000 – is deductible.

The broadband relief plan, which ran from 2010 – 2012, was an attempt by the Malaysian
government to match the broadband use of neighboring countries in the region. At the time of
its enactment, for instance, Singapore and Korea boasted respective penetration rates of 88%
and 95%, while Malaysia’s hovered at 26%.

The plan also made broadband access more affordable for 100,000 local university students,
who qualified for a laptop with free broadband for US$ 16 per month for 2 years. This
package was made possible by Telekom Malaysia.

6.5. DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS TO DRIVE BROADBAND DEMAND

This chapter focuses on how to overcome one of the three dominant adoption
obstacles to broadband diffusion among residential subscribers: lack of relevance.
The research reviewed in section 6.2 indicated that, at higher penetration levels of
broadband (beyond 20%), price elasticity coefficients start to decline, signaling that
affordability plays a smaller role in constraining diffusion. At that point, lack of
relevant content remains the final obstacle to achieving mass adoption. While content
relevance may also influence adoption at penetration rates below 20%, price plays a
stronger role in that situation.

Beyond pricing, demand stimulation also centers on enhancing broadband’s value
proposition. This is contingent upon offering applications and content that enhance
service attractiveness. This chapter will review all potential initiatives to increase
service attractiveness.

The first section of this chapter will present the multiple dimensions of content
relevance, ranging from the linguistic to the cultural and applications dimensions.
Once the context is established, the chapter will review options to tackle the content
relevance obstacle (see figure 6.32).

   Figure 6.32. Content Relevance Policy Initiatives in Residential Broadband




The second section will present recommendations regarding the introduction of
applications capable of building network effects, which could potentially stimulate
broadband demand through viral diffusion processes. As expected, social networks,
games, and other mobile-oriented applications have shown to be a powerful stimuli in
promoting broadband adoption.

The third section will review the launch of applications with high social and welfare
impact, such as e-Government services, e-Health services and financial services.


                                                                                  168
Preliminary studies appear to indicate that, in addition to enhancing social inclusion,
these applications provide additional stimuli to broadband adoption.

The fourth section deals with the introduction of applications and content generated
within the local cultural context of the targeted population. Local customization can
include linguistic characteristics as well as common cultural parameters.

6.5.1 The multiple dimensions of content relevance:

Lack of interest or relevance appears consistently as one of the reasons cited by non-
Internet users, regardless of their digital skills or income. This factor does not
represent a barrier as such, and is linked to preferences and incentives that vary by
community and from person to person. This represents a challenge for the
development of public initiatives to address this aspect of the demand gap, since no
single solution can act as broadband demand stimuli across the board. However,
Internet adoption studies reveal diverse mechanisms that come into play in the
adoption decisions made by potential users, from which several possible public policy
tools can be adopted.
Internet access in itself is of little value in the absence of so-called complementary
goods that confer value to such access. A complementary good is one whose use is
interrelated with the use of an associated or paired product (for example, DVD
players and DVDs, computer hardware and software)40. Examples of complementary
dynamics in broadband adoption include applications and content that users value,
and therefore should be attractive enough to encourage the purchase of the service.
While early broadband adopters have the capability of rapidly identifying
complementary products, late adopters (in other words, the target population of
demand stimulation programs) require some help in exposing them to applications,
services, and content whose complementary character adds value to the adoption of
broadband. Three dimensions of complementary goods exist for broadband.
In the first place, the value of some applications increases as the number of users
grows because of the use of the application to communicate or share information.
This phenomenon is known as network effects or network externalities. At their most
basic level, network effects exist in a service where its value to a user depends on the
number of other users. Value is defined as the willingness to pay (or maximum
amount that a consumer would pay for a product) for acquiring the product. In
general terms, willingness to pay in applications with network effects tends to
increase as an “S” shaped function of number of users (see figure 6.33).




40 While complementary goods are generally assessed in terms of its negative cross-elasticity
(e.g. a reduction in the price of one leads to an increase in demand of the other), the concept is
here used in terms of increased satisfaction derived from the consumption of the two products
jointly (e.g. complements in consumption).

Research on broadband adoption indicates that network effects serve as a very
powerful incentive to stimulate adoption. As mentioned above, applications designed
for communication purposes between users have strong network effects. Four types of
communications       applications    have    these   characteristics:     point-to-point
communications applications (e.g. email), social networking, content sharing
platforms, and matching networks (e.g. eBay). In point-to-point communications,
access to a network facilitating communications is extremely valuable for users
looking to communicate with friends, family, and members of a community they
belong to. Social networking adds the value of self-representation to a community to
the basic communications functionality. For example, Facebook allows users to
communicate to network members via its Connect facility while presenting a
personalized profile to the entire community. Content sharing platforms allow users
to share either social (for example, pictures in Instagram) or business content (for
example, documents in Dropbox). Finally, matching networks provide the capability
to link participants with idiosyncratic needs and offers (for example, eBay matches
sellers and buyers of products, or Monster.com links job seekers and companies
offering employment). Each of these communications applications is powered by
strong single-side or two-sided network effects. The net result is that the willingness
to pay increases as a result of the application network effects and broadband prices
decline. The combined effect becomes a stimuli for broadband adoption increases.
However, evidence also indicates that for certain groups of users, communication
network effects may not offer enough incentive to purchase broadband services. In
other words, for some consumers, the ability to communicate with friends, family and
community beyond voice telecommunications has little or no value. In this case,
public initiatives should aim to provide high value-added applications, demonstrating
tangible benefits to potential users in terms of saving time or money, or increasing

                                                                                               170
welfare. Such is the case of the various e-government applications designed to help
optimize the interaction of citizens with government, representing tangible benefits in
terms of user access to different government services (health care, public
administration, etc.).
In addition to the network effects and high social and welfare impact, a third driver of
content relevance is embodied by language and cultural customization. This
dimension is highly important in the case of users that belong to ethnic groups that
communicate in languages not highly prevalent in the Internet or that do not find in
the platform content more suited to their cultural background.
The following sections will provide examples of applications targeting each of these
three relevance dimensions and review evidence of their impact in stimulating
broadband demand.

6.5.2   Network effects applications driving broadband demand

This section will review applications that stimulate broadband adoption by
accelerating network effects. In each case, a description of the mechanisms linking
network effect applications to broadband adoption is provided. To drive home the
point, case studies of applications are introduced as examples.

6.5.2.1 Social Media Platforms

A social network serves as an Internet-based platform to articulate and make visible
the users’ current or past physical networks. In this sense, the platform allows users to
construct a public profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of users with
whom they share a connection, and view as well as navigate the user’s list of
connections and those made by others in the system.

The design of a social network follows a series of architectural choices. First, user
profiles can be built around structured or flexible layouts and based on word
descriptors or multimedia content. Second, the visibility of the profile can be open or
user restricted. Third, the confirmation of network links (e.g. invitations) can be
bidirectional or not. Fourth, the display of connections can be open or closed. Finally,
the network can provide additional functionality, such as content sharing (e.g.
pictures), built-in blogging, and mobile interface.

Social networks are the fastest growing Internet platform, with time spent having
surpassed that of portals (see figure 6.34).

Social networks’ initial value proposition was sharing user-generated content (web
links, news stories, blog posts, notes, photos, videos, events). However, very rapidly,
they expanded into applications hosting platforms where developers would
publish/upload applications, thereby enhancing allegiance to the site. For example,
Facebook Platform comprises over 1 million developers who have uploaded over
350,000 applications. Games represent the largest category (over 13,000 applications
being accessed by 418 million monthly active users) followed by the very distant
lifestyle applications (4,800 applications), utilities (4,600 applications) and education
(2,279 applications). Beyond user generated content and applications hosting, social
networks have also become a communications utility among platform users. The
network becomes the vehicle by which point-to-point communications is conducted
through services like Facebook Connect or Linkedin Message. To these three
dimensions (user-generated content, applications hosting and communications), social
networks have in the past two years added the mobility dimension, which allows for
“always-on” site connectivity.

Social networks are a worldwide phenomenon, in terms of their country of origin (see
table 6.25).

As table 6.25 shows, beyond the platforms launched in the United States, China has
become a leader in social network development.

Beyond the diversification of countries developing platforms, social networks initially
developed within one particular country have grown into multinational platforms with
a larger member base outside the country of origin. This is the case of Facebook,
which has currently only 20% of its members in North America, but a total of 26% in
Europe, 25% in Asia, and 19% in Latin America (see table 6.26).

Social networks act as a powerful stimulus for broadband adoption. In general terms,
countries appear to follow a sequential adoption process, whereby social network
diffusion acts as an incentive for signing up on an Internet account through a ISP,
lending itself over time to an increase in broadband adoption. The following three
figures compile penetration time series for Facebook, Internet usage, fixed broadband
and PCs for three emerging countries: Malaysia, Argentina and South Africa (see
figure 6.35).

In all three countries, the powerful network effects of social networks can be
appreciated by witnessing the significant growth rate in Facebook penetration.
Moreover, as mentioned above, the growth in Facebook penetration precedes by
approximately one year the increase in fixed broadband adoption. This supports the
notion that social networks act as a powerful incentive to adopt broadband. It should

                                                                                                                                                                                                174
be mentioned that the growth in fixed broadband penetration is mitigated by the fact
that a portion of the Facebook “stimulating effect” is absorbed by mobile rather than
fixed broadband.

In many emerging markets, carriers offer data plans, but with limitations. As a result,
both Facebook and mobile carriers have begun experimenting with ways of offering
free access to the social networking site.

In 2010, Facebook announced the launch of Facebook Zero, a service designed
specifically for mobile phone use. Mainly targeting developing countries, the service
promotes mobile Facebook access without data charges. When users go the Facebook
Zero URL on their devices, they find a text-only version of the site, which carriers
can offer free of charge. This “trimmed down” Facebook eliminates such data -
intensive features as photos, but when users switch to the multimedia version of the
site, they will then incur regular data use charges.

Table 6.27 lists the countries and carriers that partnered with Facebook for its initial
Zero rollout41.

    In Nigeria, Etisalat offered a Facebook promotion that allowed subscribers to

    In addition to major private sector sites acting as broadband demand stimuli
    (Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc.), social networks can also be created ad-hoc to
    fulfill specific purposes or solidify links across certain communities. For example,
    Ushahidi is a social platform developed in Haiti to facilitate networking among
    earthquake disaster victims. In other situations, existing platforms can be utilized to
    build links within a specific segment of a population. Such is the case in Russia,
    where the government utilizes Twitter to facilitate communication with its citizens. In
    these cases, ad-hoc government sponsored networks can also play a role in
    stimulating broadband adoption.

individuals ranging from human rights workers to software developers. The platform operates
on the fundamental belief that the collection of crisis information from citizens offers a real-
time and real-life glimpse into the situation, both raising awareness and allowing for more
efficient assistance and emergency deployment.

In 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake caused the destruction in Haiti that resulted in more than
230,000 deaths and devastation in some of the country’s most populous areas. In response,
the international community rallied to offer search and rescue missions and emergency
assistance. Unfortunately, Haiti’s system of information dissemination lacked the
sophistication needed to aggregate and prioritize data effectively. Ushahidi allowed victims
and volunteers to coordinate through social media sites like blogs, Twitter, and Facebook as
well as through mobile phone messages.

Reports submitted to Ushahidi included information about “about trapped persons, medic al
emergencies, and specific needs, such as food, water, and shelter” and were received and
updated by volunteers in real time as well as by anyone who had an Internet connection
regardless of their geographic location.

Ushahidi deployed its platform within two hours of the earthquake, but quickly realized that it
did not have the manpower to support the need for its services. In response, Ushahidi’s
Director of Crises Mapping, Matrick Meier, reached out to volunteers at Tufts University to
continue mapping the crisis live. The initial group of volunteers – all located in Meier’s living
room – covered Twitter, Facebook, and blogs to identify the information that needed to reach
first responders on the ground. Utilizing Google Earth and OpenStreetMap, they tagged
information based on GPS coordinates to upload it on the publicly accessible website
Haiti.ushahidi.com. People from all over the world logged into the site to contribute
information they received via email or phone from relatives in Haiti.

Just days later, a volunteer team at Tulane collaborated with Frontlines MS, the United States
State Department, and Digicel to create a system allowing Haitians to submit alerts via SMS
text messages on their mobile phones to the number 4636. At the time, 85% of Haitians had
access to mobile phones and while many of the towers were destroyed, most were repaired
prior to the launch of 4636. The service was publicized over Twitter, radio announcements,
and physical posters. Nearly immediately, the number received 1,000 to 2,000 SMS texts per
day, but with a team of volunteers located in the U.S. and Canada, the system saw the
messages conveyed to responders within 10 minutes. Volunteers translated more than 25,000
messages, emails, and social media communications, creating nearly 3,600 reports mapped on
Ushahidi.

In response, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the power of crisis
mapping and the importance of Internet access, stating, “The technology community has set
up interactive maps to help us identify needs and target resources… [today] a seven -year-old
girl and two women were pulled from the rubble of a collapsed supermarket by an American
search-and-rescue team after they sent a text message calling for help.” An analyst from the
U.S. Marine Corps echoed her praise, ““In this postmodern age, open-source intelligence
outperforms traditional intel…The notion of crisis mapping demonstrates the intense power
of open- source intelligence… [W]hen compared side by side, Ushahidi reporting and other
open sources vastly outperformed ‘traditional intel’ [after the Haiti earthquake].”

Researchers concluded that the Ushahidi-Haiti project demonstrated the role crowdsourcing
can play in disaster response, recommending that it serve as a model for the international
community. They emphasized the importance of leveraging local knowledge and
collaboration with community and grassroots organizations while integrating a variety of
platforms such as mobile devices or other communication technology.

Box 6.5.2 - Twitter (Russia)

In October 2010, the global media and ICT analytics firm ComScore released the results of
the study it conducted earlier in the year, revealing that Russia ranks number one in terms of
the world’s heaviest social network usage. At this point in time, three -quarters of all Russians
– or 34.5 million people – visited at least one social networking site in a one-month period.
With the average user spending just shy of 10 hours a month on such sites, Russians spend
nearly twice as much time using social media than their global counterparts. Throughout the
study, the top-ranked site, Vkontakte.ru, had 28 million visitors, though the number of
Facebook users in the country grew 376% in 2010.

To keep up with his constituents, then-president Dmitri Medvedev visited the San Francisco-
based headquarters of Twitter, a global social networking and microblogging site. While
there, he joined the site and sent out his first Tweet under the handle, KremlinRussia. From
Russian, this message translated to “Hello everyone. I am now in Twitter, and this is my first
message,” but he also established an English-language version of KremlinRussia. This Tweet
emphasized Medvedev’s larger strategy of enhancing ICT innovation and investment back
home and also demonstrated his push for a more transparent government. Within one year,
Medvedev had created four verified accounts that attracted more than half a million
followers.

Beyond showing his commitment to the aforementioned objectives, Medvedev and the
Russian government have used Twitter not only to share updates with the public, but also to
“humanize” the president. The government’s social media use now also includes other sites,
such as i-Russia.ru, which the Presidential Commission for Modernization and Technological
Development of Russia's Economy created for citizens to post comments and link
government resources to their social network accounts. Further, the Commission also has its
own mobile app.

In mid-2012, as part of its “Open Government” project, the Kremlin announced plans to
create its own social network to mimic Facebook, whereby citizens would create personal
accounts to which they could upload content, create groups, and connect with their peers. The
government also noted that the site would foster an environment where Russians could
openly voice their concerns and criticism surrounding local public officials.

Box 6.5.3 - Muloqot (Uzbekistan)

On September 1, 2011, the government of Uzbekistan launched its own alternative to
Facebook in partnership with the state telecom monopoly. The social networking site, known
as Muloqot, translates to “dialog” or “conversation” in English and went live to coincide with
the country’s 20th anniversary of its independence from the Soviet Union. Government
officials in Uzbekistan promoted the launch, saying that Muloqot would “ create
conditions...for the formation of high morals, for creation of spurs to successful development
of modern knowledge and achievements of technical progress, with objective of realization of
the idea of the comprehensively developed person.”

At the time of the launch, 85,000 Uzbeks had Facebook accounts, and as many as 400,000
Uzbek citizens used the Russian social network, Odnoklassniki, daily. Skeptics of Muloqot
saw it as a way for the government to cut down on the opposition found on Facebook. By
offering services in the Uzbek language and requiring a local Uzbek mobile phone number, it
effectively created a site with less foreign influence. The organization Radio Free Europe /
Radio Liberty, which works to promote uncensored news throughout the world, tested the
openness of the site, posting its own content on Muloqot’s public wall. While the information
was initially published, their profiles were deleted within 15 minutes. The accounts of users
posting pro-government posts, however, remained active.

At the time, more than half of the country’s 7.7 million Internet users connected via their
mobile phones, so developers designed the site with this platform in mind. Within one week,
Muloqot had 1,700 users. Muloqot users will likely benefit from the site’s backing from the
state telco, which can offer free services such as faster connections, free email storage, and
media downloads. Though censorship issues may pose a concern, the site will likely serve as
an effective means by which to disseminate pertinent government information to a generation
that likely pays little attention to traditional news outlets.

By late-2011, however, the site did not seem to reach the popularity the government had
anticipated. In response, it launched another social networking site, YouFace, which looks
nearly identical to Facebook. Authorities insist that these networks are not designed to
discourage opposition, but rather to promote “national platforms” and reduce citizens’
reliance on foreign-based social networking sites. The owner of the site, Uzbek national
Ayubhon Abdullaev, stated that he designed YouFace to ““boost patriotism among young
people in Uzbekistan.” The homepage features a quote from President Islam Karimov, “Our
children must be stronger, smarter, and happier than we are.”

6.5.2.2 Games and gamification

Internet-based games, particularly the category known as social games, are
applications strongly interlinked with social networking. As mentioned above, games
represent the highest application category in Facebook Platform.

The importance of the games and social networking link is substantiated by the
former’s implicit value as a socialization tool. Research indicates that games allow
users to overcome socialization obstacles by interacting with friends. Social games
provide users with an opportunity to socialize when they lack content to post on their
profiles. As such, they provide a structured way of interacting and keeping in touch
with people. Additionally, the social game provides an excuse to re-engage with
Facebook friends that are not that close to the user initiating contact.

For example, some of the more popular Internet-based games, such as Cityville or
Farmville, present players with obstacles to build a business. Players can tackle
obstacles by asking friends for help through a messaging system, or posting on their
Facebook wall. Friends can reciprocate for help by sending free virtual gifts.

Along these lines, most social games tend to run inside social network platforms. This
leads to a sequence of adoption processes leading to broadband: social game acts as
an accelerator of social network usage, which, in turn, leads to broadband adoption.

An extension of game mechanics in non-game contexts is known as “gamification”.
Gamification is an approach utilized to enhance user engagement in internet-based
applications. Initial gamification techniques entailed providing reward points to users
who share experiences on location-based platforms. For example, Foursquare, a
location-based platform rewards members with achievement badges to those users
that become more active “checking in” with the platform. A more common
“gamification” technique entails displaying in a platform a progress bar or other type
of visual meter to indicate how close the user is to completing a task the platform
operator is trying to encourage (e.g. a survey, a social network profile, a higher status
in a loyalty program). Gamification techniques can be utilized in applications such as
employee-training programs, primary education, wellness programs, and market
research.

When it comes to utilizing gamification techniques in stimulating broadband demand,
the best application could be through social media. Sequential causation would work
as follows: gamification acts as an incentive of user engagement in social network
platforms, which in turn, become a driver of broadband service acquisition.

Box 6.5.4- SuperBetter (United States)

At the TED Global 2012 conference, Jane McGonigal presented her findings on online
gaming, a talk that was viewed online by an audience of nearly 1.5 million people from
around the world. In the talk, McGonigal displayed statistics on the power of online gaming,
insisting that it “can be more effective than pharmaceuticals in treating clinical depression
and that just 30 minutes a day is correlated with significant increases in happiness.” She went
on to insist that online games can help people who are healing from injuries, and that these
same games can also be used to address such global problems as obesity and climate change.


                                                                                           180
In a similar talk from 2010 – which reached an audience of more than 2.7 million viewers –
she stated, “My goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real
life as it is to save the world in online games.” Following a severe concussion in 2009 that
left McGonigal bedridden for months, she found that viewing her pain as a game was the only
way for her to get through the ordeal, which led to her development of the online game
SuperBetter. The game incorporates activities “designed to boost physical, mental, emotional
and social resilience,” which she said ultimately helped to alleviate her depression and
anxiety.

Working with doctors, psychologists, scientists, and medical researchers, she eventually
made the game public, reaching users all over the world including cancer patients and
sufferers of chronic pain. The game encourages positive emotions as well as a social
connection, two contributing factors to physical and emotional health. As is true with most
games, participants learn that facing and overcoming obstacles makes them stronger, not
weaker. McGonigal cites the “post-traumatic growth” theory, whereby positive changes in
one’s life can occur through the exposure to challenges – which can include illness or
depression.

SuperBetter, which – according to its website – is not easy, forces users to dedicate
themselves to reaching various goals and milestones. It also offers a way to build physical,
mental, emotional, and social strength and is customizable to each user. Users can access the
game on their web browsers and also through the SuperBetter mobile application designed for
iPhones and iPads.

Beyond the actual game, the SuperBetter website offers tips for users to keep a positive
attitude and stick to their commitments. A user ultimately “wins” the game by achieving the
“Epic Win,” a real-life goal set by the user before beginning the game. Once achieved, the
user can choose a new goal to begin a new game. In late 2011, Ohio State University Medical
Research Center began conducting trials for the game to determine its effectiveness.

Box 6.5.5 - EVOKE (Africa)

In 2010, the World Bank Institute launched its online game, EVOKE, to serve as a “ten -week
crash course in changing the world.” Designed for users around the globe, it particularly
targeted the youth population in Africa. Ultimately, the game encourages users to tackle
pressing social issues while providing them with the real-world skills necessary for social
innovation. Anyone – regardless of age or location – can play EVOKE for free.

Set in the year 2020, users follow “the efforts of a mysterious network of Africa’s best
problem-solvers.” Players discover clues to solve the mystery each week while developing
their own networks and work together to develop solutions to development challenges.

                                                                                           181
The game first began in March 2010 and ran until May 2010. This first round saw more than
4,000 players from over 120 countries. Players who successfully completed all ten challenges
within the ten weeks were recognized as World Bank Institute Social Innovators – Class of
2010. The top players also qualified for mentorships with social innovators and business
leaders as well as for scholarships to attend the EVOKE Summit, held in Washington, D.C. In
that sense, winning the game translates into real-life rewards.

Per Robert Hawkins, a Senior Education Specialist at the World Bank Institute and the
Executive Producer of the game, “EVOKE helps players learn 21st century skills to become
 h                   wh h         h f      .” Explaining the game’s name, Creative Director
Jane McGonigal – who has made it her mission to create online games with social purpose –
says, “"When we evoke, we look for creative solutions and learn how to tackle the world's
toughest problems with creativity, courage, resourcefulness and collaboration."

The World Bank Institute – the World Bank division that focuses on learning – developed the
game, which InfoDev and the Korean Trust Fund on ICT4D sponsored.

Box 6.5.6 - Spent (United States)

Developed in early 2011 through a partnership with ad agency McKinney and Urban
Ministries of Durham, the online game Spent shows users what it is like to live on only
$1,000 a month in America. The game exposes the average player to real-life challenges, who
must make the same decisions about money and resources that families across the country
also face.

When a player first logs in to the http://playspent.org website, he is greeted with a message:
““Urban Ministries of Durham serves over 6,000 people every year. But you’d never need
help, right?” Below this message is a link, where users can “Prove It” and accept the
challenge. Once accepting the challenge, users are greeted by this question: “Over 14 million
Americans are unemployed. Now imagine you’re one of them. Your savings are gone. Can
you survive? You’ve lost your house. You’re a single parent. And you’re down to your last
$1,000. Can you make it through the month?” He can then choose “Find a Job” or “Exit.”
Once the game begins, players can choose from a selection of jobs, at which point the game
breaks down the weekly take-home pay after deducting such expenses as taxes and the cost of
supplies or uniforms. They then are faced with such decisions as whether they can afford
health insurance or whether they should live in the city or the suburbs, taking into account the
cost of housing and transportation. Other issues include the costs of childcare, the decision to
join a union, and when to see a doctor. If a player hits a point where the only option to avoid
homelessness is to seek help from a friend, he is directed to Facebook, where he can share the
Spent link. At the end of the game, a player can also choose to donate to UMD.

By August 2011, users had played the game more than 1 million times in nearly 200 countries
around the world. As a result of the game, users have gained a better understanding of
poverty and homeless, which has led to an increase in the global dialog surrounding such
issues. The creators of Spent have received feedback from people and organizations all over
the world, each contributing a different anecdote to support the mission. As McKinney Chief
Creative Officer Jonathan Cude states, the game shows and the feedback supports the idea
that “poverty and homelessness can happen to anyone.”


                                                                                            182
The Urban Ministries of Durham has used the game as an exercise to drive this point home to
the community. McKinney and UMD also partnered to launch a petition to the U.S.
Congress, asking “men and women of Congress to take 10 minutes from their debating to
experience for themselves the challenges that more than 14 million Americans are facing” by
playing the game.

6.5.2.3 Mobile broadband applications

The accelerated diffusion of broadband access mobile devices has significantly
increased the impact of mobile applications. In many cases, especially in emerging
countries, mobile broadband may represent a substitute for fixed services in three
types of situations: 1) the fixed service is not offered in the area where the user lives;
2) the quality of fixed services (for example, low speed) is less advantageous (or at
least comparable to) than the available mobile service; or, 3) for economic or
convenience reasons, the user opts to consolidate services and acquire only mobile
broadband, which provides connectivity combined with mobility.

In the case of mobile applications, the adoption sequence is different from social
media and games. In the prior two network effect groups, applications adoption
precedes the purchase of a broadband subscription. Along those lines, the user
becomes aware of the applications, begins using them, leading to an increase in the
willingness to pay, which results in acquiring broadband services for home or
individual access. In the case of mobile applications, the migration from an early
generation (typically 2G feature phone access) to a 3G or 4G smartphone based
device, which is an implicit adoption of broadband service, allows the user to gain
access to mobile applications of which he/she was not previously aware. In sum,
while in social network and games, the applications use may precede fixed broadband
adoption, in mobile broadband adoption service purchasing precedes applications use.

In this context, mobile broadband users represent a “captive” market, ready to adopt
mobile applications that enhance the value derived from wireless broadband. The
installed base of wireless broadband users has been growing significantly, reaching a
73.20% penetration in the developed world and 17.57% in developing countries (see
table 6.29).

It should be considered, however, that, only a portion of this base corresponds to
smartphones, devices whose screen format and keyboard are particularly suited to
conduct Internet-based transactions. Nevertheless, the installed base of smartphones
and data-only devices (USB modems, dongles) is also growing at a fairly rapid rate.
In 2011, the most advanced regions in terms of shift to 3G and 3.5G smartphones are
Western Europe ( 50% of 3G and 3.5G base) and North America (49% of base). In
terms of the total installed base, North America has the highest smartphone share
(40.3%) followed by Western Europe (22.9%). The rest of the world exhibits a
smartphone share of 3G and 3.5G devices around 20%. By 2015, smartphones in
North America and Western Europe will reach 65% and 47%, of mobile connections,
followed by Eastern Europe (11.7%), Latin America (13.1%) and Asia Pacific
(12.4%)43.

In the context of explosive adoption of broadband enabled devices, mobile
applications serve to reinforce the awareness of broadband services. Governments can
play a role in promoting the development of mobile broadband applications. Such is
the experience of Canada, the United Kingdom and Singapore, reviewed below.

Box 6.5.7 - Travel Smart (Canada)

In November 2012, Canada’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs announced the launch of
its website, travel.gc.ca, which serves as a reference for international travel information and is
fully accessible on mobile devices. In addition to the website, the federal government also
released the free travel-related mobile app, Travel Smart, available for download on
Blackberry, Android, and iPhone smartphones and tablets. The app addresses such issues as
airline restrictions, security checkpoint wait times, passport and visa requirements, and letters
of consent for travelling minors. All of this information is placed in one easily accessible
portal.

Travel Smart connects with travellers through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and SMS
messages. It funnels information from 12 other federal agencies ranging from the Canada

43Telecom Advisory Services. Assessing the Worldwide Migration to Broadband Enabled
Smartphones: a report to the ITU, New York: November 23, 2011.

                                                                                              184
Revenue Agency to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to the Public Health Agency of
Canada.

The app is also designed for Canadians traveling outside the country who need to access
safety information, learn about local laws and customs, and check on health conditions. They
can register to the site before traveling so that the government will know where Canadian
citizens are in the event of an earthquake or uprising abroad. Subscribers to the website’s
Twitter and Facebook feeds will receive travel updates and crisis information.

Beyond serving as a means for Canadians to access pertinent information more easily and
quickly, such services allow the government to cut back on some of its more tangible
expenditures. As the Department of Foreign Affairs cuts spending, it is closing international
consulates and domestic trade offices. At the same time, the number of Canadians living
abroad continues to increase year after year and citizens made 56 million trips out of the
country in 2010 alone. An additional 2.8 million Canadians live abroad. As such, despite the
need for cost cutting, there is also an increased need for available resources. In response, the
government issued a statement saying that it must “find alternative and less costly ways to
deliver routine services through the better use of technology.”

Box 6.5.8 - Gov.sg Mobile App (Singapore)

Singapore’s Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts (MICA) released a mobile
app in June 2010 to serve as a supplement to its website, Gov.sg. The “user friendly” app
allows smartphone users on the go to access government-related news stories and services
such as event calendars, directories, and feedback forms. It serves as a seamless, one-stop
platform for citizens to receive pertinent information from various agencies in a single
integrated location.

At the time, Singapore boasted some of the world’s highest smartphone penetration rates in
the world, in large part a result of its broadband and mobile infrastructure. With a 141%
mobile penetration rate, many citizens already had 3G and WiFi access, and this connectivity
offered an “opportunity for the government to extend its range of services to better reach out
to the people.” Prior to the Gov.sg app, the government already utilized more than 300
mobile services.

The ministry initially launched the app for iPhones, but followed with an app designed for
Android phones in November 2010 to meet the growing popularity of Google-based devices.
With this second launch came an updated app design for the iPhone OS 4 that emphasized
multi-tasking and built in a user-friendly interface.

Prior to the launch of the Android app, the Gov.sig iPhone app was downloaded 14,000 times
in the first four months following its release. In its first week alone, the app ranked amongst
the top three most popular App Store downloads in the “News / Free application” category.
While the Singapore Government has already demonstrated its commitment to online
government services, it hopes to encourage participation amongst the younger population
through the development of mobile apps.



                                                                                            185
One year later, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore partnered with NTUC’s
Employment and Employability Institute, SPRING Singapore and the Singapore Tourism
Board to invest US$ 12 million to develop mobile applications for the service sectors. In
response, the Ministry for Information, Communication, and the Arts stated that it “wants to
harness opportunities presented by the mobile space and to develop mobile solutions for
businesses.” The development fund hopes to encourage growth in the mobile commerce and
wireless sectors.

Box 6.5.9 - Government-developed Mobile Apps (United Kingdom)

By 2010, the British government had developed and released dozens of mobile applications
for its citizens. These apps served a wide range of purposes, ranging from helping users quit
smoking, to teaching them how to change a tire, to calculating mileage. One app, Jobcentre
Plus, allowed users to search for open job listings across England, Scotland, and Wales.

Following a 2010 Freedom of Information request, the government revealed that it had spent
between US$ 15,000 - $61,000 on the development of each app. At the same time, it spent
US$ 143 million on website development and maintenance and an additional US$ 52 million
to support the necessary staff. The rollout of mobile apps could cut down on the website
expenditures.

In 2012, multiple government agencies and service providers launched their own apps. The
Socionical Crowd Sourcing app, for instance, was developed through a partnership between
the London School of Economics and the UK police. The app – which is available for
download through the Apple App Store - allows users in London to download police-related
information and offers notifications of catastrophic incidences. Unique to other police apps,
the Socionical Crowd Sourcing app allows police to monitor the movement of crowds
through real time crowd sourcing technology. The development of this particular app came
through funding from the EU and at no cost to the Force.

Another government-launched mobile app now offers citizens a free online tax calculator to
total the amount they owe and see how the government spends it. The app works on iPhones,
iPads, and Android phones and is downloadable at the App Store and the HMRC website.
The development of the app followed a report that revealed that more than half of taxpayers
did not know the amount they paid in taxes. The government hoped that this new service will
make the system more transparent.

By late-2012, Britain continued to push for the development of apps for government-related
services. In November 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he was testing
an app to aid in decision-making and day-to-day government affairs. The app has allowed Mr.
Cameron to keep track of data as it pertains to areas such as jobs and housing in real time
while monitoring political polling and social media. Following his approval, more
government officials will have access to the app.

6.5.3. Broadband-enabled services with high social and welfare impact:

Beyond applications with high network effects, some services with capability of
having high social impact can act as an additional incentive to promote awareness of
broadband’s potential and further stimulate adoption. First, E-government services
delivered via broadband can enhance citizen welfare by facilitating the conduct of
transactions with public entities and providing access to government information.
Secondly, broadband-enabled E-health services have the potential of enhancing the
quality and reach of health care to citizens in isolated areas. Finally, financial services
delivered via telecommunications, including broadband services, represent a powerful
tool to promote financial inclusion of underprivileged segments of the population.
Each category of services will be reviewed in turn, their potential to stimulate
broadband adoption will be discussed, and examples of applications will be
presented.

6.5.3.1. E-Government services

Governments can enhance broadband demand by providing access to government
services and broadband content online. A 2008 study by the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes the growing popularity of
policy initiatives that foster more sophisticated online government services (OECD
2008). These initiatives include expanding secure government networks, putting
administrative processes and documents online, supplying firms and citizens with
more cost-effective ways to deal with the government (including once-only
submission of data), and assigning firms and citizens a single number or identifier to
conduct their relations with government. Government information available online in
various countries includes legislation, regulations, litigation documents, reports,
proposals, weather data, traffic reports, economic statistics, census reports, hearing
schedules, applications for licenses and registrations, and even feeds from
surveillance cameras. Some OECD countries even offer one-stop platforms for
government procurement, bidding information, and so forth.

E-services that improve openness and access to democratic institutions are also
becoming feasible as a result of increases in broadband transmission capacity.
Examples include Internet broadcasts of parliamentary debates and agency meetings.


                                                                                       187
Such applications allow citizens greater participation in the governance process.
Applications for polling, voting, campaigning, and interacting with government
officials can increase the demand for broadband services. In the United States, for
example, two models of e-government citizen participation are emerging. One is a
deliberative model where online dialogue helps to inform policy making by
encouraging citizens to scrutinize, discuss, and weigh competing values and policy
options. The other is a consultative model that uses the speed and immediacy of
broadband networks to enable citizens to share their opinions with the government in
order to improve policy and administration. Actions to encourage citizen participation
through e-government include the following:

        •     Connecting citizens to interactive government websites that encourage
              citizen feedback and participation in policy making, design, and
              innovation
        •     Encouraging citizens to participate in online dialogue on topics such as
              health care and the economy
        •     Participating in government experiments with a variety of tools,
              including “wiki government,” where citizens participate in peer review
        •     Educating citizens about their civic role and providing opportunities for
              them to interact with government agencies and officials using tools that
              fit individual or specific community needs
        •     Partnering with government officials and citizens to facilitate well-
              informed and productive discussions online
        •     Providing citizens the ability to create “my e-government” so they can
              personalize their interaction with government agencies and officials
        •     Creating “online town halls” to promote e-democracy for agenda
              setting and discussion of public issues as well as to promote
              accountability in the provision of public services.  

A major goal of developing such services is to make government information more
readily available as well as to increase transparency of government activities. The
Netherlands is a leader in creating digital content and offering it via online
government services (Atkinson, Correa, and Hedlund 2008, 39). In 2006, in an effort
to support the development of broadband, the Dutch government decided to give all
citizens a personalized web-page—the personal Internet page—where they could
access their government documents and social security information as well as apply
for grants and licenses. In the United States, the U.S. government embraced e-
government as an educational tool, particularly in providing online education
programs for new immigrants seeking citizenship and for school support programs
within the Department of Education. In Colombia, the 2010 Plan Vive Digital aspires
to create a digital ecosystem by 2014 that would achieve several demand- related
goals.

Types of e-Government applications that drive demand

This section will examine the different types of broadband enabled e-government
applications that have been launched in different countries. Government services and
applications fall into the following broad categories: (a) making government
information available, (b) conducting transactions with the government, and (c)
participating in the political process.

                                                                                   188
In some cases, governments chose to implement discrete initiatives. Turkey’s Land
Registration and Cadaster Modernization Project serves as an example of the
implementation of a discrete application to facilitate conducting transactions with the
government. In other cases, governments opted to formulate holistic e-government
policies and plans, such as the e-Government Act of the United States, the e-
Governance Tools in the Netherlands, and the program Vive Digital in Colombia.

Box 6.5.10 – Land Registration and Cadaster Modernization Project (Turkey)

An example of the Turkish government’s expansion of e-government applications, the
Cadaster Modernization Project was designed to make the land registry process more
effective and efficient. To do so, the project took responsibility for the following items, per a
report released by the World Bank:

           Renovating and updating cadaster maps to support digital cadaster and land
            registry information
           Making the digital land registry and cadaster information available to public and
            private entities
           Improving customer services in land registry and cadaster offices
           Improving human resources in the Turkish Land Registry and Cadaster Agency
            (TKGM)
           Developing policies and capacity to introduce in Turkey best international
            practices in property valuation.

While the land registration process will benefit from the initiative, it is the government’s
ultimate intent to improve its services while providing relevant information to the public and
private sectors. In effect, it will raise awareness of the benefits of using online services for
government-related matters, thus increasing the demand for broadband.

The project received funding approval in 2008 with an expected completion date of 2013. In
total, it is expected to cost US$ 210 million, US$ 203 million to be loaned by the World
Bank. Turkey’s General Department of Cadaster and Registration oversaw its
implementation.

Based on the World Bank’s progress matrix, the project looks to reach many of its goals and
commitments by the 2013 deadline. The reduction in time for registrants to receive a
response, for instance, decreased from 1 week to 2 hours as a result of the online services.
The number of agencies with online access to the services increased from 0 to 35 and the
website processed approximately 6.5 million requests in 2012. Additional provisions were
included to address such issues as technology training and policy drafting.

Box 6.5.11 – The e-Government Act of 2002 (United States)

The United States’ E-Government Act of 2002 worked with its Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) to create an Office of Electronic Government within the department and
establish IT polices and guidelines to promote online government services and capabilities. It
designated a Federal Chief Information Officers Council to take responsibility for “improving

                                                                                             189
agency practices related to the design, acquisition, development, modernization, use,
operation, sharing, and performance of federal information resources.” To ensure efficiency,
the agency must submit an annual report to Congress and conduct Privacy Impact
Assessments. As a part of the Act, the Federal Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) worked with OMB to “link information security with enterprise architecture.”
Amongst other responsibilities, it developed IT security standards, policies, and training for
all agencies while reporting to various Congressional committees.

The act defines e-government as “the use by the government of the Internet and other
information technologies, together with the processes and people needed to implement them,
to enhance the delivery of information and services to the public and others to make
improvements in government operations.” Thus, the act aims to promote the effectiveness,
efficiency, and quality of government service through online services.

The E-Government Act of 2002 also allowed state and local governments to purchase
updated technology approved by the General Services Administration (GSA). As one of the
largest purchasers of technology, the government could benefit from reduced prices on IT
hardware, software, and services, saving millions of dollars annually. In 2007, the GSA
signed a US$ 68 billion contract to provide 135 federal agencies in 191 countries with
telecommunications services for 10 years at a price discounted up to 40%.

Prior to the act, the federal government lagged behind the IT advances of the private sector
due to “poor management of technology investments.” The Office of E-Government aimed to
achieve the same technological standards as the top performing private sector organizations.
To do so, the Office developed Internet-based government services, encouraging interaction
of citizens and businesses with the federal government. Ultimately, these services were
designed to increase participation while promoting government transparency and improving
its efficiency.

The act budgeted US$ 345 million for 2003 – 2006 and, to ensure compliance, stipulated that
federal agencies report into the OMB regarding their progress in enhancing public
participation and developing electronic services. That said, the office did not always require
such reporting, saying that the time and resources required to develop the reports took away
from the efforts spent toward the end goal.

In its 2012 Annual Report, The Government Accountability Office addressed concerns
voiced by Congress, recommending a plan for the future and also highlighting its initiatives
over the prior 10 years. Such noteworthy accomplishments included:

           A framework for electronic signatures
           A federal Internet portal to provide a consolidated point of public access to
            government information
           Availability of government information and services to individuals with
            diminished access to the Internet and those with disabilities
           A website to provide the public with information and the ability to comment on
            proposed federal regulations
           Steps to improve the accessibility, usability, and preservation of government
            information through, for example, organizing website content and electronic
            records management
           Policies on protecting the privacy of individuals’ personal information on
            government websites.

The report concluded by praising the significant integration of e-government into agency
business and the resulting increased public participation, recognizing OMB’s role in


                                                                                          190
providing implementation leadership, raising awareness, and disseminating information. It
did, however, concede that it needs to require more detailed reporting from the agencies in
the future and should focus on reducing the burdens of this process. As the title of the report
suggests, “Agencies Have Implemented Most Provisions, but Key Areas of Attention
Remain.”

Box 6.5.12 – e-Governance Tools (Netherlands)

Recognized as an international leader and innovator in terms of e-government, the
Netherlands recognized early on the power of ICT tools to ease the administrative and
bureaucratic burdens and improve the government services available to its citizens. The
country placed high priority on citizen inclusion and participation, relying on extensive
consultation when developing online programs and activities to ensure demand of such
services.

In 2011, the government announced “i-NUP,” an extension of the National Implementation
Program (NUP), clearly stating its plan to introduce further e-Governance measures through
2015. Prior to this point, many of the country’s ministries had already gone online, publishing
pertinent information on their websites, archiving digital documents, and allowing citizens to
book appointments with elected officials. The i-NUP program ultimately aims to create “a
more accessible government,” providing basic e-Services for citizens and creating e-Business
opportunities.

The NUP, which ran until year-end 2010, represented a partnership between municipal and
provincial governments, water boards, and the central government. Together they established
the basic requisites for e-Government, promoting e-Access, e-Authentications, and e-
Information. As a result, citizens can now perform such tasks as applying for permits,
registering for unemployment, accessing social security information, and working with
various departments. By the end of the program, more than 8 million citizens could reach
their municipal government.

Responsible for the development of e-Government policy, the Ministry of the Interior and
Kingdom Relations coordinates initiatives with various levels of government and works
closely with the Government ICT Unit (ICTU) and the Government Shared Services for ICT
(Logius). The Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture, and Innovation oversees e-
Government initiatives as they pertain to businesses.

The project includes many portals, including the “Rijksoverheid.nl” citizens’ portal.
Accessible through a personal DigiD login, the portal offers every citizen access to e-
governance services including personal data and tracking. The portal also offers relevant
government information and news.



                                                                                           191

Box 6.5.13 – Plan Vive Digital (Colombia)

The Colombian government’s Vive Digital, which aims to connect all citizens to the Internet
by 2019, incorporates a nationally recognized plan to develop a digital ecosystem through
projects that focus on infrastructure, services, applications, and user experience. By making
more services available online, the plan promotes efficiency and transparency at all
government levels while curbing corruption and encouraging citizen participation. To
generate demand, Vive Digital projects allow citizens to conduct transactions and access
emergency services and value-added services online. It also incorporates such applications as
an online Congress, tele-working, and government intranet while aiming for “zero paper” in
the central administration. By bringing more everyday services online, the government hopes
to make broadband more attractive.

Various ministries offer individualized services online. The Ministry of Finance, for instance,
will offer mobile banking services while the Ministry of Education promotes ICT awareness
amongst schools, teachers, and students. The Social Protection Ministry has taken ownership
of e-health programs and rights verification services. Cultural initiatives are also supported
through a National Digital Library and the Ministry of Defense has taken a role in ramping up
cyber security and cyber defense mechanisms.

Between 2010 and 2014, Vive Digital has a budget of US$ 12.5 billion in ICT investment,
with US$ 2.2 billion provided by the central government. The program is recognized as an
integral component of the larger “Prosperity for All” plan.

As a result of Vive Digital, Colombia currently ranks #1 in the Latin America region in terms
of both e-government and citizen participation. By 2014, the set deadline for the project,
100% of all national entities and 50% of all local entities will offer online services. The plan
will continue to utilize modern ICT technology to promote the development of affordable,
online services and foster an environment to make broadband relevant to everyday life.
Ultimately, it aims to increase national productivity and improve the standard of living in the
country.

Expected impact of E-Government services on broadband demand

This section will provide evidence of the impact e-government applications have on
broadband adoption. As in the case of network effects applications, e-Government
services have also been found to stimulate broadband adoption. In a recent study
conducted for the Colombia government, Katz and Callorda (2011) researched the
causality linking e-Government services introduced by the program Vive Digital and

                                                                                            192
         broadband penetration. The researchers found that both variables were linked through
         a bi-directional causality (in other words, e-Government stimulates broadband
         adoption, but broadband adoption also acts as a stimuli of usage of e-Government
         services (see figure 6.34).

          Figure 6.34. Interrelationship between Broadband and e-Government Services




         According to Effect I, the deployment of e-Government services acts as a
         complementary service to broadband, enhancing the consumer surplus and, therefore,
         the willingness to adopt broadband. On the other hand, broadband adoption due to
         ancillary network effect applications (e.g. social networking) leads to the
         identification of e-Government services to be adopted. The authors built two
         econometric models to test both relationships (see table 6.30).

         According to the regression measuring Effect I, an increase of 1 percentage point of
         e-Government users yields an increase of 0.55 percentage points in broadband

                                                                                         193
penetration. This finding would imply that e-Government services represent a strong
incentive to purchase broadband subscription for home usage.

The results of Effect II also indicate a positive inverse relationship between both
variables. An increase of broadband penetration of 1 percentage point increases the
use of e-Government services in 0.10 percentage points. This means that, when
controlling for employment rate, growth in broadband penetration reduces the cost to
access e-Government from the home, yielding an increase in growth.

6.5.3.2 e-Health services

Broadband also contributes in an important way to the delivery of health care
services. E-health involves a variety of services and tools provided by both the public
and private sectors, including electronic health records and telemedicine. The
communication technology is useful in tackling the economic challenges derived
from delivering quality services, particularly in handling the relationship with
patients, the provision of clinical care, and administration. In general terms, three
priority areas can be identified where broadband can contribute to increase the
efficiency of health care delivery. In the first place, the administration of health care
information can be significantly improved on the basis of hospital information
systems, digital archives of clinical histories, and treatments and digital libraries
containing diagnostic images and records.

Secondly, patient-doctor/nurse communication can be conducted more efficiently by
installing on-line registration, telemedicine (in areas such as tele-psychiatry, tele-
cardiology, tele-radiology and tele-surgery), remote monitoring, and the creation of
community and social networks linking patients and health care professionals. The
application of these technologies in the processes of both primary and specialized
care has a positive impact not only on the quality of delivery but also on its flexibility
and adaptation to patient needs. Hernandez, Leza, and Ballot-Lena (2010) argue that
citizens in rural areas, as well as those with limited mobility, may use e-health to
access specialized care previously unavailable to them. For example, broadband
capabilities are essential to medical evaluation and other medical applications that use
imaging extensively. High-definition video consultations allow rural patients and
immobile patients (for example, incarcerated individuals or nursing home residents)
to be seen by specialists in a timely manner when urgent diagnosis is needed and the
specialists are not able to travel to where the patients are located.

Thirdly, the communication among health care professionals through the deployment
of social networks, distance learning programs, and video-conferencing leads to an
improvement in skill level and the delivery of up-to-date information. In this way,
health care professionals residing in remote areas can continue their training and
updating by means of eLearning platforms.

The contribution of these applications is far reaching. On a social dimension, research
has identified an improvement in the quality of health care delivery, a decrease in
time required for delivery of services, an increase in service quality, coupled with
higher efficiency in the information exchange among professionals and the benefit of
their continuing education. From an economic standpoint, the contribution of
information and communication technologies to the health care sector results in better

                                                                                      194
management of material and human resources, a reduction of care delivery and
patient transportation costs, and the consequent reduction in information handling
costs.

With the increased adoption of smartphones in low-income nations and the relative
lack of wireline broadband penetration, mobile health (m-health) is establishing a new
frontier in health care in those countries. Although basic voice and data connections
are useful in improving health and medical care, broadband connectivity is necessary
to realize the full potential of e-health and m-health services, particularly in rural
communities.

On the other hand, broadband availability renders possible the development of new
services as improvements in telemedicine and other e-health initiatives will rely on
increasing bandwidth capacity, more storage and processing capabilities, and higher
levels of security to protect patient information. As an example, Cape Verde has
exploited growing broadband connectivity by connecting two of its hospitals to the
Pediatric Hospital of Coimbra, Portugal (Favaro, Melhem, and Winter 2008). The
telemedicine system supports remote consultations through video conferencing. One
goal is to reduce the number of Cape Verdeans who must travel to Portugal for
medical service. In addition to the Cape Verdean hospitals, two Angolan hospitals
also are connected to the network and over 10,000 remote consultations have been
carried out (CVTelecom 2010).

Types of e-Health applications that drive demand

This section will examine the different types of broadband enabled e-health
applications that have been launched in different countries. There are three types of
broadband-enabled e-Health applications: 1) transmission and remote access of
patient information, 2) patient-professional and inter-professional communications,
and 3) mobile e-Health (adding the mobility functionality to the prior two
applications categories). The three case studies reviewed below illustrate examples of
all three categories. The Cape Verde experience illustrates categories 1 and 2, while
the Indian and Ghana experience are examples of category 3.

A study published in 2011 by the World Health Organization (based on 2009 survey
information) developed six categories of mHealth interactions. These initiatives
included not only established mHealth programs, but also informal programs that
used mobile technology for health-related communications and pilot programs
undergoing evaluation.

At the global level, the study found the most common initiatives to be:
     health call centers/health- care telephone help lines (59%)
     emergency toll-free telephone services (55%)
     emergencies (54%)
     mobile telemedicine (49%)

These four initiatives primarily rely on the voice feature of the phone. The occurrence
of other functions of mobile health – such as raising awareness and downloading
health information - will likely increase with increased access to mobile devices
offering Internet connections and data storage capacities.

The adoption of specific mHealth initiatives also varied by country income (as
measured by World Bank). The high-income countries reported a larger and more
diverse range of initiatives, although all income groups reported that the health call
center / help lines were the most frequently seen examples. High-income countries
tended to utilize mobile devices to remind patients of appointments nearly twice as
often as their low-income counterparts. The majority of these initiatives utilized
voice, SMS, and Internet features of the phone. The service benefits not only
individual patients and health care providers, but also the larger industry and
economy. The United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, for instance, estimated that
missed outpatient hospital appointments cost an annual US$ 1.2 billion.

In recent years, low and lower-middle income countries have looked to capitalize on
the surge in mobile phone ownership to increase access to health care information. In
doing so, they have addressed such issues as lack of quality health care professionals,
high costs, and unreliable information. In the past, health call centers were limited to
the high-income countries, where they have existed for decades. The present day

                                                                                          196
ubiquity of mobile phones has closed this gap. In some instances, governments
partner with local telcos to complement pre-existing health care services. In others,
citizens pay a flat rate (e.g. $5 per month in Mexico) that allows for call center access
and offers discounted physician services in instances that cannot be resolved over the
phone.

Box 6.5.14 – Integrated Telemedicine and e-Health Program (Cape Verde)

Developed in late 2011 by the International Trust Fund (ITF) and the International Virtual e-
Hospital (IVeH) Foundation, the Integrated Telemedicine and e-Health Program in Cape
Verde (ITEHP-CV) focuses on the provision of health-related online services. IVeH “is a
non-profit organization that was created to assist in rebuilding the public healthcare system in
developing countries by introducing and implementing telemedicine, telehealth, and virtual
educational programs through the concept of the IVeH Network.” The project aims to create a
sustainable system of telemedicine in Cape Verde that will extend beyond its 2014 deadline.

In cooperation with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Cape Verde, the program will
establish one telemedicine center with 9 local centers in pre-existing hospitals across the
country. Beyond the infrastructure and equipment installations, the creation of the centers
will also include the training of medical professionals who are competent in telemedicine as
well as an electronic medical library. In doing so, the project will “improve treatment
outcomes, increase patient satisfaction, provide physicians’ and other experts continuous
education, reduce health care costs, and induce revolutionary transformation of the healthcare
system in Cape Verde.”

As citizens utilize these online services more frequently and see the value they add to their
hospitals and healthcare system, they are more likely to recognize the value of high speed
Internet as it pertains to their everyday lives.

The program falls under the larger Development Cooperation Program, an agreement
between the Cape Verde and Slovenia governments. The ITF was initially established by
Slovenia to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina with mining-related funding, but has since
expanded to include general humanitarian projects. The Fund partnered with Slovenia’s
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer a US$ 29,000 research grant that would lead to future
implementation. This research focused on the country’s medical sector, identifying the
potential for the development of telemedicine and potential obstacles to the project’s success.
Together, ITF and IVeH finalized a proposal and plan for project deployment.

In a matter of months, two of the country’s hospitals were linked to Portugal’s Pediatri c
Hospital of Coimbra via a broadband connection. Because this service offers video
conferencing and consultations, fewer citizens need to travel outside of the country for
medical services.

Box 6.5.15 – Remote Telemedicine Services (India)

In 2008, telecommunications company Ericsson signed a Memorandum of Understanding
with Apollo Telemedicine Networking Foundation (ATNF) to establish an e-health program.
The program offers instant telemedicine services remotely over applications run on
broadband networks. In doing so, it decreases the costs of healthcare while improving its
quality and making it more available, particularly in the case of the rural population. While
Ericsson provides the necessary equipment, ATNF delivers its telemedicine expertise through
the creation of applications that transmit medical advice instantly and remotely. The HSPA
network and mobile technology allows for increased access to quality healthcare and related
services.

Beyond the actual services provided, a key component focuses on training citizens to use the
technology while also publicizing its availability and benefits. The declining costs of ICT and
mobile technology make it easier and more cost effective to provide telemedicine services to
a larger portion of the population. As more citizens benefit from the services, they will likely
realize and appreciate the value of broadband.

In India alone, more than one million citizens – particularly women and children – die as a
result of limited healthcare. An additional 700 million rural citizens cannot access specialized
services, as nearly all specialists reside in urban areas. As ICT improves and becomes more
widespread, it can allow healthcare to permeate additional regions regardless of geographical
boundaries, resulting in more accessible and higher quality services that do not require the
same time and financial expenditures.

Prior to this agreement, Ericsson received a special license in 2007 to use 3G spectrum to
demonstrate the impact it could have on e-governance, e-education, e-entertainment, and m-
health through a pilot project known as “Gramjyoti.” To address the m-health component,
ATNF worked with Ericsson to show the ways in which 3G can be utilized to improve the
transmission process of health information. Consultants at Apollo Group hospitals worked
with patients in remote villages via text, audio, and video technology to “examine” patients
with a web-based camera. This examination coupled with the patient’s medical history and
information such as blood pressure allowed doctors to make a diagnosis for 240 patients
across 18 villages and 15 towns in remote areas of the country. Both doctors and patients
reported high satisfaction.

Apollo hospitals conducted a similar pilot, this time using EDGE technology to offer tele-
consultations to a small village in the state of Tamil Nadu. Utilizing the group’s Hospital -on-
Wheels (HoW) bus, volunteers took x-rays of patients, which they then developed on board.
After uploading the images to a laptop computer, software compressed the images and
emailed them to doctors at the hospital. Doctors also conducted ultrasound examinations of
female patients, but at the time, live video streaming could not take place due to bandwidth
constraints. In this instance, volunteers took videos of the ultrasound and then emailed them
via the wireless network to the hospital where internists could utilize the web cam to finish
the exam.

These pilots have demonstrated the power of broadband to transform healthcare in India, but
they have also shown the barriers to this progress, namely the lack of pre-existing
infrastructure and the mindset of citizens in the targeted areas. Policy makers must focus on
raising the awareness of telemedicine programs and their benefits in order to stimulate
demand for broadband and additional e-health services.

Box 6.5.16 – Mobile Technology for Community Health (Ghana)

In 2009, Grameen Foundation launched its Mobile Technology for Community Health
(MOTECH) initiative, focusing on the reduction of infant and maternal mortality rates
through the utilization of mobile phone technology. Healthcare providers use their mobile
devices in a variety of ways to address the issue, beginning, for instance, with the collection
of patient information that they then upload to a centralized database. Mobile technology is
also used to communicate with pregnant women, providing them with healthcare information
and encouraging them to visit local medical centers for prenatal care and to assist community
healthcare workers in targeting women and newborns that could need their care, offering an
automated service to track patients.

The Ghanaian government launched its Community-based Health Planning and Services
(CHPS) Initiative in 2000, relocating urban clinic nurses to rural communities and
encouraging volunteers and social workers to assist them. While ambitious, the program
ultimately did not take off because many of the women who needed healthcare could not
access the village clinics and did not receive the necessary care because the nurses were not
equipped with the necessary knowledge and information to offer their services on a door-to-
door basis. Building on this initial program, MOTECH delivers relevant information to the
nurses via mobile phones while pregnant women register for care by providing their phone
numbers, location, and due dates. Once registered, they then receive SMS and / or voicemail
updates relating to prenatal care, the location of clinics, and treatment recommendations.
Some messages are personalized based on a woman’s medical records and may, for instance,
suggest certain vaccinations for her and her newborn child. In other cases, patients may send
SMS questions to the nurses.

In collaboration with Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and the Ghana
Health Service, MOTECH is made possible with a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation. Johnson & Johnson, USAID, and the Norwegian government also provide
project-specific funding. The MOTECH Suite is an extension of the project, representing the
collaboration between international mHealth implementers, open-source solution providers,
and funders to develop relevant software and establish best practices to guide future
endeavors.

The program keeps costs low by running on the low cost mobile devices that citizens already
own. The Gates Foundation covers the cost of messages. The country already boasts high
mobile phone ownership and penetration, so device distribution and the associated costs
associated are unnecessary. The project began in 2009 with small-scale field tests and was not
officially deployed until June 2010. In the pilots, the low literacy levels and variety of spoken
languages posed the largest barrier. To overcome this challenge, MOTECH delivered either
pre-recorded voicemails or standard SMS messages in the local language based on patient
preference.

6.5.3.3 Broadband enabled financial services

Online banking has evolved considerably, with the Internet becoming an integral part
of the delivery of banking services around the world. It is generally recognized that e-
banking services can provide speedier, faster, and more reliable services to customers
and thus also improve relationships with them. Although many types of Internet
connections have the capability to support online banking (for example, some m-
banking transactions are conducted with narrowband short message service, SMS,
messages), high-speed broadband is essential for effective e-banking.

Broadband enabled financial services have become prevalent in the industrialized
world. A 2007 study, for example, found that in the United States, banking online was
performed by 66 percent of households with a home broadband connection compared
to 39 percent of households with a narrowband connection (DuBravac 2007, 9). This
phenomenon is also prevalent in the developing world. Standard Charter Bank
(India), for instance, now reports that an estimated 50% of banking transactions in the
country now take place online.

Moreover, delivering financial services to low-income users or populations of
isolated areas through e-banking can also offer the potential to decrease operational
costs dramatically, but more importantly, facilitate financial inclusion. Adoption of
financial services in the developing world remains fairly limited. As of December
2010, over 2.7 billion people across the world did not have access to financial
services. In Africa in particular, only 20% of families have bank accounts,44 leaving
the vast majority of the continent “unbanked” with few prospects of ever creating
viable savings. The vast majority of this demographic live in rural areas, beyond the
growing urban sprawl of capitals and large towns leaving them with little exposure to
the banking industry. Traditional banks have had very little interest in involving this
lower income population in financial services. Beyond the usual fees required to open
a bank account in most sub-Saharan countries, which most of the population cannot
afford anyway, minimum deposit requirements can be as high as 50% of per capita
GDP.45

This problem is not limited to developing countries. For example, one in four U.S.
households are defined as “unbanked” (not having a traditional checking account) or
“underbanked” (forced to rely on other methods of money payment and
management)46. Additionally, FDIC studies in the United States show that amongst
the 25% of households that are underbanked or unbanked, the majority comes from a
minority background. These households still need a method of paying bills and
storing funds. In the past, when something needs to be paid for, cash was the first
option. Traditionally, when cash couldn’t be used money orders and money transfers

were the solution for these individuals. However, today these methods are becoming
more cumbersome and less generally accepted. Credit and debit cards are being used
for more and more transactions, and online shopping is becoming the cheapest and
most efficient way of procuring goods.

For these markets in particular, mobile money services have proved to be of particular
importance. In countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kenya, Indonesia,
Pakistan, the Philippines, and South Africa, various forms of m-banking services are
expanding the financial services frontier. These services allow users to make
payments and remittances, access existing bank accounts, conduct financial
transactions, engage in commerce, and transfer balances. A number of diverse
financial transactions are broadly referred to as “mobile payments”. It is important to
understand that these various transaction types, however, possess very different
characteristics and are often at significantly different levels of technological maturity
and adoption. Below is a summary overview of the key categories in the mobile
payments market.

Types of applications that drive demand

This section will examine the different types of broadband enabled financial services
applications that have been launched in different countries. There are three models for
mobile payment that have been either discussed or implemented in various countries:


                                                                                     201
      •      Cellular provider serves as intermediary in transaction and stores the
             value as seen in the M- Pesa model (Kenya)
      •      Cell phones serve as a mobile wallet and allow the user to use existing
             accounts, or to consolidate charges made onto the cell phone bill or an
             internal credit card account (DoCoMo in Japan)
      •      Cell phones serve as mobile wallet but require a credit card / debit card to
             remit payments to (current US ISIS model)

Box 6.5.17 – M-Pesa (Kenya)

In 2007, Vodafone’s Kenyan subsidiary Safaricom developed and launched the M-PESA
system - derived using “M” for mobile and the Swahili word for money, Pesa - allowing
customers to conduct electronic payments over their mobile phones. To use the service,
customers register at authorized M-PESA retail stores, where they then receive their own
electronic money accounts linked to their phone numbers and SIM cards. The retail stores
serve as a point of cash transfer, converting customers’ cash into an electronic value up to
US$ 500, which can be used to pay bills, purchase mobile airtime credit, and transfer funds.
Safaricom compensates the retailers for each transaction.

The global growth in popularity of mobile phones largely contributed to the success of the
program. In the five years prior to the launch of M-PESA, mobile phone penetration grew
from just 3% to 48%, and is expected to reach 72% by 2014. Kenya in particular
demonstrated certain qualities that are also attributed to the program’s takeoff, including its
“strong latent demand for domestic remittances, poor quality of available financial services, a
banking regulator which permitted Safaricom to experiment with different business models
and distribution channels, and a mobile communications market characterized by Safaricom’s
dominant market position and low commissions on airtime sales.”

Unlike many other banking services, customer registration and deposits are completely free.
Customers must pay a US$ 0.40 flat fee for transfers and bill payments, US$ 0.33 for
withdrawals, and US$ 0.01 for balance inquiries. Vodafone manages a server with all
customer account information, but Safaricom manages these accounts. M-PESA accounts do
not offer interest payments to customers, instead depositing this interest into Safaricom’s not -
for-profit trust fund.

Safaricom deserves credit for its strong promotion of M-PESA, a service that, at the time,
was an entirely new concept in a market with very little exposure to a formal financial
system. The provider aimed to reach 1 million customers – or 17% of its customer base at the
time – within the first year. Before the nationwide launch, M-PESA underwent small pilots
across the country and Safaricom ensured that 750 stores across all 69 districts of the country
were capable of handling the transactions. The emphasis on seamless customer service and
brand recognition also contributed to the popularity of the system, which outpaced the initial
1 million-customer goal.

M-PESA demonstrated the power of mobile phone technology to impact the availability of
financial services, particularly to the unbanked poor segment of the population. Because
many of these citizens already owned and knew how to use mobile phones, this technology
allowed the system to come to fruition without extensive infrastructure deployment or
training costs. Further, by designing a usage-based revenue model, M-PESA offers incentives
for users, financial institutions, and mobile providers, eliminating the inherent discrimination
as banks and providers targeted the more profitable customers. By connecting to this e-
payment system, citizens now have access to a variety of financial services; creating the
opportunity to save money in savings accounts, for instance, and receive welfare
disbursements and send payments for services.

                                                                                             202
While not the first mobile banking model, M-PESA has grown globally to become the largest
and most successful program of its kind. By 2010, more than half of Kenya’s population had
used the service; by its fifth birthday in 2012, the number of retailers outnumbered the
country’s bank branches. Kenya alone reported 15 million M-PESA accounts. Other
developing countries have seen success of similar models. MTN, Africa’s largest wireless
provider, rolled out the service across the continent while central banks in countries like
Brazil have experimented with their own version of the program in an effort to expand their
reach to the poor and rural population. The Indian government has also shown an interest in
developing a mobile banking system to increase financial inclusion, which shows particular
promise given the country’s preexisting IT infrastructure and dense population.

Box 6.5.18 – M-Paisa (Afghanistan)

In 2008, Telco Roshan launched its mobile money transfer program, modeled after the
successful M-Pesa service first seen in Kenya and known as M-Paisa in Afghanistan, in
partnership with Vodafone Global Services. The two companies agreed to share profits,
utilizing Vodafone’s platform developed for M-Pesa. The word “paisa” means cash in
Afghanistan’s local languages, Dari and Pashto.

In 2010, in conjunction with the Ministry of the Interior, the National Police in Afghanistan
began receiving their salaries through the M-Paisa system rather than in cash. Once the
program was initiated, many of the policemen thought they had received a raise; in some
instances the difference in pay equaled an increase of more than 33% once higher-ranking
officials could no longer take cuts for themselves from the cash payments. Beyond curbing
corruption within the system, the M-Paisa also discouraged policemen from defecting to the
Taliban, who could previously offer higher payments for their services and loyalty. The funds
are delivered to the policemen via an SMS and IVR system. The IVR system is particularly
important given than 70% of the country cannot read; these voicemails are available in Dari,
Pashto, and English.

The Roshan mobile network that powers the program covers 3.5 million subscribers in 230
cities in all 34 provinces across Afghanistan. The Aga Khan Fund for Economic
Development (AKFED), Monaco Telecom International (MTI), and TeliaSonera back the
provider. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provides additional funding to M-Paisa
through the US$ 12.5 mn grant it awarded to the GSMA trade association to provide mobile
banking services to 20 million global citizens by 2012.

The program has received praise for the contribution it has made in boosting Afghanistan’s
economy by curbing corruption and enabling small businesses and the Afghan people who
previously had to deal with the risks associated with cash-only transactions. Beyond salary
transfers, M-Paisa also enables “national remittance, salary disbursements, airtime purchase,
bill payment and merchant services.” The program has particular potential to impact
Afghanistan’s economy, as less than 3% of the population is banked and the financial sector

                                                                                         203
is virtually non-existent, in large part due to the past 20 years of conflict. The high need for
microfinance systems in the country drives the demand for such services and the Central
Bank of Afghanistan has supported the development of M-Paisa.

In 2011, Splash Mobile Money Limited partnered with MoreMagic Solutions and the
Guaranty Trust Bank to launch Sierra Leone’s first mobile money service, Splash. Designed
to address the flaws in the country’s inadequate banking system, Splash lets consumers use
their mobile devices for financial transactions, eliminating problems such as high transaction
costs, security, and limited transparency. More than 150 agents throughout the country are
certified to register new users in the program, converting their cash to “splash cash” credit on
their phones. The users can then send or receive electronic funds, make purchases at
participating retail vendors, or buy prepaid airtime through a text message. After receiving
splash cash, a customer can go to any certified agent to convert the electronic money to cash.

At the time of Splash’s launch, a mere 6% of the Sierra Leone population had access to
traditional banking services, making citizens more reliant on cash-only transactions. Beyond
the aforementioned benefits of removing cash from the equation, Splash also greatly impacts
rural citizens by eliminating the burden of traveling long distances to a physical bank only to
wait in line.

The company targets individuals and organizations alike. While every day citizens take
advantage of the services, so too do businesses. Splash allows Sierra Leone’s largest
microfinance institution, for instance, to send loan disbursements and repayments. The
country’s largest satellite television provider uses Splash to accept payments from customers.

Splash received its initial financing by way of equity funding from Manocap, the Soros
Economic Development Fund, and through a grant from the Africa Enterprise Challenge
Fund. When getting off the ground, one of the largest challenges to the organization’s
business model was the reluctance of citizens – who were so reliant on cash transactions – to
trust electronic money. Similarly, the transparency of mobile-money transactions revealed the
flaws and corruption in the traditional banking system, and this exposure resulted in
resistance. Further, the low literacy rates posed a problem to the SMS platform.

Within the next five years, the company hopes to expand beyond Sierra Leone and into at
least five additional West African countries. As part of its growth plan, it aims to increase the
number of agents as well as the opportunities for micro-franchising. It also plans to target the
region’s rural areas, thus bringing financial services to the unbanked population.

6.5.20 – NTT DoCoMo DCMX Service (Japan)

In 2004, NTT DoCoMo and its eight regional subsidiaries launched the i-Mode Felica mobile
wallet application, designed for use on its i-mode smart-card 2G and 3G handsets. The
company designed the devices to serve as train passes, debit cards, credit cards, and personal
identifications. At the time of launch, customers could purchase the handsets – which came
equipped with Sony’s Edy e-money system - at 9,000 shops throughout the country. 39
mobile providers offered m-wallet functions through the Felica service, available for
download on the providers’ websites.

In 2006, DoCoMo launched the “DCMX” consumer credit services through iD, its brand of
mobile credit cards. The company offered its Felica phone users two different plans from
which to choose based on their credit and purchasing behavior. The first plan, known as
DCMX mini, offered a monthly credit line of US$ 100. Use of the service did not require a
membership fee and allowed customers to use their phones to purchase goods without
requiring a separate identification or signature. The payments were applied directly to the
monthly phone bill. The other plan began at US$ 2000 and offered cash advances, requiring a
four-digit password for purchases over US$ 100 to enhance security. To encourage use, this
plan came with a US$ 13 fee when the card wasn’t used within 12 months and offered
customers the opportunity to earn points redeemable for products and services offered by
DoCoMo and its partners. Customers also received a Visa or MasterCard plastic credit card
for use in stores that did not have readers or when making purchases overseas.

By 2009, more than 30 million DoCoMo customers had purchased the Felica-enabled
handsets, available for use on more than 420,000 readers through the country’s retailers,
restaurants, convenience stores, and taxis. Of these customers, 10 million regularly used the
credit card service, reflecting the world’s largest mobile payment market. In 2011, the
company announced plans that the new models would support not only the FeliCa
technology, but also the international standard N.F.C.

While mobile payments are a very specific sector within the company’s business in Japan,
analysts feel that it could lead the way to increased mobile phone demand and adoption. They
liken the initial hesitation of customers to use mobile payment to banks’ early struggle to
encourage customers to use ATM machines.

Expected impact on broadband demand

There is some initial evidence that successful communications-enabled financial
services act as a powerful incentive for communications adoption. The example of M-
Pesa is quite illustrative. Research by Jack and Suri (2010) conducted among M-Pesa
non-adopters indicated that the primary reason indicated for non-usage was lack of
access (either lack of agents or cellular coverage) (21%), while other factors (safety,
ease, cost, confidentiality) scored significantly lower. This would indicate that, once
the network is in place, adoption would greatly increase.

6.5.4 Content to drive broadband demand

As discussed above, users purchase broadband services and devices in order to gain
access to the complementary services and content. In fact, for the population at large,
the network infrastructure is less important on a day-to-day basis than the availability
of relevant and useful online services and applications that allow them to access,
create, and share content.

This section will present different policies that could be formulated to stimulate the
development of broadband-enabled applications and services in local languages,
leveraging local content. Examples will be provided of the more successful
applications, and details regarding ways of stimulating local development will be
included.

6.5.4.1. Local content promotion policies:

In order to increase demand for broadband services, citizens must first view the
service as relevant. Without resources, information, and applications designed with
local communities in mind, the demand for such services will only come from the
segment of the population for whom the Internet was first developed – native English
speakers. Even with the rise in Internet users in countries where English is not the
first language, comparatively fewer websites written in other languages and
characters exist. Further, the defining characteristics of a culture – such as
“geographic location, religion, ethnicity, and area of interest” - shape an individual’s
interest in available content.

The Internet has offered citizens the chance to create and distribute their own content
more quickly and cost-efficiently than ever before. As discussed in prior sections, it
has also allowed them to come together in such instances as crowd-sourcing or mass
broadcasting.

At the same time, however, lack of access further stratifies various segments of the
population. Lack of access is only exacerbated by lack of local content, but in recent
years, many developing countries have taken charge of the promotion and
development of such resources. These efforts have commenced both to increase
access and also to build a new industry of digital content.

In Kenya, for instance, the government allocated a budget of nearly US$ 4 million in
an effort to increase locally relevant digital content and software. By working directly
with developers, it hopes not only to increase demand for broadband services, but

                                                                                    206
also to increase revenue within the industry. In the case of Egypt, governments have
worked to digitize pre-existing cultural content, in turn encouraging Internet use
while also allowing more people to benefit from its resources. In the Middle East, the
UAE and Qatar have both developed industries centered on the distribution of digital
content within the region.

In many instances, the governments turn to international corporations and
organizations for both implementation and financial assistance in these endeavors.
Much of this help allows these initiatives to benefit from pre-developed best practices
while also establishing international support for the budding industries. Increasing
content in areas such as education and technology training will also serve to
strengthen the countries’ economies.

In addition to direct grants for the production of local content, governments can
support the development of local content and applications in other ways, such as the
development of standardized keyboards, character sets, and character encoding. This
type of indirect intervention would affect the content available by enabling users to
create content in their own languages. Additionally, translation and standardization of
operating systems into local languages can help to facilitate the development of local
applications that are relevant and comprehensible to local users. Governments can
also play an important role in developing local content and local applications by
directly creating local content and local applications in the form of e-government
applications, as described above.

Some forms of user-generated content, such as YouTube videos, face fewer barriers
to expression, as the speaker is recorded directly in his or her own language.
YouTube has launched a localization system, where YouTube is available in 31 local
versions as well as a worldwide version. This helps to overcome some of the barriers
to content reaching a possible community of interest, but not entirely, as content
generated in languages other than those used in the 31 local versions or the worldwide
version may encounter barriers to reaching an audience.

It is likely that greater amounts of local content will continue to become available in
the near term. For example, a website called d1g.com is a platform in Arabic for
sharing videos, photos, and audio, a forum, and a question and answer facility.
Launched in 2007, d1g.com is one of the Arab world’s fastest-growing social media
and content-sharing web- sites, with more than 13 million users and 4.8 million
unique monthly visitors. It has 15 million videos and streams an extensive amount of
Arabic videos—600 terabytes of data per month. Notably, nearly 100 percent of d1g.
com’s content is user generated, with a small amount produced in-house. d1g.com
became the most popular Arab social media site (after Facebook and Twitter) when a
user created the “Egyptstreet” diwan during the Egyptian revolution. During that time,
unique visitors rose from 3 million to 5 million per month, and visits per month grew
from 6 million to 13 million.

Box 6.5.22 – Tandaa Local Digital Content (Kenya)

Operating within the Kenyan ICT Board, Tandaa “promotes the creation and distribution of
locally relevant digital content through the Tandaa Symposium and [through the distribution
of] seed money to ICT entrepreneurs.” Tandaa defines digital content as “any content that can
be consumed from an electronic device,” such as a personal computer, digital television, or

                                                                                         207
mobile phone, and is distributed through the Internet. The Tandaa website offers users the
option to stay connected through Facebook and Twitter and also houses resources that focus
on the protection of intellectual property rights. In 2010, the ICT Board designated US$ 3.7
million for Tandaa’s endeavors.

Tandaa-sponsored activities range from digital training to research to the digitization of
content. In 2010, for instance, the Company Registry of State Law saw all of its records
digitized, with more than 20 million pages and records from 1936 to 2010 scanned and made
available for online searches. This project was carried out by the private company, DPH, that
won the tender offered by the ICT Board. The task involved 215 staff members working 24
hours a day to scan 450,000 pages daily. Later in the year, the Board awarded its Digital
Content and Software Application Grant to various firms in the three categories of:
Government Information Portal, Private Sector (Individuals), and Private Sector (firms).
Grant winners were chosen based on their plans to introduce such resources as an HIV and
AIDS in the workplace e-Learning Course, a teacher’s portal, and a digital museum.

In 2011, the Tandaa team hosted four workshops around the country to promote the second
round of the Digital Content Grant. At each workshop, attendees learned about intellectual
property rights and the confidential, secure nature of the application process. They also
learned how to submit a proposal that would appeal to reviewers. The number of applications
rose by 68% from the year prior and nearly half of all applications came from outside of
Nairobi, attributed in part to the workshops and also to the redesigned easy online application
process. Following the submission of proposals, the top applicants – as chosen by a team of
consultants – attended a business plan training session at Strathmore University.

In early 2011, the ministry created the Creative Content Task Force to promote Kenya’s
Visual Effects sector, which at the time was hindered by its fragmentation. Beyond
connecting the various sub-sectors – such as animation, performing arts, and cultural
expression – the task force, per the ministry’s website, also worked to:

           Seek input from sector players towards the enhancement of the creative industry
           Establish a formal classification of the creative industry
           Catalyze trade opportunities for the creative industry
           Accelerate and facilitate access to creative industry knowledge

In 2012, the IBM Service Corp Team developed a roadmap for the industry, meeting with
representatives from UNCTAD-identified industry sectors. The roadmap identified the
segments with “high levels of innovation and thriving economic activity” that the government
should target. These sectors included new media, publishing, and visual arts industries. The
work also demonstrated that such issues as lack of recognition, insufficient education and
training, and government policy issues held back the development of some segments. These
issues also included intellectual property rights and a limited use of ICT within the country.

As a result of these findings, the roadmap established the following six main themes:

           Raise the profile and increase recognition of the creative industries
           Implement policies that support creative industry growth and its measurement
           Reinstate arts in the education system and increase creative industry training
            opportunities to raise quality standards
           Implement programs and policies to enhance general business and marketing
            skills of creative practitioners to promote brand Kenya
           Implement changes to address current intellectual property issues

                                                                                           208
           Gain further leverage through new technologies to facilitate growth

Ultimately, per its mission statement, the roadmap identifies “how the creative industry can
contribute   10% of Kenya’s GDP by 2017.”

Box 6.5.23 – Center for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage (Egypt)

As the name implies, Egypt’s Center for Documentation of Cultural and Natural Heritage
(CULTNAT) oversees the documentation of Egypt’s cultural and natural heritage and the
dissemination and promotion of such resources. Topics range from archaeology, to national
history, to music and folklore. Such projects have included:

           implementing the national plan of action’s documentation program, making use
            of the most up-to-date information technology in collaboration with the national
            and international specialized organizations;
           increasing public awareness of cultural and natural heritage using all available
            media; and
           Capacity-building for professionals in the fields of conservation and
            documentation of cultural and natural heritage.

The Center emphasizes the importance of placing resources online using the latest
digitization technologies, allowing the world to view and benefit from them regardless of
their geographic location. To promote access to the Eternal Egypt project, for instance,
CULTNAT partnered with IBM to develop an interactive, multimedia website where users
can take guided tours of the country’s pyramids in English, French, Arabic, Italian, or
Spanish. The website utilizes “interactive technologies, high -resolution imagery, animations,
virtual environments, remote cameras, three-dimensional models and more.” CULTNAT also
offers public exhibitions and projections that are available in print and CD formats, such as
the atlas series that features maps, locations, and descriptions of the country’s archaeological
sites. Other initiatives include the world’s first nine-screen interactive projective system,
CULTURAMA.

The center is located in Cairo and falls under the direction of Egypt’s Ministry of
Communication and Information Technology. Much of the outside financial support comes
from UNESCO, though project-by-project partnerships with the international private sector
also offer a source of funding.

CULTNAT’s work has not gone unnoticed by the international community. In 2003, the
center received a Special Mention at the World Summit Award (WSA) for its work in the e-
Culture category. In 2010, CULTANT won the WSA in the m-Tourism category as a result of
its mobile-app, CULTMOB, which offers a tool for locating archaeological sites via 2.5G and
3G mobile devices. Its “Archeological Map of Egypt” program received the Stockholm
Challenge Award in 2003/4 and an award from the Arab Federation for Libraries and
Information for the digitization of the country’s National Historical Archives project. China’s
AVICOM International Committee for Audiovisual and New Image and Sound Technologies
recognized CULTNAT’s work in producing educational films.

Box 6.5.24 – TwoFour54 (United Arab Emirates)

The Abu Dhabi Government published a long-term plan in 2007 that detailed its strategy for
diversifying its economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels. Known as the “Abu Dhabi
Economic Vision 2030,” it emphasized, among other factors, the importance of a strong
private sector, a knowledge-based economy, and a transparent regulatory environment while
also detailing plans for the development of certain industrial sectors. The media and
entertainment industry received special attention, largely due to the projection that its
regional growth would exceed 19% annually. With comparatively low broadband penetration
rates that were expected to grow at 12%, the government also saw this investment as a way to
boost connectivity while taking advantage of the region’s 3G mobile take-up and rise in
popularity of social media. Further, the publishing industry in the MENA region – unlike in
the rest of the world – continued to see positive growth in revenues and demand.

Named for the geographic coordinates of Abu Dhabi - 24°north by 54°east – twofour54
promotes the development of Arabic-language media and entertainment. Launched in 2008,
the initiative serves to place Abu Dhabi at the forefront of the media content industry,
covering such segments as film, broadcast, music, digital media, gaming, and publishing. The
project’s campus includes three main segments: a training academy (Tadreeb), state of the art
production facilities (Intaj), and support (Ibitkar).

Tadreeb, the training academy, offers 200 bilingual, international-standard courses through
three of the project’s partners, BBC, Thomson Reuters, and the Thomson Foundation. The
courses reflect market demands and are offered either on campus or at client offices. Intaj
offers such services as state-of-the-art HD production, post-production, media asset
management and broadcast facilities to international production companies, producers, and
broadcasters.

Ibitkar supports ventures for Arab entrepreneurs and businesses needing funding for the start-
up phase, business development, or operational support. Ibitkar’s creative lab offers grants to
Arabs in need of seed funding or development assistance.

These three pillars are supported by tawasol, which looks after organizations and individuals
looking to join the twofour54 community. Encouraging education, investment, collaboration,
and partnership, the project provides Arabic companies and organizations with the tools,
support, and infrastructure necessary to create high quality content. It also works to establish
a seamless licensing process while working with intellectual property concerns.

Twofour54 boasts an impressive roster of media business partners. Many of these partners –
like CNN, HarperCollins, and National Geographic – hail from all over the world and are
leaders in the media, television, and publishing industries. Because the campus is a free trade
zone, companies working with twofour54 enjoy the benefits of a tax-free environment with
100% foreign ownership. The project has helped many of these organizations to expand their
business to include the Middle East region, a virtue of both its geographic location and its
understanding of the Arabic culture and market.

Box 6.5.25 – Digital Content Incubation Center (Qatar)

Qatar’s Supreme Council of Information & Communication Technology (ictQATAR) offers
incubation services to new services, encouraging digital content innovation and the use of
ICT. The Council ultimately envisions these companies contributing to the availability of
Arabic digital content. Its Digital Content Cluster (DCC) offers resources such as innovative
platforms, access to international partners, business development services, training, and office
space. The entrepreneurs, start-ups, and small online businesses with which DCC works have
access to conference facilities, IT services, government resources, coaching services, and
accounting and legal services. They also receive support from multinational organizations
like IBM, SAP, and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

This project is one of the Qatari government’s many initiatives designed to support a
knowledge-based economy with less dependence on hydrocarbon revenues. Investment in the
ICT industry is expected to lead to the economic transformation that will drive sustainable
development. Recent ICT projects have included the implementation of ultra-fast networks,
international submarine cables, and satellite technology. More than 360 government e-
services are now available online and the telecom sector now has a second mobile and fixed
line operator. These innovations and the country’s growing youth population and high
purchasing power have led to an increase in demand for ICT services, and much of the
growth in available services has come as a result of private sector investment.

To work with the incubation center, aspiring entrepreneurs must first pass through three
phases - the eligibility phase, the admission phase, and the business phase - prior to
admission. Once admitted, qualifying individuals will have access to the aforementioned
resource for a specified tenure period and will eventually “graduate.” Companies working
with the center have addressed such topics as gaming, e-commerce, and women’s issues.

6.5.4.2. Digital content promotion policies:

“Digital content” is defined as the myriad of websites, applications, and services
available to broadband users. It can be based on text, audio, video, or a combination.
Much of the content available on websites today can be divided into three broad
categories: (a) user generated, (b) proprietary or commercial, and (c) open source.

User-generated content is produced within Internet-based platforms where users
function both as consumers and as producers of content. Along these lines, consumers
interact with one another instead of only dealing with site operators in a top-down
fashion. User-generated content includes blogs, wikis, podcasts, Twitter updates,
You-Tube videos, and Flickr photos. They can be produced within social and


                                                                                            211
professional networks, as well as reputational systems. For example, in the last three
months of 2011, Facebook users collectively uploaded more than 250 million photos
per day. This number broke down to approximately 7.5 billion monthly photos, or
3,000 photos every second. The social media site stores more than 100 petabytes, or
100 million gigabytes of photos and videos alone47These forms of social media help
to drive broadband demand by engaging users and ensuring the local and personal
relevance of content. Due to the “bottom-up” nature of social media, policy makers
can support the development of such content by taking a more hands-off approach in
regulating it. They can also promote such services by becoming active users of such
applications and services; more and more government agencies and even politicians
are realizing the value of such tools in reaching out to citizens (see the example of
Twitter usage in Russia).

As opposed to copyrighted materials, open-source content is available free-of-charge.
In addition, the source code is also freely available to allow anyone wanting to
incorporate the content or application into new forms of media, such as in mashups.
Open-source content has led to the creation of property rights systems that encourage
collaboration by publishing source code and allowing other users to extend those
applications and develop them further, with the provision that the result should also
be governed by the same open-source property rights.

Box 6.5.20 – Digital Content Policy (Colombia)

In 2011, Colombia’s ICT Ministry developed its Digital Content Policy, which aimed to
increase its domestic sales from US$ 70 million to US$ 200 million by 2014. By encouraging
the development of such products as smart phone applications, video games, and digital
animations, policy makers hope that the country’s digital industry will serve as the regional
leader in this area and attract higher levels of foreign investment.

To enhance the resources available to the country’s professionals, entr epreneurs, and digital
producers, MINTIC hosted Colombia 3.0, a non-profit initiative spanning three days. The
conference aimed to gather industry leaders together to network, participate in conferences
and workshops, and exchange ideas. In 2012, the ministry hosted Colombia 3.0 v.2, placing
higher emphasis on technological innovation and the development of an interactive
community while placing Colombia 3.0 in a position to serve as a single point of convergence
amongst the international digital industry. In doing so, the conference will likely promote the
industry and encourage outside investment while fostering an environment conducive to tech
startups.

Box 6.5.21 – Two Trillion and Twin Star Program (Taiwan)

By 2001, Taiwan became one of the world’s largest producers of semiconductors and LCD
technology. In an attempt to encourage the growth of this sector, in 2002, the Taiwanese
government launched its Two Trillion and Twin Star program, investing in the country’s
semiconductor industry as well as in the digital content industry. As a “rising star” industry,
the government hoped that, in the future, digital would contribute an annual production value
of more than US$ 30 billion. While the “Two Trillion” part of the plan referred to the growth
of the semiconductor industry, the “Two Stars” part promoted the di gital content industry by
encouraging Taiwanese companies to develop Chinese-language software and digital content.
While the industry had the potential to grow and contribute positively to the country’s
economy, policy makers feared that without additional investment to enhance infrastructure
and R&D, China’s manufacturing and electronics sector could surpass Taiwan’s progress.

This program spurred several digital content initiatives, many of which represented a
partnership between government agencies and the private sector. The National Science
Council sponsored 9 initiatives beginning in 2002, including the five-year National Digital
Archives Program (NDAP). The program aimed to digitize collections from the country’s
museums, libraries, and universities, covering such themes as anthropology, painting,
Chinese classics, and maps. For instance, the project created a database of the collections
featuring 60,000 digitized artifacts, calligraphic works, and paintings as well as 190,000
archived documents from the internationally renowned National Palace Museum. The public
could then access this content online from anywhere in the world.

The Two Trillion and Twin Star program also strived to “build both real and virtual industrial
parks to promote the digital content industry, establish digital content colleges … and train
new digital talents,” all of which were governed under the Digital Content Promotion Office.
The government also established the Challenge 2008 National Development Plan, under
which the Creative Industries Promotion Office designated 13 areas of interest, including
digital games and entertainment, focusing on their potential to increase employment in the
country. Similarly, the Development Fund Investment Plan for Digital Content, Software, and
Cultural Creative Industries was established by the Executive Yuan to provide financial
support for digital content projects. The fund totaled US$ 3 billion, 40% of which came from

                                                                                           213
the government. As part of the Two Trillion and Twin Star program, the Executive Yuan also
offered tax breaks and incentives for digital content producers.

Taiwan’s electronic publication and digital archives output value grew 45.23% from 2010 to
2011, reaching US$ 2.5 billion, and the digital content industry as a whole is expected to
create new job opportunities, employing more than 70,000 citizens. The industry’s output
value reached US$ 18 billion in 2010, and grew to US$ 20 billion in 2011. This figure is
expected to top US$ 26 billion in 2013, in large part due to Taiwa n’s presence in the global
mobile application industry. Many of these mobile apps work with electronic learning,
entertainment, and gaming content. In 2011, the Industrial Development Bureau established
the App Incubation Center, working with domestic companies to encourage development.
The government hopes that such an initiative will bring the country to the head of the
Chinese-language app creation industry, producing 20,000 apps a year.

6.6. LAUNCHING SERVICES TO DRIVE BROADBAND DEMAND

As discussed above in chapter 6.4, broadband in itself is of little value in the absence
of so-called complementary goods that confer value to such access. Examples of
complementary dynamics in broadband adoption include applications and content that
users value, and therefore should be attractive enough to encourage the purchase of
the service. However, beyond applications and content, complementarity also exists
with the services that enable access to the Internet as well as value added features that
broadband operators include with the broadband subscription and that meet specific
quality guidelines. The availability of such services is an important factor that
influences and possibly drives demand. This level of demand, of course, will be
affected, as discussed above, by the attractiveness and affordability of the service
offerings.

6.6.1. Internet

A broadband subscription provides a high-speed connection to the Internet. The way
the subscription is provided can affect attractiveness and will depend on the
technology and regulatory or business considerations. This includes whether the
broadband subscription can be purchased on its own or requires a subscription to an
underlying transport technology. For example, in the case of a digital subscriber line
(DSL) broadband connection, a telephone line is required. Subscribers have typically
been obligated to pay a monthly rental for the telephone line in addition to the
broadband subscription even if they do not use the telephone line for anything else
but broadband. This adds to costs and may require an extra bill, discouraging users
from taking up the service. Some operators include the telephone line with the
broadband subscription, so there is no separate bill. In a few countries, the cost of the
physical broadband connection is billed separately from Internet access. In other
words, the user needs to pay one bill for a broad- band connection and another bill for
Internet access.

Several factors make a broadband subscription more or less attractive to potential
users. One important factor is speed. Although some consider all “always -on”
subscriptions of at least 256 kilobits per second (Kbps) to be broadband, in practice,
speeds must be above a certain threshold to use desirable applications such as video
viewing or gaming. It is important to establish that download speed has a direct
impact on the user experience. Table 6.33 presents the times required to download
different types of content.

However, it is important to consider not all broadband users require fast download
speeds. While a minimum speed is certainly desirable for all users to have a good


                                                                                     215
experience, beyond a certain point, desired download speeds depend on the content
being downloaded. In study conducted by the United States Federal Communications
Commission, broadband users were segmented into four categories according to the
content being downloaded (see figure 6.37).

As the figure shows, a user that relies on email and accesses the Internet via a search
engine would rarely require more than 512 Kbps. However, once the user begins to
download audiovisual content (such as You Tube video clips), it might require 1
Mbps. In case downloading includes TV shows, the download speed required to have
an appropriate experience increases to 4 Mbps. Obviously, if the user needs reach the
levels od advanced videoconferencing, download speeds will reach 7 Mbps.

In a typical developing country, one might observe that only 25% of users could be
characterized as “multimedia”, thereby requiring only 1 Mbps. The problem is that
the segmentation presented above is nothing but static. In fact, when assessing user
behavior in terms of broadband consumption, one can observe that with more
applications and content being available on the Internet, the higher the need for speed
to confer an adequate experience. Furthermore, the faster speeds are offered, the
more content is being downloaded. The same study conducted in the United States
that segmented users by download speed observed the correlation between speed and
content (see figure 6.38).

In summary, a variety of offers with different speeds provides more choice to the user.
Other factors to consider are restrictions that the broadband providers may impose on
capacity (for example, data or usage caps). Some operators distinguish between
domestic and international use by having no cap or a higher cap for traffic to national
sites and a low cap for access to sites hosted abroad. One issue with caps is that users
often do not understand the relation between volume and their usage needs. Users can
easily underestimate how much data they will use, particularly if they access a lot of
video services or use peer-to-peer download services (some of which may run in the
background). This makes it difficult for them to know which package to select when
packages vary by data caps. Some operators cap usage through time rather than data
volume (for example, monthly subscription of 20 hours). These practices are more
prevalent in mobile services, where “unlimited” offers (no download cap) are almost
non-existent.

Increasingly, governments are responding to data caps and “throttling” practices by
requiring service providers to disclose their network management practices clearly, in
order to protect consumers and improve the overall broadband. Regulators have also
instituted other measures, such as monitoring quality of service and alerting users to
sites where they can test their broadband connection for speed or throttling.

6.6.2. Voice

Voice telephony continues to be a popular service, although it represents a declining
share of revenue for public telecommunication operators. A growing number of
broadband operators offer voice over broadband (VoB) service, which is a managed
service (unlike voice over Internet Protocol, VoIP, which is generally considered as
an application running “over the top” of the public Internet and not directly managed

                                                                                                        217
by the network operator). VoB provides the same quality as a traditional fixed
telephone and often provides other value added features such as call waiting, voice
mail, and speed dialing as well as the ability for users to monitor these features online
via the provider’s website. The price structure for VoB is often made attractive by
including unlimited national calls for a flat rate or even including free national calls
with the broadband service subscription. Since the service works through the
broadband modem, users do not need to be connected to the Internet and do not even
need a separate Internet subscription.

Several regulatory issues are related to VoB. The most basic is whether or not a
country’s laws and regulations allow it. Where VoB is legal, other regulatory
considerations are often driven by the requirements placed on legacy wireline
telephone networks. One is the requirement for users to be able to make emergency
calls. Other regulatory requirements relating to consumers can include access for
persons with disabilities and number portability. The latter can be influential in
encouraging users to switch from traditional telephone services to VoB.

6.6.3. Video

IP networks allow video services to be provided over a variety of networks. This has
allowed broadband operators to provide Internet Protocol television (IPTV) or video
on demand (VoD) services. The ability to provide IPTV, VoD, or both can make
operators’ broadband services more attractive, especially when other features are
included, such as access to special programming not available elsewhere. Television
as a managed offering with a broadband subscription takes many forms. Some
operators require IPTV to be bundled along with the broadband subscription, while
others offer IPTV on a stand-alone basis.

Others have developed more extensive video service offerings, including BT in the
United Kingdom, which offers its Vision service, which seamlessly integrates free-to-
air digital television programs with a digital recorder and VoD feature. Some
operators provide additional features such as radio programming and the ability to
watch programming on computers, tablets, and mobile phones in addition to the
traditional television set.

The ability to bundle television with broadband Internet service is often subject to
technical and regulatory considerations. In the case of IPTV, users need to have a
minimum bandwidth to use the service. Some countries require companies that
provide television service to obtain permission or a specific type of license.
Sometimes permission is required from local authorities. Conditions vary, but in
general, television service is subject to a higher level of regulatory oversight than
broadband service. Regulatory limitations have sometimes meant that operators can
only provide delayed service rather than live programming, making their offer less
attractive.

6.6.4. Bundling

IP-based technology and digitalization of media allow a single network to provide a
variety of voice, data, and video services. The ability to offer multiple services has
led operators to bundle services together. This often includes a price reduction in the

                                                                                     218
total cost of the service (that is, the bundled prices is less than the cost of buying the
same services individually) and the benefit of receiving just one bill. “Double play”
refers to a combination of broadband Internet and some other service, “triple play”
refers to the ability to provide three services, whereas “quadruple play” also includes
mobile service.

Bundling offers can be attractive to consumers because of their lower costs and a
single invoice. However, some consumers may only want one service from a provider
and therefore need to have an “a la carte” option and not be obligated to purchase
additional services. In any case, a service provider that is only allowed to provide
Internet access is at a disadvantage versus converged operators since consumers are
increasingly interested in receiving multiple types of communication services offered
through bundles. Service bundles are currently offered as a promotion to limit
customer disconnects through temporary discounts.

6.7. BROADBAND, FIRMS AND EMPLOYMENT

In the last few years, spurred by the economic crisis, many governments around the
world have implemented programs aimed at deploying broadband in order to
stimulate employment growth (see table 6.34).

How should one assess broadband effect on employment? Should it be considered an
infrastructure development project necessary to build a platform to foster long-term
economic growth? Or, alternatively, should it be conceived as a short-term job-
creation policy with only a speculative belief in its future employment multiplier
effect? Obviously, either answer may be true. Nevertheless, it might be useful to
understand how many jobs can be created by a broadband stimulus program, both in
the short run (as a result of laying down fiber optics and erecting towers) and in the
long run (as result of the potential innovations triggered by the deployment of a
broadband highway that reaches all corners of the nation). In this context, it is
important to differentiate between the two types of impact that broadband has on
employment: jobs created to deploy the infrastructure, and network externalities that
generate employment resulting from spill-overs.

This chapter will review the evidence regarding the impact of broadband in terms of
job creation. Differences will be made between the research focused on measuring the
impact of broadband deployment programs (e.g. counter-cyclical impact of
broadband network construction) and the spill-over effect that broadband can have in
terms of generating employment across the economy once it is being deployed.

6.7.1. Broadband and job creation

Broadband contribution to employment can be estimated both in terms of the direct
impact resulting from network deployment (e.g. construction effect) and in terms of
the indirect positive externalities derived from additional network coverage (e.g.
network externalities). Each type of effect is comprised of three specific impacts (see
table 6.35).

The following section will review the research conducted to date in assessing each type of
effect. In addition, the section will present evidence of these specific effects in the context of
developing nations.

6.7.1.1. Job creation through network construction

Broadband network construction affects employment in three ways. In the first place,
network construction requires the creation of direct jobs (such as telecommunications
technicians, construction workers, and manufacturers of the required
telecommunications equipment) to build the wireline and wireless network facilities.
In addition, the deployment of broadband networks has an impact on indirect
employment triggered by upstream buying of inputs required for broadband network
construction (which creates employment in, for example, metal and electrical
equipment manufacturing sectors). Finally, the household spending based on the
income generated from the direct and indirect jobs created by network deployment
induces employment throughout the economy.

Input-output tables help calculating the direct, indirect, and induced effects of
broadband network construction on employment. The interrelationship of these three
effects can be measured through multipliers, which estimate how one unit change on

According to input-output economics, multipliers are of two types. Type I multipliers
measure the direct and indirect effects (direct plus indirect divided by the direct
effect), while Type II multipliers measure Type I effects plus induced effects (direct
plus indirect plus induced divided by the direct effect).

Six national studies have estimated the impact of network construction on job
creation: Crandall et al. (2003), Katz et al. (2008b), Atkinson et al. (2009), Liebenau
et al. (2009), Katz et al. (2009), and Katz et al. (2010). They all relied on input-output
matrices and assumed a given amount of capital investment:

       United States: US $ 63 billion needed to reach ubiquitous broadband service
        in this country (Crandall et al., 2003)
       Switzerland: CHF 13 billion to build a national multi-fiber network for
        Switzerland (Katz et al. (2008b)
       United States: US $ 10 billion invested in broadband as a counter-cyclical
        stimulus (Atkinson et al. (2009)
       United States: US$ 6.4 billion invested in broadband as part of the Recovery
        Act voted by the US Congress in 2009 (Katz et al., 2009)
       United Kingdom: US $ 7.5 billion for needed to complete broadband
        deployment in the United Kingdom (Liebenau et al. (2009)
       Germany: 35.4 billion Euros to implement Germany’s National Broadband
        Strategy as well as an Ultra-broadband Scenario targeted for 2020 (Katz et al.,
        2010)

Each study will be reviewed in turn.

In 2003 Crandall et al. relied on the multiplier effects calculated by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis, and concluded that US $63.6 billion of capital expenditures in
broadband in the United States would trigger the creation of 61,000 jobs per annum.
In addition, if investments were assigned to more advanced broadband platforms

                                                                                                                                                                                223
(such as VDSL, or FTTx), the cumulative effect of current and new generation of
broadband would result in an increase of 140,000 new jobs per year. By adding both
effects, the authors concluded that universal broadband adoption would trigger the
creation of 1.2 million jobs, (546,000 in network deployment and 665,000 generated
in upstream industries.)

In a similar vein, a study by Katz et al. (2008) estimated the impact of the deployment
of a national FTTH network in Switzerland at a cost of CHF 13 Billion. Using
national input-output tables from Eurostat, the authors estimated that deployment of
such a network could generate 114,000 jobs, 83,000 in direct and 31,000 in indirect
employment. The study did not estimate induced employment.

Atkinson et al. (2009) also relied on input-output tables from the US Bureau of
Economic Analysis to assess the employment impact of a $ 10 Billion investment in
broadband infrastructure aimed at tackling the 2008 economic crisis. Their conclusion
was that such an investment could create 64,000 direct jobs and 166,000 indirect and
induced jobs.

In a replication of Atkinson et al. (2009), Katz et al. (2009) estimated the jobs that
could be generated as a result of the grants to be disbursed by the broadband
provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, published in February
13, 2009. The study differentiated between jobs generated through capital spending in
the form of grants allocated to unserved/underserved areas, and employment created
as a result of network externalities caused by the deployment of such an
infrastructure. Using input-output analysis to estimate the direct, indirect and induced
impact on jobs, the study found that approximately 127,000 jobs could be created
over a four-year period from network construction. According to the analysis, the
investment of $6.390 billion48 would generate 37,300 direct jobs over the course of
the stimulus program (estimated to be four years). In addition, based on a Type I
employment multiplier of 1.83, the bill could generate 31,000 indirect jobs. The split
across sectors is presented in table 6.36.

         Once the Type I employment was calculated, the Type II effect was estimated. As
         mentioned above, the Type II effect refers to employment generated as a result of
         household spending derived from the Type I one. In this case, the Type II multiplier
         (direct + indirect + induced jobs/direct jobs) was 3.42. The combination of direct
         (37,300), indirect (31,000) and induced jobs (59,500) yielded a total employment
         impact of 127,800 jobs over a four-year period. The average annual employment
         generation effect was estimated at 31,950 jobs per year.

         fairly consistent across research studies (see table 6.37).

In other words, all three studies conducted to assess the employment contribution of a
broadband construction program in the United States coincided in the magnitude of
job creation. Differences only remained in the amount of capital to be invested.

In a similar approach to the US studies, Liebenau et al. (2009) calculated the labor
impact of implementing the "Digital Britain Plan” in the United Kingdom. According
to this study, the investment required to implement such a program would be US $
7.5 billion, which could generate 211,000 jobs (comprising 76,500 direct and 134,500
indirect and induced).

Finally, Katz et al. (2010) estimated the employment impact of fulfilling the
broadband deployment targets of Germany’s National Broadband Strategy and an
assumed Ultra-broadband Plan to be implemented by 2020. The estimated 35 billion
Euros would generate 304,000 jobs over five years. The primary sector benefited in
terms of job creation would be construction with 125,000, followed by
telecommunications (28,400) and electronics equipment manufacturing (4,700). Total
indirect jobs generated by sector interrelationships measured in the input/output
matrix would be 71,000. The key sectors benefited from the indirect effects are
distribution (10,700), other services (17,000) and metal products (3,200). Finally,
household spending generated directly and indirectly, will result in 75,000 induced
jobs. Based on these estimates, the Type I multiplier for employment would be 1.45
while the Type II would be 1.92.

Additionally, the implementation of the expected ultra-broadband evolution would
generate 237,000 incremental jobs between 2015 and 2020. Similar to the breakdown
reviewed above, this figure would comprise 123,000 in direct jobs, 55,000 indirect
jobs and 59,000 in induced jobs.

As in the other studies, the German case concluded that the labor intensive nature of
broadband deployment determines that the construction jobs to be created are
significant and, despite the high technology nature of the ultimate product, broadband
is to be seen as economically meaningful as conventional infrastructure investment such as
roads and bridges.

To summarize, all studies that have relied on input-output analysis have calculated
multipliers, which measure the total employment change throughout the economy
resulting from the deployment of a broadband network. Beyond network construction
(direct employment), broadband construction has two additional employment effects.
Network deployment will result in indirect job creation (incremental employment

                                                                                      226
       generated by businesses selling to the sectors that are directly involved in network
       construction) and induced job creation (additional employment induced by household
       spending of the income earned from the direct and indirect effects) (see table 6.39).

As mentioned above, according to the sector interrelationships depicted above, a
European economy appears to have lower indirect effects than the US. Furthermore,
the decomposition also indicates that a relatively important job creation effect occurs
as a result of household spending based on the income earned from the direct and
indirect effects. The induced effects are very large.

While input-output tables are reliable tools for predicting investment impact, two
words of caution need to be given. First, input-output tables are static models
reflecting the interrelationship between economic sectors at a certain point in time.
Since those interactions may change, the matrices may lead us to overestimate or
underestimate the impact of network construction. For example, if the electronic
equipment industry is outsourcing jobs overseas at a fast pace, the employment
impact of broadband deployment will diminish over time and part of the counter-
cyclical investment will "leak" overseas. Second, it is critical to break down
employment effects at the three levels estimated by the input-output table in order to
gauge the true direct impact of broadband deployment. Having said that, all these
effects have been codified and therefore, with the caveat of the static nature of input-
output tables, we believe that the results are quite reliable.

These studies have provided the theoretical framework and tools to estimate the
overall job impact of broadband-enabled counter-cyclical programs. For example, In
2010, Australia embarked on the construction of a National Broadband Network with
a total funding estimated at AUD40.9 billion over 8 years to build and operate a new
open access wholesale network. The plan will support up to 25,000 jobs over the life
of the project. Funding will initially come from government, which will contribute
equity of AUD27.5 billion, with other funding expected to come from operational
earnings and private debt. In 2015, the wholesale network provider (NBN Co) will
begin raising funds through capital markets, with an estimated AUD13.4 billion
expected to be needed to finance the project.

6.7.1.2. Broadband spillovers on business expansion and innovation

Beyond the employment impact of network construction, researchers have also
studied the impact of network externalities on job creation variously categorized as



                                                                                                       228
"innovation", or "network effects"49. Once deployed extensively, broadband becomes
a “general purpose technology” with the power to facilitate growth and innovation
throughout the economy. The study of network externalities resulting from broadband
penetration has led to the identification of numerous effects:

        New and innovative applications and services, such as telemedicine, Internet
         search, e-commerce, online education and social networking50
        New forms of commerce and financial intermediation51
        Mass customization of products52
        Marketing of excess inventories and optimization of supply chains53
        Business revenue growth54
        Growth in service industries55

The results of microeconomic research have been utilized to estimate the impact of
broadband on job creation. For example, Fornefeld et al., (2008) identified three ways
that broadband impacts employment: first, the introduction of new applications and
services causes acceleration of innovation in terms of creation of new ventures and
natural business expansion requiring additional workers; second, the adoption of
more efficient business processes enabled by broadband increases productivity, which
in term, tends to reduce employment; and third, the ability to process information and
provide services remotely makes it possible to attract (or loose) employment from
other regions through outsourcing. According to Fornefeld et al. (2008), these three
effects act simultaneously, whereby the productivity effect and potential loss of jobs
due to outsourcing are neutralized by the innovation effect and gain of outsourced
jobs from other regions.

Thus, according to the authors, the negative effect of broadband productivity is
compensated by the increase in the rate of innovation and services, thereby resulting
in the creation of new jobs. The third effect may induce two countervailing trends. On
the one hand, a region that increases its broadband penetration can attract
employment displaced from other regions by leveraging the ability to relocate
functions remotely. On the other hand, by increasing broadband penetration, the same
region can lose jobs by virtue of the outsourcing effect. While we are gaining a better
understanding of these combined "network effects", the research is still at its initial
stages of quantifying the combined impact. The study by Fornefeld et al. (2008) is
probably the first attempt to build a causality chain. It applies ratios derived from
micro-economic research to estimate the combined impact of all effects, rather than
conducting aggregate econometric analysis of historical data.

Most of the research regarding the impact of broadband externalities on employment
has been conducted using US data. There are two types of studies of these effects:
regression analyses and top down multipliers. The first ones attempt to identify the
macro-economic variables that can impact employment 56, while the second ones rely
on top-down network effect multipliers.

Among the econometric studies of employment impact, are Gillett et al. (2006),
Crandall et al. (2007), Shideler et al. (2007) and Thompson and Garbacz (2008).
Relying on standard regression analysis, a team of MIT and Carnegie Mellon
researchers57 conducted a study that sought to measure the impact of broadband on a
number of economic indicators including employment. Initially, the study tried to
estimate the relationship between broadband and employment at the state-level.
However, it concluded that data at this level of aggregation did not permit observation
of any measurable impact. It was only when they turned to the zip code level that a
positive impact of broadband was observed: the availability of residential broadband
added over 1.5% to the employment growth rate in a typical community58.

Crandall et al. (2007) relied on the same methodology to conduct a study focused on
the effects of broadband on output and employment for the 48 US states. The
conclusion of their multivariate regression analysis was that "for every one
percentage point increase in broadband penetration in a state, employment is
projected to increase by 0.2 to 0.3 percent a year (…) (an increase of about 300,000
jobs, assuming the economy is not already at "full employment").

Shideler et al. (2007) analyzed the relationship between broadband saturation and
employment growth in counties of the US state of Kentucky. The authors found that
the coefficient on broadband saturation is positive and statistically significant on
aggregate county employment in several industrial sectors (details below). It ranged
from 0.14% to 5.32% for each 1% incremental broadband penetration.

Finally, Thompson and Garbacz (2008) employed a stochastic-frontier production
function to measure the direct and indirect impact of broadband penetration on the

    56
        In general, studies based on regression analysis do not differentiate between construction and
spill-over effects.
57 Gillett, et al., 2006
58
   Because of their approach, the researchers did not differentiate between job effects (network
construction vs. utilization).

                                                                                                     230
GDP 48 US states. While they found that employment in certain industrial sectors
tends to grow with broadband penetration, they also pointed that broadband
deployment may cause a substitution effect between capital and labor.

To sum up, after examining the conclusions of the regression studies, the evidence
regarding broadband employment externalities appears to be quite conclusive (see
table 6.41).

According to this research, the impact of broadband on employment creation appears
to be positive. However, as the data indicates, the impact on employment growth
varies widely, from 0.2 % to 5.32 % for every increase in 1% of penetration. There
are several explanations for this variance. As Crandall indicated, the overestimation
of employment creation in his study is due to employment and migratory trends,
which existed at the time and biased the sample data. In the case of Gillett et al.
(2006), researchers should be careful about analyzing local effects because zip codes
are small enough areas that cross-zip code commuting might throw off estimates on
the effect of broadband. For example, increased wages from broadband adoption in
one zip code would probably raise rent levels in neighboring zip codes prompting
some migration effects. Finally, the wide range of effects in the Shideler et al. (2007)
study is explained by the divergent effects among industry sectors (see below).

Beyond regression studies, "network effect" multipliers have been used to assess the
impact of broadband on job creation in a top down fashion. Within this group, key
studies are Pociask (2002), Atkinson et al. (2009) and Liebenau et al. (2009). Pociask
(2002) and Atkinson et al. (2009) studies relied on an estimated "network effect"
multiplier, which is applied to the network construction employment estimates. For
example, Pociask relied on two multiplier estimates (an IT multiplier of 1.5 to 2.0
attributed to a think tank and another multiplier of 6.7, attributed to Microsoft) and
calculated an average of 4.1. Similarly, Atkinson et al. (2009) derived a multiplier of
1.17 from Crandall et al. (2003). Though the top-down approach allows estimation of
the broadband impact, it does not have a strong theoretical basis. Network effects are

not built on interrelationships between sectors. They refer to the impact of the
technology on productivity, employment and innovation by industrial sector.

Beyond aggregate estimates indicating positive externalities of broadband,
disaggregated effects are more complex. For example, a study by Katz et al. (2010)
on the broadband externalities of Germany’s National Broadband Strategy found that,
while the positive effects on employment and economic output resulting from
enhanced productivity, innovation and value chain decomposition are significant
throughout Germany; the job impact of broadband tends to vary over time and by
region. By splitting the German territory into two groups, counties with 2008 average
broadband penetration of 31 % of population and counties with average broadband
penetration of 24.8 %, the analysis determined that the type and pattern of network
effects of broadband varies by region. In high broadband penetrated counties the
short-term impact of the technology is very high both on GDP and employment, but it
declines over time. This "supply shock" is believed to occur because the economy can
immediately utilize the new deployed technology. Furthermore, the fact that
employment and GDP grow in parallel indicates that broadband has a significant
impact on innovation and business growth, thereby overcoming any employment
reduction resulting from capital/labor substitution effects.

On the other hand, in counties with low broadband penetration the impact of
broadband on employment is slightly negative in the initial years. Negative initial
employment growth appears to indicate that the productivity increase resulting from
the introduction of new technology is the most important network effect to begin
with. However, once the economy develops, the other network effects (innovation
and value chain recomposition) start to play a more important role, resulting in job
creation 59 . Therefore broadband deployment in low penetrated areas will likely
generate high stable economic growth ("catch up" effect) combined capital/labor
substitution, which initially limits employment growth ("productivity" effect). Figure
6.41 presents in conceptual fashion a comparison of impact in both regions.

The finding conceptualized in figure 6.39 is consistent with Lehr et al. (2005) and
Thompson et al. (2005) finding that there is a short-term negative impact of
broadband on employment due to process optimization and capital-labor substitution.
However, the German evidence appears to point out that the short-term negative
effect is limited to low broadband penetration geographies. These differentiated
effects are critical in generating evidence regarding job creation of broadband in rural
areas. The results of the research appear to be mixed in this regard.

In the first place, in response to the argument that broadband deployment in rural
areas stimulates the relocation of establishments to those areas and therefore create
jobs, evidence indicates that relocation as a result of broadband tends to occur to the
suburban peripheries of metropolitan areas rather than the strictly rural geographies
(Katz et al., 2011). Furthermore, research also indicates that the jobs created in the
periphery are jobs lost in metropolitan areas (“job cannibalization” effect), which
means that no additional jobs are created. For example, Lehr et al. (2005) assessed a
district-level (zip-code) panel of data on broadband deployment in the United States
and concluded that zip codes with broadband experienced faster job growth rate (1%
to 1.4%) between 1998 and 2002, experienced faster growth in business
establishments (0.5% to 2.2%), and a favorable shift in the mix of business toward
higher value-added ICT intensive sectors (0.3% to 0.6%). In response to this finding,
some economists argue that, “job cannibalization” resulting from firm relocation
triggered by broadband technology yields equilibrium in labor markets (and therefore
has a positive contribution).

Secondly, research indicates that job effects of broadband in rural areas are highly
dependent on industrial sectors. As we will show below, job creation effect in
metropolitan peripheries is present in wholesale trade and financial services, while

                  60
                       Only effects up to t + 3 are estimated.

                                                                                                                                  233
   broadband-induced employment growth in rural areas is only significant in retail
   trade, and health services.

   In sum, the employment impact of broadband by geography appears to indicate the
   existence of multiple effects at work (see figure 6.42).

   6.7.1.3. Broadband and employment in developing countries

   Beyond the studies conducted in mature economies, the aggregate impact of
   broadband on employment has begun to be studied in emerging countries as well. For
   example, Katz (2012) constructed a cross-sectional sample for the 27 Brazilian states
   similar to that one utilized by Katz et al (2010a) for Germany, where the dependent
   variable was the rate of change of unemployment:

  However, the relationship between the rate of change of unemployment rate and the
  rate of change in broadband penetration is significant and with the expected negative
  sign. According to the model results, a change of 10% in broadband penetration could
  reduce the unemployment rate by 0.06 percentage points. On the other hand, it is
  counterintuitive that the difference in schooling years and population growth are not
  statistically significant in explaining the differences in the level of unemployment
  across regions.

  The availability of an extensive database of quarterly data for Chile allowed the
  development of a panel of time series data for each of Chile's administrative regions.
  This database was constructed by compiling data for each of Chile's regions (except
  for the Metropolitan Region due to the lack of quarterly data) from 2001 until the
  fourth quarter of 2009. The dataset contains the following information:

  A model including level of economic activity and broadband penetration was
  specified. In addition, an alternative model was proposed aimed to study possible
  effects of human capital and specialization on the level of employment. According to
  the methodology used, other specific characteristics of each region that could have an
  impact on the labor market are controlled by the fixed effects of the panel data. Thus,
  the model results are as follows (see table 6.45).

The economic activity variable remained unaltered between the two specifications; in
both cases it was significant and positive. The coefficient of broadband penetration is
significant61 and positive in both specifications. The small variation between the two
specifications suggests that the contribution of 1 percentage point in broadband
penetration would contribute nearly 0.18 percentage points to the employment rate.

An interesting result on the second specification was the coefficient of human capital,
which resulted significant at the 10% level and with a negative sign. Contreras at al
(2008) argues that this result is mostly explained by the impressive increment in the
years of schooling of the population in one generation and the entrance of women to
the labor force.62

A model similar to one constructed for Germany was developed by Katz et al. 92011)
for Colombia. In this case, growth of the employment rate was studied in relation to
the increase in broadband access lines, controlling for population growth and
economic development. The model was specified both for the whole country and for
departments with high and low broadband penetration.




       61
            It was significant at the 1% level on the first specification and at the 5% level on the second
one.
       62
       According to Contreras, et al (2008), women were educated but were not part of the labor force.
As more women entered the labor force the average schooling years of the population increased but
also increased the number of women unemployed looking for jobs.

        In these models, the broadband contribution to job creation is significant at the
        national level and for the low penetrated departments; in the highly penetrated
        departments, statistical significance is only 24%. On the other hand, population
        growth appears to have an effect only in high penetration departments (with a positive
        coefficient). This could be explained by the fact that in highly penetrated departments
        it is easier to be placed in the labor market, according to the innovation effect
        reviewed above.

        Finally, Katz (2012) conducted a study on job creation in the Dominican Republic,
        relying on panel data for the country’s 32 provinces. Contrary to the Chilean and
        Colombian models, the objective in this case was to study broadband contribution to
        the reduction of unemployment. The results in this case exhibit high impact. An
        increase in broadband penetration of 1% reduces unemployment in 0.29 percentage
        points. The other variables affecting unemployment in an indirect fashion are, as
        expected, the change in the number of industrial establishments, and the growing
        importance of the construction sector.

According to Table 6.44, an increase in broadband penetration of 1 per cent would
diminish unemployment in 0.29 percentage points. For example, if the unemployment
rate were to be 14 per cent, an increase of 1 per cent in broadband penetration would
contribute to a reduction of unemployment to 13.71 per cent.

The other variables that indirectly affect unemployment are, as expected, number of
establishments between 2008 and 2009, and the intensity of the construction sector in
a specific area in 2009. Therefore, a combination of increase in the number of
establishment, investment in construction and broadband yields a positive effect in
terms of job creation.

It is considered that the contribution of broadband relative to the other two variables
is too high. Part of this is due to the fact that the largest increase in broadband has
taken place in Santo Domingo, the capital, and Altagracia, a tourism hub. Ideally, to
refine the impact of broadband it would be necessary to include in the model
specification a variable related to the intensity of the tourism sector. However, while
data exists for three regions, Altagracia, Puerto Plata and Cibao Norte, data for the
rest of the country is not captured. Therefore, it is impossible to introduce a variable
measuring the intensity of tourism. As a result, the case confirms the contribution of
broadband to job creation, although the range of impact might be overestimated.

The results of the analyses also lead to validate the positive contribution of broadband
to employment creation for less developed countries and regions. The following chart
compiles the results of the existing literature (see table 6.48).

      In this case, all prior research and as well as the results of this study coincide that
      broadband has a positive impact on job creation. In particular, the Chilean and the
      Colombian cases, which are based on an extensive datasets, yield statistically
      significant positive coefficients. The other cases (Brazil and Dominican Republic)
      have also yielded statistically significant coefficients for the explanatory variable
      (broadband penetration) with sensible signs—positive when the independent variable
      is employment and negative when it is unemployment. While these studies are
      country-specific and cannot be applied directly to other nations, they provide an
      estimate of the potential employment gains that could result from effective broadband
      development. The positive relationship between broadband development and job
      growth is not in question. However, the magnitude of the impact should be the subject
      of further analysis, as the present studies are compiled using different methodologies
      and data samples.

      Coincident with these empirical studies, governments in the emerging world have
      begun to estimate the employment impact of broadband development programs. For
      example, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)
      estimated in 2008 that achieving 50 percent broadband penetration by 2010 could
      create 135,000 new jobs in the country. The MCMC further projected that the number
      of jobs created would reach 329,000 by 2022, based on 50 percent broadband
      penetration rate.

      6.7.2. Broadband, productivity and firm efficiency

      Converging with the aggregate macro-economic research, the microeconomic
      analysis of the impact of broadband has helped understand the multiple effects that
      the technology has on firm performance. For example, several studies have been
      conducted to determine the relationship between broadband and productivity. Atrostic
      and Nguyen (2006) analyzed the productivity of 25,000 manufacturing plants
      according to data compiled by the US Census Bureau. They found a correlation in the
      range of 3.85 % and 6.07 % between intense use of business processes enabled by the

                                                                                         240
introduction of broadband and labor productivity. A similar methodology was applied
by Rincón-Aznar et al. (2006). The authors relied upon a database of enterprises
using e-Business, which was compiled by the UK National Institute of Economics
and Social Research. They found that the average impact of such processes (enabled
by broadband access) resulted in 90% of firms in the service sector improving their
productivity by 9.8%. The researchers also found that productivity improvement
tends to be higher in certain segments of the service sector.

These results are consistent with the analysis of the e-Business watch survey, which
determined that e-Business productivity gains depend on the industrial sector. The
variable found to better explain the amount of broadband impact is the level of
information-intensity of business functions. Based on this conclusion, Fornefeld et al.
(2008) in a study commissioned by the European Commission estimate that
broadband increases productivity of information-intensive firms by 20%. To
summarize, microeconomic research has yielded the following estimates of firm
productivity enhancement (see table 6.49).

In addition to the impact on productivity, other microeconomic studies have focused
on the impact of broadband technology on business expansion, product innovation
and new business creation. With regards to business expansion, Clarke (2008)
studied the impact of broadband access on exports of manufacturing and service
firms. The analysis was performed for countries of medium and low levels of
development in Eastern Europe and central Asia. The study controlled for variables
such as firm size, industrial sector, foreign ownership, firm performance, level of
domestic competition, international trade organization affiliation, progress in
privatization, and telecommunications infrastructure. The author found that in the
manufacturing sector firms with Internet access enabled by broadband generate 6%
more foreign sales than the rest. In the service sector, broadband enabled firms
generate between 7.5 % and 10 % more sales.

In addition to increasing exports, broadband has been found to have a positive impact
on the development of new businesses. This results from the network effects of
connectivity. When a large enough number of households are connected to
broadband, the incentive to develop new businesses around information search,
advertising and electronic commerce increases. For example, Crandall et al. (2007)
estimate that the network effects of universal broadband access can have a multiplier
of 1.17 on the investment in infrastructure. As a result of 40% lower broadband


                                                                                   241
penetration in the United Kingdom, Liebenau et al. (2009) estimate the multiplier to
be somewhat lower (0.33) for the British economy

 6.7.3. Industrial sectors most impacted by broadband

As with output, the spill-over employment effects of broadband are not uniform
across sectors. Two studies have identified differential levels of impact. According to
Crandall et al. (2007), the job creation impact of broadband tends to be concentrated
in service industries, (e.g., financial services, education, health care, etc.) although the
authors also identified a positive effect in manufacturing (see table 6.50).

In another study, Shideler et al. (2007) found that, for the state of Kentucky, county
employment was positively related to broadband adoption in the following sectors
(see table 6.51).

     Table 6.51. Kentucky: Differential impact of broadband by Industry sector

Source: Shideler et al. (2007)

The only sector where a negative relationship was found with the deployment of
broadband (0.34 % - 39.68 %) was the accommodations and food services industry.
This may result from a particularly strong capital/labor substitution process-taking
place, whereby productivity gains from broadband adoption yields reduced
employment. Crandall et al. (2007) also found a negative relationship for the Arts,
Entertainment & Recreation sector, although it was not statistically significant.

Similarly, Thompson and Garbacz (2008) concluded that, for certain industries, "there
may be a substitution effect between broadband and employment" 63 . It should
therefore be considered that the productivity impact of broadband can cause capital-
labor substitution and may result in a net reduction in employment.

63   This effect was also mentioned by Gillett et al. (2006).

                                                                                        242
In summary, research is starting to pinpoint different employment effects by industry
sector. Broadband may simultaneously cause labor creation triggered by innovation in
services and a productivity effect in labor-intensive sectors. However, we still lack a
robust explanation of the precise effects by sector and the specific drivers in each
case. However, given that the sectoral composition varies by regional economies, the
deployment of broadband should not have a uniform impact across a national
territory.

6.7.4. Broadband and enterprise relocation

Enterprise geographic strategies are determined by several objectives, not all
consistent. At the most basic level, firms define their location as a function of a
market they want to serve. Closeness to the target market allows better understanding
of customer needs and faster responsiveness to environmental changes. At the same
time, firms need to consider in their location strategy an optimal approach to
accessing a valuable resource (labor, raw materials). Closeness to the supply input
builds competitive advantage (also called static arbitraging). Finally, firms tend to
cluster in certain geography as a way of lowering transaction costs. While
counterintuitive (since competitors in a common cluster might fight for inputs and
talent), the need to trade among themselves for inputs, and attracting the investment
of suppliers makes it highly convenient to collocate.

Meeting all three locational requirements might not be easy. If a firm prioritizes the
lowering of transaction costs, that might put it far away from its customers.
Alternatively, closeness to the market might run against static arbitraging (gaining
access to valuable inputs).

In this context, broadband technology represents a powerful tool to help defining a
geographic strategy that maximizes all three conditions. First, broadband reduces the
communication costs that buyers and sellers incur to complete a transaction. In that
sense, closeness to the market might not be such a strong imperative. Second,
broadband can reduce the search costs for a particular input, rendering static
arbitraging not as advantageous at least for all inputs. At the same time, broadband
allows companies to relocate to places that are attractive, with the implication that
good quality of life helps attracting talent. In sum, broadband allows firms to define
their locational strategy by prioritizing one of the three geographic constraints
without a concern of losing to its competitors. There are several examples of
enterprises that succeed despite the fact they are not collocated within a given
industrial cluster: Microsoft in Washington State, not in Silicon Valley, Berkshire
Hathaway in Omaha, Nebraska, rather than Wall Street are two examples.

In addition to enabling a decision to move geographically, broadband fulfills another
important function. When considering a company’s value chain, broadband enables
the firm to relocate certain functions to meet some locational requirements without
necessary increasing its coordination costs. Along those lines, manufacturing could be
located close to the source of inputs to reduce cost and optimize the supply chain,
while sales and marketing are located close to the markets being served. Before the
Internet, these geographic strategies could be the source of increasing complexity,
such as problems in the interface between marketing, product design, and

                                                                                   243
manufacturing. This was one of the key advantages Matsushita had over Phillips by
collocating all its primary functions in Osaka, Japan. Broadband-enabled systems
allow now to geographically fragmenting the firm’s value chain without incurring
higher complexity costs. Examples of this approach range from companies like Nike
footwear (manufacturing in Asia while design is located in the United States) to the
Indian systems integrators (serving the European and North American markets with
talent from India).

6.7.5. Broadband and entrepreneurship

If, as pointed above, broadband is causally linked to innovation, it would stand to
reason that the technology would have an impact on entrepreneurship, defined as the
incentive to launch a new business. The causality would operate at two levels. On the
one hand, broadband adoption opens new market reach opportunities to the
development of new service offerings (such as Internet based businesses). As such,
Venkataraman (2004) argues that broadband infrastructure is a prerequisite for high
tech venture growth. In addition, broadband remains a necessary infrastructure
supporting development teams that are at the center of new business incubation. For
example, Audretsch (1998) argues that information flows necessary to incubate new
businesses are accelerated by broadband infrastructure. Finally, broadband can
generate savings in start-up costs for the entrepreneur. According to the Internet
Innovation Alliance (IIA) and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council,
start-up savings generated by broadband could amount to over $16,000, comprising
accounting services, printing, telecommunications, web design and hosting, and other
applications (Kerrigan et al., 2012). Along these three lines of reasoning, it would
appear that broadband deployment would foster innovation and entrepreneurship,
with a positive contribution on economic growth.

The study of the relationship linking broadband and entrepreneurship has begun only
recently. The evidence generated so far is relatively sparse, particularly in light of
considerable data challenges. For example, in a study cited above, Gillett et al. (2006)
found that broadband access tends to reduce the share of small business
establishments by 1.3-1.6%, which would imply a negative correlation. However, the
study authors also acknowledged that given the limited availability of data,
“methodological challenges inherent in disentangling causality” remain. Similarly,
Heger et al. (2011) used county-level data for Germany and found that broadband
infrastructure does not have an impact on the overall level of entrepreneurial activities
after controlling for regional characteristics. The only exception to this general
finding was in high-tech industries (software and technology-intensive sectors),
where higher broadband adoption was correlated with new business creation. A likely
explanation of this trend is that the high-technology sector is quite dependent on
efficient transfer of knowledge, which is naturally facilitated by broadband networks.

In a recent study, Carlsen et al. (2012) analyzed OECD data through a set of
econometric techniques aimed at controlling for reverse causality and found that “a
one percentage point increase in broadband penetration, ceteris paribus, results in an
additional 0.086 new business registered per 1000 inhabitants of working age, a proxy
for entrepreneurship. Such an increase in broadband penetration is in line with the
average percentage point increase between 2008 and 2009 for the 23 OECD
countries. For the average OECD country in our sample, this corresponds to 1,625

                                                                                     244
new firms. In Sweden, the estimated number of new firms is equivalent to 523, an
increase of 2.2%”.

6.7.6. Broadband as an impact on employment structure and distribution on a
        global scale

In addition to its impact on job creation, broadband also affects the global job
distribution and the structure of employment. As broadband is facilitating the
globalization of service provisions in highly value-added services such as accounting
and IT related services as well as lower-skill services such as back-office functions
and call center activities, jobs are migrating from high cost to low cost countries in
these service sectors. In fact, the role of broadband in the international restructuring
of job market in the service sector is increasing as more and more services can be
traded as bandwidth increases. However, as Fornefeld et al. (2008) point out
broadband-enabled outsourcing can benefit emerging regions benefitting from low
cost labor and mature economies that leverage high-skilled workers.

For example, industrialized countries, such as the United States have been developing
virtual call centers, which rely on home-based agents to complement/replace
traditional call centers from emerging markets. This concept, enabled by home-based
information technology and broadband infrastructure, has a number of distinctive
advantages. It avoids overhead related to traditional contact centers, including real
estate and utilities, as well as up-front investment/capital expenditures– particularly
for rapid-growth companies. It lowers staff turnover due to work from home and
flexible schedules, and improves service level and/or labor utilization due to flexible
staffing – management of time of day and seasonal peaks. Finally, it provides greater
responsiveness to unforeseen changes in demand and lowers labor factor cost by
being able to attract talent at lower wages and benefits.

From an economic standpoint, a virtual call center located in an industrialized country
offers 15%-30% cost advantage over the traditional centralized model (see figure
6.43).

market outsourcing trend (see figure 6.44).

In addition to the outsourcing trend, the growth of broadband has also affected the
internal employment structure of both, mature and emerging economies through the
increase of self-employment by creating environment for individuals to deliver their
services directly to customers through broadband. For example, according to the
Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) of South Korea, the nation's
self-employed reached 235,000 in 2010, up 15.7 percent from the preceding year, and


                                                                                                                                                                           246
the number now accounts for about 1 percent of the economically active population.
In the United States, 15.3 million workers (or 10.9% of the economically active
population) are self-employed. Of these, 28.2% are in services such as information,
financial activities, professional and business and education and health, all
professions dependent to a large degree on broadband technology.

In addition to self-employment, broadband also assists with working from home.
According to the Global Workplace Analytics, regular telecommuting in the United
States grew by 73% between 2005 and 2011 (3.1 million) compared to only 4.3%
growth of the overall workforce (not including the self-employed). In addition to the
multiple benefits ranging from reduced carbon emissions to a reduction in real estate
costs, tele-commuting opens up the labor market to those who might be
disadvantaged, for instance by disability or by living in a rural location. Broadband
also enables many more part-time opportunities, for instance trading on eBay as a
form of supplementary income, but not a full-time job. In fact, according to the July
2005 e-Bay survey, more than 724,000 Americans reported that eBay was their
primary or secondary source of income. In addition to these professional eBay sellers,
another 1.5 million individuals said they supplement their income by selling on eBay,

Another example of the impact of broadband on the job market is the emergence of
the “virtual economy”, revenue generating opportunities, conducted in an informal,
decentralized setting, in new emerging areas like micro-work, “gold farming” and
gaming. The virtual economy is growing fast and contributes new job creations. As
reported by Minn and Rossotto (2012), every year, about ten million people, half in
the US, and the other half mainly in South Asia, earn an income from the micro-work
platform Amazon Turk, launched over 15 years ago. Micro-work enables the division
of a task into multiple “micro-tasks” and the micro-work platform enables a client to
ask a crowd of “micro-workers” to respond to the task. The Non-Governmental
Organization (NGO) Samasource has extended the concept of micro-work to highly
distressed countries, including Southern Sudan. According to Samasource, each
micro-worker in Sudan has been able to earn as much as $1,000 a year doing micro-
work, with a quality similar to the Amazon Turk worker.

6.7.7. Potential negative impact of broadband on employment and management
       strategies

As mentioned throughout this chapter, some researchers have found situations where
broadband has a negative and/or decreasing impact of broadband on employment. In
addition to job losses in some rural areas, Gillett et al. (2005) observed that, while the
magnitude of impact of broadband on employment increases over time, they also
found that the positive impact of broadband on employment tends to diminish as
penetration increases. This finding may support the existence of a saturation effect.
Coincidentally, Shideler et al. (2007) also found a negative statistically significant
relationship between broadband saturation and employment generation. This indicates
diminishing marginal returns.

In this context, it is useful to consider a set of additional policies to be put in place at
the same time a broadband deployment program is executed:



                                                                                        247
1. Coordinate broadband deployment with job creation and retention programs:
Network effects resulting from broadband programs can be sizable. However, their
fulfillment is driven by success in implementing job creation and retention programs
in parallel with network deployment. As an example, State and Local Governments in
the targeted areas need to work with private sector companies in using this new
infrastructure for employment generation. Also governments need to work with
businesses to discourage job relocation as a result of broadband deployment.

In addition, it is critical to deploy initiatives aimed at the creation of jobs enabled by
broadband technology. Following on the example mentioned above, governments
should stimulate the development of rural virtual call centers as a way to bring jobs
that were outsourced overseas.

2. Rethink criteria for selecting areas to develop broadband: Consider deployment not
only on unserved and underserved areas but also in regions where the possibility of
developing regional growth, in coordination with broadband deployment, could act as
a magnet to stimulate relocation, firm creation, and, consequently, jobs. While it is
possible that private operators have already targeted such areas, it is reasonable to
consider that opportunities for regional core development could be found. The
experience of Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands could be very instructive in this
regard.

3. Centralize program evaluation and grant allocation: As a corollary to the first
recommendation, given that the ability to generate jobs as a result of network
externalities is dependent on the regions being targeted, it would be advisable to
centralize the process of allocating funds for network deployment and rely on a
common framework for evaluating requests focused on economic growth and job
creation. In this context, it is critical to enhance the government's ability to monitor
spending and results, especially if the stimulus program is largely mandated like an
earmark as opposed to some other methods that have more controls.

4. Develop a systematic test based on social and economic criteria to evaluate the
return of the investment: All submissions for grants/loans should be backed up with
analysis of the social and economic returns supported by a common set of tools and
benchmarks.

5. Evaluate the economic impact of NGAN: This study has not quantified the effect
of faster access speeds resulting from FTTx and/or DOCSIS 3.0. Given that no
research has been conducted to date in this area, it is important to launch some
analysis in this area.

          6.8. STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE BROADBAND DEMAND

          The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidelines on how to introduce demand
          stimulation targets and policies in national broadband plans and national ICT
          planning in general. Some of the terms presented in this chapter are closely linked to
          concepts introduced in modules 1 - Policy Approaches to promoting Broadband
          Development and 3 - Law and Regulation for a Broadband World.

          6.8.1. Determining adoption targets in National Broadband Plans

          Reflecting the shift in emphasis from supply to demand, many national broadband
          plans now prioritize demand stimulation over infrastructure deployment. In general,
          this shift is more prevalent in developed nations, where the broadband coverage
          challenge has been addressed to a large degree.

          The differences in targets can, in many cases, be related to the lack of rigor in setting
          them up. It is critical that countries follow a consistent an structured approach to
          defining targets.

          The first area to be addressed regarding demand stimulation in national broadband
          plans pertains to the stipulation of adoption targets, which should complement the
          supply side (e.g. coverage of service) targets. These will have to be categorized in
          terms of residential, social (educational and health delivery institutions), enterprises
          (particularly SMEs), and public administrations. Furthermore, targets will have to be
          specified for both fixed and mobile broadband.

                                                                                               250
In order to highlight broadband demand stimulation targets, it is advisable to structure
goals on the basis of the following matrix (see table 6.52).

Supply targets: The first step in setting up broadband targets is to define the network
coverage objective. This should be conducted for wireline and wireless networks. To
a large degree, the social and residential coverage objectives have an impact on those
of enterprises and the public administration sector, since population and economic
and administrative units tend to overlap. Accordingly, if the objective is to cover
100% of the population, it is highly likely that this goal will address 100% of firms
and public institutions.

In general term, coverage target setting is conducted a priori on the basis of social
policy imperatives. The notion that broadband is a public service that needs to be
provided to the whole population of a given country is gaining currency. Forty
countries have so far stipulated in their policies and regulatory frameworks the need
        64
           Targets for supply and demand should be defined not only by the unit of
population but also by the unit of household. Given that in many cases targets could be
defined from a technology neutral position, broadband deployment can be achieved with
either wired or wireless broadband. In that sense, measuring targets in terms of both metrics
allows for better measurement and tracking. I think wired broadband can be chosen in several
situations, such as urban area


                                                                                         251
to provide universal access to broadband services (among them, Brazil, China and
Spain). Some countries go even further declaring broadband a human right (e.g.
Finland, Estonia). Broadband plans of developed countries tend to define coverage
targets for 100% of population, while many emerging countries propose reaching
75%.

Residential demand targets: Once coverage is established, demand targets need to be
defined. This requires implementing different approaches for residential, social,
enterprise and public administration. In the case of residential demand targets, four
methodologies could be used:

          Extrapolation of historical growth in penetration rates: this approach
           allows grounding residential target setting on a realistic base; however, it
           is important to consider potential saturation points when implementing this
           approach. For example, due to its late start, mobile broadband has been
           growing quite significantly in the past two years. Consequently, an
           extrapolation of penetration growth rate of this technology could
           overestimate future adoption (see example in figure 6.45)

          Correlation between economic development and broadband penetration:
           this methodology is based on a simple approach of determining whether
           the country under analysis is falling behind in broadband penetration when
           considering its level of economic development; target setting is defined in
           terms of penetration to be achieved in order to reach the level expected by
           its economic development level (see example in figure 6.46).

           Comparison with neighboring nations: this approach, while risking under-
            estimated the target, a target that aligns the nation under consideration to
            regional penetration levels (“catch up approach”)
           Country vision: an alternative approach to residential demand target
            setting stipulates that, based on broadband economic impact, the target
            should aim to grow its penetration in order to maximize its economic
            impact; this could be modeled by relying on econometric models of
            economic impact and assuming alternative impact scenarios. In other
            words, this methodology would establish a residential penetration target if
            the objective is to contributes by x% to growth of the GDP (see figure
            6.47).

       Social demand targets: the determination of targets for educational, cultural, research
       and health institutions can be conducted by relying on the recommendations set up by
       International Telecommunication Union (see table 6.54).

       Enterprise demand targets: the determination of broadband targets in the enterprise
       sector requires segmenting the sector by size of company and industrial sector. This
       segmentation is particularly relevant in the SME sector since there are firms that,
       despite their small size, are ICT intensive and require good broadband connectivity to
       fulfill their objectives. On the other hand, there are others that, due to their position in
       low-value added domestic segments, are not necessarily in need of broadband.

       This differentiation leads to the determination of different adoption targets by firm
       size and industrial sector.

       Download speed targets: download speed targets have to define by segment. While
       the minimum speed for universal residential broadband is one target, goals for social
       and enterprise applications will need to be differentiated by segment. For example,
       the targeted speeds for social institutions are driven by the broadband applications
       and their bandwidth intensity (see table 6.55).

                          Table 6.55. Target speeds for Social Institutions
                             Segments                      Download Speed
                    Universities                    20 Mbps-100 Mbps symmetrical
                    Primary schools                 6 Mbps-20 Mbps download
                    Research centers                20 Mbps-100 Mbps symmetrical
                    Public Libraries                6 Mbps-20 Mbps download
                    Cultural Centers                6 Mbps-20 Mbps download
                    Hospitals                       20 Mbps-100 Mbps symmetrical
                    Health Centers                  6 Mbps-20 Mbps download

       In the case of enterprises, it is useful to segment speed requirements by SME segment
       (see table 6.56).




                                                                                                255

                  supply of high value-added products or          foodstuffs, chemical products, etc.)

                  that leads them to supply inputs to large
                  corporations

              After defining all targets, national broadband plans could construct a matrix such as
              the one below, developed for Ecuador’s National Broadband Plan (see table 6.57).

6.8.2. Identifying and managing demand stimulation programs:

Once targets are determined, national broadband plans have to identify specific
policies to stimulate demand and bridge the gap. Whether explicit or implicit, there
appears to be a link between broadband demand stimulation programs and national
strategies focused on broadband or digitization. A large portion of regional European
Union digital literacy initiatives can be traced back to national strategies, such as the
United Kingdom’s “Empowering Citizens, Connecting Communities,” or
“Implementing the Information Society in Ireland,” as well as regional plans, like the
Lisbon Agenda and the Riga Declaration.

A classical country case in point is that of Finland, where the document “Finland –
Towards an Information Society – A National Outline 1995-2000” served as a
framework to defining a host of digital literacy initiatives. In addition, other policy
initiatives formulated at a later date, such as the “Governmental Information Society
program, 2003-2007” put additional emphasis on the deployment of initiatives aimed
at promoting usability, inclusion and quality of life.

In the linkage between demand stimulation initiatives and national broadband plans,
two differing philosophies exist. Some countries tend to deploy national and regional
initiatives that are centrally managed and that have been defined in the national plans.
In general, national centrally managed demand stimulation initiatives tend to
originate within either the Ministry of Education or the Ministry/Secretariat for
ICT/Communication. In their review of digital literacy initiatives, Hannan et al.
(2009) conclude that most initiatives, especially those led by public organizations, are
generally driven by centralized policies at the national or regional level and are seen
as strategically linked to government objectives. In particular, many initiatives and
the rationales behind them can be traced back to either the economic or the social
ramifications of a developing information society and government’s priorities in
response to these changing circumstances. A critical advantage of national centralized
programs is that they can tackle potential synergies and overlaps among demand
stimulation initiatives.

In other nations, it is common for some initiatives to emerge at the local level, once
the guidelines have been formulated nationally. Local initiatives are initiated at sub-
sovereign levels (province, department, district, and even, municipalities). These local
initiatives have an active participation of non-governmental organizations and
community interest groups. In that regard, the key advantage of locally driven
programs has to do with their closeness with the communities being targeted. This
feature allows the program to carefully tailor content and implementation dynamics to
the needs of the targeted population. As a counter-example, a digital literacy program
targeting SMEs in rural Canada was criticized for emphasizing training in
presentation (e.g. powerpoint) applications, not necessarily a critical need of
participants.

A critical element in defining a successful demand stimulation program has to do
with its long-term sustainability. In fact, according to Hannan et al. (2009)
sustainability remains a big concern, since according to their study of 464 programs
across 32 countries, only 40% have been identified as still running, transferred or
expanded beyond the initial timeframe. Similar concerns were raised in the

                                                                                     257
implementation a municipal WiFi program in Brazil, where once the hardware was
installed, financing difficulties emerged in covering the ongoing operating costs of
the facility. This has to do with the ability to implement the initiative until its
objectives are accomplished. Hannan et al. (2009) have identified five factors that are
critical in driving program sustainability:

      Composition of stakeholders involved: the findings in this regard are quite
       clear. Digital literacy programs with higher chance of sustainability are either
       sponsored by a private company, the partnership of an NGO and a private
       company, a public-private partnership, or a public-private partnership
       including an NGO; on the other hand, if a project is exclusively sponsored by
       the public sector, chances are that it will not be sustainable. An obvious
       explanation of the linkage between private sponsorship and sustainability is
       the financial and infrastructure support, although a non-intuitive factor is that
       the private entity provides more focus in achieving the program objectives.

       In addition, in demand programs that are centrally managed but locally
       implemented, the number of stakeholders increases substantially, thereby
       raising the likelihood of program sustainability. Finally, the reliance on NGOs
       (local associations, community groups, voluntary organizations) drastically
       raises the probability of long term sustainability because of the intrinsic
       interest of such entities in improving the livelihood of the population that
       lacks broadband access
      Level of implementation: national programs, driven by a country policy or
       strategy appear to have a higher likelihood of sustainability (although the
       difference with regional and local programs is not that significant)
      Whether the initiative requires payment or not by the user: 60% of analyzed
       digital literacy campaigns are free of charge to the users.
      Whether the initiative is being evaluated as part of a larger project: while
       being a positive contributor to the program success, research indicates that
       evaluation is only conducted in the context of large-scale national initiatives.

Developing nations face a number of broadband demand and supply side barriers compared to
developed countries. These include a shortage of fixed infrastructure, constrained inter- and
intra-modal competition, low income, and awareness. As a result, they typically lag developed
countries in broadband penetration (Figure 1), although there are exceptions such as some
nations in the Caribbean or the Gulf States.

A number of studies show that broadband increases economic growth (See Chapter 1).
Broadband is also a platform for innovation, an enabler of Small and Medium Enterprise (SME)
growth and a facilitator of new firm foundation. This is particularly relevant for countries facing
the challenge of development and looking to raise the standard of living of their citizens. In that
regard, it is useful to look at international objectives for promoting development and examine
how broadband fits in.


1 Broadband and global goals for developing countries
Broadband has taken on increased relevance within the development community because of its
potential to reduce poverty and better enable countries to participate in the global information
society. International agreements on development and ICTs provide a context for the
significance of broadband in developing countries.

In September 2000, governments adopted the Millennium Declaration, committing their nations
to reducing poverty monitored through measurable targets (Figure 2). The targets have a 2015
deadline and are known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).1 Several reports have
illustrated how ICTs can help to achieve the MDGs.2 Broadband can specifically help to achieve
the MDGs in numerous ways. For example, one of the barriers to achieving Goal 2 on universal
primary education is the lack of primary school teachers. Broadband can facilitate fast track
teacher training through distance education and e-learning. Three of the MDGs are related to
health; high-speed networks can have an impact through applications such as telemedicine.

The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) was held in two phases, in 2003 in Geneva
and in 2005 in Tunis.3 The Declaration of Principles identifies ICTs as an “essential foundation for
the information society” noting that “[a] well-developed information and communication
network infrastructure and applications, adapted to regional, national and local conditions,
easily-accessible and affordable, and making greater use of broadband and other innovative
technologies where possible, can accelerate the social and economic progress of countries, and
the well-being of all individuals, communities and peoples.” WSIS adopted ten targets
addressing connectivity across different sectors (Figure 3). The International Telecommunication

Union (ITU) has reviewed progress towards the WSIS targets and emphasized that most should
be considered as having a broadband component:
           “It is widely recognized that ICTs are increasingly important for economic and
           social development. Indeed, today the Internet is considered as a general-
           purpose technology and access to broadband is regarded as a basic
           infrastructure, in the same way as electricity or roads. … Such developments
           need to be taken into consideration when reviewing the WSIS targets and their
           achievement, and appropriate adjustments to the targets need to be made,
                                                      4
           especially to include broadband Internet.”

Taken together, the MDGs and WSIS targets provide a global roadmap for developing country
policymakers. Broadband can help achieve the MDGs and thus place high-speed networks within
the context of overall national development goals while the WSIS targets monitor broadband
deployment across different sectors.

2 Broadband bottlenecks in developing regions
There is a wide broadband gap around the world. Three out of every five people in the European
Union and North America have a broadband subscription compared to less than one in a
hundred in South Asia (Figure 4).

Improving access to broadband networks requires addressing supply and demand side
bottlenecks. On the supply side, there are two broadband routes with different characteristics
and market developments: fixed and wireless. The three main fixed broadband technologies in
use are Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modem and fiber to the premise (FTTP) (Figure 5).
DSL is the predominant technology accounting for almost two thirds of fixed broadband
subscriptions in September 2010. Broadband access over cable television networks was used by
one in five subscriptions around the world. FTTP accounted for just 16% of global fixed
broadband in September 2010 but its share has grown since 2005 while DSL and cable modem
have dropped.

Fixed broadband requires an underlying wired infrastructure. In the case of DSL, these are the
copper lines used to connect subscribers to the telephone network. In the case of cable modem,
the supporting transport media is the coaxial cable used to provide television access to
subscribers. Fiber optic broadband uses fiber optic cables running directly to the home or
building. Fixed telephone and cable television infrastructures are expensive to create from
scratch and thus hard to replicate if a country is not already endowed with them. In the case of
fiber optic, significant investment is required to install the cables.
Given the above-mentioned constraints, the wireless broadband route appears more promising
for developing nations. There is a larger base of mobile subscriptions compared to fixed
telephone or cable television throughout the world. However, converting mobile networks to
broadband readiness requires investment for spectrum and equipment by operators and the
purchase of new devices by users. Although the deployment costs of mobile broadband are less
than fixed, they are still significant. Other wireless options include fixed wireless such as WiMAX
and satellite. Like mobile broadband, fixed wireless also requires investment in spectrum and
equipment and it may not be able to leverage the existing infrastructure of mobile subscriptions
in terms of towers and backbone networks. Satellite broadband is an option, particularly for
remote locations but is more costly than other solutions for mass deployment.
Conditions vary across the developing world, and each country is endowed with differing levels
of communication networks. Some, such as Costa Rica or Croatia, have a relatively well-
developed fixed telephone network that could support broadband deployment, while others,
such as China and Romania, have widely spread cable TV networks that are able to provide a
measure of facilities-based competition. The challenge is to create incentives so that existing
networks can be used to offer broadband services. In other countries, the challenge is to rollout
broadband-capable networks from scratch. Diversity in broadband infrastructure creates a
higher degree of inter-modal competition. Therefore, countries should consider how they could
leverage existing infrastructures to create greater competition in the broadband market. In
2009, the world was only using a little over one fifth of telephone lines for DSL, around a third of

Broadband is also dependent on demand side aspects such as accessibility to broadband
services, being able to afford broadband and awareness of its benefits. If these demand side
issues are not tackled, a country risks creating a mismatch between supply and demand and will
not be able to fulfill its broadband potential. A country’s level of income impacts the ability to
pay for broadband services while education levels affect awareness. Figure 7 illustrates demand
side indicators for different developing regions in terms of per capita income and years of
schooling.

The next section summarizes the broadband status of developing regions and regional and
national policies for boosting broadband penetration. Section 4 identifies groups of countries
that face specific income, geographic or other limiting conditions. Section 5 provides case
studies of broadband in selected countries and Section 6 outlines best practice principles.


3 Regional developments
This section highlights broadband status in different developing regions.5

3.1        East Asia and the Pacific
The region is home to world broadband leaders such as the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, China
and Japan where super high-speed access is increasingly becoming the norm. However, a huge
broadband divide distinguishes “the mostly high-income countries that are broadband leaders
from the mostly middle- and low-income countries that are broadband challenged.” 6
A number of developing countries in the region have deployed telephone and cable television
network infrastructure but often they are not adequately upgraded for fixed broadband access.
For example, the region’s developed economies such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and
Singapore have been successful in developing broadband access through cable television
network infrastructure. This is not the case in the region’s developing nations. Despite large
cable television markets in some countries such as China, the Philippines and Thailand,
broadband competition from cable television providers is generally low. One reason is that
many networks in developing economies have not been upgraded to support broadband access

via cable modem. Take China; despite having the world’s largest cable television market with
almost 175 million subscribers in 2009, it has relatively few cable modem subscriptions and only
about a quarter of its subscriptions are digital. This is likely to change with China’s new “Triple
Network Project” announced in 2010.7 The project aims to enhance convergence among
telecommunications, Internet and broadcast networks by reducing barriers so that each market
segment can provide any broadband service.
Mobile broadband is beginning to make inroads. Most of the East Asian nations have awarded
mobile broadband spectrum and in a number of the region’s developing nations, mobile
broadband subscriptions exceed fixed. Take Indonesia where in September 2010 there were 6.7
million mobile broadband subscriptions using data cards compared to only 1.9 million fixed
broadband subscriptions.8 Mobile broadband coverage needs to be extended throughout the
region from mainly urban areas to rural zones.
Malaysia is a regional example of a country that has set broadband goals.9 It developed its
Information, Communications, and Multimedia Services (MICMS) 886 strategy in 2006, setting a
number of goals for broadband services. One was to increase broadband penetration to 25
percent of households by the end of 2006 and 75 percent by the end of 2010. But despite
impressive growth, the target for 2006 has not been met. The government is now focusing on
WiMAX, 3G, and FTTH platforms to boost broadband adoption. To that end, the government is
funding a fiber optic network that will connect about 2.2 million urban households by 2012. The
network will be rolled out by Telekom Malaysia under a public private partnership. Under the
partnership, the government will invest MYR 2.4 billion (US$ 700 million) in the project over 10
years, with Telekom Malaysia covering the remaining costs. The total cost of the project is
expected to be MYR 11.3 billion (US$ 3.28 billion).
Connecting the Pacific region with broadband is a major challenge. But it is critical that Pacific
economies gain access to adequate bandwidth essential for supporting broadband
development. Many of the island nations are widely dispersed and backbone networks are
limited. Most countries rely on high-cost, limited capacity satellites and only a few economies
have access to fiber optic submarine cables. The sub-region has been slow to develop mobile
broadband, a consequence of previously limited competition in mobile markets. However, a
number of countries now have competitive mobile markets that should spur deployment of
high-speed wireless networks.10
Vietnam has made impressive strides in boosting international high-speed connectivity and
broadband use. The case of Vietnam is highlighted in a case study (see Section 5.7).

3.2     Europe and Central Asia
The region is relatively well endowed with characteristics to encourage broadband take-up:
significant fixed and cable television networks and relatively high incomes and levels of
education compared to other developing regions. However, it is highly diverse in terms of
broadband potential. This diversity is reflected in the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe (UNECE) four-stage classification of European and Central Asian members’ ICT
development11 (Table 1). The UNECE describes strategies as ranging from accelerating and
deepening usage in the more advanced economies of the region to raising awareness and
establishing community access in those countries in the lowest level.

Despite having deployed fixed infrastructure relatively well, wired broadband growth has been
hampered because consumers are content with using Internet dial-up. One reason is that
telephone charges have historically been low in the region and not all Internet subscribers see
the benefits of switching to more expensive higher speed connections. Mobile broadband has
been launched in most countries in the region although the timing has differed. Most Eastern
and Southern European countries launched mobile broadband before the Central European and
Central Asian nations. This provided Eastern and Southern European countries with a head start
in both deployment and migration to higher speeds. For example, Romania launched 3G in 2006
and had over 2.5 million active mobile broadband subscribers at the end of 2009 accounting for
almost half of all broadband subscriptions; mobile broadband speeds up to 21.6Mb/s are
available in the Romanian market.

A number of the medium and upper medium countries in the region adopted broadband
strategies within the framework of national ICT plans. Most of the country’s plans were
launched in the early to mid-2000s and coincided with significant increases in broadband
penetration. For example Moldova adopted its information society strategy in 2005 that
incorporated a number of tracking indicators to monitor the impact of policies and programs for
improving broadband access.12 Broadband penetration in Moldovan households rose from less
than one percent in 2003 to 17 percent by 2009.13 International bandwidth rose significantly in
the landlocked country following an optical fiber connection to Romania (Box 1).
Box 1. Impact of improved access to international connectivity: The case of Moldova
Until April 2010, Moldova’s international connectivity market was entirely controlled by state -
owned incumbent Moldtelecom. Due to this and because it is a landlocked country, Moldova’s
private firms did not have direct access to the Internet. At that time, the Government reformed
policy and procedures to open the market to competition. By July 2010, three companies,
mobile telephony provider Orange and Internet service providers Starnet and Norma,
successfully applied to construct and operate cross border fiber optic cables and gain direct
access to carriers via Romania.
The benefit of liberalization on availability, prices, and quality was immediate. International
Internet bandwidth available in Moldova went from 13 Gbps in December 2009 to over 50 Gbps
in July 2010. In response, Moldtelecom dropped the prices for wholesale connectivity by a third
over that same time, with some of this drop coming in anticipation of the liberalization in late
2009. And retail subscribers in some parts of the country have already seen their available
bandwidth double while subscription rates have remained the same.
 As a country looking to establish its position as an ICT hub in Eurasia, this move marks the first
step towards connecting Moldova’s fledging IT based services to global markets. Improved
connectivity will allow SMEs to connect with new markets at lower prices and enhance their
competitiveness.

Some of the countries in the region have translated broadband deployment into high bandwidth
and rank among the top countries in the world in average download speeds. This includes
Moldova, a landlocked country. On the other hand, landlocked countries in Central Asia face the
challenge of ensuring that regional broadband backbones keep up with the region’s growing ICT
needs. Within that context, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
undertook a feasibility study in four countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and

Uzbekistan.15 The study recommended closer regional cooperation to spur development of
backbone networks.
Turkey’s government recognizes the importance of a vibrant telecommunications market and is
keen to promote the spread of broadband. For instance, many educational institutions now
have broadband access. The Information Society Strategy for 2006–2010 aims to develop
regulation for effective competition and to expand broadband access. Targets include extending
broadband coverage to 95 percent of the population by 2010 and reducing tariffs to 2 percent of
per capita income. The regulator has also looked at issuing licenses for the operation of
broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) networks in the 2.4GHz and 3.5GHz bands. In June
2009, Turkey had penetration rates of 9 percent for fixed broadband and 4 percent for mobile
broadband. The case of Turkey is highlighted in a case study (see Section 5.6).

3.3     Latin America & the Caribbean
In November 2010, ministers at the Third Ministerial Conference on the Information Society of
Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) adopted eLAC2015, a regional roadmap for the
information society. eLAC2015 considers broadband pivotal noting:
          “For the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the universalization of
          broadband access in the twenty-first century is as important for growth and
          equality as were electric power and road infrastructures in the twentieth
          century. Broadband is an essential service for the economic and social
          development of the countries of the region, and it is indispensable for progress,
          equality and democracy. That is why the strategic goal is for broadband
          Internet access to be available to all of the citizens of Latin America and the
                      16
          Caribbean.”
Six goals were highlighted for universal broadband access in the region:
Table 2. eLAC2015 universal broadband access goals
Goal 1:       Increase direct investment in broadband connectivity to make it available in all
              public establishments.
Goal 2:       Advance towards universal availability of affordably priced broadband connectivity
              in homes, enterprises and public access centres to ensure that, by 2015, at least
              50% of the Latin American and Caribbean population have access to multiple
              convergent interactive and interoperable services.
Goal 3:       Coordinate efforts to bring down the costs of international links by means of a
              larger and more efficient regional and subregional broadband infrastructure, the
              inclusion of (at least) the necessary ducts for fibre-optic cables in regional
              infrastructure projects; the creation of Internet exchange points; the promotion of
              innovation and local content production; and the attraction of contents suppliers

               and distributors.
Goal 4:        Collaborate and coordinate with all regional stakeholders including academia and
               business, the technical community and organizations working in the field, such as
               the Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry (LACNIC) and the
               Internet Society (ISOC), to ensure that Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is broadly
               deployed in the region by 2015; and implement, as soon as possible, national plans
               to make government public services portals in Latin America and the Caribbean
               accessible over IPv6 and to make public sector networks native IPv6 capable.
Goal 5:        Harmonize indicators which provide an overview of the situation of broadband in
               the region, in terms of both penetration and uses of applications, in accordance
               with international standards.
Goal 6:        Promote ICT access and use by persons with disabilities, with emphasis on the
               development of applications that take into account standards and criteria on
               inclusion and accessibility. In this connection, promote compliance by all
               government web portals with the web accessibility standards established by the
               World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

LAC has a relatively high number of fixed telephone lines and cable television subscribers
compared to other regions. Cable broadband has been particularly successful with over half of
the subscribers enjoying a broadband subscription. The number of telephone lines being used
for broadband using DSL is relatively low, a consequence of the high costs of entering the fixed
telephone market and the lack of effective local loop unbundling policies in the region.
Mobile broadband development has lagged compared to other regions. One factor has been
delays in the award of spectrum used specifically for 3G services. However, this has been
mitigated somewhat by widespread policies throughout the region allowing operators to use
their existing 850/900 MHz spectrum, originally allocated for voice, for high-speed mobile data
services. These frequencies also support wider coverage with fewer base stations so that
investment costs are lower and a larger number of people can gain access.17
On the demand side, LAC fares favorably compared to other developing regions. Education
levels are relatively high and the existence of common languages throughout many countries—
Spanish in Latin America and English in much of the Caribbean—results in a high level of
content, spurring demand. Despite relatively high per capita income for a developing region,
incomes are highly skewed in the region and affordability remains an issue. For example over
half of Mexican households reported that they did not have Internet access in 2009 because
they could not afford it.18
Chile was the first Latin American country to announce a national broadband strategy. The
strategy identified ICT as a priority for economic development. Chile has also planned and

implemented ICT policies from both the supply and demand sides. The demand-side strategy
has included programs for e-literacy, e-government, and ICT diffusion. For example, almost all
taxes are filed electronically, and government e-procurement more than doubled the volume of
transactions processed between 2005 and 2008. The government has also promoted broadband
use by municipalities. By 2008, almost all municipalities had Internet access, and 80 percent had
websites. In June 2009, Chile’s fixed broadband penetration was 10 percent, while mobile
broadband penetration was 2 percent. In order to reach the objectives of a digital Chile, the
government’s broadband goal is to double broadband connections and complete nationwide
coverage by 2012.
Brazil is one of the few countries in the region with a specific broadband plan. St. Kitts and Nevis
has the highest broadband penetration in the region. The cases of Brazil and St. Kitts and Nevis
are highlighted in case studies (see Sections 5.1 and 5.4).

3.4    Middle East and North Africa
The region is relatively well endowed with fixed line telephony for a developing region and most
fixed broadband is primarily via ADSL. Nonetheless, prospects for fixed broadband are
constrained. Few alternative operators have deployed copper line infrastructure, local loop
unbundling, for the most part, is not available across the region, the development of inter-
modal competition through cable television is inhibited by the popularity of satellite television,
and most new entrants have adopted wireless strategies.
Mobile broadband, on the other hand, has had greater success. Many but not all of the
countries have awarded spectrum for mobile broadband services. Morocco was one of the first
countries to award 3G spectrum in the region. It did so through a beauty contest, which lowered
spectrum costs for operators. Some of the spectrum was awarded to a new operator, shaking up
the existing duopoly and triggering intense competition in the mobile broadband market (Box
2). As a result, mobile broadband subscriptions in Morocco have surpassed fixed connections.
The country has adopted the Maroc Numerique 2013 strategy with targets providing broadband
to all schools and one third of households by 2013.19 Morocco is highlighted in a case study (see
Section 5.3).
A report analyzing the main factors affecting broadband demand in many of the countries in the
region identified challenges hindering broadband deployment and suggested recommendations
to overcome them (Table 3).20 The report’s overarching conclusion was the requirement for
convergence—through bundled offers and transition to IP-based networks—would trigger mass
broadband adoption.

                                                   and TV content, constitute a key enabler for
                                                   price reduction and economies of scale for
                                                   service providers.
2. Regional and international connectivity to The improvement of regional connectivity
the Internet is both complex (no regional and peering, as well as the emergence of
backbones) and costly in many countries.      powerful regional service providers capable of
                                              negotiating better interconnection prices with
                                              the main Internet backbones, would drastically
                                              reduce underlying costs.
3. Lack of a service culture and insufficient      The promotion of a service culture and
quality of telephony copper (especially for DSL    transparency as regards copper quality are

                                                   spectrum required is ensured by governments
                                                   and regulatory bodies.

Both factors are lacking in the region.

                                                 broadband.
6. In the region, the scope of Universal Access    An extended scope for Universal Access,
is confined to basic, conventional ICT services,   which includes broadband, should be clearly

Most countries in the region share a common language facilitating collaboration on developing
digital Arab content to improve demand for broadband.21 The Jordanian Minister of Information
and Communications Technology has outlined the importance of the content industry as a main
driver of Internet penetration, especially as it relates to local and Arabic content. The digital
content industry in Jordan received a boost in 2009, when chipmaker Intel announced an
investment in two digital content companies: Jeeran and ShooFeeTV.22 The funding will be used
to help both companies pursue regional growth as well as extend their product offerings. Jeeran
(http://www.jeeran.com/) is the largest user-generated content site in the Arab world, reaching
one million members and seven million unique visitors per month. ShooFeeTV
(http://www.shoofeetv.com) provides online information for more than 120 Arab satellite
channel including listings, programming information, celebrity news, pictures and video clips.

3.5       South Asia
South Asia faces severe supply and demand side constraints in promoting broadband access.
Fixed infrastructure is limited. Nonetheless in absolute terms there is a significant base of fixed
telephone lines and cable subscribers. But the number of telephone lines and cable television
connections for broadband services is relatively low. Some countries have yet to award mobile
broadband spectrum that would trigger inter-modal mobile broadband competition. On the
demand side, the region is the second poorest developing region after Sub-Saharan Africa and
levels of education are relatively low.
India was the first country in the region to adopt a broadband policy in 2004.23 However, it has
not achieved the goals set. The country published a consultative document24 on a new
broadband policy and in December 2010, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India
issued broadband recommendations.25 A key strategy is to develop an open access national fiber
optic backbone network connecting all localities with more than 500 inhabitants by 2013.
Pakistan published a broadband policy in 2004.26 But broadband deployment has not lived up to
expectations — the number of broadband subscribers in 2007 was only half of the level targeted

broadband take-up, the Universal Service Fund is being used to subsidize the deployment of
broadband throughout the country.27
Other South Asian nations have also adopted or are developing broadband plans.28 But
programs that would address demand side affordability issues are limited (Table 4).

3.6        Sub-Saharan Africa
The Sub-Saharan Africa region faces tremendous barriers in broadening broadband. It starts
from a very low base, with limited fixed telephone networks and practically no cable television
networks on the supply side, coupled with demand side bottlenecks with the lowest per capita
income and years of schooling of all developing regions.
Over the past decade, a large amount of private investment, driven by sector liberalization and
competition and major advances in cellular technology, has brought mobile services within the
reach of the majority of Africa’s population. Increasing competition is making services more
affordable and putting pressure on operating margins. Operators are responding by expanding
their networks beyond towns and cities into rural areas, and tailoring services to the needs of
the lower-income tiers of the population.
Sub-Saharan Africa, however, has been largely left behind in the shift to broadband. Increasing
the availability and affordability of broadband services is thus high on the agenda for policy
makers. Conducive policy environments, investment in network infrastructure, access to radio
spectrum, and availability of affordable international bandwidth will all play key roles in the
delivery of low-cost broadband to the region.
The region’s focus, thus far, on mobile networks to address an immediate service need has left
backbone networks underdeveloped. This has created a major bottleneck in the rollout of high-
bandwidth services and in the upgrading of cellular networks to provide value-added services.29
Overcoming this infrastructure hurdle is an important element in shaping the structure and
policy framework of the telecommunications services sector. Without it, broadband will remain
expensive and limited to businesses and high-income customers.
The backbone deficit has been acutely felt in international bandwidth. Due to limited content
and a shortage of national Internet exchanges, a significant amount of Internet traffic is routed
abroad from Sub-Saharan Africa. A lack of international high-speed fiber optic capacity has
meant that even where countries have been able to deploy broadband last mile infrastructure,
performance is affected by slow international connectivity. Where connectivity exists, cable
theft continues to be a major problem for reliability.
Until 2009, SAT3/SAFE was the only major regional submarine optic cable serving the content.
Other countries had to use more costly and slower satellite links. This has changed dramatically
since the arrival of several new undersea cable systems (i.e., TEAMS, SEACOM, EASSy) including
the first serving the region’s east coast (i.e., TEAMS). Total capacity rose by a factor of 8.5 in
2009 and additional planned cables are expected to increase undersea capacity to over 20 Tb/s
by 2012.30
International connectivity is just part of the supply chain. Countries in the African region also
need to ensure that the bandwidth gets disbursed throughout the country and, in the case of
the region’s landlocked countries that national backbones are in place to connect to neighboring
countries. This will require public private partnerships to generate the investment needed and
to ensure an effective and open access operating arrangement. The Kenyan government has
supported open access to backbone infrastructure in various ways. It encouraged operators to

participate in the TEAMS undersea cable and has also pursued public private partnerships for
national backbone construction. It is now contemplating the same for the construction of
broadband wireless networks using LTE technology. See the Kenya case study in Section 5.2.
At the local access level, mobile broadband holds great promise. However outside of a few
countries, the region has yet to exploit this on a significant scale. Around two dozen Sub-
Saharan African countries had commercially deployed 3G networks at the end of 2010 with
around nine million subscriptions.
Few African countries have elaborated a specific broadband policy. If mentioned at all,
broadband is touched upon in overall sector strategies. One exception is South Africa. The
Broadband Policy for South Africa prepared by the Department of Communications was
published on 13 July 2010.31 Defining broadband as speeds of at least 256 kbps, the government
has identified two targets for 2019: all inhabitants to be within two kilometers of a public
broadband access point and a household broadband penetration of 15%.
Box 2. The Third Man: Encouraging disruption in broadband markets
Growth in some of the more successful developed economy broadband markets has been
triggered by the entry of brand new disruptive operators. These new service providers tend to
be the third player entering the market, shaking up duopolies of DSL and cable broadband
operators or a dominant incumbent and a major wireless operator. This is the case in the
developed East Asian economies of the Republic of Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, China where
new operators entered the broadband market with innovative business plans and models,
unsettling the market and triggering a beneficial stimulus to broadband growth.
           Hanaro entered the market in 1999 as a facilities-based telephone operator in
            competition with the incumbent Korea Telecom. Soon after entry, Hanaro began
            offering broadband ADSL services resulting in intensive competition, a major factor in
            the Republic of Korea’s rise as a top ranked broadband country. Hanaro had captured
            almost a quarter of the broadband market at the end of 2009.

           SOFTBANK entered the Japanese broadband market in 2001 by leasing unbundled local
            loop lines from the incumbent telephone operators and in 2004, it obtained a facilities
            license and began deploying its own infrastructure. It acquired Japan’s third largest
            mobile operator in 2006 allowing SOFTBANK to enter the mobile broadband market.
            Marketing its service as Yahoo!BB, SOFTBANK had a 14 percent share of the broadband
            market in 2009 and over a third of its subscribers were getting speeds of 50 Mbps.
            According to the company: “It is not an exaggeration to say that the fixed-line
            broadband service in Japan was created by the SOFTBANK Group.”32

           Hong Kong Broadband Network (HKBN) entered the market in 2000 after it was
            awarded a fixed wireless license. The city’s compact high-rise building environment
            shaped HKBN’s technological strategy of installing in-building wiring; communications
            between buildings and HKBN’s routers and switches were carried out using wireless
            transmission through rooftop antennas. HKBN was able to penetrate the market quickly

        and shook up the quasi-duopoly between the incumbent fixed line operator and cable
        television company for broadband provision. HKBN later acquired a fixed line license
        and once again is shaking up the market by deploying fiber optic to the home. It had a
        20 percent share of the fixed broadband market by 2009.
The process of disruption has also occurred in some European markets where alternative
operators initially entered using the infrastructure of incumbent operators and then having
established a foothold, began investing in their own infrastructure. This is the case in France and
Italy:
       Free started as dial-up operator in France in 1999 and began providing broadband
        services in 2002 using ADSL over France Telecom’s Unbundled Local Loop (ULL). In 2006,
        it began rolling out its own FTTH network and intends to cover four million homes by
        2012, representing an investment of about €1 billion. Free has been providing triple play
        services since December 2003. Its IPTV service offers over 300 channels and Free’s
        broadband speeds range between 22-28 Mbps. In 2009, it was awarded the country’s
        fourth 3G license. Free had 23% of the French fixed broadband market in 2009.

       In Italy, FASTWEB started by deploying a fiber optic network in Milan. In 2001 it began
        providing triple-play services using DSL over Telecom Italia’s infrastructure. The
        company has partnered with other operators in a “Fiber for Italy” project where they
        will pool resources to provide FTTH in Italy’s 15 largest cities, an investment expected to
        cost €2.5 billion. Meanwhile, FASTWEB has also been building its own FTTH network
        that passes nearly two million homes, offering speeds of up to 100 Mbps. FASTWEB had
        13% of the fixed broadband market at the end of 2009.
Market disruptive operators are spreading to emerging and developing economies:
       Starnet entered the Moldovan market in 2003 providing ADSL over the incumbent’s
        telephone network. In 2006, Starnet began providing voice over broadband and also
        started the construction of its fiber optic network. In 2009, IPTV was added to its
        portfolio and by end of the year Starnet had captured 16% of the fixed broadband
        market.

       In Morocco, Wana was awarded wireless broadband spectrum in 2006. A company
        owned by national investors, it launched services in 2007 using high-speed EV-DO
        technology. This resulted in intense competition with the existing mobile operators and
        led to rapid adoption of 3G services that soon passed fixed broadband subscriptions. By
        the end of 2010, there were 1.4 million 3G subscribers in Morocco, almost three times
        the number of fixed broadband connections. Wana had 41% of the mobile broadband
        market.
The lesson for developing countries is that while it is critical to open broadband markets to
competition, it is just as important to introduce brand new operators. Setting aside spectrum for
a new operator and lowering other market entry barriers, particularly those relating to the
ability to provide convergent services, can encourage this.

4 Countries in special circumstances
In addition to regional groups, countries are also classified by particular economic, geographic
and political situations. This section identifies several groupings relevant to the international
development community and how the specific characteristics of that group can affect
broadband development.

4.1     Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
The UN created the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) category in 1971 to recognize the
existence of a group of countries with severe poverty and weak economic, institutional and
human resources.33 This group consists of 49 countries with a combined population of 815
million in 2008 (Figure 8). Most are in Africa, almost a third are in Asia and the Pacific and one is
in Latin America. Around half are either small islands states or landlocked.
 The LDCs face tremendous supply and demand side challenges in deploying broadband
networks. The existing level of fixed infrastructure is low as are demand side indicators such as
incomes and educational levels. The capacity for developing effective broadband strategies and
policies is also limited due to institutional weaknesses and insufficient human resources in
ministries and regulators.
Figure 8. LDCs

New technologies such as broadband can help LDCs overcome development challenges and can
move LDC economies away from their dependence on primary commodities and low-skill
manufacturing.34 There is some urgency to deploy broadband networks in order to mitigate
LDCs falling further behind technologically and becoming even more marginalized in the world
economy.35 The development of international and national backbones is a main priority that will

require innovative public private partnerships. Wireless broadband holds great promise given
the significant increase in mobile networks in the LDCs and the lower costs of deploying mobile
broadband. In order to achieve this, LDCs will need to introduce greater competition and
allocate spectrum for wireless broadband services.

4.2        Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs)
Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs),36 predominantly located in Sub-Saharan Africa and
Asia, “face severe challenges to growth and development due to a wide range of factors,
including: a poor physical infrastructure, weak institutional and productive capacities, small
domestic markets, remoteness from world markets, and a high vulnerability to external
shocks.”37 There are 31 LLDCs with a total population of 370 million in 2008 (Figure 9).
Figure 9. LLDCs




Source: UN-OHRLLS.
One of the main barriers LLDCs face is distance from key ports causing high transaction costs
and reducing international competitiveness. Broadband can help to overcome these limitations,
since it is not distance sensitive. However, geographical conditions pose a supply side challenge
for LLDCs in terms of global connectivity through high-speed fiber networks.
“Virtual coastlines” can be created for LLDCs through the connection of national backbones to
countries directly linked to undersea cables. This connectivity can then be brought to “virtual
landing stations” in the LLDC where all ISPs gain cost-based access to international bandwidth.
Rwanda has created a virtual landing station where optic fiber cables from undersea landing
stations in Kenya and Tanzania (Rwanda’s “virtual coastline”) are terminated.38
Access to high-speed international bandwidth will require regional cooperation and public
private partnerships to spur investment in national backbones and ensure their onward
connectivity to neighboring countries with undersea fiber optic cable. According to an ESCAP
study on Central Asia countries must cooperate to expedite and ensure effective regional

4.3        Small Island Developing States (SIDS)
The United Nations has recognized the particular problems of Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) since 1994.40 According to UNCTAD, SIDS face “… a greater risk of marginalization from
the global economy than many other developing countries…” due to their small size,
remoteness and vulnerability to external shocks.41 They are also susceptible to natural disasters
such as tsunamis and damaging environmental changes such as sea level rise. There are 38 UN
Members classified as SIDS with a population of 55 million in 2008 (Figure 10). Over one quarter
are also LDCs.

Broadband connectivity can help overcome these challenges in several ways such as economic
diversification through establishment of IT-enabled industries, creating a virtual closeness to the
rest of the world and real-time weather modeling and monitoring.
The SIDS are geographically diverse with different broadband supply and demand challenges. On
the demand side, many SIDS have relatively small populations that may deter investment.
However, the small size makes it easier and cheaper to quickly deploy networks with a high
degree of coverage and a growing number of SIDS are achieving universal mobile service.42 On
the supply side, most of the Caribbean SIDS are located in a condensed area, crisscrossed by a
number undersea fiber optic cable networks. Pacific SIDS tend to be more spread out. Since
there are far fewer options for access to undersea fiber optic cables, most Pacific SIDS are
dependent on more expensive satellite solutions. Some Pacific SIDS such as Fiji are served by
undersea cables and therefore are in a position of being a potential fiber hub to neighbors.43
Most of the Caribbean SIDS introduced competition in telecommunications networks a number
of years ago whereas the Pacific ones have done so only recently. Mobile broadband has yet to

have a significant impact in most SIDS to date due to a lack of spectrum allocation and uncertain
demand.
The Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) was established as a regional
regulator for countries in that sub-region. ECTEL overcomes human resource limitations of each
country staffing their own full-fledged regulatory institution and harmonizes sub-regional
policies. ECTEL recently moved to make high-speed Internet more accessible by designating the
700 MHz Band for broadband wireless services such as WiMAX.44
Saint Kitts and Nevis, a Caribbean SIDS, is profiled in a broadband country case study (see
Section 5.4).

4.4     Post-conflict countries
Post-conflict countries refer to nations where war and civil strife leads to the destruction of
institutions and economic facilities. There is no official definition of a post-conflict economy.
They are often locations where civil conflicts have necessitated the intervention of
peacekeeping troops.45 ICTs can play in beneficial role in helping to reconstruct these countries
by attracting foreign investment, generating employment, enhancing education prospects and
creating linkages to the global economy.46 Given the often poor or destroyed
telecommunication infrastructure, post-conflict countries can leapfrog to state-of-the-art next
generation networks. However, this will require a liberalized telecommunication regime that
encourages convergence and investment in Internet Protocol networks.
In Afghanistan years of civil strife destroyed much of the economy, shutting down most
government institutions including schools. A NATO sponsored project has installed broadband
access in universities using satellite technology.47 This has overcome shortages of learning
materials and teachers since professors and students can download teaching information and
use on-line learning tools. In East Timor, the Australian government has been assisting with the
development of the new country’s media sector by providing journalists with the ability to
upload and research news through the establishment of broadband centers.48
The case of Sri Lanka, a country emerging from a decades long civil conflict, is highlighted in a
broadband study (see Section 5.5).

5.2    Kenya: Build it and they will come
The study considers the case of broadband in Kenya and the manner in which the country has
tackled its capacity challenges. Kenya has a natural geographic advantage being strategically
positioned on the East Coast of Africa. Its government-led “build it and they will come”
approach to broadband development has leveraged the country’s geographic location and
played a major role in dramatically increasing fiber optic backbone capacity. Many of Kenya’s
milestones have been realized in less than five years. Connections were made to three fiber
optic submarine cables by the end of 2010 changing the face of the broadband market. The
country has gone from relying on satellite for international capacity, to having access to almost
four terabits over fiber.
Although the landing of the cables is merely a first step, it has already resulted in an 80 percent
decrease in wholesale bandwidth costs (although reliability is sometimes a problem). Lower
prices and greater availability are expected to increase access to the Internet as well as to
promote the continued spread of sophisticated mobile applications and services and
consequently improve opportunities for the creation of and access to information and
knowledge. Affordable broadband is expected to increase Kenya’s competitiveness, particularly
in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry, and to encourage entrepreneurship and
innovation.
With an estimated fixed and mobile broadband penetration rate of 2 subscriptions per 100
people in 2010, Kenya still has significant progress to make with respect to broadband uptake.
Stimulating demand and usage by citizens and the public and private sector remains a challenge.
Kenya, largely through the government, has taken an innovative and pro-active approach to
putting the user at the center and addressing the other elements of the broadband ecosystem,
such as education, literacy, applications and content. This has been done through progressive
regulation, the promotion of polices relating to ICT in education, the subsidization of relevant
content and application projects, and facilitating creative Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).
Much of Kenya’s success seems attributed to four important factors: (1) A clear national
approach of how broadband fits into its Vision 2030 development goals; (2) Strong leadership
and direction; (3) A credible regulatory, policy and institutional framework, and (4) Leveraging
the strength of the public and private sectors through PPPs.
The initiatives discussed in the study possess elements of these traits across all aspects of the
broadband ecosystem. The Kenyan experience is inspiring, although there have been a few
hiccups in terms of the pace of implementation and overlaps in the policy and institutional
framework. These are discussed in the study to provide a proper context for the Kenyan
broadband story and to enable countries to learn from its experiences.

5.4    Saint Kitts and Nevis: Strength in Depth
The study focuses on the broadband Internet sector in St. Kitts and Nevis, specifically the
approach the island has taken in developing the sector, to the extent that at the end of 2010
fixed broadband subscription rates stood at almost 30 percent, the highest rate among all
independent countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region. This achievement in
broadband can be attributed in part to the small physical size of St. Kitts and Nevis that has
enabled faster rollout of the physical infrastructure, facilitated more effective marketing, and
promoted maximum impact for Government-led information and communication technology
policy initiatives. Among the Caribbean islands, however, ‘smallness’ is certainly not unique.
The study therefore explores other factors that may have contributed to this achievement.
The phrase “strength in depth” is borrowed from the world of soccer, the most popular sport on
the island. The phrase is used to underscore the point that the strength of the island’s
achievement in the broadband sector, lies in its deep commitment to nurturing the foundational
components of the broadband ecosystem. Promotion of basic education and digital literacy,
building technology awareness, facilitating access to basic technologies, and encouragement of
a healthy competitive telecommunications environment are but a few examples of where the
country has developed its core strengths.
Key strengths of the St. Kitts and Nevis broadband ecosystem identified in the study can be
grouped under one of the following areas:
(a) Competitive environment – through efficient legislation and regulation;
(b) Regional coordination – particularly for design of effective policy frameworks;
(c) Government as facilitator – strong leadership in the ICT sector;
(d) Government as leader – promoting service demand through content provision;
(e) Universal service – for broadening access to technologies; and
(f) Public private partnerships - to catalyze and strengthen broadband initiatives.
The implementation of a second submarine fiber network in 2006 offering up to 1.3 terabits, has
introduced competition in the international backbone capacity that should further serve to
enhance the broadband sector. However, as in any ecosystem, sustainability and growth can be
threatened by internal weaknesses. Some of these weaknesses have served as lessons learnt
and adjusted to at the national level; others continue to pose a challenge to the islands. Cost
prohibitive services, an unstable power supply, quality of service issues, and deficiencies in the
availability of local content and applications that create network value for citizens, are some of
the challenges for future growth of the broadband sector in St. Kitts and Nevis.
In general, the two islands have been successful in promoting uptake of broadband Internet
through a number of measured approaches; approaches that can be of relevance to discussions
on broadband strategies pertaining to developing countries, based upon identified strengths
and weaknesses within this study.

5.5    Sri Lanka: Glass half full or half empty?
Sri Lanka, an island nation located in the Indian Ocean just south of India, has lately experienced
an explosion in the availability and use of mobile broadband services.
Key trends in the Sri Lankan ecosystem include:
        Innovative business models for making services accessible to all: The increase in
        mobile broadband rides on the wave of extremely high mobile voice growth. Intense
        competition forced operators to innovate in such a way as to be able to profitably serve
        even the poorest consumers. Network costs were reduced drastically by sharing passive
        and active infrastructure and outsourcing key parts of the operation. Distribution costs
        were minimized through e-reloads, eliminating the need to print and distribute top-up
        cards for pre-paid users. Small top-up values attracted consumers with low and variable
        incomes to the market. This “budget telecom model” enabled operators to make
        positive margins even though ARPU was low. This model is now being applied to mobile
        broadband in Sri Lanka. By enabling pre-paid, very low value re-charge and promotional
        discounts for students, the youth have been brought into the mobile broadband market.
        These early adopters have spread interest in mobile broadband.
        3G spectrum availability: 3G frequency was made available as far back as 2003 for
        testing and in 2005 commercial 3G services were launched. Early access to spectrum
        enabled operators to gain experience and constantly innovate to stay competitive. As a
        result, Sri Lanka has fastest mobile broadband technologies in the region.
        Government’s e-development agenda motivating investment: e-Sri Lanka is a cross-
        sector ICT-enabled development program for the whole country. A series of
        comprehensive supply and demand side projects (for example, setting up a network of
        nearly 500 rural telecenters, plans for a least-cost subsidy scheme to build and operate a
        fiber backbone in rural areas and a comprehensive e-government program) helped
        create awareness about broadband in the country. Operators were motivated to invest
        in the network infrastructure in light of upcoming demand.
        The ethnic conflict and impact on demand for broadband: Since the early 1980s, Sri
        Lanka was plagued by a violent ethnic conflict. One of the negative results was that it
        forced a large portion of the minority Tamil population to leave Sri Lanka and seek
        refuge in other countries. This large migrant population generated high demand for
        Internet services in order to communicate with relatives remaining in Sri Lanka.
        Demand for Internet telephony was unusually high in conflict zones with Internet cafes
        catering to this demand for VoIP.

        International connectivity hampering quality: The downside of budget
        telecommunications models is that price is sometimes sacrificed for quality. Compared
        with the developed world, Sri Lankan consumers get less broadband value for the
        money they spend. Part of the reason is advertising broadband speeds that are
        theoretically possible, but not in reality. Another bottleneck is international
        connectivity. A significant portion of Internet traffic is routed outside of the country and
        wholesale international connectivity prices are relatively high making Internet capacity a
        sought after resource.

6 Crafting a broadband development strategy for a particular
  country environment49
6.1      Broadband as an ecosystem
Across the developing world, countries are looking to increase access to and use of broadband.
It is useful to conceptualize broadband as an ecosystem consisting of infrastructure networks,
the services that the networks carry, the applications and content delivered over the networks,
and the users that utilize applications and content (Figure 11):
        Infrastructure-Refers to the networks that support high-speed data communication
         (e.g., telephone networks, broadcast networks, computer networks using copper wires,
         coaxial cable, fiber optic cable and other transmission media)
        Services-Refers to the services these networks provide (e.g., broadband access to the
         Internet)
        Applications and Content-Refers to the programs and information provided by services
         (e.g., Voice over Broadband (e.g., Skype), social media (e.g., Facebook), video (e.g.,
         YouTube), search engines (e.g., Google), etc.)
        Users-Refers to citizens and businesses who respond to the affordability of the services
         and relevance of the applications and content.
The broadband ecosystem is a virtuous circle with each component leveraging on another.
Investments and user demand expand the reach of high-speed networks. These networks
increase the availability of high-quality services to both users and application providers. Users
then grow in number and sophistication, demanding and driving greater investments in
networks.
Viewing broadband as an ecosystem helps define the likely roles that governments will need to
play in using broadband as a tool in ICT for development (ICT4D). Broadband is more than the
supply of access to networks and services, and thus represents a significant shift away from the
models used with telephones. To foster broadband markets, governments will have to move
beyond their traditional “push” role focused on supply-side growth in ICT infrastructure and
development of the ICT sector. They also need to stimulate demand for broadband.

Defining broadband to include both the supply and demand sides of the market leads to a
rethinking of approaches to spur broadband access and use. It is critical to create an enabling
environment for supply-side growth in terms of access to networks and services—but is also
important to facilitate demand for and adoption of broadband. There are two kinds of blockage
that inhibit the natural development of broadband deployment and use. On the supply side,
these relate to blockages at the various levels of infrastructure that are necessary for a
broadband network (Figure 12).

Box 3. Broadband gap: Stages of broadband development
Broadband markets pass through three stages—promotion when the market is incipient,
oversight as competition begins to drive growth, and universalization as the market matures.
Most countries are in the early stage (household broadband penetration less than 10%, Figure
4). Around 40 economies are in the mass-market stage (penetration ≥ 10% and less than 50%)
and three dozen are in the universalization stage (penetration > 50%).
Figure Box 3 . Stages of broadband development

Broadband development strategies are implemented using policies, regulations, and programs.
The policies and regulatory tools support the operation of a competitive, efficient market and
seek to expand access to all. They also include demand-side policies and programs. Many of
these measures would have little or no implications for government budgets. Some could be
funded through contributions from the broadband industry, and others would be self-sustaining
from service fees (as with e-government programs) or cost savings (as with infrastructure
sharing).
Descriptions and examples of the policies and programs are provided in Table 5. This is next
related to a country’s geographic placement with reference to examples from different regions
(Table 6).

Table 5. Policies and programs for promoting broadband in developing countries
                                         INFRASTRUCTURE
Policy / Program:                        Promote investment and market entry
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: All levels; Demand: Access, affordability
Description:                             The first step of broadband policy implementation is to foster competition with minimal market entry barriers.
                                         Lowering or removing entry barriers into broadband markets drives competition. A key consideration is
                                         technological neutrality. The rapid development and diffusion of broadband is largely due to competition
                                         between technologies such as DSL, cable modem, fiber optics, and wireless. To enjoy the full benefits of such
                                         competition, governments should not influence the technological choices of providers without good reason.
Example:                                 The Thai government considers that international connectivity could be a bottleneck and for that reason issues
                                         automatic licenses for international gateway services.50

Description:                             Coordination among countries can impact all levels of the broadband supply chain by lowering costs through
                                         common technical standards and facilitating the development of international, regional and national backbones.
                                         There already exists a high-level of global and regional cooperation in areas such as equipment standards and
                                         frequency coordination. Regional harmonization in broadband regulatory approaches can help to reduce
                                         uncertainty and attract investment.
Example:                                 The Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) is a regulatory body for its five member states. It
                                         coordinates policy in a number of areas including aspects related to broadband such as frequencies for
                                         broadband wireless access, wholesale access to networks and quality of service.51
Policy / Program:                        Reduce administrative burdens and provide incentives for R&D, pilots, and network rollout
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: All levels; Demand: Access, Affordability
Description:                             High license fees, taxes and burdensome administrative processes can discourage investment in the broadband
                                         sector, especially when the market is nascent and the returns uncertain. Measures such as providing investors

                                        with tax benefits and low-interest, long-term loans can promote investment in network development. Likewise
                                        allowing operators to use broadband spectrum for pilots prior to formal allocation provides an opportunity to
                                        test feasibility of different frequencies and gain valuable experience.
Example:                                In order to encourage broadband connectivity India removed licensing requirements for use of Wi-Fi and
                                        WiMAX in the 2.4 GHz-2.4835 GHz band. 52
Policy / Program:                       Allocate and assign spectrum
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: Domestic backbone, local access; Demand: Access
Description:                            Allocating the appropriate spectrum can significantly alter the business case and usefulness of wireless
                                        broadband. Furthermore, governments should manage their radio spectrum appropriately to reduce entry
                                        barriers, promote competition, and enable the introduction of innovative technologies. An important
                                        consideration for spectrum policy is which frequencies should be allocated for broadband services and how. The
                                        critical choice is whether countries want to maximize their up-front earnings through spectrum sales but reduce
                                        potential new market entrants. The move toward digital television is providing an opportunity to use the parts
                                        of the spectrum freed by the move for wireless broadband services. Given the rapid development of wireless
                                        broadband technologies, governments should allow providers to obtain new frequencies by expanding available
                                        frequency bands. They should implement management policies that are based on market principles, encourage
                                        efficient use, and shift spectrum from low-value uses to services such as broadband. Spectrum managers should
                                        also keep in mind the effect of their spectrum allocations on business economics: higher bands make mobile
                                        communication more difficult and more expensive. In addition, spectrum managers should look toward newer
                                        management models—such as the spectrum-as commons approach that has been a key factor in the success of
                                        Wi-Fi networking—to encourage spectrum sharing and innovation. Spectrum should be assigned on a
                                        technology- and service-neutral basis. This approach is critical to enabling all the different types of applications
                                        of broadband services: voice, video, and data can all be provided by wireless broadband technologies. If
                                        spectrum authorizations limit what applications can be provided, they will diminish the utility of the broadband
                                        service and undermine the business case for the service provider. Finally operators should be allowed to use
                                        their existing spectrum for mobile broadband services.
Example:                                Widespread policies throughout Latin America allow operators to use their existing 850/900 MHz spectrum,
                                        originally allocated for voice, to be used for high-speed mobile data services. These frequencies also support

Policy / Program:                      Infrastructure sharing
Supply & Demand impacts:               Supply: International connectivity, domestic backbone, local access; Demand: Access, Affordability
Description:                           Civil works (for example, trenches, ducts, and cables) are the biggest fixed and sunk cost in broadband network
                                       construction in both the access and the backbone segments of fiber-optic networks. They also play a major role
                                       in increasing the cost of network deployment for new service providers as well as incumbents. The costs of
                                       backbone network construction can be cut by establishing legal grounds for open access to the passive
                                       infrastructure (conduits, ducts, and poles) of other services (roads, railways, and power supply facilities). This
                                       approach can significantly lower the cost of rolling out telecommunications networks, because adding
                                       communications equipment (such as cables) to other infrastructure projects is relatively cheap. Similarly, when
                                       contractors construct other types of new infrastructure, the government can require them to build passive
                                       infrastructure that communications service providers can access on a nondiscriminatory basis. Another option is
                                       to require the installation of basic infrastructure, such as ducts, when homes and offices are constructed or
                                       renovated. Facilities should be granted on an impartial basis to all providers. Finally, governments can permit or
                                       facilitate joint construction of backbone and subscriber networks among providers.
Example:                               In Thailand, operators signed a Memorandum of Understanding on infrastructure and network sharing in
                                       November 2010 in support of the country’s National Broadband Policy.54 According to the government, the MoU
                                       will lead to more efficient use of networks.
Policy / Program:                      Internet exchange
Supply & Demand impacts:               Supply: International connectivity; Demand: Affordability
Description:                           There are many advantages to local routing of Internet traffic via a common exchange point:
                                       • Substantial cost-savings are made by eliminating the need to put all traffic through the more expensive long-
                                       distance links to the rest of the world.
                                       • More bandwidth becomes available for local users because of the lower costs of local capacity.
                                       • Local links are often up to 10 times faster because of the reduced latency in traffic, which makes fewer hops to
                                       get to its destination.

                                      • New local content providers and services, which rely on high-speed low-cost connections, become available,
                                      further benefiting from the broader user-base available via the IXP.
                                      • More choices for Internet providers become available on which to send upstream traffic to the rest of the
                                      Internet—contributing to a smoother and more competitive wholesale transit market.
Example:                              The case of Mongolia demonstrates that a combination of ISP cooperation and tacit support from governmental
                                      authorities can lead to the rapid and successful establishment of an IXP in a developing country. In January
                                      2001, a group of leading Mongolian network operators met in Ulaanbaatar to explore the creation of a national
                                      IXP. At the time, all Mongolian ISPs were interconnected via providers in the United States or Hong Kong.
                                      Satellite latencies amounted to a minimum of 650 milliseconds (over half a second) for each packet of data in
                                      each direction. Costs were high and very few Mongolian Internet business services were hosted within
                                      Mongolia. Mongolia’s three leading Internet providers completed planning for an independent exchange within
                                      three months. By March 2002, MIX had six ISP members and steadily increasing traffic between them. Today,
                                      local latency is less than 10 milliseconds per transaction and an average of 377 gigabytes of data are transferred
                                      domestically each day among MIX’s members. Moreover, each domestically exchanged transaction frees up an
                                      equal amount of international bandwidth, thereby improving connection speeds and reducing latency over
                                      Mongolia’s international links. 55
Policy / Program:                     Public/private partnerships (PPPs) for deployment of open access broadband networks
Supply & Demand impacts:              Supply: International connectivity / Domestic backbone
Description:                          Network construction is the highest entry barrier in the communications industry, requiring significant financial
                                      resources. Construction of domestic and international backbone networks is essential to ensure that high-
                                      quality, low-cost connectivity is available. Businesses might initially avoid investing in backbone networks
                                      because they are unsure of the returns on their investments. Governments can partner with the private sector
                                      to provide up-front support in order to reduce risks or act as an anchor tenant to induce investment.
Example:                              The Kenyan government has been aggressively promoting the development of broadband backbones through
                                      public-private partnerships (PPPs). It took an active role in The East African Marine System (TEAMS), an
                                      undersea fiber optic cable linking Mombasa, Kenya and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The
                                      government encouraged operators in Kenya to join it in taking an 85% stake in the cable, which was launched in
                                      2009. More than ten operators have an ownership interest in TEAMS guaranteeing them access at wholesale

Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: Domestic backbone, Local access; Demand: Affordability
Description:                             Obtaining the rights of way necessary to deploy broadband infrastructure can be a complex process adding to
                                         costs and delaying deployment.
Example:                                 Canada’s Telecommunications Act includes provisions to facilitate operators’ access to public property.57
Policy / Program:                        Facilitate open access to critical infrastructure
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: International connectivity, Domestic backbone, Local access; Demand: Affordability
Description:                             Critical infrastructure is essential network elements or services that are typically owned by a single or small
                                         number of suppliers. These include facilities such as international and national fiber optic backbones and fixed
                                         local access networks that cannot easily be replicated. Facilitating open access to these facilities through options
                                         such as an obligation for providers to provide wholesale access offers or structural separation of wholesale and
                                         retail activities can stimulate competition and lower retail broadband prices.
Example:                                 The European Commission’s requires incumbent operators to offer unbundled access to their fixed telephone
                                         networks.58

Description:                             School connectivity provides many benefits including access to an ever-growing volume of educational
                                         information, opportunities for collaboration and the use of on-line applications. It provides students and
                                         teachers hands-on experience for developing ICT skills. Schools can also be leveraged to provide connectivity in
                                         off-hours to the rest of the community.

Description:                            One of biggest expenses in providing broadband connectivity in rural areas is the “middle mile,” or the portion
                                        connecting a town to the Internet backbone. Once the backbone connection is established to government
                                        institutions, it can be leveraged to provide retail broadband services to local residences and businesses.
                                        Broadband connected government institutions thus become “anchor points” from which broadband
                                        connectivity can be shared with the surrounding community.
Example:                                The United States has recommended that broadband connectivity in federal offices located around the country
                                        should be used to extend broadband access to unserved and underserved communities.60
Policy / Program:                       Monitor service quality
Supply & Demand impacts:                Demand: Assurance
Description:                            Broadband service providers often advertise broadband speeds that are higher than the bandwidths actually
                                        experienced by the user. Differences between advertised and actual speed can impact users’ confidence in the
                                        quality of broadband services. This can be overcome through regular reporting of service quality levels.
Example:                                The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Bahrain publishes quarterly results of its broadband quality of
                                        service monitoring.61 It carries out a predefined set of tests around the clock. The results are stored in a
                                        centralized database. Actual versus advertized speeds for different ISPs are tested based on access to local and
                                        international web sites. The measurements supplement information already available to consumers in respect
                                        to prices and advertized speeds.
Policy / Program:                       Create an enabling environment for intermodal competition
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: Local access; Demand: Attraction
Description:                            Convergence allows for the provision of voice, data and broadcast services over telephone, broadcast, mobile
                                        and Internet networks. Governments should allow any type of network to offer any type of broadband service in
                                        order to intensify competition. This includes the legalization of voice over broadband and television over

                                        Internet Protocol services.
Example:                                Chile allows telecom and television operators to provide voice, data and video services. Cable television
                                        operators account for almost half of broadband lines and around one fifth of voice subscriptions.62
Policy / Program:                       Ensure nondiscriminatory access for service, application, and content providers
Supply & Demand impacts:                Demand: Attraction
Description:                            It is critical to ensure that all broadband providers of services, applications and content have fair access to
                                        broadband networks. “Network neutrality” helps to achieve this by preventing broadband operators from
                                        blocking or degrading access to specific content except when requested by user.
Example:                                Chile’s Internet and Network Neutrality Law prohibits operators from blocking applications or content unless
                                        requested by the user. Intensive users would be required to subscribe to a broadband plan that reflects the cost
                                        of their usage.63
Policy / Program:                       Consider expanding universal service obligation to include broadband
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: Local Access; Demand: Access, Affordability
Description:                            In a number of countries, the type and quality of telecommunication services that must be made available to
                                        subscribers is defined in laws. The inclusion of broadband in such definitions would require operators to make
                                        broadband available on demand.
Example:                                In July 2010, the Communications Market Act in Finland was revised to include a reasonably priced Internet
                                        connection in the definition of universal service. According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications:
                                        “Telecom operators defined as universal service providers must be able to provide every permanent residence
                                        and business office with access to a reasonably priced and high-quality connection with a downstream rate of at
                                        least 1 Mbit/s.”64 The industry regulator will carry out monitoring of the provision as well as reviewing price and
                                        quality (including delivery time). The connection can be either fixed or wireless.
                                        APPLICATIONS & CONTENT
Policy / Program:                       Undertake government-led demand aggregation, with government agencies as early adopters and innovators

Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: Domestic backbone, Local access; Demand: Access
Description:                             In many countries there exists pockets of broadband demand that are too small to obtain adequate broadband
                                         service at favorable prices. By pooling that demand together, a larger market can be created providing
                                         incentives for broadband operators to supply the market.
Example:                                 In Italy an agency of the Ministry of Treasury has aggregated government demand for broadband leading to a
                                         sharp reduction in the prices paid.65
Policy / Program:                        Provide e-government applications
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Demand: Attraction
Description:                             Computerizing public information and providing e-government services through broadband networks are
                                         essential. E-government encourages citizens to subscribe to broadband services.
Example:                                 In Colombia, all municipalities have a web site, the first Latin American country to accomplish this. The
                                         Colombian e-government portal is linked to some 3,000 web sites, with information about around 3,000
                                         administrative processes of which 541 could be accomplished completely online in December 2009. Citizen use
                                         of e-government services doubled in 2009 to over half a million visits per month.66
Policy / Program:                        Promote adoption by industry
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Supply: International connectivity, Local access; Demand: Affordability, Awareness
Description:                             Support for broadband-related industries increases demand for supply side components enhancing
                                         infrastructure investment and helps to create long-term sustainable demand for broadband services. Providing
                                         training and incentives for Small and Medium Sized enterprises can help them get broadband connected to
                                         improve their productivity and widen their market opportunities
Example:                                 In Vietnam the government supports software parks through development of basic infrastructure and
                                         incubation and securing domestic and foreign investment for tenants.67

Description:                             Support for content creation relevant to local needs and in national languages can help attract people to use
                                         broadband.
Example:                                 The Jordanian government has facilitated foreign investment in the digital creation industry. In 2009, chipmaker
                                         Intel announced an investment in two Jordanian digital content companies: Jeeran and ShooFeeTV.68 The
                                         funding will be used to help both companies pursue regional growth as well as extend their product offerings.
Policy / Program:                        Support secure e-transactions
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Demand: Assurance
Description:                             Online transactions are an important part of the broadband environment. Transactions must be secure and legal
                                         to encourage the development of two-way interactive e-commerce, e-government and telemedicine
                                         applications. This means that legal systems need to recognize electronic signatures and transactions.
                                         Information security such as encryption technologies and anti-hacking software, are also critical for a stable and
                                         safe broadband atmosphere.
Example:                                 The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) published a reference framework for e-commerce back in
                                         2001 and has since guided the creation and harmonization of e-commerce laws in the region. By April 2008,
                                         eight of its ten members had enacted e-commerce legislation enabling the legal recognition of online
                                         transactions to support applications such as online retailing and Internet banking.69 ASEAN is the first developing
                                         region in the world to implement a harmonized e-commerce legal framework throughout member countries.
Policy / Program:                        Implement reasonable intellectual property protections
Supply & Demand impacts:                 Demand: Assurance
Description:                             One enabler of content and media development is the creation of an intellectual property rights (IPR) regime
                                         that protects creators’ interests while enabling others to use and improve those creations. Such rights need to
                                         balance the interests of creators with the larger goals of enabling knowledge sharing, fair use, and adaptation.
                                         This is particularly relevant for the development of e-learning and distance education applications.
Example:                                 Creative Commons licenses allow creators to specify which rights they wish to reserve, thereby allowing a range
                                         of possibilities between full copyright and the public domain. 70

Policy / Program:                     Provide low-cost user devices in education
Supply & Demand impacts:              Supply: Access device; Demand: Affordability, awareness
Description:                          The spread low-cost computers in schools typically include an ecosystem for operating and maintaining the
                                      devices, which often involves providing broadband access in schools in order to download software and support
                                      the Wi-Fi capability of the devices. The provision of low-cost educational computers also develops ICT skills at an
                                      early age helping to grow demand for broadband.
Example:                              Uruguay has supplied Wi-Fi enabled laptops to all primary school children. 71 One of the goals of the Uruguayan
                                      plan was to boost overall household computer ownership by leveraging the students taking the laptops home
                                      after school. This has resulted in 220,000 new homes with computers including 110,000 in the lowest income
                                      families.
Policy / Program:                     Develop digital literacy programs for citizens
Supply & Demand impacts:              Demand: Awareness
Description:                          To raise public awareness of the benefits of broadband services and promote their use, governments should
                                      provide training on how to use computers and the Internet. This training can contribute to the rapid and
                                      widespread penetration of broadband. In the short run, such training generates demand. It can also be a step
                                      toward universal service when the program targets underserved groups. ICT training for children and students
                                      can change their learning behavior and interests and, by extension, alter their parents’ views of ICT and
                                      broadband.
Example:                              In Colombia, the Compartel program within the Ministry of ICT devoted around $153 billion pesos in 2009 for
                                      teaching free computer literacy courses at some 1,670 Internet centers around the country. The courses were
                                      provided to around 200,000 people where they learn about basic computer tools, Internet navigation, email,
                                      search engines, chat and ICT applications. In addition, teachers use virtual training and video conferencing at the
                                      centers to offer courses in other subjects. The centers are often located in educational institutions with access
                                      provided to the local community for training during non-school hours.72

Description:                            Many users are leery of broadband Internet access because of objectionable content and security concerns. This
                                        concern can be alleviated through programs that educate users about perceived risks, child online protection
                                        and how to use the Internet safely.
Example:                                The regulator in Qatar has created a site for children, teenagers, teachers and parents providing tips for safe
                                        online surfing.73
Policy / Program:                       Expand access to underserved communities with USF support
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: National backbone, local access; Demand: Access
Description:                            Universal Service Funds (USF)—typically financed by contributions from telecom operators—were initially
                                        created to facilitate the development of telephone infrastructure in rural and other underserved localities.
                                        Given that broadband connectivity can provide many beneficial services in addition to voice telephony countries
                                        should consider the scope of USF to cover broadband deployment in underserved areas.
Example:                                Pakistan’s USF is funded by a 1.5% levy on telecom operator revenues. Broadband projects are eligible for
                                        funding and include the connection of schools through broadband computer labs and extending domestic fiber
                                        optic backbones to rural areas.74
Policy / Program:                       Construct community access centers
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: Local access; Demand: Affordability, Awareness, Access, Assurance
Description:                            Citizens in underserved communities do not use broadband because they have no access, cannot afford it or are
                                        not aware of its benefits. Creating facilities for public broadband use can alleviate these barriers by establishing
                                        a place of access, offering free or low cost tariffs and including training.
Example:                                In Malaysia, the Government established Community Broadband Centers (CBC) to provide collective high-speed
                                        Internet to underserved areas identified under the Universal Service Provision (USP) program.75 The CBC is
                                        outfitted with computers connected to broadband. Training is also provided at each CBC.
Policy / Program:                       Facilitate affordability of broadband devices
Supply & Demand impacts:                Supply: Devices; Demand: Affordability
Description:                            Computers, mobile phones and data cards for broadband use are expensive for many citizens of developing

                                        countries. Countries could consider developing policies and programs that make user devices more affordable
                                        for people who want to buy them but lack the means to do so. This includes reducing or eliminating taxes on
                                        broadband-enabled devices and subsidizing or offering low or zero interest loans for their purchase.
Example:                                In March 2009, China announced that it had selected 14 PC vendors to offer low-priced PCs in rural areas. All the
                                        PCs in the winning bid are priced from $290 to $510. This approach is part of the National Home Appliance
                                        Subsidy Program for rural areas. About 57 percent of the rural population—about 200 million households—will
                                        be eligible for a 13 percent subsidy if they purchase one of those PCs.76
