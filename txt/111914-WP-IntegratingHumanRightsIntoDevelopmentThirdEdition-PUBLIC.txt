                                                Foreword

I welcome the third edition of Integrating Human Rights into Development as an invaluable resource for
those committed to advancing engagement between human rights and development professionals and
organizations.

During my term as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, and over the course of my
work with both Realizing Rights: The Ethical Globalization Initiative and the Mary Robinson
Foundation–Climate Justice, I have continued to underscore the urgent need for human rights and
development agendas to work in a mutually reinforcing way in order to eliminate poverty and promote
equitable and sustainable development. The areas of convergence are becoming more and more apparent,
including through initiatives on climate justice, migration, inclusion, disabilities, and that further the
equality and empowerment of women and girls. The message at the level of principle and broad political
commitment continues to support the fundamental compatibility of human rights and development goals,
as milestones of recent years have also shown. At the same time, international policy coherence remains
high on the list of international priorities for donors and is of direct relevance to the integration of human
rights into development.

A number of policy milestones continue to guide donor programming and to promote the convergence
between human rights and development at the level of principles, values, and goals. Of sustained
relevance to this study, including in its third edition, is the DAC’s 2007 Action- Oriented Policy Paper
on Human Rights and Development, which included ten principles designed to serve as a basic
orientation on human rights in key development areas, where donor harmonization is of particular
relevance. These principles continue to provide pertinent guidance to donors and international
development actors, for instance in recalling the principle of ‘do no harm’ or in respect of fragile states
and conflict which present particular human rights challenges for development programming.

In the area of aid effectiveness, the second edition captured milestones, such as the 2008 Accra Agenda
for Action which recognized respect for human rights as one of the cornerstones of sustainable
development and the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan in 2011, where
donors and partners again reaffirmed the importance of shared principles, which are consistent with their
international commitments and form the foundation for cooperation for effective development.




                                                                                                           iii
In the past four years, the post-2015 context generated perhaps the most significant milestones with the
proclamation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the SDG Declaration (Resolution
adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015; Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development) which was unequivocal in its affirmation of the centrality of human rights to
development. It clearly states, “The new Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter
of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium Declaration and the
2005 World Summit Outcome. It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right
to Development.” The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development must now be read together with the
Paris Climate Agreement, and its commitment to staying “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels
and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. The Paris
Agreement also commits governments to achieve carbon neutrality in the second half of the century, and
its terms should be interpreted in accordance with the human rights language in the preamble which
requires the need to respect and promote human rights, the rights of indigenous peoples, gender equality,
women’s empowerment and intergenerational equity to achieve a just transition.

At the operational level, development priorities in areas such as education, social protection, adequate
housing, disabilities and health care are increasingly framed in terms of human rights; this is also
apparent in the rise of economic and social rights litigation, particularly in the South. Like the second
edition, this third edition showcases the continued growth of donor and partner experiences
implementing human rights principles, tools, and programming approaches in a variety of sectors and
projects. Recent experience underscores the importance of mainstreaming tools and guidance, the
growing relevance of human rights due diligence and human rights impact assessments and indicators.
The range of these experiences and efforts is evidence of the global commitment to human rights as well
as the importance of context and alignment to partner frameworks and priorities. It also speaks to the
need to tailor approaches to suit different institutional and policy frameworks in order to both achieve
comparative advantage and respect the specificity of their roles internationally. Finally, the range of
approaches supports a theory of complementary and mutually reinforcing approaches to integrating
human rights in development.

A great deal has been achieved in recent years, even if considerable work remains to be done to
operationalize human rights in development policy and practice and ensure that human rights principles
and obligations are integrated effectively and consistently. There are practical challenges to meet as well,
in terms of developing effective tools and robust methodologies, ensuring institutional leadership for
human rights and allocating adequate resources to implementing policies as well as to training staff.


                                                                                                         iv
More emphasis is warranted in the areas of monitoring and evaluation frameworks to ensure that human
rights are fully integrated into mainstream development policies, strategies, dialogues, and processes.

Like the first and second edition, this study remains the most comprehensive and up-to-date resource of
its kind, which captures key developments of recent years, including additional policy and legal
dimensions, which are essential elements of the overall interface of human rights and development. It
effectively summarizes recent progress by charting donor approaches and experiences without
concealing the challenges attendant on these efforts and without arguing for any particular approach for
donors. In this way, it contributes objectively to making the case that human rights are now part of
development, and it goes some way to showing why they should be. I commend Siobhán McInerney-
Lankford and her colleagues for their valuable work.

The past two decades have witnessed a convergence between human rights and development, most
notably at the level of international political statements and policy commitments, and the past 10 years
have been marked by particularly important milestones. Of sustained relevance to this publication is the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) 2007 Action-Oriented Policy Paper that affirmed unequivocally that human rights
are an essential part of development cooperation, noting the increasing convergence of the two areas and
the relevance of human rights considerations to aid effectiveness; the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action
and 2011 Busan outcome document both acknowledged the importance of human rights standards and
principles. In the context of the Millennium Development Goals, the 2010 UN World Summit outcome
document confirmed the centrality of human rights to sustainable development, which paved the way
for the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and an even greater substantive convergence
between human rights principles and the global development goals: like the 2000 Millennium
Declaration, the declaration in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDG Declaration)
adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015 underscored the centrality of human rights in
development. The 2013 “Vienna + 20” conference had reiterated the central connections between human
rights and development, reaffirming the right to development and calling for the effective integration of
human rights into the post-2015 agenda. In the environmental sphere, the outcome document from the
2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio + 20) reaffirmed the importance of all human
rights for sustainable development and the need for green economy policies in the context of sustainable
development and poverty eradication to respect all human rights; in the climate change context, the 2015
Paris Agreement also recognized the links to human rights. Finally, in the sphere of business and human
rights, the 2013 adoption of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by the UN Human
Rights Council, although of more indirect relevance to donor policies, signalled a rapprochement in
terms between the worlds of finance and investment on the one hand and human rights on the other. In
more applied terms, the links between rights violations, poverty, exclusion, environmental degradation,
vulnerability, and conflict have continued to be explored. There is growing recognition of the intrinsic
importance of human rights in a range of contexts, as well as their potential instrumental relevance for
improved development processes and outcomes and a sustained interest in tools and metrics, including
human rights indicators.

The third edition of Integrating Human Rights into Development: Donor Approaches, Experiences, and
Challenges consolidates the findings and research compiled in 2006 and 2012 with key developments
and activities that have occurred in the subsequent years. This edition is intended to build on the review
and findings of the first and second editions, rather than to supplant them, so that much of that material
is preserved here. Like the first two editions, this study seeks to advance understanding of the nexus
between development and human rights through a systematic consideration of donor approaches. It also
seeks to enhance understanding among donors on how to work collectively to advance the strategic and
coherent integration of human rights in development in light of agencies’ roles and areas of comparative
advantage.

The book remains focused on the policies and programmes of donors but also encompasses
intergovernmental organizations and other actors whose work relates to or influences development in
order to provide an even more comprehensive view of current trends and thinking around human rights
and development.

This study brings together the key political and policy statements of recent years with a discussion of
the approaches and experiences of bilateral and multilateral agencies engaged in integrating human
rights in their development cooperation activities in a variety of ways. Although the landscape of
development cooperation has continued to evolve rapidly, marked by the emergence of new donors and
influenced by a range of actors, this study retains a focus on donors reviewed in 2006 who established
positions on human rights, even where those positions are more implicit. The 2008 financial crisis
defined the context of aid, placing additional pressure on donors to demonstrate impact and results: this
fact underscores the need to establish the instrumental relevance and “value added” of human rights.
Nevertheless, the experience of recent also attests to the sustained commitment of OECD member
countries and multilateral donors to engage with human rights strategically, as a means for improving
the delivery of aid and promoting sustainable and equitable development results.

Like the first and second editions, this edition is based on a thorough examination of policy, guidance
and operational documents, evaluations, and other analyses of practical experience, as well as interviews
with donor agencies. It reviews the approaches of different donor agencies and their rationales for
working on human rights. It confirms the range of donor approaches to human rights: some donors adopt
human rights–based approaches (HRBAs), others opt for more incremental but explicit approaches, and
still others integrate human rights implicitly into various dimensions of their development work. The
study identifies the current practices in this field and looks at the common elements of those practices.
It illustrates how aid agencies are working on human rights issues at the programming level, and what
donors have done over the past six years, charting significant changes and advances. Like the first and

                                                                                                       vii
second editions, this study draws together lessons that form the core of the current evidence on the added
value of human rights for development. It addresses opportunities and challenges (conceptual and
practical) attendant to human rights in evolving development partnerships between donors and partner
countries, as well as in the workings of the international aid system more broadly. It also highlights
significant political statements and declarations of recent years that recognize the connections between
human rights and development.

In aggregate terms, this study confirms the global trends toward recognizing the links between human
rights and development at the level of international political statements and commitments, and it
confirms the diversity of approaches that exists between donors at the level of individual agency policies
and operations. Donors maintain distinct rationales for engaging in human rights, based on their legal
and policy mandates, their institutional roles, and their priorities. Nevertheless, in substantive and
operational terms, the areas of engagement are often the same, with activities of different agencies
sometimes overlapping. Moreover, the past six years have evidenced a shared emphasis on
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, as well as on results and impact.

A note on methodology: the same basic approach was employed to research and write this edition as
was used for the first and second editions. Agencies were invited to share a written summary of their
policies and experiences as well as recent country and sector programmes that showcased their particular
approaches to integrating human rights. Many of these written submissions were followed by interviews.
The submissions were coded and complied and integrated into chapters covering rationales, conceptual
underpinnings, general approaches to development programming, tools and frameworks, and two
chapters containing country and sector programme examples. The aim is to provide an overview of
donors’ approaches without making any value judgment thereon. Every effort has been made to reflect
the submissions accurately, although due to considerations of length, not every example was included.
Responsibility for errors or weaknesses rests with the authors. The findings, interpretations and
conclusions expressed in this study are entirely those of the authors and should not be attributed in any
way to the World Bank, to its affiliated organizations or to the members of its Board of Executive
Directors or the countries they represent.

It is hoped that the third edition can, like the previous editions, serve as a reference for practitioners and
those interested in exploring the connections between human rights and development. It is also hoped
that this work can be of use to those pursuing the ways in which development cooperation can advance
the realization of human rights, as well as the ways in which human rights approaches can make
development interventions more effective, equitable, and sustainable. This update has been undertaken
with the aim of sustaining knowledge-sharing efforts among donors to improve both donor coordination

The original edition of this work, published in 2006, was the result of a collaborative effort by members
of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) Network on Governance (GOVNET). It was based on a commissioned study written
by Laure-Hélène Piron and Tammie O’Neil from the UK Overseas Development Institute. We express
our great appreciation to both authors for their excellent work. We acknowledge the contributions of the
following to that edition: Rahel Boesch (former chair of the GOVNET Task Team on Human Rights
and Development); Lisa Fredriksson (former cochair) and Sebastian Bartsch (former OECD Directorate
for Development Co-operation), who managed and provided guidance for the entire process; as well as
to the members of the task team’s core group in 2006, including Jane Alexander, Sarita Bhatla, Mac
Darrow, Christiane Hieronymus, Siobhán McInerney-Lankford, Juliane Osterhaus, Garett Pratt, Maria-
Luisa Silva, Birgitta Tazelaar, Patrick van Weerelt, Lee Waldorf, and Franziska Walter, for their
exceptional commitment to this project. We would also like to thank many other representatives of donor
agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and DAC Secretariat staff who made themselves
available for interviews, shared documentation, and submitted written or oral comments on the
manuscript. A team of OECD staff prepared the original publication: Sebastian Bartsch acted as the main
editor, while Carola Miras and Misha Pinkhasov provided advice and practical assistance on all stages
of the publication process. Invaluable external editorial assistance was contributed by Laura Boutin.

                                       Executive Summary
Human rights have been an important aspect of development policy and programming since the end of
the Cold War. This review of donor approaches to integrating human rights in development policies
spans the last two decades and encompasses a broad range of actors, going beyond a narrow definition
of donors to include development banks and international organizations.

The 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, the 2000 Millennium Summit, the 2005 and
2010 World Summits, the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Summit, and the “Vienna + 20”
conference all either recognized or reiterated that development and human rights are interdependent and
mutually reinforcing. The 2005 UN Secretary-General’s In Larger Freedom encapsulates the
interlinkages among development, security, and human rights: “We will not enjoy development without
security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect
for human rights. Unless all these causes are advanced, none will succeed” (UN 2005b).

Many donor agencies, including bilaterals and multilaterals, have adopted policies on human rights over
the past two decades. Some have developed “second-generation” drawing on their experiences and
auguring the prospect for “third-generation” policies. The UN system has lead the way with a process
of human rights mainstreaming since 1997 and, in 2003, agreement on an interagency Common
Understanding of a Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to Development Programming (UN
Common Understanding), as well as more recent initiatives such as the UN Human Rights
Mainstreaming Mechanism (UN-HRM) and the UN Human Rights Working Group (UN HRWG). The
UN definition of a HRBA highlights:

     The relationship between development cooperation, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights,
      and international human rights instruments
     The relevance for development programming of human rights standards and principles derived
      from these instruments (e.g., equality and non-discrimination, participation and inclusion,
      accountability, and the rule of law)
     The contribution that development cooperation can make to building the capacities of “duty-
      bearers” and “rights-holders” to realize and claim rights



This study, originally published in 2006 and updated in 2011, is being updated in this third edition. The
work was originally based on a study commissioned by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Network on Governance
(GOVNET), which reviewed the approaches of different donor agencies and their rationales for working

                                                                                                      xx
on human rights. The third edition reviews the current practice in the field and draws together
experiences that form the core of the current evidence around the contribution of human rights to
development. It discusses both new opportunities and conceptual and practical challenges to human
rights that concern the development partnerships between donors and partner countries, and the workings
of the international aid system more broadly. This edition includes recent developments in the area of
human rights, aid effectiveness, and sustainable development. Of continued relevance to this publication
is the OECD DAC 2007 Action-Oriented Policy Paper, which affirmed unequivocally that human rights
are an essential part of development cooperation, noting the increasing convergence of the two areas and
the relevance of human rights considerations to aid effectiveness: the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action
and 2011 Busan outcome document both acknowledged the importance of human rights standards and
principles. In the context of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the 2010 UN World Summit
outcome document confirmed the centrality of human rights to sustainable development that paved the
way for the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The SDGs reveal an even greater substantive convergence between human rights principles and the
global development goals: like the 2000 Millennium Declaration, the 2015 SDG Declaration
underscores the centrality of human rights in development, although the SDGs themselves are widely
viewed to have captured human rights considerations and principles to a far greater extent than had the
MDGs (McInerney-Lankford and Sano 2016). In 2013, the “Vienna + 20” conference marked the 20 th
anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and reiterated the central connections
between human rights and development, reaffirming the right to development and calling for the
effective integration of human rights into the post-2015 agenda. In the environmental sphere, the
outcome document from the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development reaffirmed the
importance of human rights for sustainable development and the need for green economy policies in the
context of sustainable development and poverty eradication to respect all human rights and in the climate
change context the 2015 “CoP 21” Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC also recognized the links to
human rights. Finally, in the sphere of business and human rights, the 2013 adoption of the Guiding
Principles on Business and Human Rights by the UN Human Rights Council, although of more indirect
relevance to donor policies, signalled a rapprochement in terms between the worlds of finance and
investment on the one hand and human rights on the other. The links among rights violations, poverty,
exclusion, environmental degradation, vulnerability, and conflict in more applied terms have continued
to be explored. There is growing recognition of the intrinsic importance of human rights in a range of
contexts, as well as their potential instrumental relevance for improved development processes and
outcomes and a sustained interest in tools and metrics, including human rights indicators.


                                                                                                     xxi
Donor Policies and Rationales

Human rights work is seen both as an objective in its own right and as contributing to the quality and
effectiveness of development assistance. The intrinsic reasons for integrating human rights in
development include those related to the legal obligations that emanate from the international human
rights framework. States parties to human rights instruments are under a duty to respect, protect, and
fulfil human rights. Relatedly, normative justifications draw on the concept of human dignity underlying
the international legal framework that drives ethical and political considerations about the integration of
human rights into development. Human rights are seen as constitutive of development, drawing on
conceptual frameworks such as human development, Amartya Sen or Martha Nussbaum’s capabilities
approach, or multidimensional definitions of poverty (Alkire and Foster 2009). Finally, human rights
are also viewed as instrumentally relevant to objectives pursued by donors in the areas of governance,
sustainability, poverty reduction, and aid effectiveness.

Agencies have adopted different rationales for working on human rights. Some do not approach human
rights explicitly, in light of legal, political, or empirical issues. Research and multidisciplinary exchanges
can inform the further development of policies and their operationalization, even for actors whose
mandate does not include human rights. Other agencies have more explicit positions on human rights
and adopt a more programmatic approach to integrating human rights in policies, programmes, or
projects. Despite differences in agency policies and mandates, the various operational approaches are
not mutually exclusive and may overlap in practice and evolve over time.

Thus, the integration of human rights into development takes place in various ways. The most common
form of integration has traditionally occurred through projects targeted at the realization of specific
rights or specific groups or in support of human rights organizations or defenders. A more strategic
integration of human rights can be found in the design of country programmes and global initiatives.

Other well-established practices are mainstreaming human rights into all sectors of existing aid
interventions and including human rights issues in the political dialogue between donors and developing
countries. Many agencies are moving to human rights–based approaches (HRBAs), which require
institutional change in the provision of aid. In agencies that do not explicitly use a human rights
framework at a policy level, an implicit integration can be identified.




                                                                                                         xxii
Donor Approaches to Programming Experiences

Human rights have tended to be considered as part of the donor governance agenda, and the majority of
direct interventions have been civil and political rights projects, often funded through civil society
organizations. The shift from rule of law to access to justice policy and programming points to a more
strategic use of human rights, influencing how situations are analysed, how objectives are set, and how
aid is provided. There are fewer examples of a shift in the rest of the governance agenda, although a
different approach to tax reform—based on the recognition of both the rights and the duties of citizens—
illustrates the impact of a human rights perspective beyond civil and political rights projects.

In many agencies, human rights are being mainstreamed in policy and programming areas. A number of
agencies have made significant progress in the area of children’s rights, often based on the Convention
on the Rights of the Child. Human rights are also closely associated with gender equali ty and women’s
rights initiatives, drawing on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against
Women and the 1994 Beijing Platform of Action. Significant advances have been made integrating
disabilities in development programming, which has been supported, at least in part, by the rapid
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. In addition, there appear to
have been more successes linking human rights to indigenous peoples than to other minorities, arguably
reflected in the adoption of, and growing support for, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples. Human rights mainstreaming in health and education programming is on the rise,
as is affirming the rights of individuals with disabilities. These examples emphasize the relevance of
specific human rights standards (e.g., the right to the highest attainable standard of health, grounded in
Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights) and an approach
based on human rights principles (e.g., promoting inclusion, participation, and accountability), as well
as the importance of preventing or mitigating human rights violations associated with aid interventions.

Although there is an emphasis at a policy level on the positive place of human rights in development,
human rights conditionality remains a feature of several development programmes. In extreme cases,
when other methods (including dialogue processes) fail, aid may be suspended or terminated. New ways
of looking at aid allocations, policies, and modalities create opportunities to revisit this area.

Preliminary Lessons: Integrating Human Rights Dimensions, Principles, and Obligations

Based on experience, it is possible to draw up a set of preliminary lessons concerning the contribution,
or added value, of human rights for development.




                                                                                                     xxiii
The intrinsic value of human rights offers development actors an explicit normative and analytical
framework grounded in a consensual global legal regime of international human rights treaties. The
framework can be adapted to different political and cultural environments. In some countries, it has been
possible to overcome political constraints by taking a gradual and implicit approach. Operational human
rights principles have made it easier to integrate human rights into actual programming. In fact, it has
been possible to integrate human rights (using principles derived from the human rights framework)
without an explicit approach, as seen in the work of some of the international financial institutions. The
downside of this strategy is that it increases the risk of “rhetorical repackaging” that occurs when the
distinction between the use of operational principles that might be tangentially related to human rights
and interventions specifically grounded in the human rights framework is blurred.

Human rights can make a contribution to the governance agenda. Human rights are conceptualized in
terms of “duty-bearers” and “rights-holders.” This differentiation highlights the importance of state-
citizen linkages that call for building the capacity of states to deliver on human rights commitments and
the capacity of citizens to claim their entitlements. Human rights are a source of legitimacy for state
action, emphasizing the need for effective channels of accountability and redress. Participatory
approaches are becoming more widespread in the development field through initiatives that aim to
empower poor and vulnerable populations. A strategic use of human rights strengthens these trends,
highlighting the need for free, informed, and meaningful participation that can be institutionalized.

Human rights can enhance the design and impact of aid in terms of poverty reduction goals, building on
the commitments of the 1995 Copenhagen and other UN summits, including the 2010 UN MDG Summit
and the 2015 UN SDG Summit. Human rights provide a lens to examine the structural and root causes
of poverty, for example, focusing on inequality and exclusion as major barriers to poverty reduction.
They also call for a better understanding of the context and power relations within which aid operates.
The principles of equality and non-discrimination focus attention squarely on excluded and marginalized
individuals and groups (and underline the centrality of disaggregated data).

Finally, human rights can contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of aid, in particular through the
explicit recognition of aid’s political dimensions and its focus on institutions and accountability. Because
human rights are grounded in the domestic responsibilities of states, aid agencies have found that a
HRBA has helped them to move away from roles as direct providers of services toward a capacity
development role. The interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights has encouraged holistic
approaches, for example, greater collaboration across related sectors or institutions.




                                                                                                      xxiv
Donors have built new partnerships and found supportive ways of facilitating domestic change
processes. Some of these contributions are not new to the development world; human rights offer a
comprehensive and coherent normative framework that reinforces “good programming practices,” such
as participation, by making them non-negotiable, consistent, and legitimate.



Challenges and Opportunities

Donors are faced with a number of challenges in seeking to integrate human rights into development.

First, the increasing institutionalization of human rights considerations requires looking at donors’ own
systems, procedures, and staff incentives and allocating adequate resources to better translate their
policies into practice. Several factors contribute to success in this area: a supportive international and
domestic political context; senior-level commitment, accountability, and communication; a
strengthening of staff capacities and incentives; provision of new tools and procedures; and adaptation
to a decentralized context. Many agencies acknowledge that they need to invest more in knowledge
management to inform their policy development and to improve the basis for harmonized policies and
approaches. Agencies and institutions that use an implicit HRBA may think creatively about how to
measure progress in programmes that are difficult to correspond to human rights-based indicators.

Second, aid agencies have sometimes found engagement with partner countries difficult because of
countries’ weak capacities in implementing human rights and because human rights remain a politically
sensitive and divisive issue in a number of contexts. Thus, agencies sometimes face political barriers, in
particular when their partners’ commitment is weak or where there is even overt resistance to human
rights. Practitioners working on fragile states and human rights share a common interest in the
prioritization of key features of the state: the legitimacy and accountability of state structures and the
state’s ability to create an enabling environment. Human rights can also offer analytical and operational
approaches for donor engagement in these more challenging environments. Member states have made
successive commitments to integrate the promotion and protection of human rights into national policies
and national development plans. The latter provide potential entry points to strengthen the national
ownership of human rights in the context of development partnerships, in particular around poverty
reduction strategies.

Third, the effective integration of human rights into development requires embedding human rights in
practical ways into the thinking and practice around aid effectiveness processes, instruments, and
modalities of aid delivery. It also requires concrete tools, frameworks, and indicators and that attention


                                                                                                     xxv
be paid to empirical data and results. Important analytical work has been done on the ways human rights
contribute to the MDGs, including work that links the goals to specific human rights standards (OHCHR
2006; Langford, Yamin, and Sumner 2010); drawing on the Millennium Declaration, which makes
explicit reference to human rights as well as to developing HRBAs toward meeting the MDGs. The
outcome document of the 2010 MDG Summit reaffirms that respect for human rights is critical for
reaching the MDGs (UN 2010d). The SDGs reflect human rights principles and considerations to a much
greater extent, and the SDG Declaration is explicit in linking human rights and development and
confirming that the new development agenda is grounded in the Universal Declaration Human Rights
and in international human rights treaties. In the area of aid effectiveness, the 2008 Accra Agenda for
Action and the 2011 Busan outcome document both recognize the importance of human rights, in
addition to their focus on alignment, harmonization, and mutual accountability. The OECD has long
placed an emphasis on understanding the principles that contribute to aid effectiveness, including in the
2007 OECD DAC “Action-Oriented Policy Paper on Human Rights and Development,” a 2007 update
on human rights and aid effectiveness, an information sheet entitled “Human Rights and Aid
Effectiveness: Key Actions to Improve Inter-Linkages” (OECD 2008b), and a report from GOVNET,
Linking Human Rights and Aid Effectiveness for Better Development Results: Practical Experience from
the Health Sector (OECD 2008a). These documents highlight the congruence between human rights and
a number of aid effectiveness principles such as strengthening partner countries’ capacities, greater
transparency, managing for results, and policy coherence. Human rights analysis affects both aid
allocations and the choice of aid modalities and has a role to play in mutual accountability frameworks,
in particular in holding aid agencies to account.

Fourth, the foregoing reflections are connected with a broader observation on the challenge of
international policy coherence (McInerney-Lankford; World Bank Legal Review 2013). The same states
that agree upon development goals and aid effectiveness principles are also parties to the core
international human rights treaties, and yet serious disconnects persist between the actions and
commitments in these various spheres. The challenge of policy coherence relates to the lack of “joined
up thinking” within and between governments. This challenge is compounded by the ongoing
proliferation of international regulation and treaties and what some have termed the “fragmentation of
international law.” These related phenomena contribute to the overall challenge of integrating human
rights into development policy and programming and help explain why integration can be demanding
for policy and practical reasons.

Finally, and of particular note over the past decade, donors are often faced with shrinking budgets and
pressure to demonstrate the value of their programmes. Bilateral and multilateral development agencies


                                                                                                    xxvi
find themselves trying to do more with less and struggle with difficult decisions about how to prioritize
funding. On the positive side, these financial limitations may ultimately bring donor activities in line
with the Paris Declaration by encouraging concentration in thematic and geographic areas and better
coordination with other donors



Trends and Conclusions

The past decade has witnessed a steady trajectory of integration of human rights principles into
development cooperation. There have been significant developments on the international stage, such as
high-level political statements like the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action, the 2010 Millennium outcome
document, discussions at the Fourth High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Korea (including
a thematic session on a human rights-based approach to development), and events surrounding the 25th
anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development in 2011. At the national level, some donors
have followed through with more explicit commitments to incorporate human rights into their
development work, but challenges persist in the implementation and operational understanding of a
HRBA. There has been considerable activity at the level of projects, although it remains unclear if that
trend reflects difficulty integrating human rights at a policy or programmatic level. Other actors,
particularly multilateral development banks, have shown a greater interest in engaging on these issues
by mitigating risk, promulgating safeguard policies, and adhering to a “do no harm” principle. Overall,
these activities do not represent a seismic shift in donor approaches, but rather confirm that in substantive
terms at the operational level, there are wide areas of convergence among donor approaches and common
areas of emphasis in relation to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, as well as on results and
impact. To sustain progress, all development actors should leverage their expertise and comparative
advantage to better understand the synergies between human rights and development in order to
contribute in complementary ways to both.

                              Donor Policies and Rationales

Donors have developed policies to implement their overall approaches and strategies to human rights in
development and to guide their operations and interventions. Such policies vary in scope and content,
and are underpinned by a diverse set of rationales. These rationales emerge in various ways and are
sometimes used concurrently or in combination. The following chapter surveys donor policies and their
rationales from a human rights perspective.



I.        A CHANGING GLOBAL CONTEXT



The international context within which development occurs is a fast-changing one, especially in regard
to human rights. Since their first formal proclamation in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in
1948, human rights have continued to evolve (Box 1.1), and recognition of different rights through
subsequent treaties has defined the trajectory of this area of international law.

Chronology of UN Milestones for Human Rights and Development


Human rights and development have been central and indivisible pillars of the international
community of nations since its inception in 1945 with the adoption of the Charter of the United
Nations. This historic event gave birth to a normative era in which the international community,
inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, produced an outstanding corpus of
international norms and standards for a life of dignity and well-being for all. Yet, human rights and
development practice evolved on different tracks, mainly due to the political dynamics of the Cold
War. The World Conference on Human Rights in 1993 was a turning point that opened the door to a
renewed vision of the indivisibility of human rights—a vision that underscores the hand-in-hand
partnership of human rights and development for achieving equitable human development and the

effective realization of human rights in the lives of all persons, irrespective of their location, condition,
identity, or status.




1945–1950s: Laying the Foundation
1945: The UN Charter sets forth the concepts of 1946: The UN Commission on Human Rights
“inherent dignity” and the “equal and inalienable is established.
rights of all members of the human family.” It         1948: The Universal Declaration of Human
affirms the UN’s fundamental purpose as being Rights (UDHR) is adopted, in which “Member
“respect for human rights and for fundamental States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-
freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, operation with the United Nations . . . a common
language, or religion.”                                standard . . . for all peoples and all nations.” It is
                                                       the first time in history that human rights and
                                                       fundamental freedoms are set forth in such detail;

In the past two decades, international legal and policy milestones have transformed the landscape for

                                                                                                                2
donors and partners alike. The UN World Conferences in 2005, 2010, and 2015 reflected a progressively
stronger and more explicit commitment to human rights and a consistent message about the need to
anchor development in the respect, protection, and fulfilment of human rights and states’ international
human rights obligations. In the realm of aid effectiveness, documents such as the Paris Declaration, the
Accra Agenda for Action (AAA), and the Busan outcome document have brought human rights and
human rights principles into prominence (Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation
2011). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) likewise marked a significant change to the
ambition and scope of the global goals that the development community sets for itself and, many have
argued, symbolize a more human rights–oriented agenda (OHCHR, 2014). In this context, the UNDG
has recalled that “the UN development system is bound by the UN Charter to promote respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without discrimination”, stating that in implementing the post -
2015 development agenda, the UNDG would work for the fullest possible application of the following
core principles: universality; indivisibility; equality and non-discrimination; active and meaningful
participation; and accountability. (UNDG, 2016)



In the environmental sphere, the outcome document from the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable
Development (Rio + 20) reaffirmed the importance of all human rights for sustainable development and
the need for green economy policies to respect all human rights in the context of sustainable development
and poverty eradication and in the climate change context. In 2015, the Paris Agreement also recognized
the links between development and human rights. In the sphere of business and human rights, the 2013
adoption of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) by the UN Human
Rights Council, although of more indirect relevance to donor policies, has had an important impact on
the international context, particularly for business and investment but also for governments participating
in international organizations; the UNGPs also signalled a rapprochement between the worlds of finance
and investment on the one hand and human rights on the other. The links among rights violations,
poverty, exclusion, environmental degradation, vulnerability, and conflict continue to be explored.



The increasing recognition of human rights in these diverse areas of human rights policies and
programming evidences an increased understanding of how interconnected human rights are to a range
of different policy areas and how policies, rules, and practices in these areas can impact the realization
of human rights.




                                                                                                        3
II.     POLICIES AND RATIONALES

There is no single approach to integrating human rights into development policies and programming.
Many donors have developed human rights policies that govern development assistance; others
incorporate human rights concepts and principles in less explicit ways. Some human rights policies
include binding requirements with which donors and partners are required to comply, while other
policies may be more aspirational, embodying general principles that serve as guidance; a number of
policies contain a combination of both. Such policy efforts may be grounded in legal and ethical
obligations, but they can also be viewed in a more functional light, namely that a focus on human rights
improves development aid. The implementation of human rights is remains challenging, even for donors
and agencies with an explicit legal and political mandate to do so.



A trend is clear and sustained among “traditional donors”: many bilateral and multilateral agencies have
adopted or are in the process of adopting or refining human rights policies. According to the European
Parliament: “Human rights and the related concepts of good governance, democracy and the rule of law
have become an integral element of most donors’ international development cooperation.” (Europ ean
Parliament (2016a). Among bilaterals, the first wave of foreign policy statements in the 1990s was later
complemented by agency-specific documents on human rights and development. These documents often
emphasize positive measures to promote human rights in partner countries that donors can support
through financial or technical assistance and dialogue. Multilaterals, such as UN agencies, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance
Committee (DAC), and the European Commission, have developed human rights policy frameworks to
apply to their development interventions, but not all international financial institutions have done so.



While not exhaustive, Box 1.3 illustrates that the majority of agencies surveyed have either adopted
human rights policies or are in the process of developing or updating them in light of experience gained
over the past couple decades. By comparison, fewer agencies or institutions do not have human rights
policies, although some may mention human rights in documents or may work on human rights in
indirect ways.



The 2007 “OECD DAC Action-Oriented Policy Paper on Human Rights” elaborates 10 principles to
serve as basic orientations in areas where harmonized donor action is of particular importance (OECD


                                                                                                           4
2007; see also chapter 4). Given their place in many states’ domestic legal and policy frameworks,
human rights may play a part in setting national development priorities whose implementation donors
can support, as well as positions these donors may seek to advance in multilateral settings. In addition,
a strong congruence exists between, on the one hand, building partners’ capacity and ensuring that aid
does not undermine national capacities and, on the other, the principle that states are the primary duty-
bearers and that aid can be used to assist them in meeting their human rights obligations.



Why have so many agencies adopted human rights policies? The principal reason cited by donors is the
changing international context and the growing prominence of international human rights commitments,
as evidenced in the brief overview above of international milestones and pronouncements of recent
years. Human rights remained a highly politicized issue during the Cold War, which saw a division
emerge between states that prioritized civil and political rights and those that promoted economic, social,
and cultural rights.



At the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, a consensus was reached that “All human
rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated” (UN 1993), implying that states and
their aid agencies should not prioritize one set of rights over the other. The Vienna Declaration also
affirmed that:



      Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are
      interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The international community should support the
      strengthening and promoting of democracy, development and respect for human rights and
      fundamental freedoms in the entire world. (UN 1993)



The 20-year anniversary of the Vienna Declaration was in 2013. The outcome document of the Vienna
World Conference underscored the progress made on a number of aspects of the Vienna Declaration,
including in recognition of the links between human rights and development and the need for states to
“ensure that any sustainable development framework [. . .] are aligned with economic, social, cultural,
civil, political and environmental human rights as a non-negotiable base” (UN Vienna + 20 2013).




                                                                                                         5

 The 25th Anniversary of the Right to Development

 December 2011 marked the 25th anniversary of the UN Declaration on the Right to Development,
 which in 1986 reoriented development to be centred on people. In anticipation of this anniversary, 18
 intergovernmental organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations issued a joint
 statement that reaffirmed the commitments made in the 2010 Millennium Development Goals (MDG)
 outcome document and that the right to development is “an inalienable human right by virtue” (UN
 2011b). It states that their work is guided by the human rights principles of non-discrimination,
 equality, participation, transparency, and accountability. It further emphasises that “this Declaration
 has provided normative underpinnings for a human-centred approach to development. Human
 development and human rights are embedded and reinforce each other conceptually and in practice,
 helping to secure the well-being and dignity of all people” (Source: UN 2011b)



The UN interagency statement was preceded by a July 2011 joint statement of nine chairpersons of UN
treaty bodies that reflects on the interdependence and indivisibility of civil, political, economic, social,
and cultural rights. The chairpersons resolved to:

      promote a development-informed and interdependence-based reading of all human rights treaties
      so as to highlight and emphasise the relevance and importance of the right to development in
      interpreting and applying human rights treaty provisions and in monitoring compliance with these
      provisions.



In, 2010 UN member states took stock of the progress made toward achievement of the MDGs. The
2010 World Summit outcome document on human rights acknowledges



      that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system
      and the foundations for collective security and well-being. We recognise that development, peace
      and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. We reaffirm that our
      common fundamental values, including freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for all
      human rights, respect for nature and shared responsibility, are essential for achieving the

                                                                                                          6
      Millennium Development Goals. (UN 2010)



The outcome document of the 2015 World Summit, Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development, proclaims the development Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The
SDG Declaration makes repeated references to human rights and recalls the links between human rights
and development. The preamble of the SDG framework proclaims:



     The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 targets . . . seek to realize the human rights of all
     and to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. They are integrated
     and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development: the economic, social
     and environmental.



Elsewhere, the document states: “we envisage a world of universal respect for human rights and
human dignity, the rule of law, justice, equality and non-discrimination; of respect for race, ethnicity
and cultural diversity; and of equal opportunity permitting the full realization of human potential and
contributing to shared prosperity.”



Also significant is the SDG declaration’s clear affirmation of the agenda’s foundation in international
human rights law:

        The new Agenda is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
        including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of
        Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium Declaration and the 2005
        World Summit outcome document. It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration
        on the Right to Development.

Note: The term “policy” is employed broadly here to include a range of types of policies, from
those establishing binding requirements to those embodying general principles that serve as
guidance, as well as policies containing both.



As illustrated by the 1997 DAC statement that “Respect for human rights is seen as an objective in its
own right but also as a critical factor for the longer-term sustainability of development activities” (OECD
1997), there are two main rationales for agencies’ work on human rights as part of development
cooperation: intrinsic and instrumental. Although the rationales are discussed separately here, they are
not mutually exclusive and can be linked in policy and practice, with various rationales often used in
combination.




                                                                                                        11
Intrinsic Rationales

Intrinsic rationales have their origin in moral or ethical norms, which are reflected in legal obligations
that form part of the international human rights framework for the protection of the equal dignity of all
human beings. The universal framework of common values was reaffirmed at the 2005, 2010, and 2015
UN World Summits and includes the values of freedom, equality, solidarity, and tolerance.



All states that are party to international human rights instruments have a duty to respect, protect, and
fulfil human rights, including doing so through international cooperation. The UN, which is the
guarantor of the international human rights system, has since 1997 worked to mainstream human rights
in all its activities. Since 2005, there have been repeated calls for further mainstreaming of human rights
throughout the UN system, for strengthening the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights
(OHCHR), and for closer cooperation between OHCHR and all relevant UN bodies (UN 2005). The
2010 UN World Summit reaffirmed the concept that respect for all human rights is essential for
achieving the MDGs (UN 2010). This message was further reaffirmed in the 2015 UN Summit on
Sustainable Development, during which a new agenda for development was affirmed to be “grounded
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the Millennium
Declaration and the 2005 World Summit Outcome. It is informed by other instruments such as the
Declaration on the Right to Development” (UN Sustainable Development Summit 2015, September 27,
2015, New York). The 2003 UN interagency definition of a human rights–based approach (HRBA)
explicitly states that development cooperation should further the realization of human rights as laid out
in international human rights instruments (Box 1.2).



Several bilateral agencies have embraced the view that development and human rights are interlinked
and that aid should be used to foster human rights objectives. As the review of international conferences
and pronouncements in Box 1.3 illustrates, there is growing recognition of the intrinsic importance of
human rights in a range of contexts. Nevertheless, the fact that a normative agenda is increasingly
pursued under a HRBA does not necessarily result in an emphasis on human rights as a legal obligation
or as the subject of binding international treaty obligations in the context of development cooperation
for either donors or partners (McInerney-Lankford 2009, 2013).




                                                                                                        12
Not all aid agencies accept that they are under a legal obligation to respect, protect, promote, and fulfil
human rights through their assistance, and intrinsic arguments are not limited to legal ones: the concept
of humanity underlying the human rights framework is a strong ethical force behind most policies.
Ethical arguments thus reinforce a positive association between human rights and aid, centred on human
dignity and the need to combat poverty. Political factors can also drive agencies to integrate human
rights, for example, when there is public outcry over substantial amounts of aid given to governments
that use excessive force against their own citizens or that pursue discriminatory policies.



Intrinsic reasons also include arguments in which the realization of human rights is seen as constitutive
of development:

     Drawing on Sen’s capabilities framework (1999), the Human Development Report 2000 highlights
      the common vision and common purpose of human development and human rights “to secure the
      freedom, well-being and dignity of all people everywhere” (UNDP 2000).
     The multidimensional definition of poverty in the DAC Guidelines on Poverty Reduction can be
      mapped to the various human rights codified under the international framework (OECD 2001).
      These guidelines and other DAC documents describe human rights, along with governance,
      democracy, and the rule of law, as part of the qualitative elements of development.
     The World Bank’s Voices of the Poor reports confirmed that poor people care about civil and
      political rights, such as safety and security, as much as they care about food and water and that
      safety and security are legitimate poverty reduction goals (Narayan 2000; Narayan et al. 2000;
      Narayan and Petesch 2002).



As aid agencies have become more familiar with the human rights framework, human rights
organizations have started to address poverty and development more directly. The Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has taken a particular interest in poverty reduction, and
international human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International and
Human Rights Watch are increasingly addressing economic, social, and cultural rights.




                                                                                                        13
 Box 1.4

 UN Interagency Common Understanding of a HRBA

 1. All programmes of development cooperation, policies and technical assistance should further the
 realization of human rights as put forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
 international human rights instruments.

 2. Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of
 Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development cooperation
 and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process.

 3. Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of “duty-bearers” to
 meet their obligations and/or of “rights-holders” to claim their rights.

 a. The human rights principles identified in this agreement are universality and inalienability;
 indivisibility; interdependence and interrelatedness; equality and non-discrimination; participation
 and inclusion; accountability; and rule of law.

 (Source: UN 2003).




Instrumental Rationales

The instrumental rationale recognizes the value of the international human rights framework but argues
that a focus on human rights can improve processes and outcomes in relation to development assistance,
security, risk management, aid effectiveness, and other international policy priorities. Human rights can
therefore be seen as a means to an end, such as sustainable development or as part of upholding a
principle of “do no harm.” With a traditional focus on civil and political rights, the integration of human
rights in development can contribute to good governance and integrity initiatives or efforts to combat
corruption, for instance. Human rights frameworks help people hold duty-bearers accountable, inasmuch
as the frameworks empower individuals and communities to demand that the state respect, protect, and
fulfil human rights.




                                                                                                        14
For some agencies, such as the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), the Austrian
Development Cooperation (ADC), and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA),
human rights are defined as a subcategory of governance. Some agencies pursue human rights objectives
in development cooperation through governance (Irish Aid 2009) The human rights principles of
accountability, rule of law, and participation are seen as contributing to more effective, legitimate, and
accountable governance (World Bank 2010). The Swedish International Development Cooperation
Agency (Sida) closely links democracy and human rights objectives. Sida considers that poverty,
understood in its broadest sense, is a state wherein almost all human rights are violated and that a lack
of democracy leads to greater poverty in the long term. Under the umbrella of “democratic governance,”
Sida supports initiatives on human rights, democratization, rule of law, people’s participation, and good
governance, all of which are seen to contribute to poverty reduction and to highlight the political
dimensions of development.



Arguments for integrating human rights into instrumental development cooperation hold that such
integration can help to achieve more effective poverty reduction and better social outcomes. A
commitment to human rights calls for urgent steps to tackle extreme poverty and social exclusion, which
violate human dignity and the human rights of the poorest. The outcome documents of the 2010 UN
Summit on the Millennium Development Goals (UN 2010), the 2015 World summit proclaiming the
SDGs, and the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit on Social Development all set out international
commitments in this area. A focus on vulnerable and excluded groups and the principles of universality,
equality and non-discrimination, participation, and inclusion are particularly relevant here. The UK
Department for International Development (DFID) has emphasized an empowerment approach aimed
at participation, inclusion, and realizing the rights of the very poorest (DFID 2000). SDC’s policy
strengthens its commitment to empowerment and participation by explicit reference to human rights
(SDC 2006).



Agency statements often argue that a focus on human rights can improve the coherence, quality, and
effectiveness of aid. For example, Dutch policy highlights the links between human rights, foreign
policy, and development, and the use of political instruments to achieve both human rights and
development objectives.




                                                                                                       15
III.    LEGAL AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS

Donor agencies endorse different rationales for working on human rights and development to different
degrees and in different ways. Some agencies point to legal constraints to explain limited or implicit
approaches. For example, some agencies are concerned that there may be conflicts with their mandate
due to political prohibitions in their constituent instruments if they work explicitly on human rights. In
the World Bank, as in some other international financial institutions, human rights have traditionally
been seen as political, and therefore outside of its mandate because of the political prohibitions contained
in its Articles of Agreement.



Some agencies argue that existing human development initiatives already contribute to economic and
social rights. Several of the World Bank World Development Reports (WDR) address human rights
themes: the WDR 2006, on equity (World Bank 2005a) makes explicit reference to human rights, and
both the WDR 2012, on gender, and the WDR 2013, on jobs, address the relevance of human rights to
their themes. Other examples of development activities that map substantively to human rights but do
not employ the explicit language of human rights are interventions focused on particular groups, such
as indigenous peoples (World Bank 2005b), persons with disabilities (World Bank and WHO, 2011),
and HIV/AIDS (World Bank 2011d; 2012a). An important World Bank initiative is the Nordic Trust
Fund (NTF), created in 2008 to serve as an internal “knowledge and learning initiative” to help develop
an informed view among Bank staff on how human rights relate to the Bank’s core work (for further
discussion of the NTF, see chapter 3).



Some agencies must adopt explicit human rights policies and approaches because of their legal
framework, as with a number of European financial institutions. Financial institutions of the European
Union, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), are bound by the 2009 Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union to respect and promote the charter’s rights and principles. For EU member
states, integrating human rights into all external policies, including development cooperation, is a
requirement of the Lisbon Treaty, and the EU is committed to promoting and protecting human rights
outside its borders, in accordance with its founding principles (see Box 1.5). As a result, the EU seeks
to mainstream human rights concerns into all its policies and programmes as recently reaffirmed in the
EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy adopted by the Council in 2015. The EIB’s Statement
of Environmental and Social Principles and Standards (EIB 2009) sets forth the Bank’s human rights
approach generally. The Statement of Environmental and Social Principles and Standards (EIB 2009) is

                                                                                                         16
implemented in part by five Social Assessment Guidance Notes (attached to the EIB’s Environmental
and Social Practices Handbook) on issues that cover some human rights concerns: involuntary
resettlement; rights and interests of vulnerable groups; labour standards; occupational and community
health and safety; and public consultation and participation.




Box 1.5

EU Approach to Human Rights and Development

The European Union is committed to supporting democracy and human rights in its external relations,
in accordance with its founding principles of liberty, democracy, and respect for human rights,
fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law. The EU seeks to mainstream human rights concerns into
all its policies and programmes, and it has different human rights policy instruments for specific
actions—including financing specific projects through the EU financial instruments.

(Source: European Parliament 2015).




Preambular language in the foundational legal instrument of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) notes that contracting parties are “[c]ommitted to the fundamental principles of
multiparty democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economies” (EBRD 1990).
The document further describes the EBRD’s mission as to facilitate the transition toward market
economies in member countries committed to democracy and pluralism. This mission enables the EBRD
to emphasize human rights in the course of its work. Although the EBRD does not have an explicit
human rights policy, its emphasis on political and civil rights is reflected in the EBRD’s Procedures to
Implement the Political Aspects of the Mandate of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD 1991) and Political Aspects of the [EBRD’s] Mandate in Relation to Ethnic
Minorities (EBRD 1993). Additional attention is paid to specific human rights in the EBRD’s
Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD 2008), as well as its Gender Action Plan (EBRD 2010).



Although the Council of Europe Bank (CEB) does not have a foundational document explicitly

                                                                                                     17
establishing human rights responsibilities for the bank, the CEB is institutionally grounded in human
rights through the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The CEB is administered under the
authority of the Council of Europe, the main purpose of which is to promote human rights, democracy,
and rule of law. The secretary general of the Council of Europe is required to review every project
application to assess whether it conforms to the political and social aims of the Council of Europe (CEB
2010a). The CEB’s human rights framework includes loan regulations that require projects to conform
to the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
the European Social Charter (CEB 2010a). These contractual covenants are a unique feature: the CEB
can suspend, cancel, or demand early reimbursement of a loan if a project’s implementation leads to a
human rights violation (see, e.g., CEB Loan Regulations, Article 3.3(g)(iii)). The CEB’s Environmental
Policy mandates that “the CEB will not knowingly finance projects which are identified as undermining
human rights” (CEB 2010b).



Legal constraints are often related to political ones. Not all partner countries may be receptive to having
development cooperation linked to human rights considerations. Moreover, domestic political
environments in donor countries may be more or less conducive to grounding aid in an international
human rights framework. For example, Sweden’s global policy, which requires that a “rights
perspective” (a type of HRBA) be integrated into all aspects of foreign policy (including aid) contrasts
with that of the United States, where there is a more selective endorsement of the international human
rights framework, as illustrated by the non-ratification of the International Covenant on Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and other international
instruments. This means that the poverty reduction efforts of the US Agency for International
Development (USAID) cannot be conceptualized from the perspective of economic and social rights and
obligations.



Nonetheless, aid agencies are working on aspects of the human rights agenda (either narrowly on civil
or political rights, or without using explicit human rights language) or are considering how to adapt their
policy frameworks. The processes of stocktaking or mainstreaming of human rights work (without an
overarching policy) are among the entry points (Box 1.6).



Some agencies have not adopted human rights policies for pragmatic reasons. For example, Australia


                                                                                                        18
engages in international dialogue on human rights and provides grant funding to NGOs and human rights
institutions based or operating in developing countries. In 2011–2012, Australia provided AUS $3.7
million through its Human Rights Grants Scheme to fund 41 projects in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East,
and Africa. Although Australia does not have a stand-alone human rights policy, enhancing human rights
is included within Effective Governance, one of five core strategic goals of the Australian aid
programme (AusAID 2012). Human rights principles are also applied in AusAID’s Gender Thematic
Strategy (AusAID 2011a), as well as in AusAID’s Development for All Strategy, which reflects the
rights-based approach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (AusAID 2008).
Australia’s Humanitarian Action Policy highlights protecting the safety, dignity, and rights of affected
populations as core to its humanitarian action and includes, as a guiding principle, a commitment to
working with governments and humanitarian partners to advocate for the rights and protection of
affected populations (AusAID 2011b).



The further development or implementation of agencies’ human rights policies presents empirical
challenges. Some aid agency staff consider that aid or national policies based on human rights standards
may constrain, rather than facilitate, poverty reduction, conflict resolution, or other objectives; others
worry that the introduction of human rights principles and considerations may alienate partner countries
or complicate aid partnerships. Particular outcomes in, for example, health or education may be hindered
or jeopardized by scrutinizing the processes by which such outcomes are reached; some people argue
that social spending on economic and social rights goals can slow economic growth and that labour
standards can result in incentives with a negative impact on growth (e.g., if the minimum wage is set too
high, or if implementing health and safety standards is prohibitively expensive for employers).
Nevertheless, more recent thinking highlights the ways in which a lack of emphasis on processes and a
lack of concern for discrimination, exclusion, and inequality can hinder the achievement of sustainable
development outcomes.



Pragmatic and empirical challenges are more amenable to evidence-based discussions than legal and
political ones are. Research and multidisciplinary exchanges can contribute to the development and
application of policies so as to reach a wider set of agency staff and partners (Box 1.5).




                                                                                                       19
 Box 1.6

 Entry Points for Human Rights in the Absence of Policy Statements

 “Protection from abuse”—whether in international conflicts, human trafficking, internally displaced
 people, or the rule of law—is an entry point for USAID, which compiled a list of human rights
 interventions and appointed human rights advisers in its Office of Transition Initiatives.




The World Food Programme (WFP) does not have an explicit human rights policy but does have policy
frameworks that relate directly or indirectly to human rights, such as the 2008–2013 WFP Strategic Plan,
which states that food security shall be delivered “in ways that contribute to the safety and dignity of
affected populations.” The WFP’s protection approach is consistent with human rights -based
programming, including a right-to-food approach (WFP 2010). WFP implemented the Protection
Project, funded through external sources, which engages in the training of WFP staff and partners on
protection (including trainings of trainers), a study on gender-based violence in the context of food
assistance in displacement settings, and continuous programme support, such as assessment,
implementation, and monitoring tools, to country offices. Thus far, the project guidance and tools have
been mainstreamed at the field level in country offices; the next step is to incorporate them at
headquarters (particularly as part of the monitoring process; UNDG-HRM 2011; now UNDG-HRWG).
Similarly, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) does not have a
human rights mainstreaming policy but has other strategic tools, such as Voluntary Guidelines on the
Right to Food (FAO 2005), which represent a consensus on how to achieve the right to adequate food
and how to promote it in the context of food security (UNDG-HRM 2011).



Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has not adopted an explicit and overarching human
rights mainstreaming policy, it launched a mainstreaming process in the context of its reform process,
which brings together gender, equity, and human rights. A team, responsible for institutional
mainstreaming and located within the Office of the Assistant Director-General, Family, Women’s and
Children’s Health Cluster, was established to play a central role in fostering greater cooperation across
the organization. It stimulates action with headquarters departments, regional offices, and through the


                                                                                                      20
regional offices, with WHO country offices and their national counterparts (WHO 2012).




 Box 1.7

 Building the Evidence Base for Human Rights Policies

 The Asia-Pacific Regional Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights developed the
 Lessons Learned Project (in collaboration with several other organizations) to help integrate human
 rights policy and practice in all UN activities. Project staff culled programmes and projects of the
 UN system and its many partners for experiences in using a HRBA to development. Project activities
 included writing up the lessons learned (both positive and negative) and provision of assistance to
 UN country teams (UNCTs) across the region (Source: Banerjee 2005; UNESCO 2008b).




The World Bank Development Research Group continues to focus on the role of judiciaries and legal
institutions in promoting state accountability (World Bank 2011a), the impact of legal strategies to claim
economic and social rights (World Bank 2011c), administrative law mechanisms for redressing
complaints regarding the provision of basic services (World Bank 2011b), and the costs of compliance
with human rights treaties (World Bank 2011c). Other research addresses the impacts of HRBAs (World
Bank 2012b). The World Bank published a study on the relevance of human rights indicators for
development that also provides an overview of methodological approaches on human rights
measurement (World Bank 2010b). The World Bank Institute found that “there are consistent,
statistically significant and empirically large effects of civil liberties on investment project rates of
return,” that state capture impairs socioeconomic development, and that “the extent of capture and crony
bias is related to the degree of civil liberties in a country” (Kaufmann 2005). The European Parliament
has observed that “some empirical evidence suggests that the conditions in free and pluralistic societies
are more conducive to socio economic progress and to respecting economic and social rights” (European
Parliament 2015).



The UNDG Human Rights Working Group’s Mainstreaming Human Rights in Development—Stories
from the Field illustrates the various ways in which UN actors can mainstream human rights in practice
and the value such action brings to development results. This initiative captured field results and
highlighted the critical role that UNCTs play in supporting efforts by national actors to integrate human


                                                                                                       21
rights into national development programmes and policies, while drawing on the UN system’s unique
convening power, normative role, and impartiality. The publication is a direct response to UNCTs’
request for evidence-based guidance on human rights mainstreaming. It is a step forward in documenting
experiences, one that focuses on impact.     Further to this, a UPR follow-up assistance strategy was
developed to ensure that the recommendations inform national development policies and programmes,
as well as the United Nations Development Assistance Plan (UNDAP 2011–2015). Mainstreaming
Human Rights in Development—Stories from the Field shows how UNCTs were able to assist national
partners in following up on recommendations from the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and other
human rights mechanisms, including on complex issues such as discrimination and social inclusion
(Moldova), prison reform (Uruguay), and access to education for ethnic minorities (Vietnam). In
Tanzania, the UPR process provided an opportunity for the UNCT to support the government in
conducting an inclusive and participatory consultation process and to draw on recommendations to
inform development efforts. The case studies of Kenya and the Philippines illustrate efforts to link
international human rights norms and principles with specific development programmes and policies at
the sectoral level—on water and sanitation in the Philippines and at the level of the national development
plan in Kenya. UNCTs in Ecuador, Kenya, and the Philippines are moving beyond applying a HRBA to
only UN programming. At the request of the respective governments, these teams are supporting national
partners in applying the approach to national development policies and processes as well.



Constitutional and Legislative Initiatives

The impetus to integrate human rights into development policy may come from partner country
initiatives. Donors and partners often work together on domestic legal initiatives related to human rights
that aim to support sustainable development. These initiatives draw from the international human rights
framework or sometimes from international human rights initiatives. The right to water is an example
of the potential for interplay between the domestic and international law spheres.



At the international level, the right to water is considered to be protected under the International
Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) Articles 11 and 12, which provide for
the “right to an adequate standard of living” and the “right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of physical and mental health,” respectively. The right to water and sanitation was
explicitly recognised in 2010 by UN General Assembly resolution 64/292, which acknowledges that
clean drinking water and sanitation are critical to the fulfilment of all human rights (UN 2010f).

                                                                                                       22
At the national level, constitutional provisions explicitly requiring the protection or provision of clean
water are found in at least 17 nations, including Kenya. The German Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development-funded a project to promote good governance implemented by Deutsche
German Agency for International Development (GIZ). The Kenyan-German water programme, also
implemented by GIZ, continues to support efforts to further implement Kenya’s human rights
obligations related to the right to water into national law, policy, and regulation as aligned with the
constitution. In South Africa, the right to water is explicitly enshrined in its 1996 constitution and is
enforceable in the courts. Several countries have incorporated the right to water in their national laws
and policy, making the right easier to enforce (Boyd 2011; see Box 1.8).




 Box 1.8

 Enforcing the Right to Water in Argentina

 In many instances where there is no explicit constitutional right to water, courts have found that the
 right to water is implicitly included as a fundamental prerequisite to enjoying other explicitly
 protected rights. For example, the drinking water in a poor community in Argentina (Chacras de la
 Merced) was being contaminated by inadequate wastewater treatment. An NGO filed a lawsuit
 against the upstream municipality and the province alleging a violation of the local residents’
 constitutional right to a healthy environment. The court found that there was a violation of the right
 and ordered the government to upgrade the treatment plan and provide clean water to the local
 residents in the interim. The government met its obligation, and the municipality subsequently passed
 a law requiring all future sewage and sanitation tax revenue to be invested in improvements and
 maintenance of the sewage system (Source: Boyd 2011).




In some instances, development cooperation of a technical sort may result in human rights–relevant legal
initiatives at the domestic level. For instance, Australia credits workshops sponsored by the All China
Women’s Federation and Australia-China Human Rights Technical Cooperation with the passage of
laws on domestic violence by the local-level Peoples’ Congress (AusAID 2006). Since 2004, CIDA has

                                                                                                       23
supported the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) Southeast Asia Programme (CEDAW SEAP)
to help governments, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and partners within the UN system and the
international community facilitate better implementation of CEDAW to advance women’s rights in
Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Timor-Leste.




Box 1.9

Justiciability of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ESCR)

One obstacle to the full realization of economic, social, and cultural rights is their justiciability and legal
enforceability. The 2008 Optional Protocol to the ICESCR created a mechanism for individuals to file
individual communications (complaints) for violations of ESCR under the ICESCR with the Committee
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (UN 2008b). However, the protocol will not enter into force
until 10 parties have ratified it; at the time of publication, only three states had.



At national levels, similar challenges have been raised about the justiciability of ESCR enshrined in a
national constitution (see Box 1.9). The Grootboom decision (Government of Republic of South Africa
and Others v. Grootboom and Others 2000 (11) BCLR 1169 (CC)) by the South African Constitutional
Court in 2000 was the first to recognize that such rights are justiciable and that remedies can be found
to compensate victims for violations of ESCR. The decision also confirmed the obligations of the state
to provide for ESCR regardless of budgetary or other limitations (UNDP and OHCHR 2011). Basing its
decision on Section 26 of the South African Constitution, the high court held that “Everyone has the
right to have access to adequate housing; and the state must take reasonable legislative and other
measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this right.” The court
also held that “Section 26 imposed a negative duty on states not to prevent or impair the access to
housing, as well as a positive obligation to create an enabling environment for the fulfilment of this
right.”



In November 2011, the Kenyan High Court issued an important decision on the justiciability of ESCR,
highlighting that the need to recognize the “interdependence [of human rights] is out of the realization
that people living without the basic necessities of life are deprived of human dignity, freedom and
equality.” The decision was grounded in the new constitution as well as in provisions of the ICESCR

                                                                                                            24
and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. The Kenyan NGO Hakijamii had filed a petition
on behalf of local community members in the Medina Location of Garissa, Kenya, who were violently
evicted and had dwellings destroyed with little notice and no due process. Affirming that any treaty
ratified by Kenya is part of Kenyan law, the court found violations of many ESCRs, inter alia, the rights
to life, adequate housing, sanitation, clean and safe water, and education. The high court issued a
permanent injunction, ordering the state to return petitioners to their land and reasonable residence and
awarding damages to the petitioners (Ibrahim Sangor Osman v. Minister of State for Provincial
Administration and Internal Security and Others, High Court of Kenya at Embu, 2011).



Efforts to engage judicial systems in the enforcement of ESCR can be expected to continue, with
institutions offering training and capacity building in relevant areas. For example, the Global School on
the Enforcement of Social and Cultural Rights, a consortium of institutions coordinated from the
University of Oslo, offers international, regional, and national trainings on litigation of ESCR, including
on litigating health-related rights.




IV.     FROM POLICY TO PRACTICE

Agencies have adopted different approaches to implementing policies, reflecting their mandates, policy
frameworks, and principal modes of engagement. The most common modality has been human rights
projects, which are usually linked to the promotion and protection of civil and political rights. Some
agencies have committed to human rights mainstreaming, which can lead agencies to work on human
rights issues in non-governance sectors. Many bilateral aid agencies also undertake some form of human
rights dialogue, often linked to their foreign policies. Where political or legal barriers to these approaches
exist, donors engage with areas, issues, or groups also covered by human rights treaty protection but
without referring explicitly to human rights or without adopting a HRBA or objective. The next chapter
offers a framework for further examination of these approaches.




                                                                                                           25
                               Chapter 2.
Preliminary Lessons: Integrating Human Rights Dimensions, Principles,
                           and Obligations


Building on the initial review of donor policies, this chapter explores in greater depth the justification
upon which donors rely for integrating human rights into development, looking at intrinsic and
instrumental rationales and conceptualizing the overlaps between human rights and development in
terms of dimensions, principles and obligations.



I.      INTRINSIC VALUE



A Shared Coherent Normative and Analytical Framework

Human rights offer a coherent normative framework that can guide development assistance. This
framework puts humans at the centre of the analysis, linked to state obligations as duty-bearers and to
citizen entitlements as rights-holders. It is a universal framework into which states enter freely, with a
jurisprudence to support decision-making. Its grounding in a consensual global legal regime creates a
normative legitimacy and consistency that is not always found in development interventions.



Considerable convergence exists between the substance of human rights treaty provisions (such as the
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights) and areas of development activity,
particularly as donors continue to expand cooperation into realms of social and human development.
Several core principles that can be derived from international, regional, and domestic human rights
instruments—participation and inclusion, accountability, equality and non-discrimination, attention to
vulnerable groups, and empowerment—are already part of the development discourse. Indeed, a human
rights–based approach (HRBA) to development analyses and addresses “the inequalities, discriminatory
practices and unjust power relations which are often at the heart of development problems” (UNDG
2011b). This overlap of substance and principle is illustrated by the principle of equality, which is central
to many international human rights instruments and embraced by development actors in pursuit of
equity, inclusion, or empowerment (McInerney-Lankford 2009).



                                                                                                          26
Although a normative agenda is increasingly pursued under HRBAs, this agenda does not necessarily
emphasize human rights as a legal obligation or as the subject of binding treaty obligations under
international law. This divergence results from legal constraints that put human rights beyond the reach
of certain agencies’ mandates, political sensitivities of connecting human rights to the development
context, the diversity of government interpretations of human rights in international contexts, and
institutional or organizational arrangements that keep human rights and development separate.



Development agencies are recognizing the analytical value of human rights: changes in project cycle
management and innovative tools have enabled agencies to ask new questions and analyse situations
differently. For example, a bridging analysis undertaken by the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM) helps define the meaning of relevant human rights standards for particular contexts; as such,
it builds development partners’ understanding of how human rights guidance can enhance existing work
(Box 2.1).




 Box 2.1

 Women’s Rights as an Entry Point to Analyse Land Reform

 UNIFEM’s bridging analysis in Central Asia enabled project staff to use the international framework
 to identify priority areas in the land reform process. The analysis pointed to the need to examine
 women’s right to land; women’s rights in relation to family; women’s access to credit; and the impact
 of stereotypes, discriminatory customs, and religious laws on women’s access to property.




Legal Obligations

The international human rights framework comprises universal and regional treaties adopted under the
aegis of the United Nations and regional bodies. Although there are differences in the levels of
ratification of different human rights treaties, and although some countries have adopted reservations,
derogations, or limitations to these instruments, the framework is shared and participated in by most
countries. It is underpinned by the concept of legal obligation and the principle of pacta sunt servanda.
Human rights law obligations, like other international treaty obligations, are voluntarily entered
commitments of states, and as such, they offer the potential of clarity and legitimacy.



                                                                                                      27
The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed member states’ “solemn commitment to fulfil their obligations to
promote universal respect for and the observance and protection of all human rights and fundamental
freedoms for all in accordance with the Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
instruments relating to human rights and international law (UN 2005a).



The human rights framework offers a clear articulation of the responsibilities of duty-bearers and the
entitlements of rights-holders, establishing a strong accountability paradigm. Depending on institutional
and country context, human rights obligations may provide a relevant frame of reference for
development in which human rights obligations relate substantively to development activities and
objectives. Definitions of rights based on legal obligations benefit from the clarity of the definition in
international treaties as well as from their elaboration in jurisprudence or in the interpretations of expert
bodies.



Even where states’ development policy frameworks incorporate an explicit commitment to human
rights, only a few explicitly incorporate human rights obligations. Notable examples are Canada’s 2008
Official Development Assistance Accountability Act, which provides that overseas development
assistance can be provided only if it is consistent with international human rights standards (Canada
2008). Building on the reference to human rights in the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) Articles of Agreement, the EBRD’s 2008 Environmental and Social Policy
precludes the bank from knowingly financing projects “that would contravene obligations under
international treaties and agreements related to environmental protection, human rights and sustainable
development.” Similarly, the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB)’s human rights framework
includes loan regulations that require projects to adhere to the Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the European Social Charter (CEB 2010a). The European
Union’s approach to integrating human rights into its policies and approaches to development
cooperation is grounded in legal obligations under the Lisbon Treaty. Since the early 1990s, policies
have become more systematic and refined. The 2006 European Consensus on Development recognises
human rights as an intrinsic element of sustainable development, and the complementary 2011 Agenda
for Change makes human rights, governance, and related concepts a major pillar of EU development
cooperation. The 2012 Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy and the Action Plan was
followed by the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy adopted by the Council in 2015. It

                                                                                                          28
reaffirms the EU’s commitment to mainstreaming human rights across all policies and include a pledge
to intensify efforts to promote social and economic rights.



As the EU’s financing institution, the European Investment Bank (EIB) is committed to upholding the
highest human-rights standards in its activities. In its capacity as an EU body, the EIB is directly bound
by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, an instrument that enjoys the rank of an EU treaty, in
accordance with Article 51(1) of EIB charter. In contrast to other international financial institutions and
multilateral development banks, the EIB is thus embedded in the institutional framework of the EU. As
such, its actions are subject to review by the European Ombudsman and to the jurisdiction of the Court
of Justice of the EU.



Operational Human Rights Principles

Many bilateral agencies, such as the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)
and the UK Department for International Development (DFID), have been successful in programming
around operational human rights principles. With slight variations, these operational human rights
principles are a combination of the principles found in the UN Interagency Common Understanding of
an HRBA). At the sector level, principles derived from the comments of UN treaty-monitoring bodies
about economic and social rights (e.g., accessibility, adaptability acceptability, affordability of services)
offer promising concepts around which development programming can be effectively organized.
German bilateral cooperation has demonstrated the use of these principles in a series of Promising
Practices (GTZ 2009b).



For agencies that have not adopted explicit human rights policies, operational principles offer a strategy
for working on human rights in an implicit manner. This is the case with the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights:

                 A range of agencies linked formally or informally to the State may
                 provide support and services to business activities. These include export
                 credit agencies, official investment insurance or guarantee agencies,
                 development agencies and development finance institutions. Where these
                 agencies do not explicitly consider the actual and potential adverse impacts


                                                                                                          29
                 on human rights of beneficiary enterprises, they put themselves at risk—in
                 reputational, financial, political and potentially legal terms—for supporting
                 any such harm, and they may add to the human rights challenges faced by
                 the recipient State. (2011 UNGP)



It is important to distinguish operational principles that might be tangentially related to human rights
from interventions specifically grounded in the human rights framework. There is a risk of “rhetorical
repackaging” when every single intervention aimed at enhancing accountability, by using a participatory
approach or channelling aid through civil society organizations, is described as “rights based,” or by
arguing that a donor is contributing to social and economic rights simply because of investment in
schools or jobs creation. Such interventions need to be related to specific state obligations in order to be
categorized as contributing to the realization of human rights. There may also be a risk of understating
the indirect, positive human rights impact of projects undertaken with an implicit human rights approach.
For instance, an Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) independent review
concluded that its country programmes and thematic areas often included a HRBA, but that the agency
had failed to communicate the approach (Government of Australia 2011).



The UN Interagency Common Understanding of a HRBA offers a useful framework for distinguishing
between elements that are unique and clearly linked to the human rights framework and elements that
are essential but shared with other perspectives and are more commonly found in development. Unique
elements include using recommendations of international human rights bodies and mechanisms,
assessing the capacity of rights-holders to claim their rights and those of duty-bearers to fulfil their
obligations, and developing strategies to build these capacities. Essential elements include recognizing
people as key actors in their own development (rather than as passive recipients of commodities and
services) and valuing participation, empowerment, and bottom-up processes, generally considered good
programming practices.



One example of an operational human rights principle is the principle of meaningful participation.
HRBAs are often associated with the adoption of participatory techniques. DFID, for example, invested
in “participatory rights assessment methodologies” that were piloted in Peru and Malawi. The United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) adopted a participatory community development strategy in parts
of Africa and CIDA has emphasized child participation in its development interventions aimed at child

                                                                                                         30
protection (Box 2.2) In addition to approaches that aim to contribute to the empowerment of poor and
vulnerable populations, the integration of human rights calls for free, informed, and meaningful
participation that can be institutionalized and can affect public policy choices (Box 2.3). More traditional
human rights projects in support of civic education or election processes have also contributed to this
process.




 Box 2.2 CIDA’s Work on Child Participation

 Child rights programming by donors and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as Save the
 Children has emphasized child participation. For example, the Canadian International Development
 Agency (CIDA) funded child participation pilot projects as part of the implementation of its 2001
 Action Plan on Child Protection (CIDA 2001a). CIDA has also supported the participation of children
 in research, international conferences, and policy dialogue.



 In some cases, such support has led to outcomes that were not anticipated. In CIDA’s Egypt pilot, it
 was observed that child labour often benefited children and their families. (Save the Children had the
 same finding). Rather than calling for abolition, the project supports working children to improve
 their learning and working conditions. Children are taught to identify labour hazards and to design
 healthy responses. At the national level, the Egyptian government has asked the CIDA project for
 expertise on a methodology for a participatory, rights-oriented national strategy for children (see
 chapter 8).




                                                                                                         31
II.     INSTRUMENTAL VALUE

Apart from the intrinsic value that human rights may bring to development practices, human rights may
be instrumentally useful in promoting good governance, managing risk, reducing poverty, and
improving aid effectiveness.



Governance

Governance issues and human rights are mutually reinforcing (Box 2.3). A transparent and accountable
environment in which individuals can claim and exercise their rights defines good governance. Human
rights principles and frameworks can support improved governance because they highlight the
demarcations between institutions and their constituents; they can underscore lines of responsibility and
promote transparency so that individuals are empowered to hold their governments accountable. The
international community has made the interconnection between good governance, human rights, and
sustainable development directly or indirectly in a number of declarations and global conference
documents. For example, the Declaration on the Right to Development proclaims that every human
person and all people “are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural
and political development” (Article 1). In the Millennium Declaration, world leaders affirmed their
commitment to promoting democracy and strengthening the rule of law as well as to respecting
internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development;
it proclaimed that “the MDGs [Millennium Development Goals] have to be situated within the broader
norms and standards of the Millennium Declaration,” including those on “human rights, democracy and
good governance.” Moreover, from a human rights perspective, the concept of good governance can be
linked to principles and rights set out in the main international human rights instruments, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ICCPR and the ICESCR (OHCHR Governance and
Human Rights 2016)




                                                                                                       32
 Box 2.3

 How Are Good Governance and Human Rights Linked?

 Good governance and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Human rights principles provide values
 to guide the work of governments and other political and social actors. They also provide
 performance standards against which these actors may be held accountable. Moreover, human rights
 principles inform the content of good governance efforts: human rights principles may inform the
 development of legislative frameworks, policies, programmes, budgetary allocations, and other
 measures. However, human rights cannot be respected and protected in a sustainable manner without
 good governance. The implementation of human rights relies on a conducive and enabling
 environment. Such an environment includes appropriate legal frameworks and institutions as well as
 political, managerial, and administrative processes responsible for responding to the rights and needs
 of the population. The links between good governance and human rights can be organized around
 four areas: democratic institutions; service delivery; rule of law; and anticorruption.

 (Source: OHCHR, 2013)




Links between the State and Its Citizens

Donor interventions tend to work either on the supply side (e.g., reforming state institutions to make
them more effective) or on the demand side (e.g., civil-society advocacy campaigns that promote
responsive governance). A HRBA helps break this artificial distinction by linking demand and supply
through the conceptual lens of rights-holders, duty-bearers, and citizenship (Box 2.4).




                                                                                                     33
Box 2.4

Combining Citizen Awareness with the State’s Ability to Deliver

Citizens must be registered so that they can legitimately demand their entitlements and rights. In
Bolivia, DFID and other donors funded a project designed to provide identification documents to
undocumented Bolivians (in particular, the poor, women, and indigenous peoples) and to raise
awareness about citizen rights among civil society, registration officials, and members of the electoral
court. The project also developed the capacity of the court and registration service to handle the 2004-
2005 referendum and municipal elections.

In Peru, DFID supported mechanisms of citizen participation and the formal institutions of
representative democracy. It worked with a coalition of state and civil society organizations to facilitate
electoral education and oversight during presidential, congressional, regional, and municipal elections.
The project helped strengthen citizenship by involving the poor in the electoral process. At the same
time, DFID helped transform the institutional and legal framework in which the political parties operated
by bringing together state and civil-society actors to seek consensus on a new Law of Political Parties
and a reform of the electoral code. It also worked directly with all involved parties.



A World Bank Nordic Trust Fund (NTF) grant explored how efforts to strengthen the capacity of the
government of Vietnam to guarantee the rights of its citizens could be reinforced by activities supporting
citizens with rights awareness (Nordic Trust Fund 2010–2011). The NTF grant enabled World Bank
staff to work with the government of Vietnam to raise awareness of rights through the media; to work
with People’s Councils, which represent citizens in holding the administration accountable; to support
public awareness and capacity-building activities that enabled citizens to use new legal instruments that
improved the access of poor and vulnerable groups to the formal justice system; and to train local civil
servants through the Institute of Human Rights of the Ho Chi Minh Political Academy.



German-funded participatory complaint surveys in Indonesia resulted in improved service delivery by
the public sector. Citizens became more aware of their rights and civil society organizations acted as
watchdogs and responsible partners at the local level. Local decision makers and service providers
learned to be accountable to citizens but also experienced the benefits of regular feedback. This feedback


                                                                                                        34
helped them seek improvement and prioritize action and gave local authorities leverage when requesting
resources from the central government (GTZ 2009b)



Accountability, Redress, and Legitimacy

Strengthening state legitimacy is fundamental to a governance agenda; respect for human rights
standards offers a source of legitimacy. Institutional channels for domestic accountability are an
important development concern, not only in the context of improved aid effectiveness (e.g., in relation
to general budget support and financial management), but also as a spur to pro-poor domestic reform
(e.g., encouragement of parliamentary involvement in poverty reduction strategies). Human rights
provide an accountability framework at the international, regional, and national (constitutional) levels,
emphasizing the need to document and monitor practices and progress regularly and providing
recommendations and opportunities for compensation or redress. This channel of accountability can be
used to hold not just states but also aid agencies accountable for their performance (see chapter 4).



Various initiatives may foster accountability processes and institutions, for example, around the rule of
law, democracy, and political participation. Denmark supports domestic accountability through several
development cooperation programmes. Other examples are programmes aimed at strengthening
democratic institutions and their accountability and facilitating the development of pluralist political
systems based on accountable and legitimate political parties (e.g., Uganda, Nepal). Sometimes
providing support to parliamentary development is a key domestic mechanism of democracy (e.g.,
Mozambique, Bangladesh, Mali); so might be promoting a democratic culture in which institutions, civil
society, and political actors interact; supporting free and fair elections; supporting a free and diverse
media as a watchdog and platform for democratic debate (e.g., Tanzania, Burkina Faso); promoting the
equal participation and voice of women and men (e.g., Niger); strengthening justice institutions (e.g.,
Mozambique, Vietnam, Mali); promoting autonomous and independent national human rights
institutions (e.g., Bangladesh); and supporting CSOs to assist people in formulating their demands,
carrying out advocacy, and/or providing legal assistance to poor and disadvantaged groups (in partner
countries).



As the Arab Spring powerfully reminded the world in 2011, democratic governance and human rights
are critical components of sustainable development and lasting peace. Countries that have ineffective

                                                                                                        35
government institutions, rampant corruption, and weak rule of law have a 30 to 45 per cent higher risk
of civil war and higher risk of extreme criminal violence than other developing countries. In fact, no
poor fragile or conflict-ridden state has achieved a single MDG.



Democracy programming is integrated throughout the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID)’s core development work; USAID focuses on strengthening and promoting
human rights, ensuring accountable and transparent governance, and fostering an independent and
politically active civil society. At the same time, USAID remain committed to fundamental democratic
empowerment activities, including supporting free and fair elections, up-to-date technology for new and
traditional media, and the rule of law. By helping societies protect the basic rights of citizens, USAID
prevents conflict, spurs economic growth, and advances human dignity. Countries with democratic
freedoms are more just, peaceful, and stable than those without—and their citizens can fulfil their
potential.



USAID is focused on:

       Supporting more legitimate, inclusive, and effective governments so that they are responsive to
        the needs of their people
       Helping countries transition to democracy and strengthen democratic institutions, capitalizing
        on critical moments to expand freedom and opportunity
       Promoting inclusive development so that women, minorities, and vulnerable populations benefit
        from growth, opportunity, and the expansion of rights



To advance these goals, USAID launched the Center of Excellence on Democracy, Human Rights, and
Governance in 2012. Designed to be a global resource for evidence-based research, the centre closely
measures and evaluates what works best in democracy, human rights, and governance and shares best
practices with the international development community.



“Do No Harm” and Risk Mitigation

The “do no harm” principle is one of the 10 key principles identified in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC)’s “Action-

                                                                                                     36
Oriented Policy Paper on Human Rights and Development,” which states that donors can “inadvertently
reinforce societal divisions, worsen corruption, exacerbate violent conflict, and damage fragile political
coalitions if issues of faith, ethnicity and gender are not taken fully into consideration” (OECD 2007a).
In this connection, the human rights framework can provide a normative baseline mandating non-
retrogression and a legal grounding for the principle of “do no harm.” This action-oriented policy paper
(AOPP) encourages donors to respect human rights principles in their policies and programming, to
identify practices that are potentially harmful, and to develop strategies for mitigating potential harm.
Some agencies have development policy frameworks that embody a principle of “do no harm” without
explicitly relying on the international human rights framework, which is the case for a number of
international financial institutions that have developed environmental and social policies and
frameworks to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and the environment in the development
process. Many of these policies provide guidelines for the institutions and their clients in the
identification, preparation, and implementation of projects and programmes (see chapter 4).



Poverty Reduction

Identifying the Root Causes of Poverty

The lessons put forward under governance issues also contribute to those related to poverty reduction,
especially in the areas of participation, empowerment, and the transformation of state-society relations.
Many studies have highlighted the analytical value of human rights for identifying the structural and
root causes of poverty. Instead of a needs-based framework, programming based on a human rights
analysis looks at states’ ability to meet their obligations as well as at their capacity a nd political will
constraints. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) develops country development
programme frameworks, in which country programmes must do a human rights analysis that takes into
account human rights commitments. Such analysis also examines citizens’ ability to claim their rights
and the cultural and social barriers that may exist. For example, DFID recognized that inequality and
exclusion represented major barriers for poverty reduction in Latin America and required tackling in
new ways.



Exposing Power Relations and the Inertia of Social Norms

Identifying root causes of poverty requires understanding the structural factors that perpetuate it, such
as the roles of elites, the abuse of state power, and gender discrimination. Donors are not always

                                                                                                         37
comfortable examining such issues explicitly, or they may not have the social or political skills to do so;
a human rights analysis can enable such an approach (Box 2.5).



Several studies point to the limitations of an approach that aims to respond only through legal or
institutional change: social norms and values (or informal power networks) are among some of the most
difficult challenges faced in achieving human rights (and pro-poor development outcomes more
generally), as illustrated by difficulties in achieving gender equality objectives.




 Box 2.5



 Water Rights in Tanzania

 In the Kileto District in Tanzania, WaterAid launched a project to improve water access for residents.
 By integrating human rights principles—in particular, participation, non-discrimination, equality,
 and empowerment—into the programming process (and including these as explicit programme
 goals), WaterAid was able to identify and eliminate underlying obstacles to equitable access to water.
 The participatory approach and analysis revealed that because of power imbalances, lack of land
 rights, and exclusion from national policy decisions, two ethnic groups were prevented access to
 water. Project members worked with the communities to overcome the intergroup conflict.




Paying Attention to the Excluded and Marginalised

Agencies have found human rights programming effective when directly tackling disparities. The human
rights principles of universality, equality, and non-discrimination require that aid programmes pay
attention to individuals and groups who are hard to reach through normal channels. These programmes
must take into account the institutional, political, economic, and social factors that lead to exclusion and
discrimination. Not least, this approach calls for greater use of disaggregated data (Box 2.6).




                                                                                                         38
Box 2.6

The Use of Data

UNICEF’s review of the implementation of a HRBA provides many examples of efforts to reduce
disparities and reach the most excluded. The review highlights the use of disaggregated data to analyse
the situation of women and children to reduce discrimination (Bangladesh); the use of school drop-out
rates, rather than enrolment, to shift policies and budgets toward adolescents excluded from the
education system (Chile); and a polio eradication campaign targeting poor Muslim children under the
age of two to reach the 5–15 per cent who had not yet been vaccinated. This outreach required specially
adapted inclusive strategies, including a new communication strategy to reach the most marginalized
families (India).



The OECD reported that Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population piloted a system to collect
disaggregated data from hospitals and other health facilities on the basis of sex, age, caste, ethnicity, and
regional identity on which groups and regions were benefiting from the abolition of fees for basic health
services and other health policies. In so doing, the ministry helped ensure that resources were addressing
underlying inequalities and were being used effectively to improve overall health outcomes.

Aid Effectiveness

Because human rights are important development goals themselves, they have instrumental value as
“critical objectives of aid effectiveness” (Ferguson 2008). This understanding was reflected in the 2007
AOPP as well as in the five principles of the Paris Declaration: ownership, mutual accountability,
alignment, harmonization, and managing for development results. The linkages between human rights
and aid effectiveness have been explored in a number of settings. In the context of the health sector,
Ferguson (2008) recommends that partner countries utilize the human rights framework to support
legislation, regulations, and policies; to identify citizen entitlements; to open up dialogue on critical
issues; and to institutionalize quasi-mechanisms for engaging civil society and monitoring the fulfilment
of rights. She further argues that donors can improve aid effectiveness by developing coherent positions
on human rights issues within agencies and between donors, acknowledging the importance of partner
and donor countries’ international human rights commitments, and ensure that programmes, at a


                                                                                                          39
minimum, do no harm.



Paragraph 13(c) of the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) lends further support to the link between human
rights and aid effectiveness, committing donors and partner countries to “ensure that their respective
development policies and programmes are designed and implemented in ways consistent with their
agreed international commitments on gender equality, human rights, disability and environmental
sustainability.”



Alignment and Harmonization

Alignment refers to a donor’s commitment to base support on partner countries’ national de velopment
strategies, institutions, and procedures. The concept requires strengthening of partner countries’
sustainable capacity, in particular in the areas of public financial management and procurement, as well
as in the increased use of partner-country systems on the part of donors. Harmonization requires donor
actions to adopt common arrangements, simplified procedures, a more effective division of labour, more
collaborative behaviour, and greater transparency.



In recent years, a greater focus has been placed on alignment and harmonization in reference to
integrating human rights into development. The Paris Declaration and the AAA encourage donors to
harmonize their approaches to cross-cutting issues. The 2007 AOPP elaborates 10 principles to guide
donors in areas where harmonization is critical (OECD 2007a; see also chapter 4). Human rights, given
their role in states’ domestic legal and policy frameworks, play a part in setting national development
priorities, which donors can assist in implementing. In addition, there is a strong congruence between,
on the one hand, building partners’ capacity and ensuring that aid does not undermine national capacities
and, on the other, the fundamental principle that states are the main duty-bearers and that aid can be used
to assist them in meeting their human rights obligations.



The DAC conducts in-depth, periodic peer reviews of all 24 member states to examine the effectiveness
of their development systems and strategies and to share good practices in light of their commitments
under the Paris Declaration and the AAA. Every four years, each member country submits to a six-
month review by two other member states. The DAC also publishes lessons learned about aid


                                                                                                        40
management challenges from across collected peer reviews. The peer reviews focus on members’
development programmes overall and do not necessarily address how human rights issues are being
integrated. For instance, reviews of the US and Portuguese programmes included only three brief
references to the term “human rights” (OECD 2010, 2011a).



Donor agencies continue to work on how to integrate human rights in various areas of development
cooperation. Box 2.7 presents some examples to illustrate how capacity development can be undertaken
from a HRBA and how policy coherence can guide interventions in this area (Box 2.8)




                                                                                                 41
 Box 2.7

 Public Expenditures and Rights Programming

 UNICEF and UNIFEM have supported a number of initiatives to develop capacity for budget
 preparation and monitoring from a rights perspective—for example, through gender (UNIFEM 2006)
 or children’s budgets—bringing together ministries of finance and social movements.



 DFID has supported the Uganda Debt Network in its monitoring of the Poverty Action Fund, through
 which a significant amount of donor resources is channelled to local levels. In Peru, DFID-supported
 taxation reform was linked to citizens’ rights and duties.




 Box 2.8

 Positive Complementarity

 Denmark’s policy and strategic framework for support of democratization and human rights,
 developed in 2009–2010, increased emphasis on a coherent approach to its normative human rights
 agenda in the support it provides both in multilateral fora and in bilateral aid. For example,
 Denmark’s promotion of “positive complementarity” strengthened domestic jurisdictions to conduct
 national investigations and trials of crimes included in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
 Court through support for capacity development provided by bilateral donors, multilateral
 organizations, and civil society.




Results-Based Management

The Paris Declaration includes a commitment to manage aid in a way that focuses on desired results and
uses information to improve decision-making. The AAA affirmed this commitment. The literature on
results-based management rarely touches on the role of human rights in conceptualizing and achieving
results. This omission may be due to a perception that human rights give attention to processes,
qualitative measures, and normative standards rather than to measurable outcomes. For example,

                                                                                                      42
agencies such as UNICEF have found that a lack of disaggregated data has constrained their ability to
target and monitor progress in equality and non-discrimination.



However, a number of agencies have worked to integrate human rights within their results-based
management frameworks (Box 2.9). There have been some attempts to use national and international
reporting on human rights commitments as part of country performance assessment frameworks, as well
as investments in disaggregated data or tracking qualitative impact and a focus on structures and
processes as well as outcomes.




Box 2.9

Denmark and UNIFEM’s Approaches to Results-Based Management

Although Denmark does not employ a HRBA in its development cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs actively supports the inclusion of human rights–related indicators in its poverty reduction
strategy paper performance assessment frameworks when it deems relevant. For example, in
Mozambique, one of several justice/law and order indicators reflected a gradual increase in the
percentage of criminal cases processed within the limits established by law. In Niger, a support
programme aimed at promoting gender equality and equity included result indicators that resulted in
removing Niger’s reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women (CEDAW) and ratifying its additional protocol. In Zambia, an indicator of improved
access to justice was expressed as a decreased ratio between prisoners on remand versus those convicted.
In 2011, Denmark launched an international research programme with the purpose of improving the
documentation of results with a focus on the five pillars of the overall strategy for Danish development
cooperation: freedom; democracy and human rights; growth and employment; gender equality; stability
and fragility; and environment and climate.



UNIFEM’s Multi-Year Funding Framework set four rights-based goals: to reduce feminized poverty
and exclusion, to end violence against women, to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS among women and
girls, and to achieve gender equality in democratic governance in times of peace and in recovery from
war. UNIFEM issued a guide for measuring results from a human rights perspective that included
recommendations on how to measure progress in building the capacity of duty-bearers and rights-


                                                                                                     43
holders. UNIFEM used CEDAW as the source of indicators and adopted a participatory approach to
planning and reporting.




Mutual Accountability

Mutual accountability refers to the individual and joint accountability of donors and partner governments
to their citizens and parliaments for development policies, strategies, and performance. The Paris
Declaration requires that partner governments use participatory processes to develop and monitor
national strategies and involve their parliaments; that donors provide transparent information on aid
flows to promote public accountability; and that both parties jointly assess progress in meeting aid
effectiveness commitments. These mutual accountability principles are fully compatible with the human
rights principles of accountability and transparency—which are reiterated in the AAA—and require
access to information as well as participation in decision-making.



Human rights norms and standards can explicitly be part of this mutual accountability framework (Box
2.10). To achieve that status requires not only that partner governments demonstrate progress in
implementing their human rights commitments but also that donors be held accountable for their
contribution to the realization of human rights in partner countries. There are several examples of
governments and agencies specifying human rights as a shared value underpinning their aid partnerships
(e.g., Finland, Netherlands, Sida, DFID, the UN system, and Germany, which in 2011 committed itself
to assess the possibility of setting up a human rights complaint mechanism). However, there are also
disagreements regarding the extent to which the international human rights framework requires donors
to be legally accountable for their human rights impacts.




Box 2.10

Human Rights and Mutual Accountability

DFID’s policy on conditionality (DFID 2005a) mentions that human rights commitments form the basis
of the aid partnership and that significant human rights violations can be used as a justification to suspend
aid. The latter aspect has caused the most discussion. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
Rwanda is one example of a mutual accountability framework. Rwanda signed MoUs with the UK, the

                                                                                                          44
Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. The UK MoU includes references to human rights as a shared
commitment of the UK and Rwanda, a wider set of commitments on the part of the UK than other donor
governments (to meet aid effectiveness principles), and explicit references to the government of
Rwanda’s human rights commitments. Of note, DFID modified its analysis for making decisions about
budget support by adding to the existing three commitments (poverty reduction and the MDGs;
respecting human rights; and improving public financial management and promoting good governance)
an additional prong: strengthening domestic accountability. Assessment of this additional criterion
entailed an evaluation of the partner government’s commitment to making government information
transparent, to engaging citizens, and to answering calls to justify their actions (DFID 2011d).



The OECD reported on two missions to Uganda performed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right
to Health: one on the government of Uganda’s action on neglected diseases and one on the health
programme of SIDA’s Ugandan office. The missions, which were facilitated by the Office of the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the World Health Organization, and the Uganda
Human Rights Commission, strengthened public accountability and ownership of the national health
strategy by enabling the engagement of Ugandan CSOs and the Ministry of Health in the strategy review
process. As a result of these missions and the broad stakeholder engagement, the Ministry of Health
included gender equality and human rights assessments in a midterm review of the sector strategy,
helping to ensure that the strategy was addressing the underlying causes of ill health in Uganda (Source:
OECD 2008b).




Accountability can be fostered through community participation. The United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka launched the AIDWATCH initiative in 2005 to empower civil society
in an effort to ensure that recovery and development occurs in environments of increased accountability,
transparency, and participation. A representative sample of beneficiaries was given basic rights
awareness training as well as advocacy and negotiation skills. They were also given access to local
authorities and grievance-redress mechanisms (UNDP 2008a). In a UNDP housing project, for example,
AIDWATCH participants were encouraged to discuss the project with field staff, ask questions, share
grievances, and make recommendations (OECD 2008b).




                                                                                                      45
III.    OTHER OPERATIONAL BENEFITS

From Direct Service Delivery to Capacity Development

Human rights considerations can highlight the importance of states’ and citizens’ capacity to deliver and
claim their rights. All too often, aid agencies and international NGOs attempt to fill in capacity gaps and
deliver services directly or to advocate for policy change in the place of domestic actors. Various case
studies of HRBAs, in particular studies commissioned by UNICEF, have consistently shown that a
HRBA helps donors and NGOs understand the need to move away from direct delivery and work at the
level of the overall legal and policy framework, institutions, and programmes. This approach is more
sustainable than others because it requires capacity to be developed beyond donor or NGO interventions
and to build an enabling environment in partner countries (See Box 2.11).




Box 2.11

Irish Aid’s Role in Aid Effectiveness

Although Irish Aid is a relatively small organization, Ireland is a leading player in implementing the aid
effectiveness principle (Agulhas 2010). Irish Aid has been a strong advocate of local ownership,
harmonization, and alignment at both policy and field levels (OECD 2009). Ireland’s 2008 Civil Society
Policy committed Irish Aid to create an enabling environment for NGOs to organize and engage with
their own broader constituencies and to support the role of NGOs in promoting participation and good
governance, pro-poor service delivery and growth, and building a constituency for development, human
rights, and social justice (OECD 2009).



A critical part of Irish Aid’s capacity building efforts is its Fellowship Training Programme (FTP),
wherein approximately 60 fellowships are awarded annually to students from Ireland’s programme
countries (public services or nongovernmental sector) to come to Ireland for postgraduate studies. Irish
Aid provided substantial inputs for a 2007 workshop on applying the Paris Declaration principles in
gender equality, environmental sustainability, and human rights. Ireland’s efforts in regard to aid
effectiveness became increasingly important after the global financial crisis forced aid agencies to
scrutinize, optimize, and reduce aid budgets (Source: Irish Aid 2009).



                                                                                                        46
Holistic and Integrated Approaches

Linking the principles of the interdependence and the interrelatedness of all human rights with
development programming, a number of studies have found that a HRBA produces operational benefits.
It encourages more integrated programming (as opposed to a “silo” approach) by examining the range
of factors that constrain the realization of particular rights. Integration may include, for example, linking
the lack of security at school with girls’ school attendance, rather than the availability or quality of
education per se. A HRBA often calls for collaboration with other agencies within a sector, between
different sectors, or across state and civil society actors (Box 2.12). In a UNICEF survey, 36 per cent of
country offices said that they had engaged in multisector programming as a result of applying a HRBA
(Raphael 2005).




Box 2.12

The “Justice Chain”

UNDP’s access to justice policy focuses on the various stages and capacities needed for citizens to move
from grievance to remedy, going through recognition of a grievance, awareness of rights, claiming,
adjudication, and enforcement. This process allows the justice system to be analysed from the
perspective not just of institutions but also of citizens and the barriers they need to overcome. Responses
may require collaboration across justice institutions; in the Asia-Pacific region, this includes working
with traditional justice.




Building New Partnerships

Uvin (2004) notes that “One of the major—and by now totally evident—consequences of a HRBA to
development is that it encourages development actors to identify different partners.” This trend
encourages donor agencies to work with wide sets of actors, often in a facilitative way to support
domestic change processes in partner countries (Box 2.13). CIDA’s Aid Effectiveness Plan directs CIDA
to delegate greater authorities to the field level as well as to use a partner country’s public systems as
much as possible (CIDA 2009b).




                                                                                                          47
Box 2.13

New Partnerships

Sida’s mainstreaming project in Kenya worked with a network of loc al partners (government, NGOs,
and the UN), acting as resource persons for its sector programmes. The project also contributed to a
national process around the Kenya National Human Rights Commission.



When UNICEF wanted to ensure accountability in Costa Rica, it joined forces with the Catholic Church,
public universities, chambers of commerce, and political leaders to come up with new social, economic,
and political proposals. In Jordan, when UNICEF found limited material available in Arabic on the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and on CEDAW, it opened discussions with the country’s
law school. There is now a mandatory course on human rights for all students, as well as courses on
CRC and CEDAW.



In Peru, the DFID country team cultivated new alliances for change and nurtured existing networks. It
brought together human rights organizations working on civil and political rights with more traditional
development and poverty reduction organizations. It supported coalitions between the state and civil
society at elections. It also supported networks of health professionals and umbrella bodies to work with
the government on health policy.




Explicitly Recognizing the Political Dimensions of Aid

A HRBA to poverty reduction is inherently political because it attempts to change power relations within
society. Recognizing that donors can be political actors raises difficult issues regarding the legitimacy
of donor action, the practice of power, and lines of accountability. DFID realized these consequences in
Peru, where there was the potential for conflict between DFID and the state (Box 2.14). Although few
aid agencies are able to act in an explicitly political manner, a number of studies, including political
economy analytic work such as Drivers of Change and Power Analyses (Dahl-Østergaard et al. 2005),
recognize the political dimensions of poverty reduction and the political role of donors pushing for pro-
poor change.


                                                                                                      48
Box 2.14

Political Party Reform in Peru

To start tackling exclusion and inequality, DFID Peru supported reform of the legal and institutional
framework and worked with political parties to help them think more about poverty and how to address
it—clearly a sensitive area for a donor. The Agora project brought together militants from a wide range
of parties to examine how to strengthen party governance. It emphasized inclusiveness by facilitating
the participation of all parties; for example, meetings were held outside Lima to encourage the
involvement of local party activists.




Reinforcing Good Programming Practices

Some of the contributions of human rights presented in this chapter can be described without using
“rights language.” The UN Interagency Common Understanding’s distinction between unique and
essential elements of a HRBA specifies what is found across good programming in general and the
specific value of the human rights normative framework.



Why do agencies prefer to maintain references to human rights? These agencies argue that a foundation
in a coherent, normative framework helps make good programming approaches non-negotiable,
consistent, and legitimate; an emphasis is often placed on economic and social rights (see Box 2.15).
Such references to human rights may create the potential to transform some of the more traditional,
technical, and beneficiary-oriented or needs-based approaches to aid.

Box 2.15

Spain’s Africa Plan, 2009–2012

Spain’s Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) has an explicit focus on human
rights, with a concentration on social and economic rights as well as women’s rights (FRIDE 2010).
Over time, it shifted its geographic focus from middle-income countries to fragile and least developed
countries. Building on the country’s Human Rights Plan (Government of Spain 2008), Spain’s Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and AECID published the Africa Plan, 2009–2012, which included
three mainstreaming objectives: human rights, gender equality, and environmental sustainability and
adaptation to climate change (Source: AECID 2010).


                                                                                                    49
IV.     ADAPTABILITY TO DIFFERENT POLITICAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTS

Aid agencies and their partners are sometimes concerned that human rights programming is simply too
difficult, for example, because of conflicts between human rights and local religion or culture or because
of certain political contexts. Yet some agencies have been able to use human rights as a tool to influence
harmful and discriminatory practices that might otherwise remain unchallenged. In the area of health
and reproductive rights, the United Nations Population Fund identified culturally sensitive ways of
promoting human rights drawing on Islamic sources in Muslim countries and distinguishing between
culture at large and harmful practices that violate women’s rights. Other agencies have adopted
approaches tailored to individual country situations. UNICEF focuses on policy, legal, and institutional
reforms in Latin America, community-level work in parts of Africa, and a progressive approach to
human rights engagement in Vietnam that underlines the importance of the time factor and non-
confrontational strategies (Box 2.16 and chapter 6).




Box 2.16

UNICEF’s Work in Vietnam

The UNICEF country programme in Vietnam demonstrates the results of long-term engagement using
non-confrontational language and high-level political dialogue in a centralized socialist political system.
When UNICEF first introduced child rights principles in its analysis and planning, explicit rights
language would have been too sensitive. By broadening the range of its state and party counterparts,
UNICEF was able to raise awareness of children’s rights in a number of areas. As a result, UNICEF
made progress in legal reform, juvenile justice, and child protection in Vietnam.




                                                                                                        50
V.      FINDINGS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION

Conceptually, it is useful to try to disaggregate the ways in which development and human rights
interact. Due to the extensive substantive or practical overlap between development activities and areas
governed by human rights treaties, development activities can be seen to possess significant human
rights dimensions. At a different level, due to the evolution of development polices and programming, a
number of human rights principles can be identified in development policy frameworks and approaches.
Finally, a number of international conferences and outcome documents, as well as some development
agencies, explicitly ground development objectives in international human rights law. Thus the overlaps
are significant and multitier, and they vary greatly across agencies and actors.

Development agencies view the overlaps in different ways and as a result integrate human rights in the
international human rights framework to varying degrees. Some “embrace it,” and agencies such as the
German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Sida, and the UN are explicit
about the foundation of their work in international human rights agreements and obligations; others,
such as CIDA and USAID, adopt a much more implicit use, usually at an operational level. Yet for
many, the integration of human rights into development ought to be related to the international
framework that is the main source of legitimacy of the approach. Just as development cooperation has
evolved, this framework continues to evolve, and so it will be important for development agencies,
partner countries, and civil-society groups to continue to interact with human rights actors such as UN
bodies, human rights academics, and lawyers and NGOs. At the same time, human rights organizations
should become more familiar with development concepts and approaches so they can participate
effectively in the mainstream of development debates. Promoting greater international policy coherence
depends at least in part on a more informed engagement and dialogue between human rights and
development communities.

In practical terms, states should ensure that human rights standards and the general comments of the
treaty-monitoring bodies are well known and used, and should try to enhance the usefulness and
relevance of the recommendations of these bodies (Alston 2004; O’Neill 2004). More work is needed
on developing tools and guidance and on establishing an empirical base for human rights
recommendations. Conversely, development agencies should build their knowledge of human rights law
and principles, step up their capacity to interact with human rights bodies, and consolidate their
understanding of the scope and significance of international human rights law obligations for
development.

   Global Approaches to Human Rights in Development Programming


To incorporate human rights into their development work, agencies employ a variety of approaches.
Some are driven by the donor’s human rights policies; others are constrained by the parameters of
agencies’ mandates, capacity, or comparative advantage in the field. At times, agencies adopt different
approaches in different areas or use multiple approaches simultaneously; these delineations can be
blurred by overlapping nomenclatures. Nevertheless, five basic approaches to human rights in
development programming can be identified: a human rights–based approach (HRBA); human rights
mainstreaming; dialogues and conditionality; projects and global initiatives; and implicit human rights
work (box 3.1)

I.        HUMAN RIGHTS–BASED APPROACHES (HRBA)

Although there is no one HRBA, there are a number of defining elements:

         The main objective of development policies and programmes should be to fulfil human rights.
         Rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations must
          be identified, and HRBAs work toward strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make
          their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations.
         Principles and standards derived from international human rights treaties should guide all
          development cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming
          process.
         A HRBA is a conceptual framework for the process of human development that is normatively
          based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and
          protecting human rights. It seeks to analyse inequalities that lie at the heart of development
          problems and redress discriminatory practices and unjust distributions of power that impede
          development progress (OHCHR 2006 FAQ).


HRBAs indicate a commitment to systematically taking human rights into account that typically requires
a transformation of institutional practices. Projects, mainstreaming, and dialogue/conditionality are part
of the implementation menu, but the overall rationale is distinct and explicit. Under the UN definition
of HRBA, human rights are an explicit part of the goal of development assistance, leading to a different
approach to the provision of aid. As one examination of human rights and development notes:

         At the highest level of integration, agency mandates are redefined in human rights terms, seeking
         to create a more structural and holistic approach to development and social change. Here we face
         a fundamental rethinking of the entire development practice: its ideology, its partners, its aims, its
         processes, its systems and procedures. (Uvin 2004)




                                                                                                              53
On the spectrum of approaches incorporating human rights in development, a HRBA is the strongest
articulation of donor and partner commitment to human rights. As a conceptual framework, a HRBA
explicitly posits human rights as a primary goal of development cooperation. Attention is placed on the
political dimensions of poverty and power dynamics within a society that cause and reinforce exclusion
and discrimination, with capacity building presented as a key feature of programming. HRBAs help
articulate the role and obligations of the state as duty-bearer and the corresponding entitlements of the
people as rights-holders. HRBAs can support governments as they become better equipped to identify
and meet needs within and across communities. People, including marginalized and vulnerable groups,
are given a voice and become empowered to participate in decision-making.



HRBAs can be employed at different stages of the development process: planning, implementing, or
evaluating results. These stages typically draw on an agency’s human rights policy or institutional
mandate, which provides guidance throughout the process. Although many donors now have human
rights policies, and the value of HRBAs is increasingly understood, the challenges of implementing and
evaluating the results of HRBAs remain. Outcomes of HRBAs can be hard to quantify, because HRBAs
are focused on long-term, sustainable changes to power dynamics and political participation. However,
emerging work on human rights indicators has potential relevance for measuring the impacts of HRBAs,
and development indicators that account for HRBAs are being used to demonstrate the effects of such
approach as well (see chapter 5).



The United Nations

The UN has long promoted HRBA. The UN Statement of Common Understanding on Human Rights-
Based Approaches to Development Cooperation and Programming (the Common Understanding) was
adopted by the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) in 2003. The purpose behind developing
a common understanding was to ensure that UN agencies, funds, and programmes apply a
consistent HRBA to common programming processes at global and regional levels, especially at the
country level in relation to the Common Country Assessment (CCA) and the United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).



In the UN Programme for Reform, launched in 1997, the Secretary-General called on all entities of the
UN system to mainstream human rights into their various activities and programmes within the

                                                                                                      54
framework of their respective mandates. Since then, a number of UN agencies have adopted a HRBA to
development cooperation and have gained experience in its operationalization. But each agency has
tended to have its own interpretation of HRBA and how the HRBA should be operationalized. UN
interagency collaboration at global and regional levels, and especially at the country level in relation to
the CCA and UNDAF processes, requires a common understanding of a HRBA and its implications for
development programming.

The Statement of Common Understanding specifically refers to a HRBA to the development cooperation
and development programming by UN agencies:

       All programmes of development cooperation, policies, and technical assistance should further
        the realization of human rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
        other international human rights instruments.
       Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from, the Universal Declaration of
        Human Rights and other international human rights instruments guide all development
        cooperation and programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming process.
        Among these human rights principles are universality and inalienability; indivisibility;
        interdependence and inter-relatedness; non-discrimination and equality; participation and
        inclusion; accountability; and the rule of law.
       Development cooperation contributes to the development of the capacities of “duty-bearers” to
        meet their obligations and/or of “rights-holders” to claim their rights.


The UN has made clear that HRBA requires good programming practices but that the application of
“good programming practices” does not by itself constitute a HRBA (Box 3.2)




                                                                                                        55
Box 3.2

Implications of a HRBA to Development in UN Agencies

The following elements that are necessary, specific, and unique to a HRBA:
   Assessment and analysis in order to identify the human rights claims of rights-holders and the
    corresponding human rights obligations of duty-bearers as well as the immediate, underlying, and
    structural causes of the nonrealization of rights.
   Programmes that assess the capacity of rights-holders to claim their rights, and of duty-bearers to
    fulfil their obligations and then develop strategies to build these capacities.
   Programmes that monitor and evaluate both outcomes and processes guided by human rights
    standards and principles.
   Programming that is informed by the recommendations of international human rights bodies and
    mechanisms.
Other elements of good programming practices that are essential under a HRBA include:
   People are recognized as key actors in their own development, rather than as passive recipients of
    commodities and services.
   Participation is both a means and a goal.
   Strategies are empowering, not disempowering.
   Both outcomes and processes are monitored and evaluated.
   Analysis includes all stakeholders.
   Programmes focus on marginalized, disadvantaged, and excluded groups.
   The development process is locally owned.
   Programmes aim to reduce disparity.
   Both top-down and bottom-up approaches are used in synergy.
   Situation analysis is used to identify immediate, underlying, and basic causes of development
    problems.
   Measurable goals and targets are important in programming.
   Strategic partnerships are developed and sustained.



A number of UN agencies have experience implementing a HRBA. The United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF)’s fundamental mission is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the
organization does—in programmes, in advocacy, and in operations. It does so through its application of


                                                                                                    56
a HRBA and an enhanced focus on equity. Similarly, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
focused on a HRBA to programming while strengthening national human rights accountability systems
in its Strategic Plan 2014–2017. This plan is aimed at advancing the implementation of domestic laws
and policies and the institutionalization of the protection of sexual and reproductive health and rights at
different levels of state administration in order to enhance positive impacts for key population and groups
living in marginalized or vulnerable situations.

UN-Habitat promotes a HRBA through its United Nations New Urban Agenda and by strengthening and
systematizing its engagement vis-a-vis global policy developments, using the 2030 Sustainable
Development Agenda and the Human Rights up Front (HRuF) initiative of the UN Secretary-General.
In addition, UN-Habitat works to build staff and partners’ capacity to apply human rights considerations
in project implementation, to strengthen the effective integration of the HRBA into the UN-Habitat
project cycle, and to spur the development of tools that guide a human rights-based implementation of
UN-Habitat projects.



The EU

The EU has employed a HRBA for years. In May 2014, the Council of the European Union endorsed a
HRBA “to promote human rights across all areas of its external action and in line with Policy Coherence
for Development” and adopted conclusions on a rights-based approach to development cooperation
encompassing all human rights. The council noted that:

       the promotion of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and good governance and of inclusive
       and sustainable growth are the two basic and mutually reinforcing pillars of the EU’s
       development policy. The Council reaffirms the EU’s commitment to promote all human rights,
       whether civil and political, or economic, social and cultural, in all areas of its external action
       without exception, in line with the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights
       and Democracy and the Council Conclusions on Democracy. (Source: Council of the EU, 2014)



With respect to supporting the EU’s external relations, the council stated that “[…] In the context of
working towards a rights-based approach to development cooperation, encompassing all human rights,
the Council welcomes the presentation of the Toolbox by the Commission in May 2014.4 As stated in
the aforementioned Action Plan, this Toolbox “aims at integrating human rights principles into EU
operational activities for development, covering arrangements both at headquarters and in the field for

                                                                                                        57
the synchronization of human rights and development cooperation activities.” (Council of the EU, 2014)
The Council also notes that several Member States are already developing or applying similar
approaches for the integration of human rights principles and standards in their development
cooperation.



Bilateral Agencies

A number of bilateral agencies have adopted HRBAs, and some have done so without redefining their
mandates in human rights terms; these agencies see a human rights policy as one among many
contributing to the achievement of poverty reduction and empowerment. The boundary between human
rights mainstreaming and HRBAs is not watertight, as genuine efforts to mainstream across sectors
rapidly leads to taking human rights into account more systematically across the organization. The New
Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) human rights mainstreaming action plan, for
example, is very close to the UN’s definition of a HRBA as is ADC’s (Box 3.3). However, some agencies
committed on paper to a HRBA have not invested much in institutional transformation.



Human rights have been a central element to Finnish development cooperation since the 1990s, and a
HRBA has been referred to in Finnish development policy since 2004. The 2012 policy committed all
Finnish development cooperation to a HRBA; the 2012 guidelines reflect the UN Common
Understanding on Human Rights-Based Approach to Development. Finland’s Human Rights Strategy,
adopted in 2013, defines development policy and cooperation as tools for advancing human rights; the
February 2016 Finnish government report on development policy confirms that Finnish development
policy and development cooperation continue to be human-rights based.



Sweden has long embraced a HRBA to its development assistance through the application of “a rights
perspective.” The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)’s application of a
HRBA focuses on achieving human rights through four principles: non-discrimination, participation,
transparency, and accountability. The main purpose of the HRBA is to empower boys, girls, men, and
women to claim their human rights (as rights-holders) and to increase the capacity of those who are
obliged to respect, promote, protect, and fulfil those rights (as duty-bearers). In 2014, Sida’s director
general announced four thematic foci, one of which is human rights and democracy (including
governance/public administration). Within that area, Sida decided to concentrate on the issues of


                                                                                                      58
shrinking civic space for civil society; strategic support for governance/public administration, or the
capacity development of duty-bearers (this support has since decreased for various reasons); a HRBA to
development; and freedom of expression/ information and communication technology (ICT).



Box 3.3

 Box 3.3

 HRBA in Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC)

 Human rights are mentioned in paragraph 1 of the Austrian Act on Development Cooperation (2002)
 and form an integral part of the Three-Year Programme of Austrian Development Policy 2016–2018.
 The Three-Year Programme defines good governance and human security as one of its three main
 objectives, with the priority being “promotion of human rights and the rule of law,” and prescribes a
 HRBA. According to the Three-Year Programme, HRBA is a fundamental principle for all
 interventions, projects, programmes, and political and policy dialogue. The promotion and respect of
 human rights are seen as inseparable, and these universal values form the basis of Austria’s
 development policy.




In Denmark, the promotion and protection of human rights is a central priority of foreign policy and
development policy. The 2012 Danish development strategy The Right to a Better Life rests on a HRBA.
Human rights permeate the strategic choices in the strategy, and the strategy emphasizes the significance
of the promotion and protection of human rights as an important transformational force in societies and
as a fundamental part of Danish development assistance. Human rights are a core value in partnerships,
based on the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, accountability, and participation and define
human rights as a core value as well as a driver of change. In addition to the HRBA in development,
human rights and democracy constitute separate focus areas for Danish development assistance in the
strategy. Human rights instruments thus serve as a compass that guides political dialogue and concrete
development interventions, as well as partnerships.



Norway has supported an applied HRBA since its White Paper No. 21 (1999–2000), “Plan of Action for
Human Rights.” Norway’s adherence to a HRBA has been confirmed in successive documents,


                                                                                                      59
including White Paper No. 10 (2014–2015), “Opportunities for All: Human Rights in Norway’s Foreign
Policy and Development Cooperation,” which outlines a comprehensive and integrated human rights
policy supported by all parties in the Norwegian Parliament. The paper expresses political will to
strengthen and systematize Norway’s efforts to promote and protect human rights at the global, regional,
and bilateral levels. The realization of human rights is recognized as an important stand-alone goal in
Norway’s foreign and development policy. In addition, the realization of human rights is recognized as
a means of achieving other goals such as poverty reduction, sustainable development, and lasting peace.



II.     MAINSTREAMING HUMAN RIGHTS

Beyond the formal adoption of HRBA, many agencies undertake efforts to mainstream human rights
that entail incorporating human rights into all projects and programmes and screening activities for
human rights implications. Mainstreaming efforts may involve “do no harm” policies, where adverse
human rights impacts are identified and mitigated. Mainstreaming also reflects the principle that
responsibility for human rights does not lie with any one specialized office of a development agency,
but rather should be incorporated into the work of all staff across sectors. This type of organizational
approach fosters an institutional culture that understands and applies human rights principles to
development practice comprehensively and systematically. It is not uncommon for human rights
responsibilities to be housed within governance units, which may result in agencies’ increased focus on
civil and political rights interventions.



Multilaterals

The United Nations Development Group Human Rights Working Group (UNDG-HRWG) has a
mandate to advance human rights mainstreaming efforts across the UN development system. In line with
the overall UNDG strategic priorities, the HRWG focuses on:

            Serving as the primary policy forum to ensure policy coherence on human rights
             mainstreaming
            Supporting the UNDG in making system-wide human rights expertise available to national
             development actors, anchored in strong human rights leadership by resident coordinators
             and United Nations country teams (UNCTs) with relevant capacity and support structures
            Supporting the UN development system as they deliver on the responsibilities and demands
             of human rights


                                                                                                     60
The UNDG-HRWG pursues these priorities using a holistic approach that targets various levels,
including system, regional, and country levels, with an overarching component of knowledge
management informing all levels. To maximize impact on the ground, the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the 18 agency members collect evidence on what is
happening on the ground and feed it back to country teams and HRWG practitioners.



With respect to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UNDG-HRWG seeks to implement a
human rights–based agenda across all agencies, including all development activities with a focus on
human rights in the post-2015 agenda (see Box 3.4).




Box 3.4

UN Human Rights in the Post-2015 Agenda

The UN development system is bound by the UN Charter to promote respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all, without discrimination. Evidence that human rights unite the UN
development system across diverse mandates is found in the strategic priorities of UN funds,
programmes, and agencies; in their contributions to the preparation of the new development agenda; and
in their commitments to the HRuF framework. As it contributes to implementation of the post–2015
development framework, the UN is unequivocal about what it stands for and what it upholds: freedom
from fear and want for all without discrimination. The person as rights-holder is at the heart of UN
development efforts. The UN believes that if the new development agenda is to be truly transformative,
human rights should be firmly embedded in the goals, targets, and indicators of the post-2015 agenda
and fully integrated across the UN’s implementation of that agenda. In furtherance of this goal, the UN
strives for the fullest possible application of the core principles of universality, indivisibility, equality
and non-discrimination, active and meaningful participation, and accountability.



The mainstreaming of human rights was declared a priority issue for the UN-Habitat Governing Council
in 2013 and was included in its 2014–2019 Strategic Plan. Human rights were further reaffirmed in
Paragraph 38 of the April 2015 Omnibus resolution, which
requests the Executive Director to mainstream human rights within the context of advancing the goals
and mandate of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, as set out in the Istanbul Declaration


                                                                                                          61
on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda, in line with its strategic plan for 2014–19, which states
that all cross-cutting issues will be mainstreamed throughout its seven focus areas.



This directive on mainstreaming empowers UN-Habitat to apply human rights considerations to all parts
of its work programme. The objectives of human rights mainstreaming are to improve the capacity of
UN-Habitat staff and partners to apply human rights considerations in project implementation, to
strengthen the effective integration of the HRBA into the UN-Habitat project cycle, and to spur the
development of tools that guide a human rights-based implementation of UN-Habitat projects. The
overall goal of mainstreaming UN-Habitat’s cross-cutting issues (climate change, gender, the HRBA,
and youth) is to strengthen programmatic synergies while ensuring that project outcomes reach all
intended beneficiaries, particularly persons in vulnerable situations (see http://unhabitat.org/cross-
cutting-issue-progress-report-2015/). The effective integration of cross-cutting issues will increasingly
enable the replication and up scaling of projects. Human rights mainstreaming at UN-Habitat builds on
existing knowledge and a body of normative work commissioned by the agency.

In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat adopted a Roadmap for Action, approved
by the director general, that outlines the strategic vision for its integrated mainstreaming initiative of
gender, equity, and human rights. As a member of the UN system, WHO is tasked with realizing the
right to health at the international, regional, and country levels in Committee on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights (CESCR) General Comment No. 14, which covers the right to the highest attainable
standard of health under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights.



The International Labour Organization (ILO) supports interagency work on human rights
mainstreaming, including through the UNDG-HRWG, to which the ILO has contributed in the funding
of regional and national human rights advisers and projects on human rights mainstreaming at both
national and regional levels. Close collaboration exists between the ILO and human rights treaty bodies
(the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD Committee ; the
CEDAW Committee; the UN Migrant Workers Committee; the Human Rights Committee overseeing
the ICCPR and the Committee on Economic and Social Rights) and charter-based bodies (special

Although supporting refugees lies beyond traditional development activities, the lines between
development and humanitarian and refugee interventions are fluid, and the approaches adopted by
refugee protection agencies can be instructive for development, particularly as development agencies
are being asked to support interventions to address refugee crises and humanitarian emergencies. There
has been a sustained effort to mainstream human rights throughout the UNHCR’s work, for example, in
integrating human rights standards into UNHCR’s advocacy activities. The importance of strengthening
the linkage between refugee and human rights protection is recognized in UNHCR’s Agenda for
Protection. Overall responsibility at the global level for coordination and advice on human rights lies
with the Human Rights Liaison Unit (HRLU) in UNHCR’s Division of International Protection.
HRLU’s role includes providing advice and training to UNHCR staff and partners on human rights
standards, instruments, and mechanisms and seeking to ensure that attention is given to protection issues
within the human rights processes.


Bilaterals
Switzerland advances human rights mainstreaming in its development cooperation through the work of
the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, which is part of Switzerland’s Federal Department
of Foreign Affairs. Human rights is integrated in Switzerland’s foreign policy as a whole. The integration
is significant in fostering synergies between different bilateral instruments, in particular in the area of
human rights. For example, Switzerland’s engagement on a given human rights issues (media freedom,
civil society strengthening, justice reform) can be approached in a synergetic manner, using development
instruments (programmes, projects) in a complementary manner alongside political instruments at the
national level (policy dialogues, donor coordination, strategies), as well as at the multilateral level
(human rights council, UN General Assembly).


In addition to adopting an explicit HRBA, Norway introduced human rights as a cross-cutting issue to
be mainstreamed across all parts of Norway’s Development Cooperation in 2016. In light of the values
of participation, accountability, and non-discrimination in terms of ensuring human rights protection,
special attention has been given to these norms in the operationalization of human rights as a cross-
cutting issue. These norms also reflect each of the three thematic priorities of White Paper No. 10 (2014–
2015). In light of reported difficulties in implementing the existing cross-cutting issues (gender,


                                                                                                        63
anticorruption, and climate/the environment), a new standard formulation that focus on the principle of
“do no harm” was agreed on that requires that all grants be assessed from the “do no harm” principle
and that risk factors that might have a negative impact on human rights be mitigated.



Mainstreaming in Country Programmes

One strategic form of support integrates human rights in the design of a country strategy. UNFPA
published a detailed manual on implementing a HRBA into country programming (UNFPA and Harvard
School of Public Health 2010). The manual explains how to integrate human rights principles into each
of the four stages of the country programme cycle: situation assessment and analysis; planning and
design; implementation; and monitoring and evaluation. Aid practitioners are encouraged to integrate
core human rights principles (universality and inalienability; indivisibility; interdependence and
interrelatedness; participation and inclusion; equality and non-discrimination; and accountability and
rule of law) into the agency’s policy dialogue and support of programmatic work throughout these
stages. Each programming stage should also systematically include a focus on cultural sensitivity and
gender equality.



In the field of development, the EU’s approaches can be classified into three main categories:
mainstreaming, conditionality, and human rights projects. The EU’s efforts to mainstream human rights
as a cross-cutting element in all development actions have been reinforced by the EU’s commitment to
apply a rights-based approach to development. Based on the principles of universality, the indivisibility
of human rights, inclusion and participation in decision-making processes, non-discrimination, equality
and equity, accountability, and transparency, this approach means turning away from “service delivery”
and toward a model that empowers active citizens who know their rights and are involved in
development processes.

A longstanding example of mainstreaming human rights in a bilateral country program can be found in
Sweden’s Kenya programme, which has integrated HRBA in development cooperation with Kenya for
many years (see box 3.5).




                                                                                                      64
 Box 3.5 Sweden’s Kenya programme

 In Kenya, the Swedish embassy has worked on human rights and democracy for several years and
 has been successful in integrating a HRBA into development co-operation with Kenya because
 successive Swedish co-operation strategies with Kenya (2004-2008; 2009-2103; 2016-2020)
 provided a clear mandate to tackle poverty reduction through work on democratic governance. The
 current Swedish Development Cooperation Strategy with Kenya 2016-2020 is expected to contribute
 to strengthened democracy and gender equality, and greater respect for human rights through
 strengthened democratic institutions at national and local levels; strengthened rule of law;
 Strengthened media and civil society capacity to promote; democratic development and
 accountability; and Strengthened capacity among public institutions and civil society organisations
 that promote gender equality and respect for human rights, with a focus on women and girls. The
 rights perspective means that human rights and democracy are regarded as fundamental to
 development. This approach means that individuals and groups that are discriminated against,
 excluded and marginalised are made visible prior to each contribution. (Sida Strategy for Sweden’s
 development cooperation with Kenya 2016–2020)




Human rights are frequently mainstreamed across sectors, allowing for general human rights principles,
such as participation, non-discrimination, and empowerment, to be considered alongside more specific
human rights obligations that are tailored to a particular thematic area; sector examples are explored in
more detail in chapter 7. Donors may employ different approaches to integrating human rights
simultaneously or in an overlapping and interchangeable ways.




                                                                                                      65
Mainstreaming Children’s Rights

A significant number of agencies have invested in children’s rights. In addition to UNICEF and the EU,
as well as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as the International Save the Children Alliance,
a range of bilateral agencies have developed approaches to children based on the Convention on the
Rights of the Child (CRC). For example, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)’s
efforts to integrate a HRBA are illustrated in its work on child protection (see chapter 8); Sida has made
significant progress in mainstreaming a child rights perspective (box 3.6).

 Sweden’s Kenya Programme

 In Kenya, the Swedish embassy has worked on human rights and democracy for many years and has
 been successful in integrating a HRBA into development cooperation with Kenya. Successive
 strategies (2004–2008; 2009–2013; 2016–2020) have provided a clear mandate to tackle poverty
 reduction through work on democratic governance. The Strategy with Kenya 2016–2020 is expected
 to contribute to strengthened democracy and gender equality and greater respect for human rights
 through strengthened democratic institutions at national and local levels; strengthened rule of law;
 strengthened media and civil society capacity to promote; democratic development and
 accountability; and strengthened capacity among public institutions and civil society organizations
 that promote gender equality and respect for human rights, with a focus on women and girls. The
 rights perspective means that human rights and democracy are regarded as fundamental to
 development. This approach in turn means that individuals and groups that are discriminated against,
 excluded, or marginalized are made visible prior to each contribution.

The reasons for success seem to be, first, that children’s rights are often perceived a s less controversial
than other rights, though some areas such as child participation or rights within the family can be
challenging. Second, the CRC has been nearly universally ratified, creating opportunities for


                                                                                                         66
engagement in a wide range of countries, even where human rights language is usually not well accepted
(e.g., Vietnam). Third, the CRC provides a useful series of entry points for programming because it
covers social and economic rights as well as civil and political rights. Agencies have successfully
operationalized the four CRC principles: best interests of the child; non-discrimination; the right to life,
survival, and development; and the right to participation. Finally, children’s rights open a way to engage
in a wide range of sectors by providing a clear target group. Examples of development goals that
integrate children as a target group can be found in the SDGs on health (SDG 3.2); nutrition (SDG 2.2),
education (SDG 4.2, 4.5, 4a.); and protection, juvenile justice, and child labour (SDG 8.7).




Box 3.6

Sida’s Mainstreaming of Children’s Rights

Sida mainstreams child rights in all aid interventions as part of a long-term, sustainable development
cooperation strategy, while also engaging in targeted interventions with a more immediate impact.
Because human rights are children’s rights, all HRBA information also applies to development
cooperation that directly or indirectly affects children. Sida uses the acronym P.L.A.N.E.T. as a way of
organizing and remembering what to consider when applying a HRBA to development cooperation (Box
3.7). Some human rights approaches that have been formulated and developed specifically in relation to
children must be taken into account. Examples of issues to consider when applying a HRBA to
development cooperation contributions that affects children include participation; links to human rights
in legal instruments at the national, regional, and international levels, such as the CRC and the African
Charter on the rights and welfare of the child; accountability; non-discrimination; empowerment; and
transparency. The Swedish Aid Policy Framework emphasises that the big challenge for the majority of
poor countries today is the large proportion of children and young people in the population —and the
need to meet their needs, safeguard their rights, and make the most of the opportunities they represent
(Government of Sweden 2016).


In 2011, Sida and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation commissioned an evaluation of
child rights work within the two agencies, including an analysis of field studies in Guatemala, Kenya,
Mozambique, and Sudan (Nora and Sida 2011). The evaluation concluded that mainstreaming child
rights is feasible and worthwhile but requires a greater commitment of resources, a more systematic
approach to addressing child rights operationally, and improved reporting on results of mainstreaming
work. The report found considerable achievements, albeit measured in terms of outputs rather than


                                                                                                         67
outcomes. However, it also found that child participation in development efforts had been more
tokenistic than substantial. It highlighted challenges and opportunities with a mainstreaming approach
to child rights Sida is working to address these issues by dedicating more human resources; developing
methods for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting on results; and having Sida management take
ownership over implementation.


Box 3.7 P.L.A.N.E.T. is an acronym which stands for:
•Participation: Is there active and meaningful participation of those involved - including opportunities
for them to influence the formulation of problems, planning, implementation and follow-up?
•Links to human rights: What links are there to human rights laws, treaties and systems (such as
complaints mechanisms, courts and human rights bodies) at the national, regional and/or international
levels? Are they sufficient, do they need to be revised or are they non-existent and need to be developed
from scratch?
•Accountability: Who are the duty bearers? Do they have the knowledge, mandate, resourc es and
willingness to achieve their human rights obligations? Do rights holders know who the duty-bearers are
and can they hold them to account?
•Non-discrimination: Who are the rights holders? Have they been taken into account? Are people in
vulnerable situations considered? Is discrimination actively counteracted?
•Empowerment: What capacity do duty bearers have to fulfil their obligations and rights holders' to
claim their human rights? Can their capacity be strengthened?
•Transparency: Is information available in an accessible way to duty bearers and rights holders? Are
they able to attend and observe meetings and processes where issues that affect them are discussed?



Mainstreaming Women’s Rights and Gender Equality

There is a great deal of overlap between initiatives that promote gender equality and the integration of
human rights. Most donor agencies have adopted gender equality policies that call for gender
mainstreaming and interventions directly targeted at women. The approaches share much at a normative
and a conceptual level: non-discrimination, including gender equality, is a fundamental human rights
principle; CEDAW provides a clear framework and monitoring mechanism aimed at eliminating gender-
based discrimination; and the 1994 Beijing Declaration is the foundation for a wide range of national
initiatives. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) Guidelines for Gender Equality (OECD 1999) explicitly refer to these
frameworks. At a programming level, interventions are often similar and, as illustrations in this volume

                                                                                                      68
demonstrate, women’s rights are central to the systematic integration of human rights in development
assistance.



In 2014, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution on gender
mainstreaming requesting the UN system, including its agencies, funds, and programmes, within their
respective mandates, to accelerate the full and effective mainstreaming of a gender perspective,
commensurate with gender equality goals, in accordance with previous ECOSOC resolutions, in
particular resolution 2008/34 of July 25, 2008, and General Assembly resolutions 64/289 and 67/226,
also requesting the UN to support the implementation of national policies to advance gender equality.



A prominent example of human rights mainstreaming with respect to gender is found in the approach of
UN Women. UN Women is a composite entity that consolidates four UN entities: the Office of the
Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, the Division for the Advancement of
Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and the International Research
and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women. In 2013, the UN Women expert group meeting
agreed that implementing gender mainstreaming in development programming at the country level
should encompass all programmatic measures to integrate and achieve gender equality in national
development policies and programmes, including measures taken by governments at the central and
decentralized levels, civil society actors, and donors and in 2014 UN Women published Gender
Mainstreaming In Development Programming: Guidance Note (UN Women 2014)Such approaches
must be informed and constantly readjusted by ongoing analysis of policy priorities, changing contexts,
and the impact of operations on gender disparities Gender mainstreaming is an important element of the
UN Women’s Strategic Plan 2014–2017, Making This the Century for Women and Gender Equality,
which underscores the importance of securing expertise to enhance gender mainstreaming in programme
planning and implementation and, in the post–2015 context, pledges UN Women support for gender
equality to be mainstreamed in all other goals, targets, and indicators. UN Women issued a guidance
note on gender mainstreaming in development cooperation.



UN Women embraces a vision for sustainable development grounded in international human rights
standards set out in the 2030 Agenda, which recognizes gender equality as “a crucial contribution to
progress across all the goals and targets.” The SDG to achieve gender equality and empower all women



                                                                                                    69
and girls (goal 5) has specific targets that address many important barriers to advancing women’s rights.
These targets are accompanied by gender-specific targets and indicators across other goals.



UN Women believes that gender equality and women’s rights must be prioritized in a comprehensive
manner across the entire agenda. The agenda must also be fully aligned and consistent with international
human rights standards, including those on gender equality, as core values of the UN. Recommendations
from human rights mechanisms, such as CEDAW, should guide implementation and follow-up.
Implementation of the agenda should take into account the interrelated nature of the SDGs, and the
achievement of all SDGs must contribute to people’s enjoyment of their human rights and gender
equality. It is critical that equality and non-discrimination underpin the implementation of all SDGs and
that addressing gender inequalities is a priority, as gender-based discrimination remains the most
prevalent form of discrimination.



In 2015, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) instituted the Policy on
Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, supported by a dedicated office, in order to
successfully implement its 2009 strategy to mainstream gender equality and women’s empowerment
throughout the organization. Gender equality and women’s empowerment is central to UNIDO’s work
because these are not only human rights, but are also a precondition for sustainable development and
economic growth, which are drivers of poverty reduction and social integration.



Gender equality and women’s empowerment are key to UNIDO’s goal of achieving inclusive and
sustainable industrial development, as mandated by member states in the Lima Declaration, adopted in
December 2013 (GC.15/Res.1) and highlighted in SDG 9: “Build resilient infrastructure, promote
inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.” The multiplying effect of
industrialization on other areas of development contributes to the 2030 Agenda and supports SDG 5:
“Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.” The goal of the strategy is to promote
gender equality and women’s empowerment in all UNIDO programmes, policies, and organizational
practices, based on the vision of “strong, inclusive, sustainable and resilient economic and industrial
growth and the effective integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of
sustainable development” (GC.15/Res.1). The gender strategy thus aims to strengthen gender equality
both in the services UNIDO delivers and within UNIDO itself by applying a HRBA in line with UN


                                                                                                      70
system principles. UNIDO indicators concerning gender mainstreaming and empowerment of women
are referenced in the UNIDO’s Integrated Results and Performance Framework, which measures
performance in terms of management and global development outcomes. In addition to the efforts of
UN agencies to mainstream gender equality, other organizations, such as the OAS, have launched gender
mainstreaming initiatives (see Box 3.8).




    Box 3.8

    OAS Handbook on Mainstreaming Gender Equality into the Project Cycle

    The 2010 Organization of American States (OAS) Handbook on Gender Mainstreaming grew out of
    the efforts of the OAS Department of Planning and Evaluation to introduce a gender and rights
    approach into international mandates on gender equality and human rights as part of a process of
    modernizing the management of the institution and incorporating a results-based management
    system. The handbook is a training initiative that provides practical tools for addressing gender issues
    at each stage of the project cycle. It summarizes and organizes a number of tools that are often used
    in gender-sensitive planning and evaluation, with updated content referencing the specific areas in
    which the OAS operates. The handbook consists of ten thematic modules, organized according to the
    different phases of the planning and evaluation cycle, so that each guide can be used independently
    of the others: (1) conceptual framework; (2) international mandates and instruments of the inter-
    American system; (3) evaluability of gender-sensitive project profiles; (4) a gender equality approach
    to stakeholder analysis; (5) gender assessments; (6) identification of gender equality-based objectives
    and alternatives; (7) sources of information on gender matters; (8) gender indicators; (9) checking
    whether a logical framework is gender sensitive; (10) gender-sensitive monitoring and evaluation

.

Gender equality activities are also a way of working on human rights in the absence of human rights
policies. In 2011, the World Bank produced several reports on gender equality, including Women,
Business and the Law 2012: Removing Barriers to Economic Inclusion (World Bank and IFC 2011) and
the World Development Report on Gender, Equality, and Development (World Bank 2011g). At the
same time, the Bank launched its “Think Equal” social media campaign, reiterating that “gender equality
is a core development objective in its own right.” The US Agency for International Development has
undertaken a significant amount of work on women in development, including on anti-trafficking,
women’s legal rights, trade liberalization, and education. The approach focuses on overcoming obstacles

                                                                                                          71
to opportunities rather than on explicit human rights programming.



The European Commission frames gender inequality as a denial of human rights. Its twofold approach
includes gender mainstreaming and specific measures for women. To advance gender mainstreaming,
the EC developed a toolkit on Mainstreaming Gender Equality in EC Development Cooperation (3rd
edition 2009) that is part of a larger effort to build capacity for gender mainstreaming in development
cooperation of colleagues in the External Relation Directorates and in EC delegations. The toolkit is
complemented by guidelines on specific issues such as sexual-based violence, training for headquarters
and delegations staff, and the five-year EU Plan of Action on Gender Equality and Women’s
Empowerment in Development (2010–2015), which included strengthening efforts at mainstreaming as
an overarching objective (European Commission 2010a). The DAC Peer Review 2012 found that
progress had been achieved in gender mainstreaming in the EU and set the EU Plan of Action as an
example for mainstreaming cross-cutting issues (OECD-DAC 2012).



The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) enhances support for actions on
human rights issues covered by EU guidelines, including violence against women and girls and
combating all forms of discrimination against them. The EIDHR mainstreamed gender equality in its
2011–2013 response strategy and in projects under all its objectives. For example, its project to
strengthen the judiciary in Cambodia aimed to address gender issues through the improvement of legal
and judicial mechanisms and access to justice for Khmer Rouge victims. Likewise, the EIDHR
mainstreamed gender concerns into its election observation missions by including gender experts on
teams and watching for gender issues in the organization and implementation of elections (European
Commission 2011a).



On October 26, 2015, the EU Council of Ministers adopted Conclusions on the EU Gender Action Plan
2016–2020 (GAP). The council also recognized the contribution of the Joint Staff Working Document
on “Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: Transforming the lives of Girls and Women through
EU External Relations 2016–2020.” as a follow-up to the conclusions of May 2015. Following its call
for a robust and ambitious successor to the Gender Action Plan 2010-2015, the Council welcomed and
endorsed the Gender Action Plan (GAP for the period 2016-2020 which stresses the need for the full
realization of women’s and girls’ full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms


                                                                                                    72
and the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. The council called
for systematic reporting by all EU actors on the institutional culture shift against relevant indicators and
systematic gender analysis for all new external actions.



III.    HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE AND CONDITIONALITY

HRBAs and mainstreaming efforts offer comprehensive ways of connecting human rights and
development. Yet, as noted by Uvin (2004),

       When people first consider the relation between development and human rights, [they] most
       spontaneously begin by thinking about conditionality. They argue that donors should threaten to
       cut off development assistance—and execute that threat—to recipients that consistently violate
       human rights.



The Final Report of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Participatory Development and Good Governance
suggests that conditionality be used as a last resort:

       Development co-operation stresses positive measures for the promotion of participatory
       development and good governance. The withholding of assistance should be reserved for cases
       where persistent violations of men, women and children’s basic rights are not being addressed by
       the government and no adequate basis of shared values and interests exists to permit a real
       partnership. (OECD 1997a)



Most bilateral agencies have explicit political conditionality policies that they apply more or less
consistently (Piron and Court 2004; Piron and De Renzio 2005). Since the early 1990s, the European
Union has included human rights clauses in its agreements, and it considers human rights, democracy,
and the rule of law “essential elements” of development cooperation. For instance, Article 8 of the
Cotonou Partnership Agreements outlines the specific modalities for a regular, comprehensive,
balanced, and deep political dialogue that includes respect for human rights, democratic principles, the
rule of law, and good governance. Article 8 further stipulates that representatives of civil society
organizations shall be included in the political dialogue. In 2010, the EU reaffirmed its policy of
including human rights clauses in agreements with third countries; by December 2011, such as clause
had been included in agreements with more than 120 countries (European Commission 2011f). If these
clauses are not respected, aid can be suspended.

                                                                                                         73
According to a European Commission paper published in 2012, “essential elements clauses” are
triggered only in extreme circumstances, meaning grave human rights violations such as a coup, flawed
elections, or brutal violence (European Commission ‘Using EU Trade Policy to promote fundame ntal
human     rights   –   Current    policies   and    practices’,   Non-Paper,     2012,    available   online
<http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2012/february/tradoc_149064.pdf>.)



A range of dialogue approaches has been used to respond to systematic violations or weak commitment
to human rights: at the technical (project) level, in the context of agreeing overarching country strategies,
or as part of diplomatic negotiations. The ways in which EU dialogues are initiated and conducted are
governed by EU guidelines promulgated in 2001 and updated in 2009 (EU 2009). There are four types
of dialogue:



     Discussions of a general nature based on treaties or agreements dealing with human rights (e.g.,
        the Cotonou Agreement)
     Regular, institutionalized dialogues focusing exclusively on human rights between the EU and a
        country or regional organization
     Ad hoc dialogues extending to common foreign and security policy-related topics, including
        human rights
     Dialogues in the context of special relations with certain countries on the basis of converging
        views with the possibility of cooperation with multilateral human rights bodies (EU 2009)



Sometimes donors engage in both bilateral and multilateral dialogues on human rights issues with the
same countries simultaneously (e.g., bilateral dialogues with China and Iran as well as through the EU)
(Box 3.10). Human rights conditionality remains a sensitive and controversial issue (see Box 3.9) and
the suspension of aid has usually been treated as an exceptional measure of last resort. For instance,
Spain has generally been opposed to using conditionality (FRIDE 2010), and AusAID considers
conditionality appropriate only in extreme circumstances. Anecdotal evidence suggests conditionality
for AusAID is usually linked to violations of democratic rights (e.g., coups, fraudulent elections) rather
than to economic or social rights. Weaknesses in traditional approaches include ineffectiveness, lack of
consistency in application, and ethical dilemmas.


                                                                                                          74
Bilateral human rights dialogues are an important mechanism for conveying Australia’s human rights
concerns systematically and regularly. They enable the government to raise human rights issues,
including sensitive individual cases, frankly and directly. Human rights dialogues have been held
between Australia, China, Vietnam, and Laos (GoAus 2016).




 Box 3.9

 EU Conditionality

 The EU developed a comprehensive and increasingly diversified system of human rights
 conditionality, with human rights clauses in international agreements, good governance incentives,
 and human rights progress requirements for budget support. Under the Generalised System of
 Preferences, special trade incentives for the poorest countries are designed to reward the
 implementation of core labour rights and environmental conventions; preferences can be withdrawn
 in case of serious violations of human rights. The EU’s conditionality has traditionally been applied
 in a positive and dynamic manner. Yet the EU has also been criticized for a lack of coherence in its
 sanction decisions (European Parliament 2016c).




In light of new ways of delivering and managing aid, some donors are revisiting common assumptions
about addressing human rights through conditionality. There is much to be learned from donor
experiences, yet documenting and sharing them in public forums is considered politically sensitive. An
evaluation of Sida’s engagement in human rights and democratic governance concluded that the agency
effectively promoted human rights dialogue among stakeholders in places such as Colombia and
Nicaragua (Sida 2008). Sida’s focus is more on dialogue than on conditionality, as evidenced by its
human rights dialogue kit (Sida 2010e) and other dialogue briefs on freedom of expression (Sida 2010g),
the rights of the child (Sida,2010h), the rights of persons with disabilities (Sida 2010a), and the rights of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) persons (Sida 2010k). The UK Department for International
Development (DFID) reviewed the application of political conditionality to general budget support in
Africa. Earlier studies about dialogue and sanctions had pointed to a number of lessons relevant for what
a “post-conditionality” approach in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper context of “process
conditionality” and selectivity (Harrison 2001; Piron and de Renzio 2005; Santiso 2003; Uvin 2004).


                                                                                                          75
DFID’s conditionality policy tries to strike a balance among accountability, partner country ownership,
and predictability of aid flows. Although DFID does not use conditionality to micromanage government
reforms or force partner countries to make changes that they do not want, it does use conditionality to
support aid effectiveness and accountability purposes (DFID 2009a). The UK policy on conditionality
is based on three shared commitments with partner governments: poverty reduction and meeting the
Millennium Development Goals; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and
strengthening financial management and accountability and reducing the risk of funds being misused
thorough weak administration or corruption (DFID 2011a). There have been suspensions of aid because
of the breach of one of these commitments, often financial management.



The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) appears to stand alone among international financial
institutions (IFIs) in that its contracts are conditioned on respect for human rights and may be suspended
by the CEB in the face of violations. In particular, the CEB human rights framework includes loan
regulations that require projects to adhere to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms and the European Social Charter (CEB 2010a), which was adopted by the
Administrative Council by Resolution 1562 on November 14, 2013 (box 3.9).

Box 3.11

Examples of Human Rights Dialogue and Conditionality

The EU has a range of policies on and experiences with human dialogue and conditionality. For
example, the Cotonou Agreement with Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific countries makes explicit
reference to human rights and creates a mechanism for structured dialogue and aid suspension if issues
are not resolved. The EU undertakes dialogues focusing exclusively on human rights (e.g., with China
since 1996 and Iran since 2002), as well as dialogues within the framework of joint commission
meetings as part of trade and cooperation agreements (e.g., Bangladesh, Laos, and Vietnam). By the
end of 2011, the EU had initiated approximately 40 dedicated human rights dialogues and consultations
(European Commission 2011f).




Finland’s position on conditionality is consistent with that of most other bilaterals. It is committed to
long-term cooperation, but serious human rights problems may lead to a reduction or termination of aid.
Finland pays attention to a country’s commitment to improving human rights, democracy, equality, and
anti-corruption in its overall assessment of its commitment to development. In 2001, Kenya, Zambia,
and Nicaragua failed to meet conditions relating to human rights, democracy, and good governance;
since then, the situations have improved and cooperation has increased. In 2004, Finland decided that
instability and the poor human rights situation in Nepal meant there were no possibilities for increasing
cooperation. German development cooperation policies are similar: budget aid to Malawi was stalled in
2011 as a reaction to the criminalization of lesbian acts; similar action was envisioned with respect to a
draft law in Uganda.



IV.       HUMAN RIGHTS PROJECTS

Traditionally, donors support human rights through projects that aim to build the capacity of human
rights organizations, provide human rights training, or support the ratification of treaties and legal
reform.


                                                                                                       77
Human rights projects often focus on the promotion of specific rights, the empowerment of specific
groups (e.g., children, women, ethnic or minority groups, persons with disabilities), or support to human
rights organizations. Support to civil society organizations is one of the most common forms of direct
intervention, working through them to build the capacity of rights-holders to claim and enforce their
rights and to mobilize for social change. Recipients are usually local or international NGOs that receive
resources through bilateral or multilateral human rights funds managed by embassies or donor agencies.
Less often, sector programmes may have civil-society components that address the “demand side” of
reform. In addition to targeted human rights funds, donor guidelines can create incentives for civil
society organizations to work on human rights issues or adopt HRBAs (e.g., DFID Programme
Partnership Agreements with UK-based international NGOs).



Human rights projects may stand alone or may be complemented by or related to other HRBAs. Some
human rights projects are strongly human rights based, providing analytical inputs and perspectives on
a particular human rights issue. One such example is a World Bank Nordic Trust Fund (NTF) grant that
funded research as part of the 2012 World Development Report on Gender. That research analysed how
state parties’ commitments under CEDAW and other international conventions reduced constraints to
women’s autonomy and decision-making capacities for income generation and economic development.



The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has a strong mandate to protect and
promote human rights. In terms of practice, USAID’s traditional operational approach might best be
described as emphasizing “human rights projects” and/or the “implicit human rights work” of USAID’s
democracy assistance and governance programmes. However, USAID has become much more explicit
about the human rights focus of its work, making the case for both the intrinsic and the instrumental
value of this work to its overall mission. Furthermore, the practice today is increasingly evolving to
emphasize mainstreaming human rights throughout the Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance
(DRG) sector, in particular. For example, DRG activities managed by operational units that do not have
an explicit human rights mandate are increasingly comfortable describing their work as promoting or
protecting human rights. Some examples include USAID’s support for civil society actors in
authoritarian spaces (e.g., related to the President’s Stand with Civil Society Agenda), activities related
to election assistance (e.g., programmes that protect citizens’ rights to participate in free elections and



                                                                                                        78
be elected), and even traditional governance activities that emphasize the right to remedy or freedom
from discrimination.



In addition to the two principal approaches adopted by the EU (see above), EU development assistance
is also used to directly support projects and programmes promoting human rights, democracy, and good
governance. EU institutions invested US$1.504 billion in governance and civil society in 2013,
representing 9 per cent of official sector-allocable aid. If the EU adheres to its Agenda for Change, this
proportion will grow during the 2014–2020 programming period. The 2014–2020 Development
Cooperation Instrument even includes a benchmark: 15 per cent of all geographic funding is to be spent
on human rights, democracy and good governance (European Parliament 2016).



V.      GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVES

Donors have promoted the integration of human rights and development well beyond country
programmes and direct interventions by funding international events, research, and networking at
regional and global levels.



Bilateral agencies can count many successes in their funding of multilateral organizations. Examples in
the UN system include the HRWG (box 3.11), and funding for the Princeton (2001) and Stamford (2003)
consultations, which elaborated the UN Interagency Common Understanding of a HRBA to
development cooperation. Bilaterals have also worked with development banks, which tend not to have
explicit human rights policies. For example, the World Bank’s operational document on social
development (World Bank 2005a) mentions support from Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands in
building donor and client country capacity for social development, including greater cooperation within
the Bank and with the UN; the Japan Social Development Fund, which has supported social
accountability initiatives; and cooperation with Dt. Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammendarbeit and
DFID on poverty and social impact analysis. Canada launched an initiative to strengthen human rights
education globally. In partnership with Equitas, this US$13.9 million multi-country initiative aims to
build safer, more equitable communities with greater respect for human rights and democracy by
empowering key actors, including children and youth, to become agents of change in their communities.
In both the UN and the World Bank, human rights initiatives have been successfully launched and
implemented to advance the mainstreaming of human rights into development, (see box 3.11) and help


                                                                                                       79
staff develop a more informed view of human rights (see box 3.12).




 Box 3.12

 UNDG-HRWG
 Created in 2009 at the request of the UN Secretary General, the UNDG-HRWG advances human
 rights mainstreaming efforts within the UN development system. With OHCHR as the chair, the
 UNDG-HRWG aims to strengthen coordinated UN responses to requests from member states for
 support in fulfilling their human rights commitments. A key priority of this interagency mechanism
 is supporting the UN development system to deliver rights based development results at the national
 level. Recognizing the increased emphasis on human rights as a cornerstone of the post –2015
 development agenda, as well as renewed commitment by the UN system to uphold its human rights
 responsibilities, the UNDG transformed the Human Rights Mainstreaming mechanism into the
 HRWG in January 2015.




Box 3.13

World Bank Nordic Trust Fund

Established in 2008 with a US$34.8 million trust from agreed contributions by the governments of
Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Germany, the Nordic Trust Fund (NTF)’s objective
is to help the World Bank develop an informed view on human rights. This internal knowledge and
learning programme supports activities that generate knowledge about how human rights relate to the
Bank’s analytical activities and operations by identifying and tapping the Bank’s comparative
advantages and developing ways to systematize and improve existing involvement in the overall context
of the Bank’s core mission of promoting economic grown and poverty reduction.




NTF Grant Programme

NTF activities primarily follow three tracks: grants to Bank teams to incorporate human rights
considerations into analytical and operational work; analytical work and training on human rights; and
fostering and building partnerships. The NTF grant programme provides support to task teams across

                                                                                                   80
the World Bank to integrate human rights perspectives into their projects, strategies, tools, or research.
These grants are US$250,000 each for a two-year implementation period, and they cover all thematic
areas and regions of the Bank, including economic, social, and cultural rights; civil and political rights;
capacity and institutions; and discrimination and vulnerable groups. Projects include pilot activities in
analytic and operational work to generate and disseminate knowledge about how human rights relate to
a Bank unit’s/team’s work (Nordic Trust Fund 2010). One project aims to better incorporate the right to
health for Roma into health projects and health sector work in the Europe and Central Asia region
(Nordic Trust Fund 2011). Another activity explores how the right to health can be implemented in
Colombia by analysing the fiscal and financial sustainability of eliminating disparities in services and
insurance coverage, surveying the capacities of health facilities, designing a social communication and
advocacy strategy, and monitoring the implementation of health rights, including through constitutional
litigation.



CEB Human Rights Trust Fund

The CEB Human Rights Trust Fund (HRTF) was set up in 2008 by Norway, the initiator and a founding
contributor; the Council of Europe; and the CEB. Since its creation, HRTF has grown to include
Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The HRTF finances
activities that support member states’ efforts in implementing the European Convention on Human
Rights and other Council of Europe human rights instruments and contributes to strengthening the
sustainability of the European Court of Human Rights, by reserving and promoting common
fundamental values concerning human rights, democracy and the rule of law; ensuring effective
mechanisms for verifying the compatibility of legislation and administrative practice with the
Convention, including ensuring effective domestic remedies; facilitating the implementation of national
measures to prevent or redress violations of human rights. In particular, the Human Rights Trust Fund
projects contribute to ensuring: that effective remedies exist for anyone with an arguable complaint of
violation of the Convention; that there are domestic procedures that comply with procedural obligations
under the Convention to conduct effective investigations and handle cases of serious violation of the
Convention; that there are effective mechanisms for verifying the compatibility of draft legislation and
administrative practice with the Convention; and that adequate organization, operation and infrastructure
of administrative and judicial public services exist.




                                                                                                        81
VI.     HUMAN RIGHTS RESEARCH

Discrete human rights projects may include research into a wide range of thematic issues linking human
rights and development; surveys of needs and capacity gaps within countries, institutions, and sectors;
analyses of indicators for measuring development outcomes using a HRBA; and training materials on
applying HRBAs. For example, the World Bank and International Finance Corporation report Women,
Business and the Law 2012: Removing Barriers to Economic Exclusion with NTF support examines
how regulations and institutions in 141 economies distinguish between men and women in ways that
affect one’s capacity to work, start, or run a business (World Bank and IFC 2011). In collaboration with
the Danish government, the NTF supported publication of a 2010 World Bank study, Human Rights
Indicators in Development: An Introduction, which considers the significance of human rights indicators
for development processes and outcomes as they connect standards and obligations with empirical data
(World Bank 2010b). In 2011, the NTF supported the publication of the World Bank’s international law
study, Human Rights and Climate Change: A Review of the International Legal Dimensions, comprising
a literature review of human rights and environmental issues and a presentation of points of convergence
and disconnect along with areas for future research (World Bank 2011a). In 2013, the NTF
commissioned the report Human Rights Impact Assessments: A Review of the Literature, Differences
with other forms of Assessments and Relevance for Development (World Bank 2013). The purpose of
the report was to review the various existing approaches to human rights impact assessments (HRIAs)
in order to assess their form, content, methodology, and use, as well as their potential relevance to
development policy and practice. The report considers the essential elements of HRIAs and compares
them with other forms of assessments used in development, such as environmental impact assessments
and social impact assessments. By comparing the sets of tools, the study draws out the similarities
between them as well as the value added of HRIAs.



The World Bank Development Economics Vice-Presidency undertook research on how public
transparency increases executive branch compliance with court orders on human rights led by Varun
Gauri. It found that a core element of the rule of law is that courts should be capable of remedying
violations of legal obligations, especially core obligations such as human rights orders. Important factors
that promote powerful courts rest largely beyond judicial control. Most obviously, judges are unlikely
to have an immediate and strong influence on the degree to which political power is fragmented or on
the drafting of formal rules that insulate themselves from external pressure. But some factors may be
subject to judicial influence. Compliance, and judicial power more generally, depends on public support,
which in turn is related to the transparency of the conflicts courts resolve, because without at least the

                                                                                                        82
possibility of informing people about noncompliance, public support does not matter.



This research project looked at efforts on the part of two courts, the Constitutional Chamber of the
Supreme Court of Costa Rica and the Constitutional Court of Colombia, to use transparency to increase
compliance rates with their own human rights orders. The researchers used an experimental design to
examine the effects of transparency on compliance. The Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court
of Costa Rica, in the summer of 2009, began monitoring compliance with its direct orders in amparo
and habeas corpus cases. The court announced the early results from its analysis at a well-attended
March 2010 press conference. The president of the court promised to continue monitoring and
publicizing the results for the foreseeable future. The research used a unique data set on compliance
derived from this monitoring system to evaluate theoretical claims about the relationship between the
transparency of judicial orders and compliance. It found that vague orders and orders issued without
definite time frames for compliance were associated with delayed implementation. It also found that
orders issued after the press conference were implemented roughly two months earlier than orders issued
just prior to the press conference.



As part of its knowledge and learning mandate, the NTF engages in partnership building and takes the
lead on research and training projects. To foster partnerships with academia, NGOs, the UN, the EU,
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it facilitates and participates in
numerous learning events annually, such as peer-to-peer exchanges with the Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) Human Rights Task Team (HRTT) and UN and training courses on human rights and
development for NTF grantees (Nordic Trust Fund 2010). Other more recent World Bank knowledge
initiatives, such as the Global Forum on Law Justice and Development, have supported human rights
exchanges and seminars, such as those of the Community of Practice (CoP) on Human Rights and
Development, which was established in October 2014. The CoP has the overall aim of fostering dialogue
and innovative thinking among development and human rights professionals and increasing
understanding about the relationship of human rights and development by creating a network of
professionals who can share knowledge and new initiatives through facilitating exchanges and
sponsoring seminars on human rights and development and providing a forum for sharing research and
relevant new initiatives. One NTF-funded research grant focuses on the concept of the “minimum core”
of economic, social, and cultural rights under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights (ICESCR), focusing on the rights to health and education. This research seeks to


                                                                                                    83
demystify key concepts underpinning the ICESCR, including minimum core, progressive realization,
and maximum available resources and aims to explain their significance for development practitioners
and development policy and programming in partner countries where resources are especially scarce.
Outputs of that research include a framework analytic paper that explains the contours of the legal
concepts and two substantive research papers that explain minimum core for the right to health and the
right to education (NTF 2016).



Institutionally, the UN System Staff College (UNSSC) is the primary provider of interagency training
and learning within the UN system. It conducts a variety of training and learning activities in Turin, as
well as at regional and country levels. Its work is organized around five areas, including human rights
and development. The UNSSC, in close collaboration with OHCHR and other UN agencies, offers its
services to the leadership of UN country teams and programme staff alike with a view to build capacity
to integrate human rights into all policy and programming processes. The UNDG-HRWG updated the
HRBA Common Learning Package in 2011 under the leadership of UNFPA and with the support of
UNSSC, which resulted in the inclusion of results-based management elements and programmatically
relevant information on the Universal Periodic Review process (see chapter 5).



The UNDG-HRWG supports UN system-wide knowledge management in the area of human rights and
development by bolstering knowledge exchange among field practitioners and expanding access to
HRBA resources through the UN HRBA Practitioners’ portal (http://hrbaportal.org/). The UNSSC has
conducted train-the-trainer workshops on the Common Learning Package and is developing a number
of e-learning tools; upcoming research and training on human rights and HRBAs will focus on leadership
development and evidence-based learning.



One of the unique features of UN engagement in mainstreaming human rights, and actively supported
by OHCHR as cochair of the UNDG-HRWG, is the process of ensuring the collective ownership of
policy guidance and implementation support, particularly within the spirit of “One UN.” HRBA learning
tools for UNCTs are developed by the system for the system, while training teams are put together to
reflect a variety of UN agencies. This internally owned process and approach has proven invaluable in
deepening the system’s collective engagement on the subject. Moreover, leadership at the country level
is critical for efforts to successfully mainstream human rights. The UNDG-HRWG actively supports


                                                                                                      84
resident coordinators and UNCT leadership to engage politically and tactically on human rights by
scaling up deployment of in-country and regional human rights advisers and by developing and rolling
out a Human Rights Leadership Development Strategy.



Several multilateral donors and development banks have engaged in surveys of their members and peer
institutions to research and better understand how human rights issues are being addressed. For instance,
the UNDG-HRWG engaged in a mapping of UN agency human rights mainstreaming policies and tools
(UNDG-HRWG 2011). In addition, the European Investment Bank conducted a survey on human rights
and the activities of IFIs (EIB 2011). The DAC HRTT carried out a survey of how human rights task
team members implement principles from the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra
Agenda for Action (OECD-DAC 2011a).



VII.    IMPLICIT HUMAN RIGHTS WORK

Governance Interventions

In terms of substantive content and objectives, governance is widely viewed as the sector most closely
associated with human rights, and many aid agencies manage human rights interventions under the
umbrella of governance. Although a wide range of civil and political rights projects exists, little work
exists on integrating human rights into other governance areas, such as public sector reform or financial
management.



Most direct human rights interventions have addressed civil and political rights issues, often under a
governance heading, linked to democracy and the rule of law. Uvin (2004) estimated that this type of
aid accounts for about 10 per cent of aid budgets. Topics may include specific rights, such as freedom
of expression (e.g., media projects) or due process (e.g., rule of law programmes). Options include
investing in organizations (e.g., national human rights institutions), processes and procedures (e.g.,
democratization, including elections, parties, civic education), and structures (e.g., capacity building of
state or civil society). Some examples include the European Instrument for Democracy and Human
Rights and the EU Governance Initiative. CIDA has supported the creation of more than 22,000
community development councils in Afghanistan to strengthen community-level governance and the
unprecedented involvement of women in rural community decision-making (CIDA 2011a). However,
as Carothers (1999, 2006) notes, there is little systematic knowledge in the area of democracy support

                                                                                                        85
and rule of law initiatives.



National human rights institutions (NHRIs) have a distinct role in supporting states fulfil their legal
international obligations. NHRIs can advocate for the removal of treaty reservations, encourage the
government to pass legislation to implement international law where necessary, and argue that where
case law is ambiguous, laws should be interpreted consistently with the state’s international legal
obligations. The prevalence of NHRIs is growing: by the end of 2010, there were 66 Paris Principle-
compliant institutions in the world (UNDP and OHCHR 2010).



Access to Justice

The trend across a number of agencies to embrace an access to justice approach can be associated with
the more strategic use of human rights. Traditional rule of law interventions focused on building
institutions by working with courts, prisons, ministries, and lawyers. These interventions can contribute
to the achievement of specific rights and standards. Well-known examples include the provision of legal
representation to defendants or reducing court delays and time on remand. Another example is USAID’s
provision of police training and organizational development to police forces (USAID 2011b). Such
interventions also institutionalize the human rights principles of accountability and the rule of law. By
including equal access to justice (EA2J) in their policy documents and programmes, donors have started
to transform the way in which they analyse situations, set objectives, and provide assistance. This
approach uses participatory research to identify poor people’s priorities and tests new ways to overcome
barriers. Instead of limiting interventions to enhancing the effectiveness of institutions, a people-centred
perspective starts from the experiences of people themselves (e.g., through perception surveys).



Access to justice links demand and supply activities. In particular, it focuses on the ability of poor and
marginalized people to claim rights through the courts and of the courts to deliver appropriate services
to meet users’ needs. Access to justice involves efforts to demystify the law through rights awareness.
It helps meet the needs of women, juveniles, isolated populations, minorities, and indigenous peoples
by looking at location, language used, simplification of procedures, cultural compatibility, and the best
interests of the person. Explicit human rights or constitutional standards are used to set goals and
benchmarks, such as diversion measures for juvenile offenders under the Convention on the Rights of
the Child, or civil liberties contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

                                                                                                         86
A shift does not necessarily require explicit reference to human rights mainstreaming or a HRBA.
Although UNDP and Sida describe their policies in terms of implementing a HRBA, for example, DFID
does not. For USAID and the World Bank, access to justice is one possible area of intervention. In any
case, it is a resource-intensive approach. Lessons from UNDP Asia-Pacific point to substantial
commitments of staff time and the need to identify new partners.



USAID rule of law projects aim to improve the independence and performance of the judiciary, increase
effective criminal prosecution, and reduce delays, thereby contributing to civil rights objectives. The
agency has supported a number of access to justice programmes, including awarding grants to law
schools and civil society organizations in Iraq to provide legal aid to underserved and disadvantaged
populations, such as women, widows, divorcees, orphans, internally displaced and undocumented
populations, persons with disabilities, minorities, and others lacking state protections and services
(USAID 2011c). In 2009, USAID launched a one-month Women’s Access to Justice Campaign in two
provinces of Afghanistan to provide women in rural and urban areas a better understanding of gender
equality, women’s rights, and the legal system (USAID 2009). Likewise, the EU has supported access
to justice for vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as women and juveniles in prison in Albania and
those living in the townships and rural areas of South Africa (European Commission 2009b, 2010c).



Sida engaged in a mapping of international experiences promoting the rule of law and equal access to
justice that recounts the evolution from “law and development” to equal access to justice, describes
obstacles people face in seeking justice, and outlines an equal access to justice approach (Sida 2011c).
Based on this mapping, Sida produced the Guide on Equal Access to Justice (Sida 2011d) that instructs
Sida staff and others on identifying potential EA2J interventions while applying a HRBA.



The World Bank’s Justice for the Poor (J4P) programme supports the emergence of equitable justice
systems. It focuses on identifying and supporting substantive justice outcomes rather than on pursuing
predetermined institutional structures. The programme operates in countries where legal pluralism
presents a particular development challenge. J4P is marked by three essential characteristics: it engages
the justice sector as a whole, working with the range of justice institutions present in each country,
including state, non-state, and hybrid systems. it designs and implements innovative justice initiatives

                                                                                                      87
across development sectors, recognizing that rights and accountability are instrumental to achieving
broader development outcomes; and it is grounded in evidence-based approaches because improving
justice outcomes and processes of reform requires better understanding of existing structures and
dynamics. J4P is supported by a World Bank-administered trust fund that is financed by the Australian
Agency for International Development (AusAID) and the governments of the Netherlands, Japan,
Ireland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. J4P is active in East Asia and the Pacific
(Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste and Vanuatu) and in Africa (Nigeria and
Sierra Leone).



Other Governance Dimensions

In recent years, attention has been paid to the issue of corruption and corporate governance in the context
of development. The impacts of corruption on human rights and development have been the subject of
extensive research (see, e.g., Centre for Democratic Institutions 2001; Sunga and Bottigliero 2007);
international agreements have been signed (including an implementation monitoring mechanism agreed
to in 2009 for the 2003 UN Convention Against Corruption); and corporate structures have been
modified and policies developed to address corruption. The World Bank’s focus on the governance and
anticorruption (GAC) agenda stems from its mandate to reduce poverty. GAC undertakings ensure that
the Bank’s financing will be used for the purposes intended and to achieve the expected development
outcomes. The World Bank adopted a Governance and Anticorruption (GAC) Strategy in March 2007
(World Bank 2007b) and an Implementation Plan in October 2007 (World Bank 2007c), with progress
reports presented to the Board in 2008 and 2009. The GAC strategy calls for the strengthening of the
World Bank Group’s engagement in governance and anticorruption at three levels: (i) at the project
level, (ii) at the country level, and (iii) at the global level. The GAC Strategy, which was updated in
March 2012 , puts renewed emphasis on the Bank’s “multistakeholder engagement”. There are a number
of anticorruption tools with direct application to the Bank’s operations including the General Conditions,
the Anticorruption Guidelines, and the Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. For the Bank’s new
financing instrument, called Program for Results (PforR), a different set of Anticorruption Guidelines
which are tailored to the specificities of this product line has been developed. In particular, the PforR
Anticorruption Guidelines take account of the fact that the Bank will not be funding specific transactions.



Despite such efforts, much work remains to be done to combat corruption successfully. Human rights
principles such as participation, transparency and access to information, and accountability could

                                                                                                        88
support anticorruption programmes. It has been said that “corruption is essentially an activity carried out
by groups with power” (International Council on Human Rights Policy 2009), and a HRBA addressing
economic, political, and social factors that foster corruption could legitimize the claims of marginalized
populations and empower people to challenge the abuse of power (International Council on Human
Rights Policy 2010).



There are several examples of agencies addressing governance and human rights issues. The USAID
Mobilizing Action Against Corruption (MAAC) Activity partnered with the International Council on
Human Rights Policy (ICHRP) to publish the Armenian-language versions of ICHRP reports on
anticorruption and human rights (USAID 2011d). With Global Human Rights Strengthening Programme
support, UNDP prepared a wealth of new policies and practice notes on such areas as access to justice,
parliaments, police, decentralized governance, national human rights institutions, and the right to
information. OHCHR and UNDP organized an international seminar on human rights and governance
in Seoul in 2004.



Sometimes human rights principles have helped agencies move beyond civil or political rights projects
in their governance portfolios. Although not always couched in human rights language, interventions
may pay attention to institutionalizing participation (Gaventa 2010), providing accountability and
redress, and fostering a healthy relationship between the state and citizens based on the recognition of
rights and duties.



An NTF grant team is undertaking research to explore the links between the World Bank’s Citizen
Engagement Framework and human rights. This research is being carried out through the development
of case studies in three different contexts: Afghanistan, Paraguay, and Serbia. The research looks at
grassroots initiatives in these countries to analyse how citizen-led movements and campaigns led to
improved services and accountability and better collaboration between governments and citizens. The
research will lead to the development of an analytical paper, the findings of which will be disseminated
through knowledge and learning events at the country level and at headquarters. The World Bank team
leading this research co-leads the Community of Practice for Social Accountability and Demand for
Good Governance, and the team members participate in the World Bank’s working group to mainstream
citizen engagement in Bank operations. As such, the grant represents a strong opportunity to mainstream


                                                                                                        89
human rights knowledge into the implementation of the Citizen Engagement Framework.



VIII.   FINDINGS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION

Donors have been integrating human rights for some time and in a variety of ways, whether through
direct projects, in their country programmes, or at a global level, for example, through the work of
international organizations. Most traditional interventions have been delivered through civil and political
rights projects, often supported by civil society funds and closely associated with democracy and the
rule of law. Some governance programming areas, such as access to justice, have started to change as a
result of the introduction of HRBAs, yet it is difficult to assess wider trends, in particular in governance
areas where political dimensions have only more recently been taken into account. The absence of an
explicit application of a human rights perspective to the wider governance agenda is possibly one of the
clearest shortcomings in donor experiences. This absence could be examined, for instance, with regard
to the relationship between human rights and corruption (UNDP 2008a).



Although at a policy level governments are committed to the indivisibility of all human rights, within
development, the cooperation human rights work has tended to be narrowly construed around civil and
political rights (OECD 2001). This narrow focus in part explains why there is limited evidence and
advice on how governance interventions can strengthen the realization of all rights, including economic
and social rights.



Nonetheless, there have been significant efforts at human rights mainstreaming across a number of non-
governance sectors. Possibly because they are perceived as politically less sensitive and because of the
success of UNICEF in implementing its HRBA, child rights have been incorporated into a wide range
of policies and programmes. There has been a growing mainstreaming of human rights into health,
education, and programming on gender and women in development. By comparison, donors seem to
have less frequently linked human rights to areas such as minorities, infrastructure, and livelihoods.



There has been little research on the use of political conditionality, despite its use by bilateral agencies
and the EU. As new aid approaches emerge, it will be important to have open discussions about this
issue and how to find effective ways of handling political conditionality in the context of medium to


                                                                                                         90
long-term aid relationships as well as in fragile and conflict-affected states.



Finally, aid agencies could invest more in knowledge management across the board. Although nearly all
the UNDG-HRM agencies have developed knowledge products (KPs) on operationalizing human rights,
case studies and documents on lessons learned are lacking. Few KPs are region specific, and the vast
majority are available only in English. Most KPs are not specifically addressed to national counterparts,
thereby missing an opportunity to strengthen the capacity of national partners (UNDG-HRM 2011). The
UNDG-HRM has acknowledged these facts, and one priority for its work plan is to strengthen case
studies, lessons learned, and knowledge sharing across the UN on human rights mainstreaming). The
UN System Staff College is developing a Learning and Evidence Centre, capturing stories and
experiences (from within and outside the UN system) and translating those into training and learning
case studies for use in future skills development and leadership courses on human rights and
development (see Chapter 5).



Additional specific issues for research and analysis that could be undertaken jointly include:

     Governance subareas where there has been a demonstrable policy and programming shift (e.g.,
      rule of law and access to justice or decentralization)
     Achievements of non-governance interventions that have the explicit objective of human rights
      mainstreaming or are based on a HRBA to allow comparison between a small set of sectors (e.g.,
      health and education)
     Human rights dialogue and the impact of conditionality by bilateral donors and the EU, including
      the collaboration between development cooperation agencies and foreign ministries




                                                                                                      91

             Policies to Integrate Human Rights into Development


To implement the various types of approaches outlined in chapter 3, agencies have adopted different
strategies, policies, and frameworks, some of which are summarized in this chapter.



I.      UN BODIES AND SPECIALIZED AGENCIES

Following the 2012 global evaluation of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)’s
implementation of its human rights–based approach (HRBA) to programming, the development and
approval in 2013 of the UNICEF Strategic Plan (2014–2017) was an opportunity to clearly articulate
how HRBA programming, as a foundational principle, guides the equity focus of UNICEF’s
programmes and advocacy. The plan recalls UNICEF’s commitment to human rights principles and the
equity approach as the translation of this commitment into action by placing gender equality and human
rights as outputs under each outcome area:

           Universality: reaffirming UNICEF’s mandate to promote the rights of every child
            everywhere
           Equality and non-discrimination: enhancing the focus on the most marginalized and
            excluded children
           Accountability: highlighting formal and informal accountability mechanisms to strengthen
            the capacity of rights-holders, including children, families, and communities, to demand the
            fulfilment of their rights
           Participation: emphasizing children’s right to information and to participate in decisions that
            affect their lives



The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the United Nations’ global development
network. Its work in nearly 170 countries and territories is aimed at the eradication of poverty and the
reduction of inequality and exclusion. UNDP assists countries in three major areas: sustainable
development; democratic governance and peace building; and climate and disaster resilience. UNDP




                                                                                                        92
works holistically across sectors and around the world, operating as manager of the Resident Coordinator
System and chair of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG).

Following the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, UNDP’s primary focus is on
strengthening new frameworks for development, disaster risk reduction, and climate change. UNDP’s
strategic plan, Changing with the World 2014–2017, was published in September 2013; its overarching
vision is to help countries achieve the simultaneous eradication of poverty and the significant reduction
of inequalities and exclusion. UNDP’s work on human rights cuts across all three development pathways
of the strategic plan—sustainable development, democratic governance, and resilience building. Under
this plan, HRBA is an overarching engagement principle: as such, citizens’ expectations for voice,
development, the rule of law, and accountability should be met by strong systems of democratic
governance, highlighting the priority of strengthening the capacities of human rights institutions.




 Box 4.1

 Human Rights up Front

 The Human Rights-up Front (HRuF) initiative of the Secretary-General (launched in 2013) aims at
 improving UN action to safeguard human rights around the world. The need for early action, and the
 crucial role of responding early to and preventing human rights violations, is at the heart of HRuF.
 The UN Secretariat, funds, and programmes must all ensure that the UN system, both on the ground
 and at headquarters, is appropriately prepared—early on—to deal with evolving crisis situations.
 UNDP is playing a leading role in operationalizing the initiative at the country level, especially
 through its role as convener of the resident coordinator system.




UNDP plays an active role in other UN interagency human rights mechanisms, notably the UN
Development Group Human Rights Working Group, or UNDG-HRWG (see chapter 3) through its RC
Guidance Note on Human Rights, the Interagency Support Group on Indigenous Peoples (which in 2015
finalized the system-wide action plan on implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples, or UNDRIP), and the Interagency Support Group on Persons with Disabilities.




                                                                                                      93
UNDP’s Social and Environmental Standards (SES) have been mandatory for all UNDP projects above
$500 000 USD since January 1, 2015. The SES includes a human rights principle that requires UNDP
to refrain from providing support for activities that may contribute to violations of a state’s human rights
obligations and the core international human rights treaties, and also requires UNDP to seek to support
the protection and fulfilment of human rights. These social and environmental safeguards and related
grievance mechanisms provide tools to ensure that integrated development solutions are identified early
on so that programming does not result in inadvertent harm or conflict. The SES comprises an
overarching policy and principles, project-level standards, and the policy delivery process. The project-
level standards further support implementation of UNDP’s commitment to promote respect for human
rights, gender equality, and environmental sustainability and relate to areas such as sustainable natural
resource management, displacement and resettlement, cultural heritage, and indigenous peoples. The
specific objectives are to strengthen the social and environmental outcomes of UNDP’s programmes and
projects; to avoid adverse impacts to people and the environment; to minimize, mitigate, and manage
adverse impacts where avoidance is not possible; to strengthen capacities for managing social and
environmental risks; and to ensure full and effective stakeholder engagement, including through a
mechanism to respond to complaints from project-affected people.



The Rule of Law, Justice, Security and Human Rights team within the Governance and Peacebuilding
Cluster of the UN Bureau for Policy and Programme Support leads UNDP work on human rights. It
does so through programme delivery in countries, policy development, implementation, advocacy, and
partnerships; this work includes strengthening the work of national human rights institutions,
engagement with international human rights mechanisms, and implementation of Universal Periodic
Review (UPR) recommendations, as well as the promotion of the application of the HRBA to
development programming and national planning processes.



The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is the specialized agency of the
United Nations that promotes industrial development for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization, and
environmental sustainability. Its mission is to promote and accelerate inclusive and sustainable industrial
development (ISID) in developing countries and economies in transition. Reflecting systemic
developments within the UN system and in the wider world, UNIDO’s position on human rights is
constantly evolving. In December 2013, UNIDO member states endorsed the Lima Declaration:
Towards Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development, which provided UNIDO with a renewed


                                                                                                         94
mandate to promote ISID. In addition to the work of UNIDO in advancing economic competitiveness,
the renewed mandate recognized safeguarding the environment and creating shared prosperity as
programmatic fields of activity, contributing to a broad range of human rights objectives through
industrial development.



Human security concerns are prominent in the 2015 UNIDO’s Medium-Term Programme Framework
2016–2019 (MTPF), especially regarding post crisis rehabilitation services, which acknowledges that
industrial development has a critical role to play in building capacities for resilience and the restoration
of livelihoods following natural and human-made disasters. The MTPF implicitly recognizes the pursuit
of human rights objectives through several programmatic fields such as pro-poor enterprise and
employment initiatives oriented explicitly toward women and young people. The 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development underlines the linkages between human development and human security and
promotes the role that security plays in successful economic productivity. The agenda is an opportunity
to expand on this nexus and raise the profile of UNIDO by aiming to close the gap between security and
economic productivity.



UNIDO is working to advance the conceptual understanding of how inclusive and sustainable industrial
development can aid the achievement of human rights. For example, UNIDO developed a working paper
on the development of human rights, including the right to development, within industrial development.
UNIDO collaborated with the Regional Academy of the United Nations (RAUN) on a concept paper
outlining a HRBA to industrialization in the post–2015 era. UNIDO has deepened its engagement with
UN systemic initiatives on human rights, and it has participated in the United Nations Development
Group Human Rights Working Group (UNDG-HRWH) for several years, aiding in the elaboration of a
HRBA to development. UNIDO is thus implementing several UN systemic initiatives with regard to
human rights, HRuF inter alia, the UNDG Guidance Note for Resident Coordinators, and the 2006 UN
System Wide Action Plan on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment.



UN-Habitat is mandated by the UN General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally
sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all. This twin mandate
encompasses the right to an adequate standard of living, of which the right to adequate housing is part.
The right to adequate housing is an internationally recognized right as provided for under Article 11 of
the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). As part of the UN

                                                                                                         95
family, UN-Habitat is mandated to respect, promote, and protect human rights in all its activities. UN-
Habitat is a key agency in the implementation of the right to safe drinking water and sanitation.



In early 2013, mainstreaming of human rights became a priority issue for the UN-Habitat Governing
Council, and it was included in the 2014–2019 UN Habitat Strategic Plan. Paragraph 38 of the April
2015 “Omnibus” resolution,

       requests the Executive Director to mainstream human rights within the context of advancing the
       goals and mandate of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, as set out in the Istanbul
       Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda, in line with its strategic plan for
       2014–19, which states that all cross-cutting issues will be mainstreamed throughout its seven
       focus areas.

Such directives on mainstreaming empower UN-Habitat to apply human rights considerations to all parts
of its work programme.



The UN New Urban Agenda promotes human rights through strengthening and systematizing UN
Habitat’s engagement vis-a-vis global policy developments such as the 2030 Sustainable Development
Agenda and the HRuF initiative. UN Habitat’s human rights mainstreaming objectives are designed to
improve the capacity of UN-Habitat staff and partners to apply human rights considerations in project
implementation, to strengthen the effective integration of the HRBA into the UN-Habitat project cycle,
and to spur the development of tools that guide a human rights-based implementation of UN-Habitat
projects.



The UN General Assembly creased the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women
(UN Women) in 2010 to accelerate the UN’s goals on gender equality and the empowerment of women
as part of the UN reform agenda, bringing together resources and mandates for greater impact. The UN
Women’s Strategic Plan 2014–2017 (approved in 2013), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and other international instruments on gender equality
provide a framework for the work of UN Women. UN Women adheres to the United Nations system-
wide common understanding of a HRBA, including that all development cooperation programmes,
policies, and technical assistance should further the realization of human rights as enshrined in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. The Strategic
Plan commits UN Women to leverage its mandate to strengthen implementation of normative

                                                                                                    96
commitments and standards, including CEDAW, by enhancing the capacity of governments and
stakeholders to assess progress and share experiences and lessons learned, along with overall
implementation trends. An indicator is included on countries supported by UN Women that report under
CEDAW or the UPR process.



The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has issued a number of policies to
advance gender equality throughout all aspects of development assistance. It issued the Gender Equality
and Female Empowerment Policy in 2012, as well as the Counter-Trafficking in Persons (CTIP) Policy.
Also, although it is not a formal policy, in 2014, USAID’s LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans) Vision
for Action provided guidance on advancing LGBT rights throughout field programming.



The UN Population Fund (UNFPA) was established by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1973;
its mandate is to build the knowledge and capacity to respond to needs in population and family planning.
UNFPA is a human rights organization, and its work is guided by the Vienna Conference on Human
Rights (1993) and the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo (1994),
which confirmed that women’s rights and reproductive rights are human rights. The ICPD Programme
of Action (PoA), adopted in 1994 by 179 member states, lays out the mandate for UNFPA’s work, which
places the human rights of individuals at the centre of development rather than as numerical population
targets in order to achieve sustainable progress and confirms that increasing social, economic, and
political equality is the basis for individual well-being, lower population growth, sustained economic
growth, and sustainable development.



Approved in 2013, UNFPA’s Strategic Plan 2014–2017 embodies a HRBA to programming while
strengthening national human rights accountability systems. At the heart of the strategic plan is the
realization of the right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number,
spacing, and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so; the right to attain
the highest attainable standard of sexual and reproductive health; and that decisions concerning
reproduction should be made free from coercion, discrimination, or violence. Human rights and gender
are mainstreamed throughout the PoA and are at the core of the outcomes. The 2004 International
Conference on Population and Development Framework of Actions emphasizes that respect, protection,
promotion, and fulfilment of human rights are necessary preconditions for realizing all the unfulfilled
objectives of the PoA; the elaboration and fulfilment of rights are a critical metric for determining

                                                                                                      97
whether, for whom, and to what extent development has been achieved. The comprehensive ICPD
Beyond 2014 Review overwhelmingly supported the consensus that investing in individual human rights,
capabilities and dignity ‒ across multiple sectors and through the life course ‒ is the foundation of
sustainable development. In September 2014, a Special Session of the General Assembly endorsed the
findings of the 20-year review, and governments committed to intensified efforts to address gaps and
emerging challenges.



The constitution of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) was amended
in 1965 to add the following words to its preamble: “and thus ensuring humanity’s freedom from
hunger.” This wording was echoed in the provisions of Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the ICESCR, which
was adopted in 1966. Human rights, including gender equality, the right to adequate food, the right to
decent work, the right to social protection, and indigenous peoples’ rights, are mentioned in various
normative, strategy, and programme documents of the FAO. These specific rights and the HRBA more
generally are embedded in the strategic objectives and cross-cutting issues of the FAO Renewed
Strategic Framework that was adopted in June 2013. Human rights feature as basic principles or
substantive norms in a range of FAO policy instruments such as the Policy on Indigenous and Tribal
Peoples (2010), the Policy on Gender Equality (2012), and a number of FAO guidance instruments and
toolkits (described in chapter 5).



FAO’s Renewed Strategic Framework (RSF) integrates the rights in different ways. For example, under
Strategic Objective 1, “contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition,” the
organization works on strengthening political commitments and accountability mechanisms to realize
the right to adequate food and to promote secure and equitable access to resources and assets. Strategic
Objective 3, “reduce rural poverty,” dedicates an organizational outcome to promote greater
opportunities to access decent farm and nonfarm employment. An important component of this objective
is FAO’s commitment to support the implementation of internationally accepted labour standards.
Gender is one of the two cross-cutting themes of the RSF, under which FAO promotes gender equality
and the empowerment of rural women, based on its Policy on Gender Equality and international
instruments such as CEDAW. Other specific human rights and the HRBA form an integral part of all
strategic objectives and the other cross-cutting theme, “governance.”




                                                                                                     98
Human rights have featured in several normative instruments adopted under FAO auspices. The
Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the
Context of National Food Security (VGGT), endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS)
in May 2012, have a goal of food security and the progressive realization of the right to adequate food
and spell out human rights as part of their guiding/implementation principles. The VGGT are being
implemented in many countries to promote and protect tenure rights to land, fisheries, and forests, with
emphasis on vulnerable and marginalized groups. The various technical guides issued by FAO to support
the implementation of the VGGT highlight the strong linkages between human rights and tenure rights
(see chapter 5). The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Responsible Investment in Agriculture
and Food Systems – known as CFS-RAI were approved by the CFS in October 2014 with the objective
of promoting responsible investment in agriculture and food systems that contribute to food security and
nutrition, thus supporting the progressive realization of the right to adequate food. FAO is in the process
of developing an umbrella programme to support the implementation of the principles by all
stakeholders.


The World Health Organization (WHO) was established in 1948 with a mandate to promote universal
health coverage. The Constitution of WHO states: “The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of
health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being without distinction of race, religion,
political belief, economic or social condition.” WHO works with policymakers, global health partners,
members of civil society, academics, and the private sector to support countries to develop, implement,
and monitor national health plans. WHO supports countries to assure the availability of equitable
integrated people-centred health services at an affordable price; facilitates access to affordable, safe, and
effective health technologies; and aims to strengthen health information systems and evidence-based
policymaking. In 2014, the WHO Secretariat adopted a Roadmap for Action that outlines the strategic
vision for its integrated mainstreaming initiative of gender, equity, and human rights.


As a member of the UN system, WHO is responsible for realizing the right to health at the international,
regional and country levels (see General Comment No. 14, on the right to the highest attainable standard
of health, under Article 12 of the ICESCR). Under WHO’s 12th General Programme of Work,


        In a context of growing inequity, competition for scarce natural resources, and a financial crisis
        that threatens basic entitlements to healthcare, it would be hard to find a better expression of
        health as a fundamental right, as a prerequisite for peace and security, and the key role of equity,
        social justice, popular participation and global solidarity in the Organization’s work.


                                                                                                          99
A number of World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions confirm the centrality of human rights and the
right to health, such as WHA Resolution 23.41 (“reaffirms that the right to health is a fundamental
human right”); WHA Resolution 30.43 (“Considering that health is a basic human right and a worldwide
social goal, and that it is essential to the satisfaction of basic human needs and the quality of life”); and
WHA Resolution 51.7, adopting the World Health Declaration, whose Article 1 reaffirms the
commitment to the principle enunciated in the WHO Constitution that the enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.


At the policy level, WHO’s flagship health priority of universal health coverage is built on the notion of
“health for all,” and human rights standards and principles are reflected and referenced within WHO
global strategic action plans and thematic resolutions, such as the Mental Health Action Plan 2013–
2020; the End TB Strategy; the Global Action Plan on Non-communicable disease; the Global Strategy
on Women, Children’s’ and Adolescents’ Health; and the HIV Strategy, as well as draft stra tegies on
ageing and health, the health workforce 2030, and a framework for people-centred and integrated care.
WHO’s human rights commitment was reaffirmed by its constituent members in Executive Board
discussions on the issue of health and migration, during which a number of member states underscored
WHO’s mandate to protect and uphold the right to health without discrimination.


Established in 1996, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is the leading
advocate for global action against HIV/AIDS. Its mission is to guide, strengthen, and support worldwide
efforts to turn the tide against the epidemic. Such efforts are aimed at preventing the spread of HIV;
providing care and support for those infected and affected by the disease; reducing the vulnerability of
individuals and communities to HIV/AIDS; and easing the socioeconomic and human impact of the
epidemic. The work and mission of UNAIDS are grounded in human rights, and UNAIDS’ vision and
strategy include a focus on eliminating discrimination and advancing human rights as a precondition for
ending AIDS. Adopted in 2015 the UNAIDS 2016–2021 Strategy calls for frontloading investments,
closing the testing gap, and protecting the health of the 22 million people living with HIV who are not
accessing treatment. The strategy focuses on the unfinished agenda of UNAIDS: to drastically reduce
new infections to bend the trajectory of the epidemic. Ending the AIDS epidemic will involve progress
across the entire spectrum of rights: civil, cultural, economic, political, social, sexual, and reproductive.



The International Labour Organization (ILO) was established in 1919 as a tripartite organization
bringing together governments, employers, and workers representatives of 187 member states to set
labour standards, develop policies, and devise programmes promoting decent work for all women and

                                                                                                        100
men. ILO standards and development are deeply interlinked. Decent work and the four pillars of the
Decent Work Agenda—employment creation, social protection, rights at work, and social dialogue—
became part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is anchored in human rights. The
ILO has actively participated in shaping and defining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which
are all related to its mandate. In particular, SDG 8 (in particular, 8.5, related to equal pay for work of
equal value, and 8.7, related to the eradication of forced labour) calls for the promotion of sustained,
inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work, and is a
key area of engagement for the ILO and its constituents.



The 2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization provides the overarching
framework for the ILO programme and budget for 2016–2017. Its proposals are anchored in the
continued commitment to the goal of decent work. These proposals will equip the ILO with the capacity
to work in giving effect to the SDGs. The ILO Strategic Plan for 2016–2017 (adopted in 2015) contains
10 outcomes. Outcome 2 refers to the ratification and implementation of International Labour Standards;
Outcome 8 aims at protecting workers from unacceptable forms of work. These are closely related to
the protection of human rights. Other outcomes are also connected to human rights: creating and
extending social protection floors and promoting fair and effective labour migration policies, for
example. Two of the three cross-cutting policy drivers also have an important human rights component.
These drivers require the ILO to reflect the principles and guidance provided by the International Labour
Standards and to promote the principles and practice of gender equality and non-discrimination.



There are important synergies between the standards adopted by the ILO’s International Labour
Conference and the UN human rights system. Indeed, ILO conventions, such as the eight conventions
underpinning the four core labour standards, are widely considered to be human rights instruments. The
ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, adopted in 1998, commits member
states to respect and promote principles and rights in four categories, whether or not they have ratified
the relevant conventions: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective
bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the
elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The declaration establishes that
these rights are universal and that they apply to all people in all states, regardless of the level of economic
development. It mentions groups with special needs, including the unemployed and migrant workers. It




                                                                                                          101
recognizes that economic growth alone is not enough to ensure equity and social progress or to eradicate
poverty.



The norm-setting work of the ILO is ongoing: the ILO adopted the Domestic Workers Convention in
2011 (No. 189) to address difficult working conditions, labour exploitation, and human rights abuses
faced by domestic workers worldwide, among whom the majority are women. In June 2014, the ILO’s
International Labour Conference adopted a legally binding protocol, supplemented by a
recommendation, to strengthen global efforts to eliminate forced labour and trafficking in persons. This
protocol complements the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), addressing practices such as
trafficking in persons and creating new obligations on protection, prevention, and remedies, including
compensation. The accompanying recommendation provides technical guidance on its implementation.
The protocol reaffirms the obligation to punish perpetrators of forced labour and to end the impunity
that is pervasive in so many countries.



Although work to support refugees lies beyond the traditional parameters of development, the lines
between development and humanitarian and refugee interventions are fluid, and the approaches adopted
by refugee protection agencies can be instructive for development, particularly as development agencies
are being asked to support interventions to address refugee crises and humanitarian emergencies.
Moreover, the overlaps between human rights law and international refugee law (IRL) are increasingly
recognized, as is the potential applicability of human rights law to areas where IRL may leave gaps
(internally displaced persons, or IDPs; internal conflicts; etc.). The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) is the global body with a mandate to provide international protection and to
work for solutions for refugees and asylum seekers. It is granted the authority to supervise the application
of international instruments for the protection of refugees and asylum seekers, in particular, the 1951
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, collectively known as the 1951
Convention. State parties to these instruments are required to cooperate with UNHCR in the exercise of
its functions. Over the years, the General Assembly has expanded UNHCR’s mandate to various groups
of people who are not covered by the 1951 Convention. Some of these people are qualified as “mandate”
refugees; others are returnees, statelessness persons, and, in some situations, IDPs.

Complementing and reinforcing the protection environment for persons within UNHCR’s specific
mandate, human rights instruments are part and parcel of the legal protection framework underpinning
UNHCR’s strategic planning, objective setting, and work. There has been a sustained effort to

                                                                                                       102
mainstream human rights throughout UNHCR’s work, for example, in integrating human rights
standards into UNHCR’s advocacy activities. The importance of strengthening the linkage between
refugee and human rights protection is recognized in UNHCR’s Agenda for Protection. Overall
responsibility at the global level for coordination and advice on human rights lies with the Human Rights
Liaison Unit (HRLU) in UNHCR’s Division of International Protection. HRLU’s role includes
providing advice and training to UNHCR staff and partners on human rights standards, instruments, and
mechanisms and seeking to ensure that attention is given to protection issues within the human rights
processes. HRLU represents UNHCR in headquarters-level interagency discussions and activities
concerning human rights within the UN Treaty Body Strengthening process and in liaising with the
OHCHR, including UNHCR country offices for the various UN human rights mechanisms.

The UNHCRs’ Executive Committee has recognized “the multifaceted linkages between refugee issues
and human rights” (ExCom Conclusion No. 95 (LIV), General, 2003, at para. (k); para.(l) of this
Conclusion goes on to note the “the complementary nature of international refugee and human rights
law as well as the possible role of the United Nations human rights mechanisms in this area”. (UNHCR,
2003)



II.     EUROPEAN UNION

As the largest development donor in the world, the European Union is committed to ensuring that
“human rights is at the forefront of EU Development Cooperation,” with similar commitments to
humanitarian aid and common foreign and security policy. The policies flow from the legal obligations
of EU member states, as well as from the Lisbon Treaty provisions that recognize human rights as
common values underpinning EU partnership and dialogue with third countries. In 2012, the EU
appointed its first Special Representative for Human Rights to increase the effectiveness and awareness
of EU policy on human rights in non-EU countries (the EU is engaged in human rights dialogues with a
number of countries). A Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy was adopted in 2012
that was designed to make EU human rights policy more effective and consistent. The framework sets
out principles, objectives, and priorities, all designed to improve the effectiveness and consistency of
EU policy as a whole. It provides a basis for a collective effort involving EU member states as well as
EU institutions. The framework also anchors a commitment to partnership with civil society. The first
EU Action Plan covered the period 2012–2014 and brought together 97 actions under 36 headings; it
was prepared on the basis of consultations with EU member states, which, together with the EU, are
responsible for implementation.



                                                                                                    103
In July 2015, the EU issued a Joint Communication, “Keeping Human Rights at the Heart of the EU
Agenda,” as presented by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and
Security Policy and the European Commission, under which the Council adopted an Action Plan on
Human Rights and Democracy for 2015–2019. With this action plan, the council reaffirmed the
European Union’s commitment to promote and protect human rights and to support democracy
worldwide. The action plan was prepared by the European External Action Service, involving the
European Commission and EU member states, all of which are responsible for implementation. It builds
on the 2012–2014 Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy and reaffirms the EU’s commitment
to the Strategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy, which will continue to guide the EU’s
actions in the field.

The action plan is being implemented with the close involvement of the European Parliament and regular
consultation with relevant stakeholders, in particular, civil society organizations. A midterm review will
be undertaken in 2017.



The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the financing institution of the EU. Among the most relevant
aspects of the EIB’s commitment to human rights is the upholding of EIB’s environmental and social
standards by managing and duly remedying adverse impacts arising at the investment level. Respect for
these standards is safeguarded not only at the due diligence stage, but also through the inclusion of
contractual obligations and project monitoring. With the adoption of its revised environmental and social
standards in 2013, the EIB opted in favour of a robust and human rights–responsive social due diligence
framework, backed by relevant standards, management systems, and toolboxes, thereby rejecting the
alternative of stand-alone human rights impact assessments. This step signals the importance the EIB
attributes to the materiality of risk to affected persons, who should be acknowledged as right-holders,
and the introduction of a human rights mitigation hierarchy in the undertaking of social due diligence.
This hierarchy considers severity, likelihood, and frequency of human rights violations in an operation,
thereby reordering the prioritization of mitigation measures; the expansion of the scope of its due
diligence, therein assuming a broader view of the supply chain and considering legacy issues; and the
use of the analysis of the specific country and project context, political economy, and institutional and
legal parameters to inform social due diligence.




                                                                                                     104
The EIB Statement of Environmental and Social Principles and Standards (2009) is the bank’s publicly
consulted statement, confirming that the Bank is to follow a rights-based approach when considering the
social aspects of a project, as well as containing explicit references that the bank will not finance projects
that result in a violation of human rights or projects located in countries declared “off-limits” by the
European Council, particularly due to violations of human rights. A revision of the bank’s environmental
and social standards was undertaken in 2012 and 2013, resulting in the adoption of its updated
Environmental and Social Handbook, effective January 1, 2014. The revision was informed by the
bank’s human-rights commitments under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as well as by the
United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and other international best
practices.



III.    THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT


The mandate of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development
Assistance Committee (DAC)’s Governance Network references human rights:
        The DAC Network on Governance aims to improve the effectiveness of donor assistance in
        support of democratic governance in developing countries. It provides members with a forum
        to exchange experiences and lessons, identify and disseminate good practice, and develop policy
        and analytical tools relating to the reform of institutions, the dynamics of change and the
        interplay of checks and balances, and issues surrounding domestic accountability and respect
        for human rights. Consistent with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), the
        GOVNET promotes partner country ownership, aligned and coordinated donor approaches,
        results and mutual accountability.


The network helps deliver evidence-based research and policy recommendations to support donor
policies and programmes that promote respect for human rights. In 2014, the OECD published a report
on accountability and democratic governance that includes orientations and principles for development
for the promotion of accountability. The report is an exploration of innovative ways to improve support
of accountability in developing countries while “doing no harm” and avoiding undermining political
processes. The report highlights the need for a more holistic, comprehensive approach to accountability
support and more deference to partners as they evolve their systems, while external actors play the part
of facilitators. It proposes a systems approach in which all accountability actors take part in a country’s
own development script. (OECD, 2014)

                                                                                                         105
The leading instrument issued by the DAC on human rights is the 2007 “Action Oriented Policy Paper
on Human Rights and Development.” In this action-oriented policy paper (AOPP), the DAC committed
to fostering international consensus on how to promote and protect human rights and integrate them
more systematically into development. The AOPP identifies 10 principles that constitute basic
orientations for key areas and activities where harmonized donor action is of particular importance (box
4.2). It invites donor agencies to use the principles to inform the design of human rights policies and
programming. The principles could form a basis for dialogue with other stakeholders, national
governments, and non-state partners.


Box 4.2

OECD AOPP 10 principles

1. Build a shared understanding of the links between human rights obligations and development priorities
 through dialogue.

2. Identify areas of support to partner governments on human rights.

3. Safeguard human rights in processes of state building.

4. Support the demand side of human rights.

5. Promote non-discrimination as a basis for more inclusive and stable societies.

6. Consider human rights in decisions on alignment and aid instruments.

7. Consider mutual reinforcement between human rights and aid effectiveness principles.

8. Do no harm.

9. Take a harmonised and graduated approach to deteriorating human rights situations.

10. Ensure that the scaling-up of aid is conducive to human rights.


The OECD has for some time placed an emphasis on responsible business conduct. The OECD
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (the Guidelines) were first adopted in 1976 as part of the
Declaration on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises. Since then, the OECD has


                                                                                                   106
promoted co-operation in this field through a balanced framework of nonbinding principles and
standards addressed to governments and enterprises. Through these Guidelines, forty-two countries have
committed to new, tougher standards of corporate behaviour in the Guidelines for Multinational
Enterprises: the 34 OECD countries plus Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Latvia, Lithuania, Morocco, Peru,
and Romania. The guidelines draw explicitly on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights and include recommendations on human rights abuse and company responsibility for supply
chains, making these guidelines the first intergovernmental agreement in this area. These Guidelines
were updated in 2011 in light of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
The guidelines establish that firms should respect human rights in every country in which they operate.
Companies should also respect environmental and labour standards, for example, and have appropriate
due diligence processes in place to ensure that this respect happens. These standards include paying
decent wages, combating bribe solicitation and extortion, and the promotion of sustainable consumption.
The guidelines are a comprehensive, nonbinding code of conduct that OECD member countries and
others have agreed to promote among the business sector and include a process for complaints and
mediation.



IV.     BILATERAL AGENCIES



The Aid Policy Framework governs Swedish development cooperation. “Strengthened democracy and
gender equality, greater respect for human rights and freedom from oppression” is one out of five sub -
objectives in the 2014 Aid Policy Framework, and there is a clear indication that human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law will be core focus areas in a revised policy framework. The 2014 Aid
Policy Framework emphasizes the rights perspective and poor and oppressed people’s own perspective
on development as the fundamental values of Swedish aid and development cooperation. The new policy
framework will likely include a strong emphasis on the rights perspective. All strategies—geographic,
at regional and country levels, and global—that govern the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (Sida)’s work include human rights. The Swedish government’s instruction to Sida
were revised in 2015 to include five thematic perspectives that permeate the direction of Swedish
development cooperation: a human rights perspective, poor people’s perspectives on development, an
integrated environmental and climate perspective, an integrated gender perspective that includes the
analysis of the situation of women and girls and men and boys, and an integrated conflict perspective in
development cooperation.



                                                                                                   107
In the UK, the Department for International Development (DFID) has a strong commitment to enabling
poor people to enjoy the rights and freedoms defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and
core treaties of international human rights law. DFID recognizes that the realization of human rights
underpins sustainable development. DFID pursues its overall human rights objectives while supporting
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s lead role on oversight and negotiations related to the
international human rights framework. For the UK government, the SDGs represent a commitment to
achieve substantive, measurable improvements on economic, social, and political human rights. The
SDGs reflect human rights in substance, not just in form, and include the overarching commitment to
“leave no one behind,” an expression of the human rights agenda that commits the UK to a set of actions
to ensure that “people who are furthest behind, who have least opportunity and who are the most
excluded will be prioritized.” A commitment to human rights also underpins the four strategic objectives
of the UK Aid Strategy published in November 2015: to strengthen global peace, security, and
governance; to strengthen resilience and response to crises; to promote global prosperity; and to tackle
extreme poverty and help the world’s most vulnerable.


The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) makes clear that promoting universal human
rights is a UK priority and an integral part of building prosperity and stability around the world. It states:
        We will work with our partners to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights, and
        hold to account those responsible for the worst violations and abuses. This is part of our work
        to promote the golden thread of democracy, rule of law, free media and open, accountable
        institutions.
In March 2015, the UK passed the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target)
Act, which enshrined in law the UK’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its gross national income on
aid every year. DFID’s three overarching commitments—ending the need for aid by creating jobs,
unlocking the potential of girls and women, and helping to save lives when humanitarian emergencies
hit—are all underpinned by DFID’s commitment to the realization of universal political, social, and
economic rights.



The German Agency for International Development (GIZ) assists the German government in achieving
its objectives in the field of international cooperation. GIZ considers human rights an integral part of its
commitment to sustainable development. In October 2012, the Management Board adopted the
Orientation on Human Rights, GIZ’s primary policy statement on human rights as the reference
framework for its work. It also established a human rights complaints procedure. Concerns that any of
GIZ’s actions may have a negative impact on human rights can be addressed to GIZ via e-mail. The

                                                                                                         108
complaints procedure is being revised to comply with the standards for human rights complaint
mechanisms as stipulated in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The
Independent Compliance and Integrity Unit will play a central role in handling complaints. GIZ’s
primary concern is to ensure that no negative effects of its actions on human rights materialize in the
first place. Therefore, setting up internal assessment mechanisms and capacity development measures
has been crucial, in particular regarding the implementation of BMZ requirements. GIZ also developed
a human rights sector programme, commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development (BMZ), under implementation between 2014 and 2017.



The human rights concept note published by BMZ in 2011 underscores the centrality of human rights as
a guiding principle and cross-cutting task of German development policy. In line with its own human
rights commitments, the BMZ adopted Development Policy Action Plans on Human Rights in 2004 and
2008. These were replaced by a binding Human Rights Strategy in 2011, which reaffirmed human rights
as one of the guiding principles for German development policy, under which the realization of human
rights is recognized as an objective in itself. At the same time, BMZ regards the fulfilment of human
rights as a prerequisite for sustainable development, poverty reduction, and peace. BMZ’s Human Rights
Strategy is complemented by Operational Guidelines (BMZ 2013) specifying how to assess human
rights–related risks and impacts in the appraisal phase of all development programmes commissioned
by the ministry. Both the 2011 Human Rights Strategy and the 2013 Operational Guidelines are relevant
for all sectors and areas of German development cooperation. The 2011 strategy document is the
overarching human rights policy, but human rights were mainstreamed in earlier German strategies, for
example, the strategies on good governance (2009), water (2006), and health (2009).



The promotion and regard of human rights as inseparable and universal values form the basis of Austria’s
development policy. Human rights are mentioned in Paragraph 1 of the Federal Act on Development
Cooperation (2002) and form an integral part of the strategy of the Austrian Development Cooperation
(ADC)’s Three-Year Programme of Austrian Development Policy 2016–2018. The three-year
programme defines good governance and human security as one of its three main objectives, with the
priority area as “promotion of human rights and the rule of law,” and it prescribes a HRBA. The HRBA,
according to the programme, is a fundamental principle for all interventions, projects, programmes, and
political and policy dialogue. The HRBA has constituted the framework of ADC for many years and has
evolved even stronger in the Three-Year Programme.


                                                                                                   109
Australia has long supported the international human rights movement, and the Australian government’s
aid programme aims to promote prosperity, reduce poverty, and enhance stability within the region.
Human rights are mentioned as a priority in the 2015–2019 DFAT Strategic Framework, which states
that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) works to strengthen international frameworks
and norms that promote human rights, gender equality, democratic principles and the rule of law,
international security, and open and transparent global markets. Some human rights issues, such as
gender equality, are included in various policies across the department.



Global Affairs Canada’s Strategic Paper on Governance as a Cross-Cutting Theme (2015) outlines a
number of governance considerations for analysis and integration into policy and programming that are
aligned with a HRBA to development, including participation, inclusion, accountability, and non-
discrimination. Gender equality, another cross-cutting theme, is guided by Global Affairs Canada’s
Policy on Gender Equality (1999) and is grounded in a rights-based approach. On May 18, 2016, the
Minister of International Development and La Francophonie launched a public review and consultations
to renew Canada’s international assistance policy and funding framework. The aim is to rethink
Canada’s policies and programmes in order to better respond to the challenges and opportunities of the
new global context. Canada’s 2016 “International Assistance Review Discussion Paper” encourages the
exploration of opportunities to intensify Canadian efforts to support inclusive and accountable
governance and consideration of new ways of promoting respect for human rights, including considering
adoption of a rights-based approach to development.



Human rights is an established priority in the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs policy framework.
The Dutch government adopted a self-standing human rights strategy discussed in parliament. Human
rights progress reports are submitted annually and are available to the public. Since 2011, the priorities
have become more focused on protecting groups such as human rights defenders and LGBT people.



USAID updated its Mission Statement in 2014 to read, “We partner to end extreme poverty and promote
resilient, democratic societies while advancing our security and prosperity.” (USAID, 2014) Although
human rights are not explicitly stated in the mission statement, the vision makes USAID’s commitment
clear, describing “resilient, democratic societies” as those that “embrace not only elections, but also
legitimate, inclusive, and accountable institutions that effectively deliver services to all of their people,
respect and promote human rights, and strive to advance freedom, human dignity and development.”

                                                                                                        110
Moreover, although USAID’s traditional approach might best be characterized as “implicit” or grounded
in human rights projects, since 2010, a number of key policy frameworks have been issued that guide
its work in this area and strengthen its mandate for protecting human rights. In 2013, the USAID Strategy
on Democracy, Human Rights and Governance further defined a commitment to elevating human rights
to include the “protection and promotion of universally recognized human rights” as one of the four
development objectives of that strategy.



The 2015 US National Security Strategy states that “defending democracy and human rights is related
to every enduring national interest.” This language builds on a similar commitment in the 2010 National
Security Strategy, which highlights the intrinsic and instrumental arguments for supporting human
rights:

          The United States supports the expansion of democracy and human rights abroad because
          Governments that respect these values are more just, peaceful, and legitimate. We also do so
          because their success abroad fosters an environment that supports America’s national interests.
          Political systems that protect universal rights are ultimately more stable, successful, and secure.
          (United States, 2015)


Switzerland’s human rights engagement as whole, including the human rights engagement of the Swiss
Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), is based on a strong legal and policy framework.
Under Article 54 of the Swiss Constitution, Switzerland’s foreign policy (which includes its
development cooperation) mandate is to promote human rights, democratization, peaceful coexistence,
and the reduction of poverty. SDC is part of the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.



Since 2006, SDC has had its own human rights policy that makes an explicit link between poverty and
human rights and institutionalizes the HRBA for its development cooperation programmes. Since
Switzerland signed on to the New Deal Agreement in 2011, SDC has undergone a strategic shift and
increased its focus and work on fragile and conflict-affected countries and contexts. In line with this
strategic shift, human rights have been given increased attention and have become an integral part of
SDC’s engagement in such countries. In 2015, SDC adopted the Peacebuilding and State Building
Strategy to guide its work in fragile and conflict-affected countries. The strategy includes human rights
and humanitarian law as key strategic principles on which SDC’s work in these contexts is based. The
increased respect for human rights, alongside conflict reduction and resilience to withstand crises, is
considered a key criterion for SDC’s work in fragile and conflict-affected contexts.

                                                                                                        111
In 2016, Switzerland introduced a new Human Rights Strategy (2016–2019) for foreign policy
engagement covering foreign policy as a whole, including development cooperation engagement. The
key pillars of the previous Swiss policy were not reversed, and HRBA remains an institutionalized
programmatic approach. However, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and
the increased focus on fragile and conflict-affected contexts justified an adjustment of the policy.


In 2012, New Zealand introduced its Environment and Social Impacts Operational Policy and
Guideline, which requires all staff to identify and consider social risks including those that relate closely
to human rights issues. This policy states that the New Zealand Aid Programme will ensure that the
activities it designs and implements, where relevant, will seek to conserve and strengthen the
environment and communities through “ensuring equality and non-discrimination in participation and
access, through special consideration of the particular rights of women, children, ethnic minorities,
people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups, as relevant.”


The New Zealand government recognizes that a number of cross-cutting and thematic issues have
significant impact on development outcomes, and it endorsed three cross-cutting issues in the
International Development Policy Statement of the New Zealand Aid Programme (2011), which
recognizes the importance of human rights in development. New Zealand’s Aid Programme Strategic
Plan 2015–2019 states: “We will integrate environment and climate change, gender equality and
women’s empowerment and human rights issues in our policies and investments.” These issues must be
taken into account in a mandatory framework for the design, implementation, and evaluation of aid
initiatives in order to ensure good development outcomes and to manage risks, including the risks of
negative unintended impacts.


The Investment Priorities 2015–2019 is a companion to the New Zealand Aid Programme Strategic Plan
2015–2019 and details the framework for investments. It provides guidance on how New Zealand will
focus its aid, capability, and policy engagement to deliver sustainable development and poverty
reduction in partner countries. Investment Priorities 2015–2019 makes numerous references to human
rights in the context of particular investment priorities and cross-cutting issues:
        We will ensure that human rights are considered and protected in our activities to increase their
        impact. We will look especially for opportunities for women, children, youth and people with
        disabilities to benefit from our aid. . . . We will also work with partner Governments and
        implementing partners to build understanding of the contribution of gender equality, human

                                                                                                        112
        rights and environmental sustainability to economic growth and sustainable development, and
        will engage with regional and multilateral organisations that advance these important issues.



Norway’s human rights policy is outlined in White Paper No. 10 (2014–2015), Opportunities for All:
Human Rights in Norway’s Foreign Policy and Development Cooperation, which has the support of all
parties in the Norwegian Parliament. The white paper expresses political will to strengthen and
systematize Norway’s efforts to promote and protect human rights at the global, regional, and bilateral
levels. The realization of human rights is recognized as an important stand-alone goal in Norway’s
foreign and development policy. In addition, the realization of human rights is recognized as a means of
achieving other goals such as poverty reduction, sustainable development, and lasting peace. Policy
coherence for human rights is the fundamental principle underpinning the priorities outlined in the white
paper. In the national budget for 2015–2016, the realization of human rights was reflected as stand-alone
objectives, or as part of other development objectives, for the most relevant budget lines. It was also
reflected as stand-alone goals or part of other development objectives for most of the countries Norway
has development cooperation with.



In 2013, the Irish government adopted One World, One Future: Ireland’s Policy for International
Development, which guides the government’s engagement on international development and sets out
goals and priorities, including reducing hunger and improving resilience; inclusive and sustainable
economic growth; and better governance, human rights, and accountability. Among the key changes that
the government planned was the reorientation of its efforts toward developing countries experiencing
hunger, fragility, and instability because of conflict, disaster, or the harmful effects of climate change.



V.      INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

Several international financial institutions (IFIs) address human rights considerations in their
environmental and social policies. With respect to human rights, some IFIs are constrained by provisions
in their constitutive legal instruments, while others have mandates that explicitly include human rights.



The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was established to support the
transition of countries in Central and Eastern Europe toward market-oriented economies, provided such
countries are committed to, and apply, principles of multiparty democracy and pluralism (the region of
operation now includes Mongolia and countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean). The

                                                                                                        113
EBRD assesses these commitments on an ongoing basis, with an emphasis on civil and political rights.
Although the purpose and functions of the EBRD do not include a specific reference to human rights,
the Preamble to the Agreement Establishing the EBRD records the commitment of the contracting
parties to “the fundamental principles of multiparty democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights
and market economics.”



Although the EBRD’s political mandate has not changed substantially since the bank was established,
the focus on human rights has evolved in its Environmental and Social Policy (2014). The EBRD
established procedures for the implementation of the political aspects of its mandate that recognize the
critical link between the political and economic aspects of the EBRD’s mandate. The main rights
that EBRD considers essential elements of multiparty democracy and pluralism can be divided into four
groups: free elections and representative and accountable government; civil society, media, and
participation; rule of law and access to justice; and civil and political rights. EBRD’s Environmental and
Social Policy recognizes the responsibility of clients and their business activities to respect human rights
and that it may be appropriate for a client to complement its environmental and social assessment with
further studies focusing on specific risks and impacts. Such impacts may include impacts on individuals,
community, and workers resulting from the business activity to be supported and the way in which their
working conditions, socioeconomic status, cultural identity, human rights, and/or health may be affected.
The EBRD does not knowingly finance projects that would contravene country obligations under
relevant international treaties and agreements related to human rights. It does not have a long-term
strategic plan in this area, but it continues to develop its interpretation of the human rights elements in
the Environmental and Social Policy, including synergies with the UN Guiding Principles on Business
and Human Rights and the scope of project due diligence to be conducted in relation to this aspect of
EBRD’s policy.



The Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) appears to stand alone among IFIs to the extent that
its contracts are conditioned on respect for human rights and may be suspended by the CEB in the face
of violation. In particular, the CEB human rights framework includes loan regulations that require
projects to adhere to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
and the European Social Charter. The CEB may demand early reimbursement of disbursed loans where
the implementation of the project financed by the bank leads to a violation of the convention.




                                                                                                       114
The CEB Environmental Policy (2010) provides that “The CEB will not knowingly finance projects
which: Are identified as harmful to human beings or undermining human rights protected in the Council
of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the European
Social Charter.”



On December 17, 2013, the boards of the African Development Bank (AfDB) unanimously adopted
the Integrated Safeguards System (ISS), a cornerstone of the bank’s strategy to promote growth that is
socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. Safeguards are a powerful tool for identifying risks,
reducing development costs, and improving project sustainability, thus benefiting affected communities
and helping to preserve the environment. With the ISS, the bank addresses emerging environmental and
social development challenges. The ISS not only promotes best practices in these areas but also
encourages greater transparency and accountability. It upholds the voices of people who are affected by
bank-funded operations, especially the most vulnerable communities, by providing, for example,
project-level grievance and redress mechanisms—a structured, systematic, and managed way of
allowing the voices and concerns of affected people to be heard and addressed during project planning
and implementation.



The AfDB, in accordance with its mandate, views economic and social rights as an integral part of human
rights, and accordingly affirms, in the preamble to the ISS, that it respects the principles and values of
human rights as set out in the UN Charter and the African Charter of Human and Peoples’ Rights. These
are among the principles that guided the development of the ISS. The AfDB encourages member
countries to observe international human rights norms, standards, and best practices on the basis of their
commitments made under the International Human Rights Covenants and the African Charter of Human
and Peoples’ Rights.



The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted policies that implicitly address human rights and has
also adopted policies and procedures pertaining to indigenous peoples (Asian Development Bank, 1998)
gender equality (Asian Development Bank, 2003; involuntary resettlement (Asian Development Bank,
1995) that are supportive of human rights.




                                                                                                     115
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group. IFC’s
Sustainability Framework includes a Sustainability Policy and Access to Information Policy, which are
applicable to the IFC, and eight Environmental and Social Performance Standards, which define IFC
clients’ responsibilities. The Sustainability Framework took effect in January 2012, following a review
of three years of implementation of the 2006 Sustainability Framework as well as extensive public
consultations, including with human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the team
working on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The Access to Information
Policy increases access to information throughout the IFC project cycle, resulting in further disclosure
of project-level information on environmental, social, and development outcomes. The Sustainability
Policy and Performance Standards recognize the private sector’s responsibility to respect human rights
and the need to undertake additional due diligence in some high-risk circumstances. The current
standards address gaps identified in an earlier version (which define clients’ roles and responsibilities
for managing their projects and the requirements for receiving IFC support), particularly in regard
to human trafficking, forced evictions, and community access to cultural heritage. The policy requires
that free, prior, and informed consent be obtained in certain circumstances affecting indigenous peoples.



IFC’s Sustainability Framework incorporates key overarching human rights principles, and the
performance standards explicitly affirm the responsibility of the private sector to respect human rights.
Each performance standard has elements related to human rights dimensions that a project may face in
the course of its operations. For example, Performance Standard 1, Assessment and Management of
Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts, states that

       Business should respect human rights, which means to avoid infringing on the human rights of
       others and address adverse human rights impacts business may cause or contribute to . . . Due
       diligence against these Performance Standards will enable the client to address many relevant
       human rights issues in its project.




                                                                                                    116
 Box 4.3

 2016 World Bank Environmental and Social Framework

 On August 4, 2016, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved a new Environmental
 and Social Framework (ESF) to protect people and the environment in the investment projects it
 finances. This effort is one of several key initiatives, including procurement reform and climate and
 gender strategies, undertaken by the Bank to improve development outcomes.




The ESF responds to development demands and challenges that have arisen over time. The experience
and capacity of many borrowers has improved, and requirements have been updated to reflect the
realities of today. This framework will boost protections for people and the environment and drive
sustainable development through capacity- and institution-building and country ownership. It will also
enhance efficiency for both the borrower and the Bank. The framework brings the World Bank’s
environmental and social protections into closer harmony with those of other development institutions
and makes important advances in areas such as transparency, non-discrimination, social inclusion, public
participation, and accountability—including expanded roles for grievance redress mechanisms. The
framework helps to ensure social inclusion and explicitly references human rights in the overarching
vision statement.



To support the new framework—and to meet additional oversight demands—the World Bank is on a
trajectory to substantially increase in funding for the safeguards. The World Bank and most of its
shareholders recognize strengthening national systems in borrowing countries as a central development
goal. In line with this goal, the framework places emphasis on the use of borrower frameworks and
capacity building, with the aim of constructing sustainable borrower institutions and increasing
efficiency.



The expanded protections in the framework, which is precedent setting for the World Bank, include
comprehensive labour and working condition protections and community health and safety measures
that address road safety, emergency response, and disaster mitigation. It includes a responsibility to
include stakeholder engagement throughout the project cycle and a non-discrimination principle
augmented by a new mandatory World Bank Directive that lists examples of vulnerable and


                                                                                                   117
disadvantaged groups and explicitly requires staff to assist borrowers consider, mitigate, and manage
related issues.



With respect to human rights, the Vision Statement states that,

       the World Bank’s activities support the realization of human rights expressed in the Universal
       Declaration of Human Rights. Through the projects it finances, and in a manner consistent with
       its Articles of Agreement3, the World Bank seeks to avoid adverse impacts and will continue to
       support its member countries as they strive to progressively achieve their human rights
       commitments.



The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)’s Sustainability Framework stems from the IDB’s
charter and funding mandate to reduce poverty and inequality and to achieve sustainable growth among
its borrowing member countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. To meet these mandates, the IDB
put in place strategies and priorities to guide support and lending, along with a robust safeguards system
including, inter alia, the 2006 Environment and Safeguards Compliance Policy, its 2006 Operational
Policy on Indigenous Peoples and Strategy for Indigenous and its 2010 Operational Policy on Gender
Equality in Development. In addition, the IDB tracks measurable results, adherence to lending targets,
and the effectiveness of its safeguards and emphasizes knowledge and capacity building—essential
components for ensuring sustainability. Its strategies, policies, and frameworks address human rights
considerations implicitly rather than explicitly. IDB has adopted sector strategies (including climate
change and sustainable infrastructure); sector frameworks (in areas such as agriculture and nature
resource management, tourism, gender and diversity, urban development, and housing); and policies and
guidelines (on the environment, disaster risk management, resettlement, indigenous peoples, gender, and
access to information). In addition, the IDB has adopted multi-sectoral policies and guidelines governing
areas such as the environment and safeguards, compliance and guidelines, natural disaster risk
management, public utilities, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples and gender equality, the latter
of which was the first policy of its sort among multilateral development bank (MDBs).



VI.     EMERGING DONORS

In general, the trend among emerging donors is not to adopt an explicit position on human rights,
although in some cases their policies make mention of human rights.


                                                                                                     118
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a MDB established in Beijing in 2015. It is based
on the lessons learned from existing MDBs and the private sector. Its Articles of Agreement contain
similar political prohibitions to those found in MDBs such as the AfDB, the Inter-American
Development Bank, and the World Bank. Article 31(2) states that
        The Bank, its President, officers and staff shall not interfere in the political affairs of any
        member, nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member
        concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions. Such
        considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve and carry out the purpose and
        functions of the Bank.



The AIIB Environmental and Social Framework, published in February 2016, reflects the institutional
aims to address environmental and social risks and impacts in projects. It provides, inter alia, a robust
structure for managing operational and reputational risks of the bank and its shareholders in relation to
projects’ environmental and social risks and impacts, and it helps ensure the environmental and social
soundness and sustainability of projects. It also supports the integration of environmental and social
aspects of projects into the decision-making process by all parties and provides a mechanism for
addressing environmental and social risks and impacts in project identification, preparation, and
implementation. The framework enables clients to identify and manage environmental and social risks
and impacts of projects, including those of climate change, and provides a framework for public
consultation and disclosure of environmental and social information in relation to projects. The Vision
Statement of the AIIB Framework provides for human rights in the following way:
        The Bank believes that social development and inclusion are critical for sound development.
        For the Bank, inclusion means empowering people to participate in, and benefit from, the
        development process in a manner consistent with local conditions. . . . In this regard, the Bank
        seeks, through the Projects it finances, to be supportive of these human rights and to encourage
        respect for them, in a manner consistent with its Articles of Agreement.
With respect to indigenous peoples, the objective of Environmental and Social Standard 3 is to “design
and implement Projects in a way that fosters full respect for Indigenous Peoples’ identity, dignity, human
rights, economies and cultures, as defined by the Indigenous Peoples themselves.”
Established in 2015, the New Development Bank (sometimes referred to as the BRICS Bank) is
headquartered in Johannesburg. Its articles contain similar provisions on political prohibitions to those
of the World Bank. Article 13 (e) of the BRICS Bank Charter states,


                                                                                                     119
      The Bank, its officers and employees shall not interfere in the political affairs of any member,
      nor shall they be influenced in their decisions by the political character of the member or members
      concerned. Only economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions, and these
      considerations shall be weighed impartially in order to achieve the purpose and functions stated
      in Articles 2 and 3.

Many agencies have development tools, processes, and guidance for staff to secure the effective and
consistent implementation of policies and approaches. This chapter focuses on the issue of “how” donors
implement their distinct approaches to human rights and how they implement policies.



I.      UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW

The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a unique process within the Human Rights Council which that
involves a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN member states. It was established
at the same time as the Human Rights Council was created on March 15, 2006, by the UN General
Assembly via Resolution 60/25. The UPR is a mechanism under which all member states of the UN
undergo the review on the status of all human rights in their country every four years. Forty-eight states
are reviewed per year, divided into three sessions of two weeks. The UPR provides an opportunity for
all states to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries
and to overcome challenges to the enjoyment of human rights. The UPR also includes sharing best
human rights practices around the globe. It is designed to prompt, support, and expand the promotion
and protection of human rights on the ground. To achieve this goal, the UPR involves assessing states’
human rights records and addressing human rights violations wherever they occur. The UPR aims to
provide technical assistance to states and to enhance their capacity to deal effectively with human rights
challenges and to share best practices in the field of human rights among states and other stakeholders.



The main objective of the UPR is to improve the human rights situation at the country level through:

                An assessment of positive developments and challenges faced by the state
                Enhancement of the state’s capacity and of technical assistance needed, in consultation
                 with, and with the consent of, the state
                Sharing best practices among states and other stakeholders
                Support for cooperation among national stakeholders in the promotion and protection
                 of human rights




                                                                                                       121
               Encouragement of cooperation with the Human Rights Committee (HRC), human rights
                bodies (treaty bodies and special procedures), and the Office of the UN High
                Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)



The review is carried out through an interactive dialogue between the state under review and the Human
Rights Council, in a working group composed of the 47 members of the HRC and facilitated by three of
them (acting as rapporteurs, and known as the “troika”). The working group is an intergovernmental
meeting that UN entities and stakeholders (national human rights institutions, or NHRIs;
nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs; members of civil society, etc.) can attend but during which
they cannot intervene. The UPR is both assisted by and relevant to the work of development actors,
particularly those within the UN system (See also Vietnam example in Chapter 7). The UPR mechanism
benefits from the active involvement of the whole UN system, and in particular of UN country presences.
The resident coordinators (RCs), UN country teams (UNCTs), and other UN agencies play an important
role in ensuring that the state has the information and capacity to produce a solid and representative
report; that there is wide national ownership and engagement in the UPR process; and that the
recommendations are followed up by the state. This is illustrated in the UNCT experience in Ecuador
(box 5.1): that UNCT is developing its new Common Country Assessment (CCA) and United Nations
Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), to which it is applying a HRBA.




 Box 5.1

 UNCT Ecuador

 The UN RC viewed the UPR process in Ecuador strategically, believing that the UN should support
 Ecuador, is producing a strong and representative state report that could provide a solid basis upon
 which the UNCT could draw. The RC understood the need for strong national ownership of the state
 report. Specifically, the UN supported the reporting process in three ways: informing and promoting
 wide engagement in the process; supporting national consultations for the state report; and sending
 information to Geneva. (Source: UNDG, 2010)




                                                                                                  122
Within the UN, agencies link UPR and development programming and policy. UN Women supports the
UPR, including supporting the preparation of member state reports, contributing to UNCT reports, and
supporting the implementation of recommendations. UN Women also collaborates with other
mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the Working Group on Discrimination Against
Women in Law and in Practice; the Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Issues; and the Special Rapporteur
on Violence Against Women, Its Causes and Consequences.



The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supports the UPR. The specific and targeted
human rights work includes strengthening the work of NHRIs (with more than 90 NHRIs, and through
a partnership with the ICC-NHRIs and the OHCHR, as well as with regional networks of NHRIs),
supporting engagement with the international human rights machinery and implementation of UPR
recommendations in particular; and promoting the application of the HRBA to development
programming and national planning processes.



Documenting good practices and lessons learned on mainstreaming human rights is one of the priorities
of the UNDG-HRM. It responds to United Nations country teams’ request for evidence-based guidance
on human rights mainstreaming. In 2013 the UNDG published selected experiences of UN country teams
in integrating human rights into their development work. The case studies highlight different ways in
which United Nations country teams can support both government and civil society to engage with
international human rights mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic Review and Special
Procedures of the Human Rights Council. (see Box 5.2) (UNDG 2013a).




Box 5.2 Tanzania: The Universal Periodic Review: An Opportunity to Enhance Rights-Based
Development Results



        In 2011, Tanzania underwent its first Universal Periodic Review conducted by the United
Nations Human Rights Council. This provided a valuable opportunity to address long-standing human
rights issues in the country. However, challenges in engaging with the Universal Periodic Review
process and leveraging these opportunities for the benefit of the population were multifold, in particular
the lack of knowledge and experience and limited ability to ensure a transparent, inclusive and
participatory process among national stakeholders. The United Nations system, under the leadership of

                                                                                                     123
the Resident Coordinator and supported by an inter-agency framework, was able to step in at the request
of government to provide the required technical support to both State and civil society actors. It also
mobilized a wide range of actors, including state officials from different rural areas, civil society, the
media and the donor community, to engage in the Universal Periodic Review preparatory and review
process, as well as to support implementation of its recommendations. As a result, the Universal Periodic
Review process became viewed as a credible process, representing the genuine views of Tanzanians.
The recommendations provide a powerful framework to take forward human rights reform in Tanzania
and for policy makers and development partners to draw upon in advocacy, policy and programming
initiatives (Source: UNDG, 2013a).



Among bilateral donors, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) has sought to
engage its country offices in the UPR process. For example, it encourages country offices to create
strategic synergies between recommendations issued by Switzerland and programmes implemented by
the SDC at the national level. The SDC also encourages country offices to consider recommendations
accepted by countries as part of the UPR as possible entry points for a programmatic engagement.




II.     HUMAN RIGHTS GUIDANCE, TOOLKITS, AND IMPLEMENTATION



The United Nations

In addition to its role as convener of the RC system, the UNDP also plays an active role in various other
UN interagency human rights mechanisms, notably the UN Development Group Human Rights Working
Group by providing relevant guidance on human rights, (such as the RC Guidance Note on Human
Rights), the Interagency Support Group on Indigenous Peoples (which in 2015 finalized the System
Wide Action Plan on Implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples), and the Interagency Support Group on Persons with Disabilities. The Rule of Law, Justice,
Security and Human Rights team within the Governance and Peacebuilding Cluster of the UN Bureau
for Policy and Programme Support leads the overall human rights work through programme delivery in
countries, policy development, implementation, advocacy, and partnerships.           A recent source of
guidance in the UN context is the 2015 UNDG, Guidance Note on Human Rights for Resident
Coordinators and UN Country Teams which includes a summary of guiding principles and key messages


                                                                                                     124
and outlines the human rights responsibilities of resident coordinators and UNCTs. The Guidance Note
is broken down by sections which address (i) why the UN’s human rights role is so important, in that
mainstreaming human rights achieves better development results, doing no harm and exercising human
rights due diligence and preventing human rights crises. The Guidance Note also outlines the human
rights responsibilities of the resident coordinator and the UNCT as well as the boarder UN team. It then
describes how to meet these human rights responsibilities through understanding the human rights
situation on the ground and how to build strategies for immediate and longer term priorities. This section
includes how to act to advance human rights and ensuring that the UN is exercising due diligence
(UNDG, 2015).



A European Union - United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) toolkit, Child Rights Toolkit:
Integrating Child Rights in Development Cooperation, was developed in 2014 primarily for
development professionals working in bilateral and multilateral donor agencies (such as EU delegations,
UNICEF, other UN agencies, regional development banks, and the World Bank). The toolkit is useful
for government and civil society professionals in countries addressing development challenges as well
as for experts engaged in providing technical assistance in the design and implementation of
development programmes. The audience includes policymakers and practitioners who are not child
rights experts but need practical guidance on:

       How to operationalize international commitments on children’s rights within different phases
        and sectors of development cooperation programming and external action
       How to support partner governments in implementing their commitments under international
        treaties and standards to protect, respect, and fulfil children’s rights
The toolkit consists of eight modules, each of which contains associated tools for application.



The 2016 UN-Habitat Tool enables increasingly uniform and effective mainstreaming through a three-
pronged integrated approach: a help desk/advisory services function that includes project reviews and
housing rights and human rights briefs; training and capacity-building components for staff and external
stakeholders; and mainstreaming human rights at the country level by reinforcing the human rights
component as an operational activity across UN-Habitat’s different focal areas of work.




                                                                                                     125
FAO Toolkits and Guidelines
A number of UN specialized agencies have taken note of human rights in their policies and guidance,
including rights-related guidelines and toolkits. Since 2012, the Committee on World Food Security
(CFS), a body comprising the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and UN
members and co-hosted by FAO, the World Food Programme, and the International Fund for
Agricultural Development, have endorsed a number of soft-law instruments based on human rights
generally, the right to adequate food in particular, including the FAO Environmental and Social
Management Guidelines (2015), and FAO Guide to the Project Cycle (2015). Other such instruments
include:



          Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests
           in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT) (2012),
          Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems (CFS-RAI) (2014),
          Framework for Action for Food Security and Nutrition in Protracted Crisis (2015),
          Global Strategic Framework for Food Security and Nutrition (4th version of 2015).



The European Union

In 2012, the Council of the EU called for the EU Commission to

           develop a tool-box for working towards a rights-based approach to development cooperation,
           with the aim of integrating human rights principles into EU operational activities for
           development, covering arrangements both at HQ and in the field for the synchronisation of
           human rights and development cooperation activities (Council Conclusions on an EU Action
           Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2012)



In April 2014, the European Commission published Toolbox: A Rights-Based Approach, Encompassing
All Human Rights for EU Development Cooperation. The toolbox describes what a rights-based
approach (RBA) to development is by highlighting the core concepts and their rationales, clarifying
common misunderstandings, and introducing relevant legal references and other donors’ commitments.
It then describes how to systematically apply a RBA in EU development cooperation, which objectives
to pursue, which working principles to apply, and how to integrate a RBA in the implementation of

                                                                                                     126
programming and in each phase of the EU project cycle management. Finally, the toolbox provides a
checklist and offers support measures for EU staff in headquarters and delegations to support the
implementation of this new approach. The toolbox contains references to examples of good practice
provided by stakeholders that have officially adopted a RBA in their development cooperation. It is
intended to provide pragmatic support and guidance to EU staff and partners involved in the
implementation of day-to-day EU development cooperation. It deals exclusively with EU development
cooperation and does not apply, for instance, to EU humanitarian assistance. The toolbox and all
supporting documents can be found at www.eidhr.eu.



The CEB was evaluated positively by the Joint Inspection Unit for its mainstreaming of the 2012 Council
of Europe Development Bank (CEB) Toolkit on Mainstreaming of Employment and Decent Work, which
establishes systemic standards for mainstreaming decent work for UN entities. This toolkit is designed
to be a “lens” that agencies can look through to see how their policies, strategies, programmes, and
activities are interlinked with employment and decent work outcomes and how they might enhance these
outcomes by taking full account of the implications of their policies, strategies, programmes, and
activities for employment and decent work during the design stage and while advising and assisting
countries and constituents with regard to the adoption and implementation of the policies.



The approach of the toolkit is similar to that adopted during the gender mainstreaming process: it
provides the user with a checklist of questions used to raise awareness of the interlinkages between
decent work and the different themes and policy domains of the respective agencies. It contains a list of
key questions organized according to the four pillars of the Decent Work Agenda to guide agencies in:

       Determining whether policies, strategies, programmes, and activities may affect employment
       Determining if decent work outcomes exist in their different dimensions at the global, regional,
        country, sectoral, and local levels
       Exploring how the effects of these policies, strategies, programmes, and activities are or could
        be taken into account or assessed in a more systematic way
       Promoting concrete ways to optimize employment and decent work outcomes in policies and
        operations, ideally at the design stage



Bilateral Agencies


                                                                                                    127
SDC was among the first development agencies to adopt guidelines on human rights and development
cooperation back in 1997. Following the UN Statement of Common Understanding on a Human Rights–
Based Approach in 2003, SDC issued its own policy in 2006 and adopted that approach. Since 2006,
SDC has actively supported the application of the HRBA throughout the institution.


The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) developed methodological material
on a HRBA to development that includes information, tools, and inspiration on how to integrate and
apply a HRBA in Swedish development cooperation. The HRBA (equivalent to the concept of rights
perspective in Swedish policy) provides legal grounds and principles that guide Sweden’s work for
people living in poverty. The material was developed for Sida staff, but it is also relevant for Sida
partners and other stakeholders. It includes a number of HRBA-related information briefs on a range of
issues. The methodology is used to achieve sustainable results through targeting root causes of problems
and active and meaningful participation among those concerned and ensuring a focus on discriminated
people and people in vulnerable situations.



Since Germany’s publication of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development
Guidelines on Incorporating Human Rights into Programme Proposals in 2013, the German Agency
for International Development (GIZ) has further developed its internal guiding documents. Staff in
charge of project planning and implementation have attended training sessions on human rights
standards and principles and methodologies for the appraisal of human rights impacts and potential risks.
The implementation of these guidelines is part of the internal quality control of project proposals within
GIZ. Other formats that intend to further promote a HRBA to project design include sector-specific
training and exchange formats, the collection and publication of promising practices of human rights-
based projects in various sectors, and guiding documents and tutored online courses on human rights
issues in development. Introductory courses for new staff include a course on integrating human rights,
gender equality, and poverty reduction into programme design and implementation. In January 2016,
this course became part of mandatory in-house training for new staff.



In 2015, the Austrian Development Agency (ADA) developed an operational-level questionnaire/self-
assessment for international partners when applying for funds. This instrument helps integrate the HRBA
and social aspects into projects and programmes. ADA had held a series of workshops for Austrian


                                                                                                     128
Development Cooperation (ADC) staff (ADA, Ministry of Foreign, other relevant ministries among
others. Experts from Denmark’s Danida were invited to support this endeavour because their entire
development strategy is based on the HRBA. Concrete recommendations from these events include the
incorporation of the HRBA in guidelines on the development of cooperation strategies and the inclusion
of relevant HRBA goals and indicators in new cooperation strategies with partner countries.



In Finland, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to ensure compliance with the HRBA mandated by the
National Action Plan on Fundamental and Human Rights 2012–2013 by reviewing adherence to the
HRBA as part of the overall quality assessment of all interventions considered for funding (HRBA is
part of the quality assessment procedures). The first review of a project’s quality, including its adherence
to the HRBA, is performed by the geographically or thematically responsible unit within the ministry.
The intervention is then reviewed by the Quality Assurance Group of the ministry; the assessment
encompasses an evaluation of the intervention’s level of compliance with the HRBA. If a project is
deemed to have negative impacts on human rights, it will not receive funding from the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs.



New Zealand has systematically developed tools to encourage and assist staff to consider cross-cutting
issues, including human rights, at all stages of activity design. Generic guidance on human rights in
development activities has been published and training is available to staff four times a year to support
their understanding and use of this guidance. Sessions on the rights of persons with disabilities and
children’s rights have been delivered to staff by specialist agencies (e.g., UNICEF) that also provide
information relevant to development activities, including manuals and checklists on various human
rights issues. Strategic evaluations consider how all cross-cutting issues have been addressed at this
level. Processes are in place to advance implementation of New Zealand’s commitment to integrate
cross-cutting issues in programming and policy engagement (box 5.3).

 Box 5.3
 New Zealand Agency for International Development
 The New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) has developed a useful set of
 screening questions for evaluating the implementation of its human rights mainstreaming policy.
 These questions can be considered at all stages of the programme cycle and evaluation process; they
 include:


        Which rights are affected by this strategy or programme?
        Is there a risk of acting in any way that is inconsistent with human rights commitments?
         Or of reducing the ability of the partner government to fulfil its human rights obligations?
         Or reducing participants’ ability to exercise their rights?
        Has the strategy or programme been developed and implemented using participatory
         methodologies?
        Does the strategy or programme contain clear accountability mechanisms and measures
         that reinforce legal accountabilities both within the partner country and in New Zealand?
        Is the strategy or programme inclusive? Does the it discriminate (directly or indirectly)
         against any group of people or bar them from benefiting from the programme’s benefits,
         or does it support discriminatory laws and regulations?
        Does the monitoring and evaluation framework include the collection of disaggregated
         data?
 (Source: NZAID, 2009).




Norway has developed the following strategies and guidance relevant to human rights and development
for its foreign service:

          Support of human rights defenders
          A new strategy for freedom of expression and independent media in foreign and development
           policy
          A national action plan on business and human rights was launched 12 October 2015
          Guide for the foreign service: Protection and Promotion of the Rights and Freedoms of Persons
           belonging to Religious Minorities

III.       HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT ASSESSMENTS

A human rights impact assessment (HRIA) is an instrument for examining policies, legislation,
programmes, and projects to identify and measure their effects on human rights. HRIAs provide a
reasoned, supported, and comprehensive answer to the question “How does the project, policy, or
intervention affect human rights?” The fundamental purpose is to help prevent negative effects and to
maximize positive effects. As such, HRIAs are an indispensable part of making human rights
considerations operational in a range of legal and policy contexts.


There has been increasing demand for various actors to undertake HRIAs before adopting and
implementing policies, projects, agreements, or programmes. The development of this tool is part of a
growing effort by the human rights community to operationalize the relevance of human rights in various
fields, including development, and thus to advance an understanding of the ways in which public policies
and development projects affect the enjoyment of people’s rights (World Bank, 2013).


In 2015, Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) was improved through a revision of the EU
Commission Impact Assessment Guidelines, which “now include specific guidance and a tool box for
analysing the potential impact of important EU policy initiatives on developing co untries.” The
commission released a report monitoring progress on PCD in August 2015 that stated, “In response to
Council and European Parliament demands for an independent ex-post assessment of how the
Commission implements its legal and political commitments, an independent and comprehensive
evaluation on PCD is to be launched in February 2016” (2015 EU European Commission).



The UNDP Oslo Governance Centre conducts democratic governance assessments and UNDP projects
at the country level, including those of the UNDP Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund. It also
manages the Governance Assessment Portal, an online resource centre for governance indicators,
assessment frameworks, and country studies.




                                                                                                      131
In 2010, the International Finance Corporation and the International Business Leaders Forum (IBLF),
in collaboration with the UN Global Compact, developed the Guide to Human Rights Impact Assessment
and Management. The guide was developed for companies committed to assessing and managing the
human rights risks and impacts of their business activities. It covers how to identify potential and/or
existing human rights risks; assess potential and/or existing human rights impacts; and integrate findings
from the assessment into the company’s management system. The guide presents a seven-stage
framework, a comprehensive and systematic methodology for companies to follow and adapt to their
needs when developing their own HRIA or integrating human rights into other kinds of risk and/or
impact assessments. By following and adapting the guide’s seven-stage process and completing a HRIA,
a company will be in a better position to address potential and/or existing human rights risks and impacts.

IV.     HUMAN RIGHTS INDICATORS

Human rights indicators are central to the application of human rights standards in context and relate
essentially to measuring human rights realization, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They offer an
empirical or evidence-based dimension to the normative content of human rights legal obligations and
provide a means of connecting those obligations with empirical data and evidence; in this way, they
relate to human rights accountability and the enforcement of human rights obligations. Human rights
indicators are important for both assessment and diagnostic purposes: the assessment function of human
rights indicators relates to their use in monitoring accountability, effectiveness, and impact; the
diagnostic purpose relates to measuring the current state of human rights implementation and enjoyment
in a given context, whether regional, country specific, or local (World Bank, 2013). As such, human
rights indicators are an indispensable element of any approach adopted for the integration of human
rights into development.


At UN-Habitat, the “markers” are social safeguard mainstreaming tools that serve two main purposes
quality assurance and capacity building. The markers assure the quality of projects at the level of the
Project Advisory Group (PAG), and thus increase accountability and transparency through the group’s
monitoring function. The markers also build the capacity of UN-Habitat to integrate cross-cutting issues
in the project cycle by providing guidance and sharing knowledge, including through staff self-
assessment.


At the project planning and design stage, a self-assessment rating is recorded in the Projects Accrual and
Accountability System (PAAS) by the project manager prior to submitting the project document to the
PAG for review and approval. A UN-Habitat project for consideration of the PAG must receive a final


                                                                                                      132
rating of 1 or higher by the cross-cutting teams in order to be approved. This final rating is recorded in
PAAS. Projects rated 0 (i.e., a blind or negative rating by the cross-cutting teams) will not be allowed to
proceed to access funding. The markers became effective on September 1, 2015 (UN Habitat, 2015)
Two indicators measure UN-Habitat’s human rights objectives:


       Number (and percentage) of UN-Habitat project documents submitted to the PAG reflecting the
        HRBA; by the end of the 2014–2019 Strategic Plan, 70 per cent of new project documents
        submitted to the PAG must reflect the HRBA.
       Number of UN-Habitat project documents, policies, strategies, concept papers, and guidelines
        reviewed and implemented based on the HRBA; for each biennial cycle, 100 substantive
        advisory services must be delivered as measured by the number of UN-Habitat project
        documents, policies, strategies, concept papers, and guidelines reviewed.


Human rights mainstreaming at UN-Habitat builds on existing knowledge and will enable an
increasingly uniform approach toward effective mainstreaming through a three-pronged integrated
approach: a help desk/advisory services function that includes project reviews and housing rights and
human rights briefs; training and capacity-building components for staff and external stakeholders; and
mainstreaming human rights at the country level by reinforcing the human rights component as an
operational activity across UN-Habitat’s different focal areas of work.


In recent years, UN-Habitat has been moving toward greater operationalization of human rights with the
development of explicit technical guidance to apply rights-based approaches to health, for example, on
the integration of rights-based approaches into national health sector strategies and programmes; on
preventable maternal, neonatal, and under age five mortality and morbidity; and on ensuring human
rights in the provision of contraception. This operational focus has led to enhanced efforts to identify
“underlying determinants of health” through the identification of social determinants of health and
access barriers and the disaggregation of data and “health inequality monitoring” to trace those who are
not being reached by health services or who are more vulnerable to ill health. These efforts have relied
on the development and use of human rights indicators.




                                                                                                      133
V.         NEW TOOLS AND PROCEDURES

 Several agencies have made changes to project cycle management procedures to help integrate human
 rights at all levels of design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of regional and country
 strategies, programmes, and projects. In some cases, these have been compulsory; within the UN system,
 reviews of UNICEF’s work, CCAs, and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework
 (UNDAF) show the impact of this mandatory approach on country strategies and activities (box 5.4).




     Box 5.4

     UN Country Assessment and Programming

     In 2007, the UN issued new guidelines for preparing CCAs and UNDAFs that employ a HRBA. The
     guidelines are supported by a guidance note that gives technical advice on applying indicators for
     HRBA programming. These documents explicitly state that human rights form the basis of UN
     analysis and programmes. The documents contain a thorough analysis of the root causes of poverty
     and take a sophisticated approach to advocacy. They point out data inadequacies in identifying
     discrimination and inequities and provide clarity in capacity analyses of both duty-bearers and rights-
     holders.




 Two assessments of UNDAFs (see box 5.3) were conducted in 2011. In one study, the United Nations
 Development Operations Coordination Office (UN-DOCO) developed a matrix of variables to evaluate
 UNDAFs and their success applying a HRBA. In the other study, the UNDG-UNDAF Programming
 Network (UPN) assessed how a HRBA, among other programming principles, had been applied to
 UNDAFs. This study concluded that a HRBA is one of the best, most uniformly integrated principles
 across the UNDAF



 Agencies continue to make changes at the level of strategy and programme appraisal and design:

        Human rights situation analyses contribute to country strategies by identifying national human
           rights constraints and opportunities to strengthen capacities of both state and non-state actors
        Bridging analysis looks at a country’s existing international, regional, and constitutional human

                                                                                                         134
        rights obligations and identifies gaps in legislative frameworks, policies, and programmes. The
        analysis then describes measures recommended by the human rights system to fill these gaps,
        thereby identifying programming priorities (e.g., United Nations Development Fund for Women
        in Tajikistan;
     Participatory approaches used at all stages (e.g., the UK Department for International
        Development’s Participatory Rights Assessment Methodologies or the joint UNDP-OHCHR
        rights-based municipal assessment and planning project in Bosnia-Herzegovina).



In general, however, there is a lack of instruments to hold donors accountable for implementing their
human rights policies. A Global Human Rights Strengthening Programme’s lesson-learning workshop
in March 2005 recommended the establishment of mechanisms at the country level to support the UNDP
to implement its HRBA—an approach piloted in Kenya with indigenous peoples. By supporting the
development of partner capacities, donor agencies can help to create momentum to improve collective
performance of partner country governments and civil society actors. In 2011, UNICEF introduced the
Equity Tracker, a tool for monitoring progress made by country offices and UNICEF on its refocus on
equity (UNICEF 2011a). Based on annual reporting, however, it seems that although most staff members
appreciate the value of human rights, there is no grounded accountability system and much depends on
individual interest in mainstreaming (UNDG-HRM 2011).



Human rights monitoring and evaluation continues to be a weakness across most agencies and at all
stages in the programming cycle. This fact applies to human rights projects, mainstreaming efforts and
dialogue initiatives, as well as to country programme impacts and the overall institutionalization of
human rights policies within agencies. For example, at the level of projects and country programmes,
the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation developed a human rights impact assessment tool
(Norad 2001), but the tool does not appear to be systematically used. Human rights indicators have been
developed to assess overall country performance and influence aid allocations, but these are
controversial. Metagora—an international project implemented under the auspices of the consortium
Paris 21, hosted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2008—aimed at
enhancing evidence-based assessment and monitoring in the areas of human rights, democracy, and
governance. Its main objective was to develop tools based on well-established statistical methods to
obtain data and create indicators upon which policies can be formulated and evaluated (). It is not yet
clear whether the complaint procedures made available through the 2008 Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights will prove helpful in monitoring

                                                                                                   135
human rights commitments and projects (UN 2008b).

VI.     TRAINING AND LEARNING PROGRAMMES

The UN System Staff College (UNSSC) is the primary provider of interagency training and learning
within the UN system. UNSSC conducts a variety of training and learning activities in Turin, as well as
at regional and country levels. Its work is organized around five areas, including human rights and
development. The UNSSC, in close collaboration with OHCHR and other UN agencies, offers its
services to the leadership of UN country teams (UNCTs) and programme staff alike, with a view to
building capacity to integrate human rights into all policy and programming processes. In 2011, it led
the update of the HRBA Common Learning Package that resulted in the inclusion of results-based
management elements and programmatically relevant information on the UPR process. UNSSC has
conducted train-the trainer workshops on the Common Learning Package and has developed a number
of e-learning tools; upcoming research and training on human rights and HRBAs will focus on leadership
development and evidence-based learning.



One of the unique features of UN engagement in mainstreaming human rights has been the process of
ensuring the collective ownership of policy guidance and implementation support, particularly within
the spirit of One UN, the programme in which multiple UN agencies function as a single team within a
country to maximize efficiencies and promote interagency coordination. HRBA learning tools for
UNCTs are developed by the system for the system, while training teams are put together to reflect a
variety of UN agencies. This internally owned process and approach has proven invaluable in deepening
the system’s collective engagement on the subject matter.



With the decentralization process that FAO embarked on after the adoption of its Renewed Strategic
Framework (RSF), more capacity development work and the development of tailored tools and
assistance have become more important. In addition to many theme-specific learning materials, an
integrated learning programme was developed in 2014–2015 on the UN Common Country Programming
principles, with lessons on gender equality, the right to food, decent work, and indigenous peoples’ right
to free, prior, and informed consent. The decentralization process has allowed for increasing knowledge
sharing and understanding of regional and national dynamics in order to provide results-based and
evidence-based support and assistance, at the core of the principles of the RSF.




                                                                                                     136
Despite the benefit of the decentralization process, its implementation has posed constraints to ensure
adequate resources in support of regular programme activities in some areas such as the right to food.
For example, although regular programme funds supplemented the work on the right to food that mainly
depended on trust funds (Germany, Norway, and Spain) until 2013, activities have since been carried
out exclusively with trust funds. Considering that many human rights require progressive and long-term
commitments are aimed at increasing technical capacity, awareness raising and advocacy, and making
use of concrete opportunities created by political and economic processes, decreasing financial resources
hampers effectiveness and efficiency in the pertinent work of FAO. Resource constraints have led to the
lack of representation of FAO in UN-led human rights-related processes, such as the UNDG Human
Rights Working Group.



To ensure adherence to and understanding of the HRBA, Finland’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)
organized in-depth training on the HBBA to development. The basics of HRBA are mainstreamed into
the overall development policy and development cooperation–related trainings, such as those on
programming and evaluation, offered by the MFA. In addition, sector-specific HRBA trainings and
workshops have been organized; these are open to civil society and consultants working in the
development field. The aim of these trainings is to strengthen knowledge on human rights–related quality
criteria (availability, accessibility, affordability, acceptability, and quality) and their use in the design of
development interventions, as well as to strengthen understanding on the adherence to the human rights
principles in programme design, implementation, and evaluation.

                 Case Studies: Country Projects and Programmes

Although the most common form of human rights assistance is human rights projects, a strategic
approach aims to integrate human rights in the design of a bilateral or multilateral country strategy. This
chapter provides case studies of some country programmes. Country-level approaches create
opportunities such as promoting human rights through coordinated, parallel interventions in different
sectors, allowing a programme focus on a particular group or issue or encouraging a focus on human
rights principles (e.g., participation and accountability) in technical areas, or supporting the realization
of economic and social rights. High-level political dialogue, processes of political opening, and partner
government ownership are also important enabling factors in country programmes.

I.       BANGLADESH: NORAD’S WOMEN AND GENDER EQUALITY PROGRAMMES

As the fourth largest recipient country of Norwegian bilateral aid, Bangladesh has received more than
NKr 12 billion in Norwegian aid (adjusted for inflation). Bilateral cooperation was revised in 2008, and
the emphasis is on business cooperation and political dialogue, whereas aid is limited to projects
concerning:

        Climate change, environment, and sustainable development
        Women and gender equality
        Good governance and human rights
        Climate change, environment, and sustainable development



In 2011, the Norwegian Embassy in Dhaka entered into an agreement with UN Women: for up to NKr
18 million over three years, the project would strive to reduce women’s vulnerability resulting from
climate change and to influence government policymaking. The project was implemented in cooperation
with two local partners, BRAC (an international development organisation based in Bangladesh) and the
Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) in ten selected districts in Bangladesh. Specific goals
included:

        To promote women as change actors and resources in the work of climate change adaptation
         and reduced vulnerability of local communities
        To contribute to the government and others taking women into consideration in climate change
         adaptation interventions in local communities

                                                                                                       138
       To contribute to the documentation and development of good models and practices
        internationally
       To increase economic opportunities for vulnerable women
       To enhance women’s rights



The project’s results included:

       Women in the selected areas obtained better knowledge and ability to implement measures
        against climate change.
       Approximately 1,600 women earned better incomes as a result of training and productivity
        improvements in their businesses.
       UN Women persuaded the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics to include aspects of gender equality
        in their nationwide studies of climate change.
       The project provided technical assistance to the government’s seventh Five-Year Plan for 2015–
        2020, in which aspects of gender equality were included in the description of disaster prevention
        and climate change.
       The project helped BCAS increase its capacity to include aspects of gender equality in its
        research. BCAS is a pioneer in the field of climate change research and exerts major influence
        on Bangladeshi authorities and other actors. For example, new knowledge in this field was
        communicated at the climate summit in Lima in 2014, where a representative of BCAS
        participated.


Since 1994, Norway has supported the grassroots organization Bangladesh Mahila Parishad (BMP),
which was established in 1972—immediately after liberation—and is the oldest and largest women’s
organization in the country. BMP can be described as a social movement, encompassing a network of
resource persons from various professions across the country. Its activities are based on a strong element
of volunteerism. BMP has more than 100,000 volunteers (women age 16 years and older). With their
wide range of backgrounds (law, medicine, academic professions, education), these women help spread
information on women’s rights, and they are also regular activists. BMP is visible at the grassroots level
as a women’s and human rights organization that combats violence against women. BMP promotes
women’s rights through measures such as legal assistance, family arbitration, human rights work,
women’s shelters, and influence on political processes through lobbying. The project’s implementation
period is from 2010–2015 with a planned budget of NKr 35 million, of which NKr 7.5 million was
disbursed in 2014. The activities focus on raising awareness of human rights issues, offering legal

                                                                                                     139
assistance related to violence against women, promoting the political influence of women, and
combating Islamic fundamentalism.




  Box 6.1

  Dutch Support of DRC Elections

  In Kinshasa, human rights policy helped the Dutch embassy in the run up to elections in Democratic
  Republic of Congo (DRC). The funds support local organizations that protect human rights defenders
  associated with the opposition and are threatened or intimidated by security services.




II.     BOLIVIA: SIDA SUPPORT FOR EDUCATION

Swedish support of research in Bolivia has led to knowledge on composting, water purification, health,
and sustainable energy. Bolivia is rich in natural resources, such as minerals, natural gas, and forests.
Yet the country is one of the poorest on the continent. It lacks the technical knowledge needed for adding
value in its domestic industry. Instead, it exports raw materials and has long been dependent on the
technology of other countries. As a result of Swedish support, locally adapted knowledge and
innovations are being produced at a higher pace.



Swedish cooperation helps Bolivia carry out independent research in order to decrease poverty. The
support has allowed for investigations into the spread of heavy metals in water and foods, small-scale
methods of turning waste into biogas and fertilizer, gathering health data that had long been missing,
searching for treatments to tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas among others.



Universities act as drivers for economic development and decreased inequality. The Bolivian
government has made science a priority, increasing budget allocations to universities by several hundred
per cent. For technology to be useful, it needs to be adapted. For example, machinery may be too large
or expensive for local manufacturing methods. By adapting technology to local circumstances and
developing cheaper alternatives within the country, universities can help the country’s small-scale
producers grow and compete on the international market. This is often accomplished through innovation

                                                                                                     140
 clusters, which consist of collaborations between universities, the government, and the private sector.
 Thanks to Swedish support, Universidad Mayor de San Simon (UMSS) in Cochabamba established a
 unit for technology transfer that, among other things, puts local business owners in contact with
 policymakers and researchers. Sweden has worked to strengthen research capacity through education,
 funding research projects, and supporting university administration. During the period 2000–2012,
 Swedish support led to the graduation of 34 new PhDs at Universidad Mayor de San Andrés (UMSA).
 Swedish research support to Bolivia amounted to 216 million SEK for the period 2013–2017.




   Box 6.2
   New Zealand Support for Timor Leste
   New Zealand support to OHCHR for Timor Leste New Zealand has provided funding for the
   OHCHR itself, the Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice, which is the National
   Human Rights Institution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, as well as bulk funding for
   schools in Samoa that enable schools to remove attendance fees that act as barriers for children to
   enjoy their right to education. New Zealand funding has also supported and community-based
   rehabilitation and provided support to persons with disabilities associated with visual impairment and
   leprosy.




III.     UKRAINE: THE SDC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

 In addition to being one of the largest countries in Europe, Ukraine is among its poorest. Independent
 since 1991, this former Soviet republic has been in deep crisis since the outbreak of armed conflict in
 2014—with thousands dead, 1.5 million displaced, massive destruction to infrastructure in the
 industrialised east of the country, a critical humanitarian situation, and an economic depression with
 serious social repercussions.

 Switzerland grabbed this opportunity as a neutral protagonist. As formulated in the cooperation strategy,
 the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is working toward strengthening internal
 cohesion in Ukraine, including democratic governance and sustainable social and economic
 development. Switzerland’s commitment applies to the entire country, placing particular focus,
 whenever possible and appropriate, on areas affected by the conflict and taking special account of
 minorities and poor, vulnerable sections of the population. The efforts are concentrated in several areas.



                                                                                                      141
An administration that operates efficiently is one that offers its services to all citizens and allows them
a say in political matters. Committed to this objective, Switzerland has long been active in Ukraine in
relation to the issues of decentralization and local governance. Ukraine’s ongoing decentralization
results in pressing concerns such as the division of powers, the dismantling of centralized structures, and
improvements in efficiency, and the fight against corruption. Switzerland supports this reform at all
levels.



During its Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Chairmanship in 2014,
Switzerland launched various initiatives to resolve conflict in Ukraine. Switzerland maintains its support
of such initiatives, which include the Trilateral Contact Group and the OSCE Special Monitoring
Mission. Switzerland is also addressing antagonisms that led to the Ukraine conflict and is working
toward a gradual process of de-escalation in order to find a lasting solution.



After a long and successful involvement in the area of perinatal healthcare in Ukraine, Switzerland
shifted its focus to improving basic medical care. Switzerland is assisting Ukrainian authorities in
drawing up and implementing healthcare reforms.



The prevention of non-communicable diseases is another focal point. Promoting healthier lifestyles,
along with preventive measures, will help to curb diseases such as cancer and diabetes, as well as
cardiovascular diseases and respiratory disorders.



Since 2014, SDC Humanitarian Aid has been working on both sides of the contact line in government
and nongovernment-controlled areas of Ukraine. Initially, its focus had been on providing multilateral
organizations with financial and personnel support. In 2015, SDC Humanitarian Aid provided funding
for four humanitarian lines of action that will benefit people in need. Via partner organisation People in
Need, SDC Humanitarian Aid provides emergency assistance, for example, the repair of damaged
homes, to those in greatest need. In addition to products for purifying drinking water, Switzerland
delivers medicines and medical consumables to the nongovernment-controlled area and medical
instruments to the government-controlled area.




                                                                                                      142
Switzerland’s commitment relies on the work of the SDC, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
(SECO), the Federal Department of Foreign Aid’s Human Security Division (HSD), and SDC
Humanitarian Aid. Switzerland uses its foreign affairs apparatus and its role in international bodies as
leverage. The country’s OCSE Chairmanship in 2014 and its participation in the Troika alongside
Chairmanship holders Serbia (2015) and Germany (2016) are of particular note.



Switzerland works closely with local authorities, other donor countries, and international organizations
such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF). All programmes are based on the principles of good
governance and gender, social, and ethnic equality.

Swiss cooperation has been present in Ukraine for more than 15 years. Its projects produce concrete
results that can be applied in other parts of the country. Switzerland’s Cooperation Strategy 2015–2018
further strengthens its commitment. Support for the regions affected by the armed conflict is also
planned.



Switzerland coordinates its support with the work of the international community. It nevertheless
maintains impartiality between the two conflicting parties. Its activities aim to support the transformation
of the conflict in Ukraine and to build a democratic state attuned to the needs of its people. In this way
Switzerland seeks to promote reconciliation, peace and development.



Switzerland is strengthening its support in areas that have produced tangible results: decentralization,
healthcare, energy efficiency, and support for the private sector. Swiss initiatives support government
reforms and integrate the conflict dimension in all these areas of intervention.



Switzerland is supporting regions and individuals affected by the armed conflict as much as possible,
both on the side controlled by the Ukrainian government and the side controlled by armed groups. The
support focuses on the most vulnerable people, in particular those displaced by the conflict.




                                                                                                       143

      UNIDO-Hungary Social Inclusion
      In cooperation with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the
      government of Hungary funds a project that aims to foster social and economic inclusion of
      disadvantaged and marginalized population groups, including ethnic minorities, in Central, South,
      South East, and Eastern Europe. Social exclusion has risen up the policy agenda in many countries
      in response to growing inequalities, unemployment, poverty, exclusion, and environmental
      degradation, arising as negative externalities from the ongoing processes of globalization and
      interdependences, EU enlargement, and economic crisis. The project plans to establish a regional
      knowledge-sourcing platform drawing on the expertise and experiences of a diverse group of
      stakeholders working to address social exclusion, including representatives from government, the
      private sector, academia, civil society, social enterprises, and international organizations.




IV.         FIJI: NEW ZEALAND AID PROGRAMME

 The New Zealand Aid Programme (NZAP) in Fiji invests in developing agriculture, achieving a more
 highly skilled and educated workforce, building links among institutions, and supporting democracy.
 New Zealand boosted the development programme during the lead up to the successful democratic
 elections in late 2014.



 Aid to Fiji is made up of funding for activities specific to Fiji, as well as funding that includes

V.       BANGLADESH: GIZ JUDICIAL REFORM

 The German Agency for International Development (GIZ) has been supporting the reform of the justice
 sector in Bangladesh for years. Since 2008, a project commissioned by the German Federal Ministry for
 Economic Cooperation and Development and implemented by GIZ has supported the establishment of
 paralegal services in prisons. Because many prisoners in Bangladesh are detained unlawfully, paralegals
 are trained to establish the status of prisoners and to provide free legal assistance to prisoners and their
 families. Between 2008 and 2015, this training led to 153,000 legal interventions comprising legal advice
 and assistance in courts, police stations, and prisons.


 Around 9,500 prisoners were released from the project’s pilot sites as a result. Paralegal access to prisons
 has been rolled out to 34 out of 68 prisons across the country. Overcoming its initial hesitation to discuss
 human rights issues, the government of Bangladesh now prides itself on being a beacon for improving
 the human rights situation in prisons in South Asia.



VI.      VIETNAM: UNICEF

 The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) country programme in Vietnam demonstrates the results
 of long-term engagement built on high-level political dialogue in centralized socialist political systems
 using non-confrontational language. When UNICEF first introduced child rights principles in its analysis
 and planning, explicit rights language would have been too sensitive to employ in Vietnam. By
 broadening the range of its state and party counterparts, UNICEF was able to raise awareness of


                                                                                                          146
children’s rights. As a result, UNICEF made progress in legal reform, juveni le justice, and child
protection. Patience, persistence, and appropriate strategies for the use of language were instrumental in
this process.



To make children the subjects of rights in Vietnam’s legal system, UNICEF began working with a
variety of partners in 1996. Training on children’s rights with the Ho Chi Minh Political Academy led
to the foundation of a network on children’s rights that meets twice a year to explore how to promote
child rights in academic training. Conducted in partnership with the ministries of Justice and of Public
Security, the sessions have trained judges, lawyers, prosecutors, police, prison staff, and border guards.
Work on juvenile justice started in 1996, with a focus on disseminating international standards and
integrating them in the reform of the Criminal Court and the Criminal Procedure Code. UNICEF trains
a wide range of staff and is the only agency allowed to work in prisons. In 2002, the Polit Bureau called
upon the government to create a special court for families and juveniles, and UNICEF supported
discussion of the proposal and an intersectoral Plan of Action for Juvenile Justice. Constraints in making
more progress have included the scale of UNICEF support, which is based on a small scale rights
promotion project; the sensitive nature of reforms aimed at strengthening the status of citizens vis-à-vis
the state; and the priority given by the government to legal reform in relation to the economic sector
(e.g., for accession to the World Trade Organization).



Work in the area of child protection has been challenging. The Convention on the Rights of the Child
(CRC) recommends national systems of social work and counselling and non-institutional forms of
childcare. However, there are few trained professionals in Vietnam, including social workers. There
seems to be ideological resistance to the CRC approach, and there are few independent nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), which would typically provide a central role in such systems. In the 1990s,
UNICEF and others were able to advocate for alternative care. Following a conference in Stockholm in
2002, the government reviewed its policy of institutional care and replaced it with alternative models of
community-based care. This change called for a wide range of consultations with officials, though less
participation by non-state actors such as parents or children themselves. (The policy change was
prompted by rising numbers of children in need of care and an insufficient state budget to meet this
need.)




                                                                                                     147
Other areas of progress include a more integrated approach to policy development in child policy, with
UNICEF supporting the development of Vietnam’s first national family strategy (which does not
mention the need for establishing a national profession of social workers), and efforts to encourage more
participation within UNICEF programmes. In 2001, UNICEF supported the review of the National
Action Plan for Children and the preparation of a revised one. This was the first time that children from
all parts of the country discussed child policies and programmes with the political leadership. There has
been less progress in developing monitoring and accountability structures, in particular outside the state.



In documenting its experiences with a HRBA to programming, UNICEF commissioned a Vietnam case
study (Salazar-Volkmann 2004). The study produced some interesting findings.



HRBAs can be applied in challenging and complex environments. A careful analysis of the functioning
of political, economic, and social systems can help identify national windows of opportunity. UNICEF
requires government approval for all its activities. Although tight control characterized UNICEF’s work
until the doi moi reform process, staff were able to travel and interact with subnational counterparts and
engage in policy advice. As Vietnam opened to the international economy, it also worked on
nationalizing international concepts that created a favourable context for introducing child rights. The
report notes, “Human rights-based programming can become acceptable within a political environment
such as Vietnam only when it has evolved from a successful political dialogue at the very highest levels.”
UNICEF made inroads in the more traditional social and economic rights areas while using political
momentum to include civil, political, and cultural rights to a greater extent.



A progressive approach can yield results over time. Without using the sensitive language of rights,
situation analyses, and master plans of operations, UNICEF promoted the principles and underlying
ideas of a HRBA. Government partners became progressively more comfortable with the approach.
Trust was built thanks to UNICEF’s continuous presence since 1975, even during the Western -led
embargo. Senior UNICEF management staff were among the most important agents of change in a
process that encompassed a broadening of counterparts, including the Committee for the Protection of
Care of Children and the Women’s Union. The committee increased understanding of child rights across
the state and society so that eventually child rights language was found in official documents. Thus
“patience, persistence and appropriate strategies for the use of language were instrumental in the


                                                                                                      148
process.”



Child rights, based on the CRC, provided an entry point for a HRBA. Because the CRC was developed
with the support of socialist countries during the 1980s, the Vietnamese Communist Party found the
CRC politically acceptable. The government ratified the convention, starting a process of
implementation measures such as legal reforms and action plans to harmonize laws, policies, and
practices.



The rights of indigenous peoples, by contrast, are difficult to address. In Vietnam, and East Asia more
generally, the rights of indigenous peoples have been seen as a matter of national security and a taboo
subject. There has been even less progress on women’s rights. Although the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was ratified before the CRC, it took longer
to disseminate across government and society. Its integration in the national legal system was weaker
than that of the CRC, reflecting stronger cultural and political resistance.



Economic liberalization can constrain the realization of economic and social rights. Vietnam’s
process of privatization and economic reform is seen as having contributed to poverty reduction, but this
perception was associated with processes of marginalization as subsidies were cut back and service
delivery was reformed. Vietnam continues to struggle with issues of inequity and disparity, particularly
regarding children of ethnic minorities and in rural areas. UNICEF has encouraged use of a HRBA to
recognize the distinct cultures of ethnic minorities and to prevent ethnic minorities from being subject
to discrimination or marginalization (UNICEF 2009).



In 2006, Vietnam became the first pilot country for the One UN programme, in which multiple UN
agencies function as a single team within a country to maximize efficiencies and promote interagency
coordination. In the Final Common Country Programme Document for Vietnam, 2012–2016, UNICEF,
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the United Nations Population Fund
collectively highlight the need to strengthen the rule of law in Vietnam. These organizations identify
how greater institutional accountability, equal enforcement of the law, improved access to justice, and
increased government engagement in implementing human rights treaties can facilitate the strengthening
of the rule of law. Over the next few years, the UN will be implementing a HRBA to development in

                                                                                                    149

 including a HRBA (UNICEF 2011c).

   In Burundi, a multisector approach to promoting the right to education for children living and
   working on the street was adopted, enabling more than 2,000 such children to attend primary schools
   as of 2007. The programme, led by UNICEF and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
   Cultural Organization (UNESCO) involved a collaborative effort among government ministries, UN
   agencies, NGOs, and private companies to provide long-term pedagogical support and assistance for
   families (UNICEF and UNESCO, 2007).




VII.     KENYA: SWEDISH PROGRAMMES

 Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)’s work in Kenya illustrates how to
 integrate a democratic focus with a HRBA at different country programming levels.



 In order to promote dialogue, the Swedish embassy launched a project to put “equality for growth” on
 the public agenda by working with civil society organizations, research bodies, media, other donors, and
 decision makers in the executive and parliament. A Memorandum of Understanding was established
 between the Ministry for Planning and National Development, the Society for International
 Development (an implementing NGO), and Sida, with agreement to focus on gender, regional, and
 income inequalities. Project activities included collecting data on inequality in Kenya and helping the
 ministry disseminate its poverty map to line ministries. Inequality became a national issue, and the
 project grew to include other partners such as UNDP and ActionAid.



 Since 2003, the Mainstreaming in Action Project (MAINIAC) has worked to better integrate human
 rights and democracy principles (non-discrimination, participation, accountability and transparency)
 into sector programmes funded by Sida. It aims to develop the capacity of the government of Kenya and
 other key actors to identify and use mainstreaming indicators, undertake implementation in a manner

                                                                                                    150
that promotes mainstreaming, participate in dialogue, and develop an adequate monitoring and
evaluation system. Target sectors are roads; water; health; integrated land and urban sector; governance,
justice, law, and order; and agriculture.



An extensive evaluation of how a HRBA was integrated into Swedish-Kenyan development cooperation
was conducted by the Swedish Agency for Development Evaluation (SADEV) in 2008 (SADEV 2008).
The evaluation found that there

        has been a strong and committed leadership emphasising the embassy’s priority of working with
        the principles of the rights perspective which has created conditions and practices conducive to
        capacity development on the rights perspective and its principles, through initiatives such as
        training, structures for follow-up and internal feedback.

It concluded that embassy knowledge and awareness of a HRBA in programming had increased and that
the project developed the capacity of Sida programme staff to work out indicators and participate in
dialogue with the government on mainstreaming issues in the assessment and implementation of
programmes. Some ambiguity about the relationship between a HRBA and cross-cutting issues
promoted under MAINIAC remained, however, generating confusion among staff. Additional and
follow-up training was recommended.



The programme succeeded in developing a network of local resource persons working on HRBA that
meets quarterly at the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. This network supports the design
and implementation process by commenting on programme documents, participating in seminars, and
developing the capacity of staff in ministries. These resource persons are drawn from local organizations,
such as the International Federation of Women’s Lawyers, the Institute for Law and Environmental
Governance, and the Child Rights Advisory Documentation and Legal Centre, as well as UN agencies
such as the United Nations Development Fund for Women and UNICEF. The evaluation found that the
network would benefit from ongoing and long-term maintenance of these relationships.



In the agricultural sector, the SADEV evaluation found that “the integration of HRBA has been
intensified in all programming phases.” Decision-making has become more participatory and
accountable following policy changes, the development of mechanisms to engage groups at the local
level, and increased information sharing among stakeholders. A roads project was generally a success


                                                                                                     151
  thanks to a high degree of local participation (with attention paid to how women and children could
  benefit), local accountability structures, and public information about the initiative at local markets. The
  decentralization of responsibilities to district committees and engineers improved accountability and
  participation, but there was a corresponding lack of documentation about how the HRBA was
  decentralized. In the water sector, participation of marginalized groups and transparency increased
  through the establishment of planning tools and the use of complaint mechanisms.



  There has been government ownership of the process: the president of Kenya announced that he
  wanted Kenya to be “a rights-based state” and a new constitution was promulgated in 2010. The
  Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) has played “an instrumental role in
  providing training on HRBA.” Overall, government prioritization of human rights has created an
  enabling environment for dialogue and for integrating a HRBA into sectors and programmes (SADEV
  2008).



VIII.      SERBIA: EIB RIGHT TO HOUSING

  The European Investment Bank (EIB) honours the right to adequate housing as a component of the right
  to an adequate standard of living and the right to non-discrimination in this context. A good example in
  this regard is the Sava Bridge Access Roads project in Belgrade, Serbia. The project impacted an
  informal settlement of mainly Roma families. The EIB’s condition for the start of work was the
  implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), providing permanent housing to families
  displaced by the roads project. Despite a difficult process of negotiations over the RAP with the city
  between 2011 and 2014 but following continuous engagement with the affected families and CSOs, four
  apartment blocks in two locations were built to accommodate 48 affected families. Resettlement was
  completed in 2015 with the following outcomes: overall, improved living conditions for the families—
  families now reside in modern apartments with standard amenities and access to utility services; the
  families pay rent and utility bills of about €10 per month (subsidized for low-income families); new
  personal documents were provided for all resettled persons as a precondition for accessing social
  services; and all children of school age in the affected households attend school regularly.



  The EIB declares zero tolerance for forced evictions, thereby asking its clients to avoid and/or prevent
  forced evictions and provide effective remedy to minimize negative impacts should prevention fail. The


                                                                                                         152
EIB affirms and promotes the importance of security of tenure, providing occupants with legal protection
against forced evictions, harassment, and other threats. In one instance, forced evictions undertaken
unbeknownst to the EIB in a transaction prior to the signing of a financing contract resulted in the bank
putting contract negotiations on hold and requiring, inter alia, an incident audit report and a corrective
action plan. The EIB further required that the RAP involve very close consultation with affected people
and civil society and that the transaction secure an entitlement matrix that exceeded the compensation
standards set by local legislation.




                                                                                                     153

            Case Studies: Sector-Specific Projects and Programmes


In addition to country-based partnerships and programs, donors have supported a wide range of sector
and thematic programs across developing countries to advance key human rights principles and
implement priorities. These programs cover gender equality, the right to health, the right to education,
the rights of persons with disabilities, CSO engagement, labor and the right to work, torture and the
death penalty, the right to food and the rights of indigenous peoples.



I.      GENDER EQUALITY




Finland actively promotes women’s and girls’ rights and gender equality in all its foreign and security
policy activities, placing special emphasis on women’s political and economic participation, the
elimination of discrimination against women, and sexual and reproductive health and rights.



Finland also actively contributes to the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, whose
goals are to protect women and girls in armed conflicts, to promote women’s equal participation in peace
negotiations and reconstruction, and to prevent gender-based violence. The empowerment and equal
status of women are not possible without political and economic inclusion and empowerment, which is
why Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs underlines women’s participation and leadership in political
and economic decision-making. These goals are pursued through development cooperation by
supporting women’s and girls’ education, for instance. Furthermore, Finland works locally with
organizations that promote women’s and girls’ rights and cooperates with women’s human rights
defenders. Finland strives to eliminate all violence against women and girls.



In the UK, the Gender Equality Act, which amended the International Development Act of 2002, makes
considering gender equality in any funding decisions a legal requirement. The act does not require a
prioritization of gender interventions, but places a duty on the UK Department for International
Development (DFID) to consider ways in which development and humanitarian funding will build
gender equality in the countries receiving aid.

                                                                                                   154
In relation to gender, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed
tools such as the Gender and Land Rights Database, the Legal Assessment Tool for gender-equitable
land tenure, the Tool for Gender-Sensitive Agricultural Policies, and the gender-sensitive Rural
Advisory Services Tool that have been put to use in many countries. FAO joined forces with the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, the World Food Programme, and UN Women in the
Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress toward the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women with
support from the governments of Norway and Sweden (2012–2017); the programme aims at generating
lasting improvements in rural women’s well-being and is being implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala,
Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger, and Rwanda. FAO further provides policy and legal support for the
implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
(CEDAW) and the gender aspects of the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure
of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, the Principles for Responsible
Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, and other instruments. It contributed to the elaboration of
the General Comment on Rural Women, adopted in March 2016 by CEDAW. In the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) process, FAO is the custodian of indicator 5.a.2, “Proportion of countries
where the legal framework (including customary law) guarantees women’s equal rights to land
ownership and/or control.” For example, in support of the rights of girls and women, DFID provides £36
million to accelerate action to end child marriage in 12 countries.



Women in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are poorly represented in political parties,
parliament, and government. Women also have weak representation in public administration, especially
at the management level. Although the constitution provides for gender equality, the implementing legal
framework lags far behind. Sexual violence against women is a serious and pervasive problem
throughout the country. In the eastern provinces, it is linked to the conflict, with the army, police, and
armed groups as the main offenders. In the past two years Norway has spent NKr 110 million on
combatting sexual violence in DRC. This investment is a response to the UN Security Council resolution
on sexual violence in conflict zones. Both Norwegian and international organizations have received
funding from the UN for this purpose. Norway has supported the UN humanitarian country-based pooled
funds, which have put in place a national strategy to combat sexual violence. The establishment of
Kyeshero Hospital is a significant result of the Norwegian investment. The Heal Africa Hospital has
also acquired a new ward thanks to support from Norway. Both offer health services and support to rape
victims.

(SOFEPADI), a Congolese women’s organization. The cooperation operates through the Norwegian
Embassy in Luanda, the capital city. The support to SOFEPADI encompasses a broad programme of
interventions against sexual violence in the eastern Ituri province. The project supports the work of
Karibuni Wamam, a medical centre in Bunia. The centre promotes the health of women and families
and supports victims of sexual violence. The centre has played a unique role in the region by offering a
full range of services, including medical support, psychosocial follow-up, and legal assistance. The
centre has worked actively to promote women’s rights and women’s health, as well as to increase
awareness with regard to sexual violence.



The Norwegian Embassy in Luanda supports women’s political participation through the women’s
organization Fonds pour les Femmes Congolaises (FFC). FFC mobilizes women to participate in
national, regional, and local elections. In 2014, the organization worked with 25 local women’s
organizations throughout the country to increase competence with regard to women and gender equality
issues, governance, and political participation. FFC has also worked to enhance women’s knowledge
about electoral processes and to strengthen the communication and leadership qualities of women
candidates. It helped establish a women’s network for the exchange of knowledge and experience across
the country. FCC and SOFEPADI together received NKr 2.5 million in 2014.



Am important contributor in the struggle against sexual violence is the American Bar Association
(ABA). The ABA has supported the establishment of a legal database of abuse cases and carries out
awareness-raising work to prevent abuse. As a result, survivors of sexual violence in a variety of
countries have gained access to the legal system in the areas in which they live through the use of mobile
gender courts. Judges, legal personnel, and law students have received training in cases involving sexual
violence.



Canada has supported improving women’s rights in Southeast Asia. In partnership with UN Women,
Canada is financing a $10 million, multi-country initiative that aims to help achieve greater equality
between women and men before the law in seven countries in Southeast Asia. The programme focuses



                                                                                                     156
on strengthening the capacity of government and civil society to develop and implement legislation that
is respectful of CEDAW, as well as improving equitable access to justice systems for women.



A World Bank Nordic Trust Fund (NTF) grant under implementation aims to generate more evidence
about effective approaches to respond to and prevent sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV),
especially in fragile and conflict-affected states. Activities include impact evaluations of selected project
activities in the three countries covered by the Bank-funded Great Lakes Emergency SGBV and
Women’s Health Project in Burundi, Rwanda, and DRC. The lessons learned from the evaluations will
contribute to ensuring that services provided through the Great Lakes Emergency SGBV Project are
adequately targeted and delivered and inform future World Bank Group programming of interventions
addressing SGBV and women’s rights. In the DRC, work focuses on the impact evaluation of the
project’s mental health interventions. In Rwanda, tentative plans are to collaborate with academic
partners to evaluate the impact of working with men and boys at the community level to promote
behavioural change, possibly including adding data collection to the study at a later date to measure the
longer-term impact of these activities.




II.     HEALTH



In 2008, Clare Ferguson undertook research for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Human Rights Task Team on the
links between human rights, aid effectiveness, and experiences in the health sector (OECD DAC Human
Rights Task Team 2008a). The study concluded that applying human rights principles to the health sector
supports the aid effectiveness principles contained in the Paris Declaration. For example, democratic
ownership of the health sector was fostered by encouraging women and excluded groups to participate
in discussions about healthcare policy and service provision. The resulting report explains how the
human rights framework promotes the importance of accountability between a government and its
citizens as well as between a donor and country partners through the use of administrative, judicial, and
quasi-judicial processes at many levels. Through the use of human rights indicators and benchmarks, as
well as disaggregated data, stakeholders can manage results and better track how health policies impact
different groups. Moreover, the human rights framework supports alignment and harmonization efforts


                                                                                                        157
by providing shared standards and norms upon which projects can be organized.



New partnerships are emerging. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)
has collaborated with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other partners
on human rights–based (HRB) advocacy on HIV and is pursuing partnerships with the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP)’s Global Commission on HIV and the Law as well as with the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (the Global Fund) to maximize the impact of efforts.
Likewise, OHCHR has supported activities to strengthen the capacity of 35 national human rights
institutions to integrate discrimination against people living with HIV in their work (OHCHR 2011).



Human rights budgeting is a useful tool for analysing health budgets. In 2005, the Central American
Institute of Fiscal Studies (ICEFI) analysed the budgets of every Central American country to determine
if the countries protect citizens’ economic, social, cultural, political, and legal rights, particularly in light
of a country’s national and international commitments (such as the Millennium Development Goals, or
MDGs). In Mexico, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Fundar used a human rights framework
to identify inequalities in the government’s health budget, including lower per capita amounts of health
spending in the poorer states of south and southeast Mexico. The results of this analysis enabled Fundar
to successfully advocate for the inclusion of basic obstetric care in the government’s poverty -focused
popular insurance (OECD 2008b).



Human rights principles have relevance for health interventions targeting HIV/AIDS. A significant
number of health or HIV/AIDS policies make reference to human rights (e.g., discrimination against
persons living with HIV/AIDS), although they do not always provide operational guidance to address
those issues (e.g., how to reconcile public health and human rights objectives in practice). Some agencies
are developing innovative programmes and tools that illustrate how a human rights –based approach
(HRBA) to health can be implemented. For example, successful approaches to reproductive health and
maternal mortality require that interventions examine the barriers faced by women to accessing services,
in particular those related to gender discrimination, as well as sensitivity to cultural and religious factors.
Germany has developed comprehensive guidance on how to implement human rights in the different
areas of health programming and how to make health sector interventions inclusive for persons with
disabilities. Likewise, the human rights focus of German support for health led to more attention to


                                                                                                            158
lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and/or intersex (LGBTI) persons’ access to health services. UNAIDS
developed a “people with stigma and discrimination index” to measure the situation of rights for people
living with HIV (UNDG-HRM 2011).



Norway has supported the Global Fund a since its inception, and in 2014–2016, Norway provided
funding of NKr 1.7 billion. Total funding amounts to US$295 million (71 per cent for AIDS, 12 per cent
for tuberculosis, and 17 per cent for malaria). Norway also supports the work of the Cuban Medical
Brigade in Haiti. Cuba has provided medical assistance to Haiti since 1998, and Cuban doctors have
provided effective help to Haiti, particularly in combating cholera.



Ireland has been a key donor in fighting the AIDS epidemic. Ireland has also supported the fight against
HIV and AIDS and other global communicable diseases at international, regional, and country levels. Its
political commitment is matched by a financial commitment. Annual spending on health, HIV and AIDS,
and communicable diseases is around 22 per cent of the bilateral aid budget (Analysis of Bilateral
Overseas Development Assistance by Sector – Annex 7 of the 2013 Annual Report). Eight million
people are receiving treatment for AIDS in developing countries, an increase of almost three million in
just two years. A significant development in recent years has been that developing countries are
investing more in addressing HIV and AIDS in their own countries than international donors have been.
Nevertheless, tackling the pandemic requires better coordinated local and global efforts to reduce the
impact and preventing the spread of the virus. The international community, with UNAIDS taking the
lead, has responded positively. A number of global health partnerships have brought together the major
development players in concerted efforts to tackle the world’s priority health problems including HIV
and AIDS. Irish Aid promotes a broad development response to HIV and AIDS, which focuses on
reducing poverty, providing basic services and addressing the poor status of women. It also focuses
support on strengthening national responses to HIV and AIDS on a country-by-country level. Across all
of the programmes, Irish Aid takes account of the pandemic and ensure that actions Ireland takes in other
areas do not further its spread. It focuses on strengthening national responses to HIV and AIDS at the
country level.



III.    EDUCATION




                                                                                                    159
Donor policies often refer to the right to education, and there is an increasing range of experiences in
adopting a HRBA to education. In addition to putting into practice human rights principles such as
participation, non-discrimination, and accountability, a HRBA can encompass not only the right to
education (access), but also rights in and through education (quality and relevance; SDC 2006b). Such
a HRBA directs attention to the overall educational framework (curricula, governance structure,
distribution of resources in the education system), as well as to the social outcomes of education.
Specifically, a HRBA to education that emphasizes quality can promote social cohesion because it
includes a focus on respect for families and the value of local communities and cultural diversity. It also
builds respect for peace, supports the empowerment of children and stakeholders to claim their rights,
and develops the capacities of governments to fulfil their obligations (UNICEF and UNESCO 2007).



To better ensure children’s right to education, increased attention has been placed on the creation of
“child-friendly” schools that are accessible, welcoming, high quality, gender sensitive, and safe.
Approaches that promote child-friendly schools require consideration of such factors as the location of
a school, travel to and from school, and ensuring that appropriate facilities for girls exist. The United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)-supported Building Child Friendly Schools and Communities
Initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina 2008–2009 generated widespread professional assistance and
promoted social unity and cultural diversity among 20,000 children. As another example, a child-to-
child census was taken in Kenya as part of a child-friendly school approach to identify children who
were not in school, to determine why they failed to attend, and to discuss and develop solutions at the
community level. In one of three pilot districts, approximately 7,000 of the 9,000 out-of-school children
were brought back, half of them girls. A third example is in Mozambique, where a UNICEF-supported
Child Friendly Schools programme worked to improve the quality of education by providing
professional support and teacher resources to classroom educators (UNICEF and UNESCO 2007).



In Vietnam, UNICEF worked with the Ministry of Education on a programme to improve access to
quality education for poor, ethnic communities that did not speak Vietnamese. Children attended
preschool and primary schools where they could learn in their local language while teachers were trained
on bilingual education techniques (UNICEF 2011a).



In Burundi, a multisector approach to promoting the right to education for children living and working


                                                                                                      160
on the street was adopted, enabling more than 2,000 such children to attend primary schools as of 2007.
The programme involved a collaborative effort between government ministries, UN agencies, NGOs,
and private companies to provide long-term pedagogical support and assistance for families (UNICEF
and UNESCO 2007).



A World Bank NTF grant to empower children (ages 6–11) and families from ethnic minority
communities (mainly Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian) in Kosovo to make strategic decisions and realize
the children’s rights in the context of education. The project will promote the rights of the child (as per
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC) by providing them with tools to “speak” about
their perception and experience of education using verbal and nonverbal means. The objectives are
twofold: to institutionalize a methodology for listening to the voice of the child in education and ensuring
children’s meaningful participation in the quality of education services provided in Kosovo; and to
capture learning from the project and disseminate it in an innovative and meaningful way. The project
is founded on the approach of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). In line with the
CRC the Project is in the best interests of the child and will support the Kosovan State to ensure
appropriate access to rights and education provisions to all children, including those from the of Roma,
Ashkali and Egyptian communities.




                                                                                                       161
IV.     DISABILITIES




Disabilities are relevant to development because of their “bidirectional link to poverty”: they can
increase the likelihood of poverty just as poverty can increase the likelihood of disability (World Bank
and WHO 2011). More than 1 billion people in the world live with a disability (World Bank and WHO
2011), 80 per cent of whom live in developing countries. The United Nations Educational, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates that 98 per cent of persons with disabilities in
developing countries do not attend school and that access to healthcare services and public health
information for those with disabilities is scarce (UNESCO 2008a). The Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), adopted in December 2006, emphasizes non-discrimination (e.g.,
Articles 3, 4(1), and 5) as well as equal access (e.g., Articles 3 and 9) to opportunities for fulfilling one’s
potential, including through development programmes (UN 2006). Persons with disabilities represent a
key target group under MDG 1 (eradicating hunger and poverty), and are a critical target group for the
realization of other development goals as well (UNESCO 2008a;). Several donors have developed
disability inclusion policies or frameworks based on the CRPD such as DFID, Ireland’s Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,
the International Labour Organization (ILO), UNICEF, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency.
Other notable organizations with disability policies include the International Committee of the Red
Cross. A recent example of heightened donor and government attention in this area is the Charter on
Inclusion        of       Persons        with        Disabilities       in       Humanitarian          Action
(http://humanitariandisabilitycharter.org/).


At the global level, the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) is a coordination mechanism
for international cooperation: it is a network of bilateral and multilateral donors and organizations,
foundations, philanthropic organizations, and private sector entities actively contributing resources
internationally to disability-inclusive development and humanitarian action. GLAD was launched in
London in December 2015 by a group of like-minded partners who recognize that to realize the promise
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to leave no one behind, and to further the principles
reflected in the CRPD, the international community needs to work together to share expertise, coordinate
actions, and raise the profile of disability across a broad range of organizations contributing to
international development efforts. Consistent with Article 32 of the CRPD, GLAD promotes
international cooperation on disability-inclusive development. As a collaborative network, GLAD

                                                                                                          162
supports its members to coordinate their contribution of resources internationally to disability-inclusive
development and humanitarian action. It also facilitates the expansion and diversification of the
community of partners making such contributions, and through collaborative advocacy amplifies their
voice for maximum global influence. GLAD provides a mechanism for sharing knowledge and resources
on disability-inclusive development and humanitarian action.

 Box 7.1

 World Bank New Environmental and Social Framework

 The World Bank Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) makes reference to disability, as does
 the accompanying directive, and the World Bank is developing a Disability Inclusion and
 Accountability Framework to promote and guide the mainstreaming of disability across the Bank’s
 operations and analytical work, applying principles derived from the CRPD. The framework is aimed
 at ensuring that persons with disabilities can participate in and benefit from the Bank’s activities.




The EU has made some strides in regard to disabilities. The 10-year EU Disability Strategy (2010–2020)
identifies areas of action to empower people with disabilities, including accessibility, participation,
equality, employment, education and training, social protection, health, and external action (European
Commission 2010d). At an operational level, a 2004 Guidance Note on Disability and Development
(European Commission 2004) provides a set of principles to guide EU delegations on how to address
disability issues in development cooperation activities, but implementation can vary by location and
programme. The EU has supported partner countries’ shifting from welfare to rights -based policies in
places like Morocco, where the first disability survey was conducted, and Chile, where a disability
census was performed to inform legislation and policy analysis. As budget support is increasingly used
as the modality of EU development cooperation, incorporating or mainstreaming the rights of persons
with disabilities becomes an integral part of policy dialogue with partner countries (Coleridge et. al.
2010).



The Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) supports a framework programme, Light for the World,
that provides support for inclusive development at the community level in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, and
Mozambique. Instead of simply providing medical treatment and welfare aid, the programme aims to
ensure that persons with disabilities are integrated as actors at all levels of social activity. In community-
based rehabilitation programmes, helpers come into the house, plan individual assistance programmes,
and show relatives how to help disabled family members learn critical skills. The primary aim is to
enable people with special needs to take equal and self-determined part in development (ADC, 2011).

Disability Rights and the SGDs

An example of heightened donor and government attention in the area of disability rights is the Charter
on      Inclusion    of     Persons      with     Disabilities     in     Humanitarian         Action     (
http://humanitariandisabilitycharter.org/). Work on inclusive urban development around Habitat III
seeks        to       further       articulate       the         CRPD         and        the        SDGs
(https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/resources/disability-accessibility-and-sustainable-
urban-development.html). Several proposed initiatives on disability inclusion at the World Bank are
linked to the CRPD and the SDGs, for example, the Quality Infrastructure Investments Partnership,
which refers to SDGs 9 and 11, and is reflective of the need to make infrastructure accessible to persons
with disabilities.



Implementation of the rights of persons with disabilities is a cross-cutting objective in Finnish human
rights and development policies. Finland strives to enhance the involvement of disabled persons in
political decision-making both in Finland and internationally. The CRPD obliges governments to build
an accessible society without barriers where everyone can benefit from services in the fields of education
and healthcare, for instance. To ensure effective implementation of the CRPD, Finland supports the
work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Moreover, Finland funds
projects that promote the rights of disabled persons across the world, being one the main funders of the
UN Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

Human rights considerations influence Australian development policy and strategy. In May 2015,
Development for All 2015–2020: Strategy for Strengthening Disability-Inclusive Development in
Australia’s Aid Programme was launched. It builds on the successes of the previous 2009 –2014
development strategy. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT)’s approach was
guided by the CRPD. In July 2015, DFAT developed a Displacement and Resettlement of People in
Development Activities policy, which considers the possible negative impacts of displacement and
resettlement on people adversely affected by aid programme activities. In particular, the focus is
vulnerable groups, which may include women; children; the elderly; people with disabilities; minority
ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups; and indigenous peoples. Attention to resettlement is important
to help affected people, especially vulnerable groups, improve or at least restore their livelihoods and,
in the case of vulnerable people, improve their living standards after displacement.




                                                                                                        165
Australia partnered with UNICEF to support the second phase of the Rights, Education and Protection
project (REAP 2). This partnership builds on the success of the first phase of the REAP project, which
piloted education and child protection activities in Vietnam and Bhutan; REAP 2 includes additional
focus countries in the Indo-Pacific. Australia also has partnered with the United Nations Washington
Group on Disability Statistics to complete a survey that countries can insert into their existing national
data collection processes (such as a census) to provide internationally comparable data on children with
disabilities. Funding will support the development of a second survey to understand the barriers and
facilitators to children with disabilities in accessing quality education. The survey is intended to be used
with both children with disabilities who are in school and those who are out of school. Once completed,
the survey questions will be used to improve data collection on children with disabilities in UNICEF’s
Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, one of the largest global sources of internationally comparable,
statistically rigorous data on the situation of children and women. Australia supports the Washington
Group in disseminating tools to collect disability data, provide technical assistance to support their
uptake and consistent use, and engage in new work on measures of participation and functional
limitations related to mental health.



The 2014 New Zealand Aid Programme introduced a policy that requires staff to consider access for
people with disabilities to all built structures. Activity design documents must explain how accessibility
for disabled people has been considered and addressed through the design of public buildings and
structures. If design proposals do not show evidence of consideration of access for people with
disabilities, appraisers are required to seek an explanation prior to decision-making. Accessibility is not
mandatory, but it is expected unless a clear and acceptable justification is provided.



V.      SUPPORT TO CIVIL SOCIETY




The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has become more explicit about the
human rights focus of its work, making the case for both the intrinsic and the instrumental value of this
work to its overall mission. The practice is increasingly evolving to emphasize mainstreaming human
rights throughout the Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) sector, in particular. For
example, DRG activities managed by operational units that do not have an explicit human rights mandate
are increasingly comfortable describing their work as promoting or protecting human rights. Some
examples include USAID’s support for civil society actors in authoritarian spaces (e.g., related to the

                                                                                                       166
President’s Stand with Civil Society Agenda), activities related to election assistance (e.g., programmes
that protect citizens’ rights to participate in free elections and be elected), and even traditional
governance activities that emphasize the right to remedy or freedom from discrimination.



In the past few years, USAID has:

         Promoted government accountability and transparency by assisting more than 130 civil society
          organizations that engage in advocacy and watchdog functions, and supporting more than 60
          civil society advocacy campaigns in nine countries.
         Supported free and fair elections in Tunisia and Egypt.
         Expanded political participation by training more than 9,800 domestic election observers and
          officials, and providing voter and civic education reaching more than 6.5 million people.
         Enabled the first-ever meeting of Tunisian civil society leaders and legislators to work toward a
          new NGO law for activists. USAID programmes are helping Tunisian civil society actors share
          their experience with new voices in Libya, working toward the same goal.


Norwegian voluntary organizations supported the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the tune of
NKr 53 million in 2015, a reduction from NKr 88 million in 2014. The main actors, which were funded
by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, were Rainforest Foundation Norway, JOIN
good forces, Caritas, CARE Norway, DIGNI, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and IIASA. Norwegian
Church Aid, the Pentecostal Foreign Mission of Norway, the Red Cross, and Doctors without Borders
also received support. The main emphasis of the support was interventions aimed at reinforcing women’s
rights and combatting sexual violence, mother and child health, and education. In addition, there was a
significant commitment targeting climate change and forest.



VI.       LABOUR AND THE RIGHT TO WORK




In relation to the right to work, FAO provides support to the formulation and implementation of policies,
strategies, and programmes that generate decent rural employment, especially for rural youth and
women, and that extend the application of International Labour Standards (ILS), such as child labour
prevention and occupational safety and health, to rural areas. FAO has provided support for increased
awareness and strengthened institutional capacities to prevent child labour in agriculture in Cambodia,

                                                                                                      167
Niger, Malawi, and Tanzania, and it has supported the development of youth employment policies in
countries such as Nigeria and Senegal. FAO developed youth-friendly methodologies for technical and
vocational education and training (e.g., Junior Farmer Field and Life Schools) that have been
implemented in a number of countries with HRBA. FAO promotes access to social protection in rural
areas by producing solid evidence to inform policymaking and by providing policy and technical support
with HRBA.



FAO has increased the visibility of decent work in global dialogue on effective fisheries management
and responsible aquaculture. In addition to promoting the implementation of ILS in seafood value chain
in various international fora, in collaboration with the ILO, the organization has supported policy and
legislative processes on the protection of human and labour rights in fisheries in countries such as
Indonesia. It undertook legal assessment on labour law in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries and
aquaculture in Guatemala, Senegal, and Uganda with a view to providing future legal support. Work on
the implementation of the VGSSF with a HRBA has been initiated in Costa Rica, Cambodia, Cote
d’Ivoire, and South Africa.



VII.    TORTURE, INHUMANE TREATMENT OR PUNISHMENT, AND THE DEATH
        PENALTY




A number of donors link their development priorities and programs to issues more closely associated
with civil and political rights, such as the abolition of the death penalty or human rights defenders.
Australia supports the universal abolition of the death penalty, which is considered to be an inhumane
form of punishment. The government urges all countries that maintain capital punishment as part of their
laws to cease executions and establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, including through
bilateral representations, the Universal Periodic Review process, and the UN General Assembly
(UNGA).



In 2010, the Australian Crimes Legislation Amendment (Torture Prohibition and Death Penalty
Abolition) Act was introduced to safeguard ongoing compliance with the Second Protocol to the




                                                                                                   168
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by ensuring that the death penalty cannot be
reintroduced in any Australian state or territory.



In 2014, the governments of Chile, Denmark, Ghana, Indonesia, and Morocco launched the 10-year
cross-regional initiative, the Convention against Torture Initiative (CTI), with the aim to achieve
universal ratification and better implementation of the CTI. The CTI is an initiative by and for
governments that mobilizes positive, mutual support to overcome the obstacles for ratification and
implementation that countries face. The CTI has a “constructive, twinning and inspirational” approach
to achieving its objectives. It enhances the exchange of experiences and knowledge in order to learn
from others with similar challenges—typically in regional settings. The Group of Friends of the CTI
includes governments, experts, and NGOs (www.cti2024.org).



USAID has provided medical treatment, psychological and social support, legal assistance, and
economic strengthening support to 43,000 survivors of torture and victims of gender-based violence in
the DRC. USAID’s efforts have resulted in more 1,450 separated or abandoned children—many of
whom are survivors of sexual abuse—being reunited with their families.



VIII.   THE RIGHT TO FOOD AND NUTRITION




With the support of the governments of Germany (until 2013), Norway, and Spain (until 2016), FAO
has been working on the right to adequate food by supporting the development of global governance
capacity; enhancing dialogue and participation in multi-stakeholder platforms; fostering knowledge,
capacity, awareness, and commitment toward the implementation of the Right to Food Guidelines; and
strengthening the accountability and commitment of national governments for the promotion of better
legal and policy tools for the realization of the right to food. These activities have led to the development
of food security and nutrition (FSN) policies, strategies and plans of action, school feeding laws, food
security legislation, and relevant institutional structures that clearly articulate the right to adequate food
in countries such as Bolivia, Cabo Verde, El Salvador, and Nepal. Similar processes are underway in
countries such as Kirgizstan and Togo. FAO furthered the participation of parliamentarians in Latin
America and Caribbean region and the Community of Portuguese Language (CPLP) countries in


                                                                                                         169
dialogues on FSN with right to food perspectives. National parliamentary fronts have been instrumental
in the adoption of national FSN policies and laws.



Since the publication of the Irish government-commissioned Hunger Task Force Report in 2008, the
fight against hunger has been a cornerstone of Ireland’s international development policy and aid
programme. This centrality was reinforced in the goals set out in the One World, One Future policy
issued in May 2013. Within Irish Aid, 20 per cent of the budget is dedicated to actions in the fight against
hunger. In addition to Ireland’s financial support, Irish Aid is using its experience to influence others to
take their commitment to tackling hunger seriously. Through the membership of a number of
international committees such as the Committee on World Food Security, and through bilateral policy
engagement with its partner agencies in the UN development system and elsewhere, Ireland advocates
for more, and better, aid to improve global food and nutrition security. Ireland works at the European
Union level to ensure that combating food and nutrition insecurity is prioritized in EU external aid and
in EU positions at international meetings. In 2013, under Ireland’s EU Presidency a new EU Nutrition
Policy to enhance maternal and infant nutrition in EU external assistance was endorsed by the Council
of the EU. Moreover, through the adoption of a new EU Food and Nutrition Security Implementation
Plan, Ireland sought to strengthen action by the EU and its member states in tackling global hunger, food
insecurity, and undernutrition.



The Government of Ireland and the Mary Robinson Foundation—Climate Justice hosted a major
international conference, Hunger-Nutrition-Climate Justice, in 2013. Ireland was a founding supporter
of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement in 2010. SUN brings together stakeholders—donor and
developing partner countries, UN and other international organizations and agencies, international
financial institutions, civil society and business organizations—to tackle hunger and undernutrition. It
focuses on maternal, infant and child undernutrition and on increasing political will and investment to
address undernutrition in early childhood.



In 2012, Ireland c-hosted a side-event at the UN Commission on the Status of Women, Gender and
Nutrition: Supporting Rural Women to Improve Nutrition. In its partner countries in Africa, Ireland
works to improve coordination of action to improve nutrition. In Ethiopia, for example, Ireland is a
member of the Nutrition Donor group. In Malawi, Ireland is a Donor Convener for the SUN Movement.


                                                                                                       170
Ireland is a member of the Agriculture Sector Working Group and participates in four Technical
Working Groups (Food Security and Risk Management; Agricultural Land and Water Management;
Commercial marketing and agro-processing; Monitoring and Evaluation). Ireland is also a member of
the National Conservation Agriculture Task Force and the National Farm Inputs Subsidy Programme
Task Force and participates in the Donor Committee on Agriculture and Food Security.



IX.       INDIGENOUS PEOPLES




Australia plays an active international role in focussing on indigenous issues, which continue to be a
priority area both domestically and internationally. The government cosponsors resolutions on the rights
of indigenous peoples and makes statements supporting the advancement of these rights in both the
Human Rights Council and the UNGA Third Committee. In August 2015, the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade (DFAT) launched the world’s first comprehensive foreign affairs department,
Indigenous Peoples Strategy. The Government continues to engage in international discussions on best
practice approaches consistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP)
and the Outcome Document from the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.



In August 2015, DFAT launched its Indigenous Peoples Strategy prioritizes indigenous issues and
participation across diplomatic, trade, development, and corporate areas to harmonize international and
domestic policy approaches on indigenous rights. The five-year strategy is based on the following pillars:

         (i) working to influence international policy to advance the interests of indigenous peoples in
          the international community
         (ii) striving to deliver international programmes that improve outcomes for indigenous peoples
         (iii) encouraging indigenous Australians to apply for DFAT-funded opportunities to engage in
          and develop people-to-people links with the international community; and
         (iv) ensuring an inclusive workplace culture across DFAT


The government continues to engage in international discussions on best practice approaches consistent
with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the outcome document
from the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples.


                                                                                                     171
The rights of indigenous peoples are a cross-cutting theme in Finnish development policy, and achieving
these rights is accomplished by taking account of such rights at the planning stage of development policy
principles and projects. Finland aims to reinforce the status of indigenous peoples by working toward
the realization of the goals enshrined in UNDRIP. Finland also continues to support the activities of UN
indigenous peoples’ organizations. In 2014, UN member states and the representatives of indigenous
peoples and civil society, who had gathered at the first-ever high-level UN World Conference on
Indigenous Peoples, adopted an outcome document on the promotion and protection of the rights of
indigenous peoples. This document gives impetus to the earlier commitment of states to uphold the
position of indigenous peoples and respect their rights, and it serves as a roadmap for the implementation
of indigenous peoples’ rights. Finland considers it particularly important to encourage the involvement
of indigenous peoples in the UN system.



FAO has been working toward systematically mainstreaming indigenous rights in its various areas of
work. It has developed a capacity-building strategy and a manual on free, prior, and informed consent
to ensure that the rights of indigenous peoples are duly considered in its activities. Since 2014, FAO has
worked with the International Indigenous Women’s Forum to organize the Leadership School for
indigenous women on human rights, food security and nutrition, and advocacy skills, with the objective,
inter alia, of strengthening the capacity of indigenous women in the use of national and international
instruments on human rights.



X.       CONFLICT AND FRAGILITY




Poverty and conflict are inextricably linked to authoritarianism and poor governance, with consequences
for citizens worsening during times of crisis. Conflict in South Sudan, Iraq, Yemen, and Ukraine has left
tens of millions of people in need of assistance; Syria’s brutal civil war has destroyed entire communities
and affected far too many lives. USAID is committed to responding to crises around the world to help
the people and places most in need. With a focus on disaster prevention, response, recovery, and
transition, USAID works to:

        Strengthen resilience by helping states and communities prepare for and mitigate the impacts of
         disasters to help people withstand crises rather than have to seek emergency assistance.

                                                                                                      172
       Provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to save lives and alleviate suffering.
       Provide emergency food assistance while also sowing the seeds for recovery and resilience.
       Accelerate a rapid and durable recovery by supporting livelihoods, markets, and the sustainable
        provision of basic services.
       Address underlying grievances that cause instability and conflict to wind down tensions before
        they ignite.
       Promote peaceful political transitions by strengthening civil society and respect for human
        rights, facilitating reconciliation, supporting effective democratic governance, and fostering the
        resumption of basic economic activity.
       Invest in the protection and empowerment of women and girls in countries affected by crisis and
        conflict to improve prospects for peace and security.


For example, USAID has:

       Provided emergency assistance to tens of millions of people in 45 countries in response to
        49 disasters.
       Provided food assistance in the form of food, value transfers, and vouchers to more than
        53 million people in 47 countries.
       Helped prevent conflict and mitigate the impact of unanticipated complex crises with targeted
        programmes in five countries.



A World Bank NTF addressed human rights in the Columbia post conflict setting. In 2011, Colombia
passed the Victims and Land Restitution Law to support access to justice for victims experiencing crimes
due to armed conflict such as displacement, threats, and violence. In response to the law, in 2012, the
Ministry of Justice and the Defensoria del Pueblo (the ombuds agency) created the Mobile Victims Unit
(MVU) to ensure access to justice for all affected Colombians. Together, these entities support a mobile
van that travels throughout Colombia, reaching even the most remote areas, allowing victims to declare
and register for reparations. The MVU has served 51,821 people since its creation. Five years after the
institution of the Victims and Land Restitution Law and four years after the creation of the MVU, the
World Bank partnered with the three entities to conduct an impact evaluation of the unit and its services.
Although the general feedback from communities has been positive, an evaluation will take a deeper
look at the effectiveness and impact of the mobile van. The NTF grant is being used to fund data
collection to increase the understanding of how displaced persons and other victims try to enforce their
rights, the impact of enforcement of their rights, and the effectiveness of different service delivery

                                                                                                     173
models in helping displaced persons and other victims exercise their rights. The evaluation will look at
impact and cost effectiveness and will emphasize the realization of human rights, not just the number of
victims served.



Another World Bank NTF grant addresses human rights and post-conflict in the Colombian context. The
general objectives of the grant are to capture and make available knowledge about how a HRBA can add
value to post-conflict sustainable development strategies directed at coca growers in former FARC-EP
controlled areas in accordance with Colombia’s peace-building and post-conflict stabilization priorities.
It also aims to strengthen the participatory mechanisms and advocacy capacity of coca growers in three
departments (Nariño, Cauca, and Caquetá) to engage in dialogue with local and national authorities and
inform drug policymaking.



XI.     LGBTI RIGHTS



Finland promotes the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by lesbian, bisexual, and transgender
persons, as well as intersex persons. Sexual and reproductive health and rights are an essential
component of human rights, and the agenda for gender equality and development and their
implementation is very important for everyone’s body, sexuality, and reproductive health.



Sexual and gender minorities commonly experience discrimination all over the world. Homosexuality
is still criminalized in more than 80 countries. Finland advocates the elimination of all forms of
criminalization as well as other discriminatory legislation and official measures based on sexual
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Finland supports every person’s right to define his or
her gender and sexuality on his or her own terms. Young people, in particular, must have the right to be
informed without any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, gender
expression, or family structure. Finland supports the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender/transsexual, and intersex (LGBTI) persons through economic and political means.



Finland seeks to ensure that the Yogyakarta Principles, approved at an expert level, are adopted as a
foundation for international human rights policy and as international recommendations for guiding

                                                                                                     174
action in the field. The Yogyakarta Principles complement UN-defined human rights by covering the
rights of sexual and gender minorities. Finland fosters rights related to sexual orientation and gender
identity by supporting initiatives to promote this theme in such fora as the UNGA and the Human Rights
Council. Finland actively implements the LGBTI guidelines of the European Union. These guidelines
establish a framework for EU action in issues concerning sexual and gender minorities. Furthermore,
Finland supports the work of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and is engaged in cooperation with
such entities as the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights. The Ministry for Foreign
Affairs participates, frequently together with other EU countries, in Pride events all over the world.




                                                                                                         175
                                         Chapter 8
                               Challenges and Opportunities


Beyond the legal or policy commitments of donors to human rights, there are a range of practical issues
which may affect the degree to which they are able to integrate human rights effectively into their
development programming. These include institutional and budgetary considerations, as well as staff
and organizational factors such as decentralization. There are important factors related to partner
country capacity and in some cases political resistance to human rights. Questions related to aid
modalities and policy coherence present both challenges and opportunities for the integration of human
rights into development.



I.      INSTITUTIONALIZATION




Institutionalization of human rights considerations is an important internal challenge facing aid agencies.
Agencies that are committed to applying a human rights–based approach (HRBA) internally must take
a systematic look at their procedures and operations in order to identify required changes and strengthen
staff capacities and incentive structures. Organizational culture plays a role in this process, potentially
impeding an institution’s ability to adopt or adapt to new ideas. For agencies committed to working on
human rights in a more selective way (such as at the level of projects or in dialogues), it is important to
provide guidance to staff on why to undertake this work and how to do so effectively.



A synthesis of documented experiences, along with a large number of interviews conducted, suggests
that the following elements are important for effective institutionalization: external environment, senior
leadership, staff capacity and incentives, new tools and guidance on changes to project cycle
management, and adapting to working in a decentralized context. In addition, broader challenges such
as state fragility, partner country capacity and engagement, and the challenge of international policy
coherence play a role in the effective integration of human rights into development policies.




                                                                                                      176
In Germany, despite the significant progress made within the German Agency for International
Development (GIZ), some challenges remain in order to systematically integrate human rights in the
entire project cycle. Although progress has been made in the planning phase of new programmes and
projects, GIZ is placing more emphasis on the entire project cycle. For this reason, GIZ is in the process
of establishing a comprehensive environmental and social risk management system that includes human
rights standards and principles.



For Austria, challenges remain with regard to mainstreaming human rights into all strategic documents
such as country strategies and thematic strategies, but also when implementing these strategies in fragile
situations or in the context of protecting women and children in armed conflicts or with regard to the
rights of persons with disabilities. This is a crucial development in regard to HRBA application in
Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC), since HRBA is prescribed at the highest level and is clearly
defined.



In Finland, central challenges to institutionalization of the HRBA have been the frequent turnover of
staff working with development cooperation, as well as the need for concrete guidance and tools, such
as checklists, for effective implementation. Reporting on human rights–related results needs be
strengthened. The HRBA has been mainstreamed into all trainings, although separate in-depth trainings
and sector specific workshops are also part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)’s course
curriculum. The MFA has developed internal guidance and checklists in its efforts to pursue a stronger
institutional integration of the HRBA. Finland has made HRBA screening part of the quality screening
of all interventions.


Although there is a clear legal and policy mandate to integrate human rights into all development
cooperation, the Finnish government has faced a number of challenges in achieving this goal. The
operationalization of the HRBA is an institutional learning process. Challenges relate to delays in
implementing more detailed policy guidance (the levels of HRBA consideration) because of the different
timeframes for programmes and projects (e.g., some have been going on for years; integration into new
initiatives is easier). There are challenges related to resources: human rights experts are not always
involved in all teams implementing development cooperation. As human rights experts participate in the
implementation or planning of development interventions upon invitation by regional departments and
embassies, there has occasionally been a lack of practical guidance for the HRBA. To meet the
challenges, an internal action plan for the operationalization of the HRBA was developed in 2014. The

                                                                                                     177
work plan includes programming processes, development of guidance and instructions, HRBA training,
and strengthened internal coordination.



II.     SENIOR-LEVEL COMMITMENT, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND COMMUNICATION




Resistance to policy change is common among agencies. However, reviews indicate that senior-level
managers and other policy champions (in agencies such as the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF); the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ); and the
Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)) have taken steps to ensure that new
policies are effectively developed, communicated, and implemented in their organizations. Making staff
accountable to senior management has been a useful approach. The UN Systems Staff College has
recognized the need to develop strong leadership on human rights issues and is developing new trainings
aimed at strengthening senior-level commitment. One of the priorities for the United Nations
Development Group Human Rights Mainstreaming Group (UNDG-HRM) is to strengthen the capacity
of resident coordinator and UN country team leadership to drive mainstreaming efforts by providing
them with enhanced learning support and guidance.




  Box 8.1

  Senior-Level Directives

  In 1998, UNICEF issued an Executive Directive introducing its HRBA to programming (UNICEF
  1998). It assigned responsibilities for dissemination and implementation to heads of offices, regional
  directors, and division directors. The new approach was not made a separate thematic area; instead,
  every staff member and country office was given responsibility for implementation. Both the
  Vietnam case study and the evaluation of UNICEF’s HRBA emphasize the important role played by
  senior staff in this transformation (see chapter 7).




The New Zealand Agency for International Development (NZAID) translated ministers’ commitments
to human rights mainstreaming into an implementation plan (NZAID, 2004). An implementation team,


                                                                                                     178
including senior managers, met monthly to review progress, and reported to ministers after a few years.
The implementation plan targets not only strategy, planning, and programming, but as well as also
organizational capacity and cultural transformation within NZAID. It called for data capture on human
rights programming, staff recruitment and training, a process for responding to staff concerns about
human rights abuses (within the agency or in partner countries), a review of contracting procedures, and
the agency’s communication strategy. The resulting programme is now called the New Zealand Aid
Programme; human rights continues to be a cross-cutting issue that is mandatory in all New Zealand
Aid Programme policies, processes, and activities for which management is clearly accountable. Human
rights considerations are appraised in all project designs, included in implementation, tracked through
monitoring, and reported in results for all aid initiatives.



III.    BUDGETARY CONSIDERATIONS




Donor agencies faced challenges in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Some foreign aid budgets
were reduced, and a strong focus was placed on demonstrating the value of aid. Austria’s overseas
development budget fell to 0.3 per cent of GNP instead of continuously rising toward the expected 0.51
per cent in 2010 and 0.7 per cent in 2015, the target year for reaching the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs; Global Responsibility 2011). As a result, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which develops
Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) strategies and programmes that are in turn implemented by
the Austrian Development Agency (ADA), had to move out of several partner countries and
programmes. Similarly, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) announced in its Aid
Effectiveness Action Plan that it would be focusing 80 per cent of its resources in 20 countries, down
from approximately 34 countries, and on five priority themes in an effort to make its assistance more
focused, effective, and accountable (CIDA 2009b). Concentrating activities in more limited areas and
sectors may help ADA and CIDA harmonize their programming with other donors in line with the Paris
Declaration principles. In its Strategic Plan 2014–2017, the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) identified the following challenges worldwide: gaps in skills, diminished speed of action, rising
costs, and declining core funding.



In some instances, the global financial crisis coincided with a continued increase in aid and emphasis on
demonstrating its effective use. For example, in 2011, Spain unveiled the Fund for the Promotion of


                                                                                                    179
Development and kept its aid budget on a steadily rising trajectory. To ensure that funds were well spent,
a working group was created to focus on the quality and efficacy of Spanish aid distribution as a
horizontal priority (FRIDE 2010). Australia’s aid budget grew to 0.5 per cent of GNI in 2015–2016. The
Office of Development Effectiveness, established in 2006, conducted an in-depth independent review
of aid effectiveness making recommendations on how Australia’s aid programme could be less
fragmented and improve its performance management system. The review was introduced by explaining
that “Australians want their contribution to be effective. They want to know that there is value for money;
that it is having a real impact on the lives of people” (Government of Australia 2011). In 2011, Canada’s
prime minister of international cooperation remarked that “Canadians want to know that their tax dollars
are spent wisely and effectively” (CIDA 2011). When such value is demonstrated, it can have positive
effects. When an independent aid review was conducted in 2008 and found that AusAID’s HRBA to
stopping violence against women in Melanesia and East Timor was particularly effective, AusAID’s
related programme funding was doubled.



As a number of human rights initiatives merge into existing development initiatives (e.g., gender
mainstreaming) agencies are being asked to do more with less. Success with information sharing and
joint reporting is being reported, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR)’s collaboration with United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on presenting input to expert
committees on refugee children.



Considering that many human rights require a progressive and long-term commitment aimed at
increasing technical capacity, raising awareness and advocacy, and making use of concrete opportunities
created by political and economic processes, decreasing financial resources hampers effectiveness and
efficiency in the pertinent work of the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO).
Resource constraints have led to the lack of representation of FAO in UN-led human rights–related
processes, such as the UNDG Human Rights Working Group.



IV.     STAFF CAPACITIES AND INCENTIVES

Many agencies lacked staff expertise when they first adopted their human rights policies. To put the
policies into action, most have created focal point positions and recruited external experts. The Europe
Aid-DEVCO (formed by a merger of the EuropeAid Cooperation Office with the Directorate General

                                                                                                      180
for Development and Relations with ACP States, which manages European development policy, has a
unit dedicated to governance, democracy, gender, and human rights. The EU created the Directorate on
Human Rights and Democracy within the European External Action Service and assigned a human rights
focal point in all EU delegations around the world (European Commission 2011f). The World Bank
Nordic Trust Fund (NTF), housed within the World Bank’s Governance Global Practice, is an example
of an internal capacity building initiative designed to build staff knowledge of human rights and help the
institution develop a more informed view of human rights.



More often, however, staff numbers have remained small, with often only one or two persons responsible
for human rights (e.g., the ADA Department on Human Rights within ADC,) and related issues at
headquarters (usually located within governance units). Some agencies gave responsibility to a
professional cadre with country programming responsibility (e.g., the UK’s Department for International
Development [DFID]’s social development advisers). Various agencies launched training programmes
in headquarters and the field (targeted to audience and level of expertise) to mainstream expertise across
the agency (e.g., UNICEF, BMZ, Sida, ADA, and Dutch development cooperation). A number of
agencies promoted outside networking opportunities and exchanges of information within the agency
(e.g., DFID’s social development retreats and Sida’s democratic governance events). Implementation
guides such as the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)’s Implementation of
Governance as a Transversal Theme with a Human Rights-Based Approach, make it easier for an
agency’s development practitioners to apply HRBA to programmes and projects (SDC 2008b).




Box 8.2

Capacity Development Initiatives

NZAID issued its Human Rights Policy Statement (NZAID 2002) shortly after the department was
established, thereby launching its human rights policy. Similarly, UNICEF staff members undergo
human rights training as part of their induction training. These examples contrast with agencies where
staff are already familiar with existing approaches and frameworks and are not offered training. Despite
a major organizational restructuring and the development of new business processes, human rights
continues to be one of three cross-cutting thematic issues for the New Zealand Aid Programme (New
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 2011).




                                                                                                     181
DFID’s significant policy and programming developments can be credited to its professional network
of social development advisers (about 70 out of 2,500) who ensure that a social perspective (including
human rights considerations) is applied to all DFID activities. Individual advisers have championed the
approach in specific projects and programmes, as well as in the development of country strategies and
new policy initiatives. This policy contrasts with bilateral agencies where human rights are seen
primarily as a governance concern or there are fewer professional advisers working on these issues.




Organizations now realize that it is not enough to develop, launch, and share methodological material
on a HRBA to development. Sida reviews how a rights perspective/HRBA is applied in Sida’s system
for the management of appraisal, follow up, and completion of financial support. Sida also developed a
training module on a HRBA (www.sida.se/hrbs).



With regard to integrating human rights as a cross-cutting theme in projects in various sectors, internal
quality control standards comprise human rights impacts and risks and respective capacity development
measures have been increased in recent years. In January 2016, an introductory course on human rights,
gender equality, and poverty reduction became part of the mandatory in-house training for new GIZ
staff.



In 2010, the Danish Institute for Human Rights held a three-day training course for World Bank teams
receiving grants from the NTF to familiarize staff with human rights law, HRBA, and human rights in
development programming and practice (Nordic Trust Fund 2010). In 2011, the Finnish Ministry of
Foreign Affairs held a three-day workshop for the NTF, providing teams receiving grants an opportunity
to present their work and have it critiqued by experts.



There are many examples of agencies learning from one another. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs
invited Sida, GIZ, and UN staff colleagues to share experiences with HRBAs in January 2012. In
September 2011, Minority Rights Group Europe, which published a guide on the integration of HRBA,
held a two-day seminar in Budapest and invited EU member states development agencies to share their
experiences working with a HRBA. ADC looked to AusAID’s leadership to develop its “Focus Paper
on Persons with Disabilities” (ADC 2011).


                                                                                                    182
Multilateral donors can play a role in this kind of information sharing. Since its establishment in 2008,
the NTF has supported exchanges across an informal network of interested World Bank staff and
sponsored learning events with international, regional, and national partners as part of its knowledge and
partnership programme (Nordic Trust Fund 2011a). In February 2010, the NTF hosted a two-day peer-
to-peer exchange among 50 Bank staff and members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Human Rights Task Team. A
similar exchange on human rights and development took place in June 2011 between Bank staff and the
UNDG-HRM. The UN HRBA Portal is an excellent online resource where agencies can share and seek
information about HRBA programming.



One challenge relates to the lack of experience on how to apply the HRBA, in particular in the sectoral
areas of the work of FAO. In addition to the requirements of building staff capacity, the fact that the
national partners of FAO are institutions with technical sectoral specialties, poses challenges to
mainstreaming human rights. Much work must be done to create and strengthen inter-sectoral and inter-
institutional collaborations at the international and national levels so as to bring human rights within
FAO sectoral policy, legal, programme, and institutional support.



The work on the human rights that fall within the purview of FAO is supported by dedicated units that
enjoy differing levels of organizational support in terms of human and financial resources. The units
work toward the implementation of rights through activities at the corporate, national, and global levels.



V.      ADAPTING TO DECENTRALIZATION




The increasing decentralization of most aid agencies has fostered closer interaction with national
partners and country-based aid coordination and poses a challenge to the institutionalization of human
rights and other policies. Policies tend to be developed at headquarters, yet need to be applied in specific
country contexts, presenting a challenge to agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO),
whose decentralized structure has complicated its ability to offer consistent interpretations and
approaches on human rights-based policies (UNDG-HRM 2011). Other agencies have used their

                                                                                                       183
decentralized structure more opportunistically. As illustrated in SDC and DFID reviews,
decentralization has enabled some country offices to experiment with a HRBA, even when central
policies and procedural changes lagged behind.



Reviews have identified a range of techniques to improve linkages between policy and implementation.
Some agencies ensure field representation in the development of human rights policies and guidance
(e.g., the SDC consultation process), decentralize expertise to country offices (e.g., Sida’s regional
democracy and human rights advisers, DFID’s social development advisers), or include human rights in
the terms of reference for a wider range of field positions (e.g., the United Nations Development Fund
for Women). Other techniques include providing headquarters advice to targeted country programmes
(e.g., GIZ country programmes draw on headquarters human rights expertise, the Global Human Rights
Strengthening Programme (HURIST) reviews UNDP country programmes), or adding questions about
progress on human rights programming in annual planning instructions and country office reports (e.g.,
UNICEF annual reviews).



Organizations have documented their experience with country-level piloting of new approaches to feed
into institutional learning (e.g., DFID’s Participatory Rights Assessment Methodology initiatives in Peru
and Malawi), or with the application of a HRBA across a full country programme (e.g., UNICEF case
studies; Sida’s Kenya programme; and DFID programmes in Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil). In addition,
organizations have established regionally based, multiagency communities of practice to share lessons
about human rights in a region/country relevant way (e.g., OHCHR Lessons Learned Project on HRBA
in the Asia-Pacific region and UNDP’s lesson learning work on rights and justice in the same region).



One of SDC’s advantages as well as challenges is its high level of decentralization. SDC’s programmes
are highly context-relevant and adapted to local circumstances. Yet, the considerable independence
means that the impact of institutional policies on programmes is limited at times. The decentralized
approach means that learning among country offices is challenging. To counter that challenge, SDC set
up a number of thematic networks that foster learning and knowledge management and provide support
for quality assurance. One of the thematic networks focuses on conflict and human rights.




                                                                                                    184
With the decentralization process embarked on by FAO after the adoption of its Renewed Strategic
Framework (RSF), capacity development work and the development of tailored tools and assistance
became more important. In addition to many theme-specific learning materials, an integrated learning
programme was developed in 2014–2015 on the UN Common Country Programming principles, with
lessons on gender equality, the right to food and decent work, and indigenous peoples’ right to free,
prior, and informed consent. The decentralization process allowed for increasing knowledge sharing and
understanding of regional and national dynamics in order to provide results-based and evidence-based
support and assistance, at the core of the RSF principles. Despite the benefits of decentralization, it has
presented challenges for ensuring adequate resources in support of regular programme activities. For
example, although regular programme funds supplemented the work on the right to food that had mainly
depended on trust funds (Germany, Norway, and Spain) until 2013, those activities have since been
carried out exclusively with trust funds.



VI.     STATE FRAGILITY AND CAPACITY LIMITATIONS




Factors and context beyond those related to a donor’s policies and institutional arrangements impact the
integration of human rights, and many are challenging. Integrating human rights into development
assistance is not simply a technical matter resolved by adequate training or better tools and procedures.
In some contexts, aid agencies have found engagement with partner governments around human rights
issues particularly difficult because a human rights frame can highlight the political dimensions of
poverty reduction or because of weak capacity. Donors need to understand and address the links between
fragile states and human rights. Donors realize that they need to find better ways of engaging in difficult
environments or fragile states, defined by the DAC as “countries where there is a lack of political
commitment and/or weak capacity to develop and implement pro-poor policies, suffering from violent
conflict and/or weak governance” (OECD 2005c). Acute human rights violations and the fear of being
seen as complicit with human rights–abusing governments are among the most important factors
impeding a stronger role for donors in fragile states (World Bank 2011b).



In 2007, the DAC brought attention to the challenges of working with and within fragile states by
identifying a new focus area in the Action-Oriented Principles on Human Rights and Development
(OECD 2007a; box 4.2) and soon thereafter, the DAC issued the Principles for Good International


                                                                                                      185
Engagement in Fragile States and Situations (OECD 2007c; box 8.3). The Principles for Good
International Engagement are 10 principles to guide donor engagement in fragile states, including
several references to human rights. For example, when donors consider suspending or continuing aid in
the context of human rights violations in a recipient country, the DAC’s “do no harm” principle reminds
donors to consider what impact such decisions may have on circumstances in-country. It also encourages
a focus on state building so that state institutions can safeguard human rights.



Yet, the theoretical and practical links between the human rights and fragile states agendas are
underdeveloped and tend to be implicit. Few agencies have developed policy statements or strategies in
these areas; when they have, human rights are not given much prominence. One notable exception is
Denmark’s 2010 policy on fragile states (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark 201 0a), which lists
the promotion of democratic development, good governance, and human rights among its five priority
areas for working in fragile situations.



Weak capacity to realize human rights can result from a range of factors, such as limited resources to
meet minimum standards or ignorance of human rights duties and claims. The approaches examined in
chapter 3 and the key role given to capacity development of rights-holders and duty-bearers in the UN
Interagency Common Understanding of a HRBA are the strategies most commonly adopted to overcome
weak capacity. Danish support of human rights is centred on the strengthening of the capacity of relevant
national institutions to promote the rule of law and human rights, such as support to ministries of human
rights (e.g., Burkina Faso), national human rights commissions (e.g., Uganda and Bangladesh), and
ministries of justice (e.g., Mozambique). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is the private
sector arm of the World Bank Group. IFC focuses on the role of private sector actors in developing
countries, including fragile and conflict-affected states. With support from the NTF the International
Committee of the Red Cross, extractive industry trade associations, and others, the IFC launched an
Implementation Guidance Tool for IFC’s Voluntary Principles of Security and Human Rights in
September 2011.



In weak or fragile states, state capacity may be so limited that the realization of some human rights
obligations may not be realistic, for example, holding states accountable for meeting even the most basic
obligations, such as maintaining security or providing access to services. Focusing on human rights may


                                                                                                    186
help identify what is required for effective nation or state-building; a HRBA can highlight how to move
progressively to a situation where states meet their basic obligations, reconstructing the social contract
between rulers and those ruled. The DAC’s approach to fragile states prioritizes state core functions such
as basic security, justice, economic and service delivery functions, legitimacy and accountability, and
an enabling environment (OECD 2005b, 2007c). Likewise, the World Bank’s 2011 World Development
Report emphasized that institutional legitimacy is key to breaking the cycle of violence, conflict, and
poverty (World Bank 2011).

 Box 8.3

 DAC Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations



 At the DAC’s High Level Forum in April 2007, ministers and heads of agencies endorsed the DAC
 Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations to maximize
 engagement in fragile states and minimize potential harm. Although there are concerns about whether
 these principles are applied in practice and what mechanisms exist to monitor their implementation,
 they do provide useful basic guidance for donors operating in fragile states:



 1. Take context as the starting point.
 2. Do no harm.
 3. Focus on state-building as the central objective.
 4. Prioritise prevention [of conflict and other crises].
 5. Recognise the links between political, security, and development objectives.
 6. Promote non-discrimination as a basis for inclusive and stable societies.
 7. Align with local priorities in different ways in different contexts.
 8. Agree on practical coordination mechanisms between international actors.
 9. Act fast . . . but stay engaged long enough to give success a chance.
 10. Avoid pockets of exclusions.




Human rights approaches present opportunities and challenges when promoting peace building and
development in fragile and conflict-affected states. Conflict impacts human rights and vice versa. A

                                                                                                     187
specific human rights issue may fuel a conflict, such as discrimination and inequality between ethnic
groups; or a conflict may result in a humanitarian situation that demands intervention. It is often difficult
to provide basic services in fragile states and to find entry points to protect human rights. The UK Aid
Strategy committed 50 per cent of all of UK aid to fragile and conflict-affected states. However, there is
not necessarily a greater emphasis on human rights in fragile states compared to other DFID priority
countries. Human rights are one among a wide range of approaches to address conflict and fragility and
are relevant to the UK response in fragile and conflict-affected states in different ways: local context is
crucial.


There is increasing concern about the apparent trend of restrictions on civil society activism, media
freedom, social movements, and human rights in many countries. This issue has strong links to the UK
government’s commitment “to continue to promote the golden thread of democracy, the rule of law ,
property rights, a free media and open, accountable institutions,” and has been an important issue
considered in the Civil Society Partnership Review, which is being finalized at the time of writing. DFID
country offices and the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) respond to these issues in each
country on a case-by-case basis.



In Switzerland, SDC will continue and deepen its strategic shift toward fragile and conflict-affected
contexts. SDC, together with the State Secretariat of Economic Affairs and the Human Security Division,
prepared the Swiss Confederation’s Strategy on International Cooperation, a strategic framework and
budget for 2017–2020. The framework envisages that SDC spend 50 per cent of its budget in fragile
contexts. Additionally, the strategic framework emphasizes that human rights are a key part of SDC’s
engagement in these contexts, as well as its theory of change for addressing fragility.


In Syria, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) recognizes that the conflict
is not only inciting an unparalleled humanitarian situation, but is also compromising human and
economic prospects for current and future generations in all impacted countries, including for the
realization of human rights. The crisis is putting a strain on already vulnerable resources in the region’s
middle-income countries. Neighbouring countries have spent billions of dollars to help protect and house
refugees. These countries can no longer cope with the massive number of refugees, and displaced
persons are fleeing to countries outside the region. UNIDO has a responsibility to help people and
communities deal with the crisis, even as it advances. The United Nations has embraced life-saving
humanitarian assistance by providing food, water, and shelter, but people need more than that—they
also need to maintain livelihoods and access to education and healthcare. UNIDO is ready to provide

                                                                                                        188
post-crisis recovery, to work toward regaining social cohesion, and to resume progress as soon as the
situation allows.



VII.      PARTNER-COUNTRY OWNERSHIP, POLITICAL RESISTANCE TO HUMAN RIGHTS,
          AND MUTUAL ACCOUNTABILITY




Some donors struggle to reconcile human rights with national ownership and leadership of strategies.
Aid agencies may be reluctant to engage in human rights programming because they fear that the human
rights agenda will be rejected by official partners, for example, on the grounds of political interference
in domestic sovereignty or arguments grounded in cultural relativism. The 2005 UN World Summit
outcome document reaffirms the universality of human rights and commits member states “to integrate
the promotion and protection of human rights into national policies” (UN 2005a). Successive
international outcome documents, including the 2013 Vienna +20 outcome document, have affirmed the
same principles.




Box 8.4

Challenges for UNICEF Staff



UNICEF identified contextual challenges faced by staff implementing a HRBA. Constraints include the
operations of government structures in partner countries, in particular when a government operates in a
highly centralized manner with limited public accountability. Some country contexts present greater
challenges than others, for example. war-torn societies, those with widespread poverty or extremely
weak capacity, or countries where basic survival or institution building is a priority. A country may have
open political resistance to human rights, for example, in the context of sharp ethnic divisions where
collecting disaggregated data or providing education in native languages is not politically acceptable.
Resistance to human rights goes beyond governments and can include social norms and values, such as
opposition to child and adolescent participation and a perception of aid as charity.



Strategies to overcome political resistance have included progressive engagement (e.g., UNICEF in


                                                                                                     189
Vietnam), bypassing state actors (the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights), the use
of dialogue, and the possibility of applying conditionality, such as sanctions and aid suspension. Lessons
learned from DFID in Peru and Sida in Kenya suggest that opportunities for engagement are greater at
certain times, for example, during political transition, although resistance may be found at other levels
in government and society (such as resistance to equal gender relations).




 Box 8.5

 Promoting HRBA and Cultural Sensitivity

 The 2011 UNDG-HRM mapping of UN agency human rights mainstreaming policies and tools
 highlights the challenge of advocating a HRBA in politically sensitive contexts (UNDG-HRM 2011).
 The report points to a programming manual for United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) country
 staff and national partners with modules on how to apply a HRBA to its work (UNFPA and Harvard
 2010). The manual distinguishes between promoting human rights with cultural sensitivity and using
 “culture” as an excuse to disregard or violate human rights. It refers to a 2004 policy note by then-
 UNFPA Executive Director Thoraya Ahmed Obaid:
              By adopting culturally sensitive approaches to promote human rights standards and
 principles, UNFPA is not making value judgments on any cultural values held by communities or
 groups; rather it is addressing harmful practices that represent violations of international standards
 of human rights. For example, campaigning to end female genital cutting is a judgment that the
 practice denies the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of gender and the right to health.
 A human rights perspective affirms that the rights of women and girls to freedom from discrimination
 and to the highest standard of health are universal. Cultural claims cannot be invoked to justify their
 violation. (UNFPA 2004a)




                                                                                                      190
When state fragility is more clearly linked to a lack of will than to capacity, human rights play an
important role in donor engagement. Human rights can provide a tool to analyse power relations and
state capacity issues behind the lack of will. They offer an entry point for dialogue based on an
international, rather than bilateral, approach. Special human rights procedures can be used as part of
fact-finding and to guide an international response (e.g., human rights missions could have been listened
to prior to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda). When the political environment permits, a HRBA to aid can
support social change processes to demand more effective and accountable states or a focus on the core
rights required for change (e.g., freedom of expression and association, or a move to more equitable
services).



Partner governments often claim that human rights are an externally imposed agenda. This assertion
seems to conflict with the principle of national ownership, where partner countries exercise effective
leadership over their development policies and strategies and coordinate development actions. In
response to this, and consistent with the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which prioritizes
ownership, agencies refer to nationally entrenched fundamental rights in constitutions and domestic
legal standards, as well as to the (freely entered into) international human rights obligations; aid can help
partner countries meet these commitments, primarily through capacity development support.



Donors may support partner-country actors’ participation in poverty reduction strategy processes,
thereby allowing wider constituencies to engage and supporting domestic accountability. In Uganda, for
example, DFID has funded participatory processes, including a focus on pastoralist communities. UNDP
has supported the Uganda Human Rights Commission in policy debates, and a coalition of civil society
organizations has advocated for a HRBA to the Poverty Eradication Action Plan revisions, leading to
greater emphasis on equity considerations. More lessons about the integration of human rights in poverty
reduction strategies may emerge from research on poverty and human rights by the Geneva-based
International Council on Human Rights Policy. Lessons may also be drawn from Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) efforts such as the application of the Draft Guidelines on a
Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies (OHCHR 2003) and the piloting of the
approach by HURIST in a limited set of countries.




                                                                                                        191
In the UK, DFID addresses human rights challenges by:

       Working with the FCO to raise concerns with governments at the appropriate level. In many
        cases, this collaboration must be done out of the public eye in order to avoid “backlash” against
        the very groups the government is seeking to assist. The government considers violations in the
        context of a country’s overall context, trends and “direction”, and makes an informed judgment
        about which violations require an immediate response and which require private diplomacy and
        sustained engagement.
       Providing aid to governments only when DFID is satisfied that the government shares Britain’s
        commitments to reducing poverty and to respecting human rights. Before providing aid to a
        partner government, DFID assesses the government’s commitment to four Partnership
        Principles: a commitment to poverty reduction; respecting human rights and other international
        obligations; improving public financial management, promoting good governance and
        transparency, and fighting corruption; and strengthening domestic accountability.



Despite such strategies to overcome resistance and encourage partner country ownership, challenges
remain. In some countries, gaps persist between the improved frameworks and their actual
implementation, leading to impunity gaps and lack of access to justice for all. In other countries, certain
groups remain the subject of systemic discrimination (e.g., homosexuals in some African countries).
Standstills or setbacks can occur despite continued donor support (including training and study tours)
and sustained diplomatic pressure at country and multilateral levels.



Mutual accountability is a central tenet of the aid effectiveness agenda and a key principle of the 2005
Paris Declaration, along with ownership, harmonization, alignment, and results. Mutual accountability
refers to the individual and joint accountability of donor and partner governments to their citizens and
parliaments for their development policies, strategies, and performance. The Paris Declaration requires
that partner governments use participatory processes to develop and monitor national strategies and
involve their parliaments, that donors provide transparent information on aid flows to promote public
accountability, and that both parties jointly assess progress in meeting aid effectiveness commitments.
These mutual accountability principles are fully compatible with the human rights principles of
accountability and transparency, which require access to information as well as participation in decision-
making. Human rights norms and standards can be a part of the mutual accountability framework,

                                                                                                      192
requiring not only that partner governments demonstrate progress in implementing their human rights
commitments but also that donors be held accountable for their contribution to the realization of human
rights in partner countries. There are several examples of governments and agencies specifying human
rights as shared values underpinning their aid partnerships (e.g., Finland, Netherlands, Sida, DFID, the
UN system). However, there are also disagreements about the extent to which the international human
rights framework requires donors to be legally accountable for their human rights impacts.



VIII.     AID ALLOCATION AND AID MODALITIES




Assessments of whether human rights are being met and the kinds of resources needed to allow partner
governments to better respect, protect, and fulfil human rights contribute to aid allocation decisions. This
sensitive area is closely related to the use of political conditionality and the withholding or suspension
of aid in certain circumstances. Some agencies use public sets of human rights and governance indicators
to identify and reward good performance. For example, the assessment of good governance, including
“a minimum respect for human rights, a free press, pluralistic democracy and rule of law, including
independence of the judiciary” is an established step in the assessment of whether to provide Danish
budget support to partner countries.

The US Millennium Challenge Corporation



The US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), created in 2004, aims not to use US political or
foreign policy objectives in order to select beneficiary countries. Instead, it identifies a set of countries
based on per capita income. It uses 17 third-party indicators in three categories to measure candidate
countries:
   Ruling justly (civil rights, political rights, control of corruption, government effectiveness, rule of
    law, voice, and accountability)
   Investing in people (immunization rates, public expenditure on health, girls’ primary education
    completion rate, public expenditure on primary education, and natural resource management)
   Encouraging economic freedom (business start-up, land rights and access, trade policy, regulatory


                                                                                                        193
      quality, inflation, and fiscal policy) (MCC 2011)
The MCC explicitly uses governance indicators and draws on the six dimensions of the World Bank
Institute’s database, which uses a range of human rights indicators. Countries become eligible to submit
proposals for MCC funding. The MCC Board can exercise discretion in the selection process,
considering data weaknesses, additional qualitative information, or country performance on an indicator.
Care must be taken that use of discretion does not open up space for a repoliticization of the selection
process. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) commissioned an
independent evaluation of MCC and concluded that the agency is largely aligned with the Paris
Declaration principles (Source: USAID 2011a).




Chapter 3 illustrates how human rights, traditionally addressed through stand-alone projects, have been
mainstreamed in sector programmes. A number of donor agencies are concerned that, in the current shift
to programme aid modalities (such as general budget support and sector-wide approaches), a focus on
human rights is being lost. For example, some agencies are, cutting down on non-programme aid
interventions, such as support to civil society organizations and grassroots activities, because these are
perceived as difficult to design and manage. Yet, they are a central element of integrating human rights
into development cooperation in that they support the ability of rights-holders to become aware of, claim,
and enforce their rights.



Agencies are responding to this dilemma. For example, the German Development Bank commissioned
a study and portfolio analysis of the relevance of HRBAs for financial cooperation (Heinz 2006). Some
agencies have developed tools to ground their choice of aid modalities based on country analysis
encompassing human rights and governance (chapter 4). Research suggests that a mix of aid instruments
is desirable (Booth and Curran 2005). Programme aid must be viewed in the context of a range of
options: appropriate policy dialogue, technical advice, and capacity development support to enable
governments to identify and implement their national priorities. Finally, donors and governments need
to build effective accountability mechanisms that can help integrate human rights into aid initiatives.



IX.       ADOPTING A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL
          RIGHTS AND CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS




                                                                                                     194
Many donors focus interventions on particular rights or emphasize certain groups of rights. An emerging
challenge in development policy is how to promote a holistic and integrated approach to economic,
social, and cultural rights, on the one hand, and civil and political rights, on the other. Such an integrated
and comprehensive approach is important for legal and conceptual reasons, including the
interdependence, indivisibility, and interrelatedness of all rights, but also to secure the sustainability and
effectiveness of development interventions.



At USAID, human rights pose a couple challenges. One is avoiding the tendency to focus human rights
work primarily on issue groups or vulnerable groups within the Democracy, Human Rights, and
Governance sector, leading to a propensity to not think broadly enough about human rights as an
underpinning of the overall work, instead thinking in terms of specific groups or issues that may or may
not be relevant to a country context. The other is related to the challenge of addressing economic, social,
and cultural rights at the same time as working on civil and political rights. On the first challenge, USAID
has seen that too much emphasis on single human rights issues or vulnerable groups can have positive
and negative effects. On one hand, USAID’s increased attention to issues such as lesbian, gay, bisexual,
trans, and/or intersex rights, trafficking in persons, mass atrocities prevention, and the rights of
indigenous peoples has led to a number of important policies, projects, and tangible results that show
important USG leadership on key human rights issues. On the other hand, a heavy focus on those
priorities can give the false impression that those issues are USAID’s sole human rights priorities or
concerns. That focus can draw energy and attention away from efforts to mainstream human rights, to
advance a rights-based approach, or even implicit human rights work.



The second challenge is the tension of balancing economic, cultural, and social rights with civil and
political rights. USAID may provide technical assistance and other forms of support to help states protect
and respect their human rights obligations and to help non-state actors promote human rights across the
spectrum of economic, social, civil, and political rights. In the development context, USAID focuses on
the development priorities for the countries in which USAID works and designates governance and
capacity-building work critical to meeting international obligations and country-level development
objectives as the basis for programme design and implementation. In that context, USAID typically
defers to its field missions to identify the human rights issues most relevant in a country, taking into
account the specific obligations of the host government and the technical assistance needs related to the
rights’ protection, respect, and fulfilment.


                                                                                                         195
UNFPA’s work is guided by the International Conference on Population and Development’s prerogative
to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights in a holistic manner by going beyond a narrow
focus on economic, social, and cultural rights in the access to services or civil and political rights, in
particular to non-discrimination, the right to privacy and confidentiality, and the right to freedom of
association.



X.      POLICY COHERENCE




Policy coherence in the development context can be understood as “strengthening synergies and weeding
out inconsistencies between non-aid policies and development objectives” (European Commission
2011e). Policy coherence can promote effectiveness and efficiencies in aid allocations because it
minimizes duplication and ensures that policy efforts are not contradictory; it can also uphold a principle
of “do no harm” in development. The pursuit of policy coherence is consistent with the core aims and
principles of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA). The pursuit of coherence
is a useful exercise in assessing the impacts that a policy may have on other policies or individuals. It
can also add value: coherence across related and diverse policy arenas maximizes the potential for
synergies at a practical level (McInerney-Lankford 2009).



International treaties may provide a relevant reference point for policy coherence. The DAC notes that:



      The fact that both donor and partner countries have ratified the international human rights treaties
      provides a uniquely valuable reference point for harmonisation efforts. A mutually agreed,
      universal normative framework already exists, supported not only by political commitment, but
      also by the force of legal obligation. As well, at the operational level, there is growing convergence
      on the integration of human rights in development. (OECD 2007b)



The integration of human rights within development assistance is consistent with the need for donors to
improve the coherence of their aid with their other policies, an issue firmly on the DAC agenda. Indeed,


                                                                                                       196
human rights have traditionally been part of foreign policy; in a number of countries, ministries of
foreign affairs take the lead on human rights. Human rights often lack leverage on other ministries that
may implement policies of immediate relevance for overseas countries (e.g., defence or external trade).
Initiatives to use aid to pursue human rights objectives and to ensure that aid does not contribute to
human rights violations overseas may promote policy coherence.



The coherence challenge has been easier to overcome for agencies already working closely with (or
integrated into) ministries of foreign affairs. Other agencies have developed closer relationships or
worked more strategically with ministries of defence, trade, or the interior. The Austrian Development
Agency, for example, organized a training workshop on the protection of children’s rights in emergency
situations with the Austrian ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs.



Policy coherence has a role to play at the national level as well as at the international level. For example,
DFID distinguishes between two types of policy coherence: “coherence across UK government policies
and coherence within multilateral institutions such as the European Commission (EU)” (McInerney-
Lankford 2009). Likewise, Sweden reported that its policy for development co-operation “was not only
aiming to empower partner countries with increased budget support but was also promoting overall
coherence among policies within its own boundaries as well as in the recipient countries with a view to
contribute to the promotion and protection of human rights both domestically and internationally”
(Salomon, 2007).



WHO, OHCHR, and Sida developed a tool for supporting countries ensure policy coherence between
the design and implementation of national health sector strategies and their legal obligations and
commitments. The tool employs three assessment levels:

     Assessment Level 1: State obligations and commitments made on human rights and gender
        equality
     Assessment Level 2: Translating human rights and gender equality obligations and commitments
        in the national legal, policy, and institutional frameworks
     Assessment Level 3: Identifying human rights and gender equality obligations and commitments
        in national health sector strategies (WHO 2011a)



                                                                                                        197
A Council of Europe initiative can be considered in policy coherence terms, albeit domestically focused
on member states’ internal social and poverty reduction policies. In 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe issued a recommendation that its 47 member states should be guided by
OHCHR’s 2006 Principles and Guidelines on a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction in their
policymaking and budget decisions; the assembly assessed member states’ progress in 2013 (Council of
Europe 2011).




 Box 8.7

 Policy Coherence for Development in the EU

 Policy coherence is a long-established priority for EU development cooperation. This priority was
 reiterated in the 2006 European Consensus on Development and affirmed in Article 208 of the Lisbon
 Treaty, which requires the European Union to “take account of the objectives of development co -
 operation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries.” (Source:
 European Union, 2009)




To advance EU policy coherence, the European Commission Impact Assessment Guidelines require an
assessment of proposed new policies’ coherence with the objectives of EU development policy as well
as an assessment of their potential impact on developing countries. In May 2010, the European
Parliament created the Standing Rapporteur on Policy Coherence for Development, responsible for
facilitating interaction between the parliamentary committee on development and other committees.
Policy coherence for development focal points have also been appointed within the European
Commission (Directorates General) DGs and the External Action Service. In 2010, the European
Parliament (EP) adopted a resolution that encourages greater cooperation at multinational level between
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the main UN institutions in the human rights field. The EP
resolution considers that closer links with the OHCHR and with the special procedures would be
particularly useful to provide a multilateral trade framework which would enhance respect for human
rights; and considers, similarly, that the OHCHR’s expertise could be taken into account within WTO
panels and the appeals body when cases of serious breaches of human rights are observed. In addition,
the resolution mentions that the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review is a useful tool to
monitor compliance with human rights provisions in international trade agreements and supports the
practice of including legally binding human rights clauses in the EU’s international agreements.

                                                                                                     198
For the Netherlands, a key challenge is the integration of human rights across development cooperation
and trade and economic policy frameworks. Human rights constitute a separate pillar of foreign policy
and can be hard to incorporate in trade missions to countries where human rights are violated and in
development policy where the scope of work is broad and where the approach is to build on the local
context or endogenous developments rather than on principles. The Netherlands Ministry of Foreign
Affairs has a well-established routine of funding human rights projects at the country level and reporting
on human rights initiatives worldwide. The Dutch government has brought human rights considerations
down to the country level and established a feedback loop to both headquarters and to the UN human
rights mechanisms in Geneva.



In Switzerland, policy coherence with regard to human rights remains a priority for development
cooperation; challenges tend to arise when potential conflicts arise between human rights and other
spheres, such as economic affairs (trade agreements, arms exports) or engagement with multilateral
development banks. The Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA)’s human rights strategy
addresses and acknowledges the challenges of policy coherence with regard to human rights. Although
the current strategy is limited to the FDFA only, a future strategy will need to include other departments
to ensure policy coherence.



Despite the convergence between development cooperation objectives and human rights principles,
policy coherence is a challenge because of structural issues and divergences endemic to public
international law. Development policy frameworks and human rights obligations have generally evolved
on parallel tracks. Where integration has occurred, it more frequently entails the loose application of
human rights principles and language rather than legal obligations under internationally agreed upon
instruments (McInerney-Lankford 2009).




                                                                                                     199
This divergence is further complicated by the diverse array of international regulatory regimes that
exists, many with potential relevance for development—the international human rights framework being
just one of them. Trade and regional economic integration and cooperation represent a set of regimes
with distinct objectives and regulatory instruments. Another category of international regime pertains to
development issues, such as economic growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable development through
lending and technical assistance. International oversight of the environment and the protection of natural
resources occupy a separate realm. A fifth regime applies to security, cooperation, and humanitarian
affairs (Nordic Trust Fund 2011b). Although there are thematic overlaps among these regimes, each
possesses its own normative frameworks, procedures, institutions, and approaches. Understanding and
reconciling these multiple frameworks and their relevance to may present considerable challenges.



Even where convergence appears to be more intuitive, disconnects are evident. For instance, although
the Millennium Declaration references human rights, the MDGs and their correlating targets omit any
reference to human rights. Similarly, poverty reduction strategy papers, descriptions of policies, and
programmes that a country will pursue to promote growth and reduce poverty rarely incorporate rights
language or references to international human rights treaties (Stewart and Wang 2005).



XI.     FINDINGS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION




Donors face several challenges in further integrating human rights: institutionalizing the approach
internally within agencies; working on human rights issues positively with partner governments, in
particular in fragile states; and making sure that a HRBA influences the manner in which key issues on
aid effectiveness and new aid modalities are framed and understood. Moreover, questions remain about
what lessons can be learned from the MDG process and applied to the post–2015 development agenda.



With regard to the institutionalization of human rights policies, donors could more regularly share tools
and guidance documents and undertake joint training, rather than investing in them separately. Efforts
might include the following:



                                                                                                     200
     A knowledge management (and possibly advisory) centre for interested agencies could provide a
        helpful mechanism to enable agencies to learn more systematically from one another. Although
        the UN HRBA Portal serves as a useful online repository for documents and HuriTalk provides
        a platform for discussion about HRBA, neither performs analysis of case studies or a common
        template to facilitate comparative learning, potentially limiting their use for practitioners.
     Identification and documentation of examples of “do no harm” policies, possibly including past
        negative impacts and how they can be overcome, would demonstrate the value of the HRBA.
     To enhance donor accountability, codes of conduct for staff and project implementers could be
        developed. Complaint and redress mechanisms would allow beneficiaries to hold agencies to
        account. The area of human rights–related monitoring and evaluation requires more in-depth
        review. It would be helpful to see work providing more evidence of the impact of human rights
        on the achievement of development objectives (UNDG-HRM 2011) such as poverty reduction.
        This process might include the application of human rights indicators linked to the MDGs
        developed by organizations such as OHCHR (2008), UNDP (2006b), and UNFPA (UNFPA and
        Harvard 2010) to help document experiences, to measure the impact of human rights projects
        and mainstreaming initiatives, and to inform aid allocation and aid modality decisions (UNDG-
        HRM 2011).



To further promote human rights as part of nationally owned strategies, wider consultative processes are
needed. Parliamentarians (e.g., parliamentary human rights committees), national human rights
institution, national civil society organizations, and international nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) should be included to build wide ownership and draw on considerable country-based
experiences.



With regard to ways of delivering and managing aid, donors could document existing approaches to
using human rights to inform decisions on aid allocations and modalities. This documentation should
not be reduced to the use of selectivity and conditionality and should go beyond project-based aid. There
is much potential cross-fertilization with the fragile states agenda here.



Responding to Paragraph 42 of the Paris Declaration and Paragraph 13(c) of the AAA, donors should
continue to harmonize their approaches to human rights. DAC members could think about examining
the implementation of human rights policies in peer reviews so as to encourage the application of

                                                                                                         201
existing commitments and share good experiences.



The application and impact of conditionality have not been well researched; new approaches to aid
effectiveness and aid modalities create opportunities to revisit this area. Agreement on a set of principles
for the design and application of conditionality, along with improved understanding of partner countries’
political trajectories and how internal forces may respond to external pressures, would enhance donor
rationality when dealing with governance crises. Clear aims and objectives make it easier to be consistent
with predictability and partnership commitments. Conditions found in existing partner governments’
commitments should be used as much as possible, including constitutions, poverty reduction strategies,
and other national frameworks, as well as relevant international and regional human rights instruments.
Maintenance of minimum bottom lines, based on public commitments set in overall aid agreements, is
a prerequisite for principled actions by donors if all else fails. Experience suggests that, for consistency
of message and likelihood of impact, coordinated donor action and the use of multilateral channels are
essential.



It is increasingly recognized that donors can make better efforts to explore ways in which human rights
can be more explicitly linked to the important fragile states agenda. Various entry points, linked to the
Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States (OECD 2007c), demonstrate where and
how human rights could be made explicit and relevant. One promising approach is to use human rights
analysis as part of “understanding the context” and to adopt a “prevention mode” by focusing on the root
causes of state fragility. Use of the “do no harm” principle could be extended to both state capacity and
the fundamental rights of the population.



“Civilian protection” offers a way of responding to humanitarian crises or violent conflict. A new entry
point is the “responsibility to protect” as agreed to by UN member states at the 2005 World Summit (UN
2005a). Another fruitful option could be to consider the concept of human security (Commission on
Human Security 2003) in relation to fragile states and security agendas because it integrates a focus on
human dimensions and therefore human rights.



To promote more harmonized approaches, donors might wish to pilot human rights programming,
including policy dialogue, in a selected number of countries, for example, where UN and bilateral

                                                                                                       202
agencies have made most progress. This programming could range from collaborating more closely on
ongoing initiatives and documenting joint work to a more ambitious approach, where new work is
undertaken in the context of the enhanced harmonization of work toward human rights at the country
level.




                                                                                              203

      he past two decades have witnessed a convergence between human
      rights and development, most notable at the level of international
      political statements and policy commitments, such as the OECD
Development Assistance Committee’s 2007 Action Oriented Policy Paper
(“AOPP”), the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action and 2011 Busan Outcome Doc-
ument. In 2013 the “Vienna + 20” conference reiterated the connections
between human rights and development, reaffirming the right to devel-
opment and calling for the effective integration of human rights into the
Post-2015 Agenda. Along with the 2010 UN World Summit Outcome Docu-
ment, these statements paved the way for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and the 17 new SDGs. In the sphere of business and human
rights, the 2013 adoption of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights by the UN Human Rights Council, while of more indirect relevance to
donor policies, signalled a rapprochement between the worlds of finance
and investment on the one hand and human rights on the other. This third
edition of Integrating Human Rights into Development: Donor Approaches,
Experiences and Challenges consolidates the findings and research com-
piled in 2006 and 2012 with the key developments and experiences of the
intervening four years. It seeks to advance understanding of the nexus be-
tween development and human rights through a systematic consideration
of donor and IGO approaches to provide a comprehensive view of current
trends and thinking around human rights and development.
