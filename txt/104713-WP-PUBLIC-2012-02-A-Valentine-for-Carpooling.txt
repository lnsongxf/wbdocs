The World Bank Group Archives Exhibit Series contains exhibits originally
published on the Archives’ external website beginning in 2002. When the
Archives’ website was transferred to a new platform in 2015, it was decided that
older exhibits would be converted to pdf format and made available as a series
on the World Bank’s external database, Documents & Reports.

These exhibits, authored by World Bank archivists, highlight key events,
personalities, and publications in the history of the World Bank. They also bring
attention to some of the more fascinating archival records contained in the
Archives’ holdings.

To view current exhibits, visit the Exhibits page on the Archives’ website.
A Valentine for Carpooling?

To mark the month of February
and Valentine’s Day, the World
Bank Group Archives is
featuring a valentine poem
about carpooling written by
World Bank staff member,
Maurice Perkins, which first
appeared in the January /
February 1959 edition of
International Bank Notes, a
newsletter for staff.

This poem of collegial
camaraderie, and other stories
of the World Bank Group’s
passion for development and
poverty alleviation can be
found in the Archives. Find out
more about our holdings!

Happy Valentine’s Day from
