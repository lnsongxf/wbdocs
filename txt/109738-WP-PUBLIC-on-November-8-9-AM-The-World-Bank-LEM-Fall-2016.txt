the country to significant refinancing risks.

VI.     BdL policy interventions in the real
economy has provided critical support to the real
estate sector and, ultimately, to the banking sector
(Special Focus). As Lebanon’s economic landscape
came under duress following the eruption of the war
in Syria, the BdL introduced successive subsidized
lending packages targeting the real economy. The
real estate sector has been the largest beneficiary of
these packages. Nonetheless, preliminary evidence
suggests that, given current economic fundamentals,
the existing political paralysis, a volatile security
environment and spillovers from the Syrian conflict,
economic activity in Lebanon would have been more
sluggish in the absence of BdL’s policy interventions.

V.      Une reprise des importations de biens
associée à une régression des exportations devrait
creuser davantage un déficit des comptes courants
déjà important. La première moitié de 2016 a été
marquée par une croissance de 5 pour cent (par
rapport à l’année dernière) des importations de
marchandises, essentiellement les minéraux et les
métaux, alors que les exportations continuent à
être affectées par la fermeture, en mai 2015, de la
dernière route menant en Syrie, à travers laquelle les
exportateurs étaient capables d’accéder au marché du
CCG. Le déficit des échanges de biens qui se creuse
de plus en plus, devrait provoquer une détérioration
de la balance des comptes courants en 2016, pour
accuser un déficit de 19 pour cent du PIB, parmi les
plus grands du monde, ce qui expose le pays à des
risques de refinancement significatifs.

VI.      La politique d’intervention de la BdL
au niveau de l’économie réelle a apporté
un soutien d’envergure au secteur foncier, et
éventuellement au secteur bancaire (Intérêt
particulier). Vu que la situation économique
au Liban a été mise à rude épreuve depuis que la
guerre a éclaté en Syrie, la BdL a introduit des séries
successives de prêts bonifiés visant l’économie réelle.
Le secteur foncier en a été le plus grand bénéficiaire.
Toutefois, les preuves préliminaires montrent qu’au
vu de la situation économique actuelle, la paralysie
politique en place, un environnement sécuritaire qui
peut être instable, et les répercussions du conflit en
Syrie, l’activité économique au Liban aurait pu être
encore plus faible, sans la politique d’intervention de
la BdL.

                               BOX 1. Counting Syrian Refugees as Part of the Population Figures.


  The World Bank now counts Syrian refugees in Lebanon’s population estimates.* The national accounts
  published by Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) do not differentiate between refugee and non-refugee
  contributions to output, meaning that, de facto, GDP figures include the contribution of Syrian refugees to the
  formal economy. On the other hand, the majority of refugees work in the informal economy, with unregistered
  enterprises or lacking a work permit. As such, refugees’ principal contribution would be unaccounted for by the
  national accounts.

  Per capita growth has been on a decline. Table 1 below compares main macroeconomic indicators per capita when
  the refugees are excluded (panel I) and which until recently has been our working assumption, with the same per
  capita indicators but including Syrian refugees** (panel II). The sluggish economic growth that has been in effect
  since 2011, combined with the larger denominator (population), generates an 8.3 percent drop in real GDP per
  capita for the 2012-2015 period, for a total loss of US$ 726 million. This compares to an increase of 4.1 percent if
  the refugees are not counted. While this suggests that the average standard of living has worsened in Lebanon, the
  caveat remains that the full contribution of Syrian refugees is not captured since the bulk of it is concentrated in the
  informal economy. Hence, the above-estimated contraction in real GDP is exaggerated.

resident new private deposits (NRD) averaged 15
percent (Figure 14). These ratios have declined
sharply since, due primarily to the regional turmoil
and secondarily to the unsustainability of such
high levels. During the crisis period of 2011-2015,
however, TD and NRD shares of GDP fell to 5
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. Despite this
deterioration, Lebanon’s financial sector retains key
advantages. To begin with, exceptionally low global
interest rates warrant a reduction in Lebanon’s
rates. Furthermore, non-resident deposits, which
are largely sourced from Lebanese expatriates, are
resilient to shocks due to the diaspora’s familiarity
with the country’s political and security volatilities.
Additionally, the BdL has demonstrated its readiness
to be the ultimate guarantor of the financial sector
via its large foreign exchange reserves and good
crisis management overall.

27.      Absent significant structural reforms on
either revenue or spending, Lebanon’s public
finances are projected to remain structurally
weak. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to
continue widening over the medium term. Current
spending is projected to grow as a result of
increased debt servicing due to pass through from
higher global interest rates and higher oil prices that
will reflect on transfers to EdL. Moreover, assuming
political paralysis eases by 2017, we expect some
limited public sector wage increases. In addition,
and despite the expected return of positive inflation
in 2017, the trend for debt-to-GDP ratio based on
current policies and real GDP growth rates remains
unsustainable and is expected to notably worsen
once global dollar interest rates start normalizing (a
pace which is expected to start with a tightening of
policy rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board).

Water in Lebanon – Coupling Infrastructure with
Institutional Reform (Special Focus 3): Despite the
relative availability of water resources, the Lebanese
water sector has not achieved suitable levels of
service provision and is not in line with the level of
economic development reached by the country. The
cost of inaction in the water sector is estimated at
about 1.8 percent of GDP, or 2.8 percent of GDP if
the cost of environmental degradation is included.
Several factors have led to this situation and require
sustained attention. These include: (i) low continuity
of water supply due to small storage capacity, large
amount of water lost to the sea, growing demand for
water and deficiency of the existing water networks;
(ii) unfinished reform agenda that contributed
to institutional uncertainty and fragmentation
of functions particularly relating to wastewater
and irrigation; (iii) an irrigation sector that is
characterized by inadequate water storage capacity,
lack of proper maintenance and a heavy reliance on
subsidies; and (iv) regional water establishments
(RWE) that severely lack management and financial
autonomy and are impeded by limited inter-
agency coordination and weak central government
oversight. Moving forward, the Government must
urgently address priorities within the sector.
