Foreword




T
        he World Bank Group (WBG) is committed to the twin goals
        of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosper-
        ity. Although significant progress has been made, with global
poverty rates having declined to less than 10 percent for the first time
in history, childhood stunting—a leading measure of undernutrition
and overall ­ well-being—remains a silent emergency of a magnitude as
large as that of the AIDS epidemic: it affects 159 million children with
negative consequences including illness, deaths, learning outcomes,
poverty, and diminished productivity. The links between early child-
hood nutrition and human capital have been well recognized for some
time now. This report identifies a set of actions that, taken together,
could allow the world to reach the global nutrition targets for stunt-
ing, anemia in women, and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, as well
as scale up the treatment of severe wasting. Doing so would bring
many benefits to children’s nutrition in the immediate term, their
long-term health and well-being, and their future productivity as
vibrant adult members of society. Investing in this set of actions would
require almost $70 billion over 10 years from domestic resources, offi-
cial development assistance (ODA), and the private sector.

Unlike many other development investments, investments in nutrition
are durable, inalienable, and portable. Durable because investments
made during the critical 1,000 day window of opportunity last a life-
time without ever needing to be replenished. Inalienable and portable
because they belong to that child no matter what and wherever she or
he goes. Even more important are the findings in this report that these
investments in nutrition are among the best in development, with a
return of between $4 and $35 for every $1 invested.

This report identifies ways to raise the needed financial resources
to scale up actions to address the global targets. It will be vital to
combine traditional financing—ranging from additional domestic
government and ODA resources to reallocating existing government
resources from less cost-effective investments to highly effective
investments in nutrition—with innovative financing mechanisms such

as the Power of Nutrition and the Global Financing Facility in Support
of Every Woman, Every Child.

The time for action is now. Let us come together as an international
community and drive down malnutrition. Childhood years are lim-
ited, and each day that passes without action to address stunting and
improve other nutrition outcomes diminishes the growth and prosper-
ity of countries around the world.

A benefit-cost ratio summarizes the overall value of a project or pro-
posal. It is the ratio of the benefits of a project or proposal, expressed
in monetary terms, relative to its costs, also expressed in monetary
terms. The benefit-cost ratio takes into account the amount of mon-
etary gain realized by implementing a project versus the amount it
costs to execute the project. The higher the ratio, the better the invest-
ment. A general rule is that if the benefit from a project is greater than
its cost, the project is a good investment.

Capacity development for program delivery is a process that
involves increasing in-country human capacity and systems to design,
deliver, manage, and evaluate large-scale interventions (World Bank
2010). This includes developing skills by training public health per-
sonnel and community volunteers to improve the delivery of services.
These efforts typically accompany program implementation or, when
possible, precede program implementation. In this analysis we allo-
cate 9 percent of total programmatic costs to capacity development for
program delivery.

Cost-benefit analysis is an approach to economic analysis that weighs
the cost of an intervention against its benefits. The approach involves
assigning a monetary value to the benefits of an intervention and esti-
mating the expected present value of the net benefits, known as the
net present value. Net benefits are the difference between the cost and
monetary value of benefits of the intervention. The net present value
is defined mathematically as:

                                           T
                                                 Ct
                     Net present value =    (1 + r) – C
                                           t=1
                                                      t   0




where Ct is net cash inflows, C0 is the initial investment, the index t
is the time period, and r is the discount rate. A positive net present
value, when discounted at appropriate rates, indicates that the pres-
ent value of cash inflows (benefits) exceeds the present value of cash
outflows (cost of financing). Interventions with net present values that

Glossary of Technical Terms	                                            xix
are at least as high as alternative interventions provide greater ben-
efits than interventions with net present values equal to or lower than
alternatives. The results of cost-benefit analysis can also be expressed
in terms of the benefit-cost ratio.

Cost-effectiveness analysis is an approach to economic analysis that
is intended to identify interventions that produce the desired results at
the lowest cost. Cost-effectiveness analysis requires two components:
the total cost of the intervention and an estimate of the intervention’s
impact, such as the number of lives saved. The cost-effectiveness ratio
can be defined as:

                       Cost-effectiveness ratio =
             total cost of implementing the intervention
           impact of the intervention on a specific outcome

The analysis involves comparing the cost-effectiveness ratios among
alternative interventions with the same outcomes. The intervention
with the lowest cost per benefit is considered to be the most cost-effec-
tive intervention among the alternatives.

A DALY is a disability-adjusted life year, which is equivalent to a
year of healthy life lost due to a health condition. The DALY, devel-
oped in 1993 by the World Bank, combines the years of life lost from
a disease (YLL) and the years of life spent with disability from the
disease (YLD). DALYs count the gains from both mortality (how many
more years of life lost due to premature death are prevented) and
morbidity (how many years or parts of years of life lost due to disabil-
ity are prevented). An advantage of the DALY is that it is a metric that
is recognized and understood by external audiences such as the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institutes of Health
(NIH). It helps to gauge the contribution of individual diseases rela-
tive to the overall burden of disease by geographic region or health
area. Combined with cost data, DALYs allow for estimating and
comparing the cost-effectiveness of scaling up nutrition interventions
in different countries.

A discount rate refers to a rate of interest used to determine the
current value of future cash flows. The concept of the time value of
money suggests that income earned in the present is worth more than
the same amount of income earned in the future because of its earn-
ing potential. A higher discount rate reflects higher losses to potential


xx   	                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
benefits from alternative investments in capital. A higher discount rate
may also reflect a greater risk premium of the intervention.

The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is an estimation tool that translates
measured coverage changes into estimates of mortality reduction
and cases of childhood stunting averted. LiST is used to project how
increasing intervention coverage would impact child and maternal
survival. It is part of an integrated set of tools that comprise the Spec-
trum policy modeling system.

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E), operations research, and techni-
cal support for program delivery are all elements of cost-effective
and efficient program implementation. Monitoring involves check-
ing progress against plans through the systematic and routine col-
lection of information from projects and programs in order to learn
from experience to improve practices and activities in the future, to
ensure internal and external accountability of the resources used and
the results obtained, and to make informed decisions on the future of
the intervention. Monitoring is a periodically recurring task. Evalua-
tion is the assessing, as systematically and objectively as possible, of
a completed project or intervention (or a phase of an ongoing project).
Operations research aims to inform the program designers about
ways to deliver interventions more effectively and efficiently. Techni-
cal support entails ensuring that training, support, and maintenance
for the physical elements of the intervention are available. In this cost-
ing exercise we allocate 2 percent of total intervention costs for M&E,
operations research, and technical support.

Nutrition-sensitive interventions are those that have an indirect
impact on nutrition and are delivered through sectors other than
health such as the agriculture, education, and water, sanitation, and
hygiene sectors. Examples include biofortification of food crops,
conditional cash transfers, and water and sanitation infrastructure
improvements.

Nutrition-specific interventions are those that address the immediate
determinants of child nutrition, such as adequate food and nutrition
intake, feeding and caregiving practices, and treating disease. Exam-
ples include promotion of good infant and young child nutrition,
micronutrient supplementation, and deworming.

ODA refers to official development assistance and similar kinds of
aid. This comprises aid from bilateral assistance agencies (and the

Glossary of Technical Terms	                                             xxi
high-income countries to which they belong), multilateral organiza-
tions (such as the development banks), and a wide variety of chari-
table institutions (including large international nongovernmental

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the robustness of
findings when key variables change. It helps to identify the variables
with the greatest and least influence on the outcomes of the interven-
tion, and it may involve adjusting the values of a variable to observe
the impact of the variable on the outcome.

Stunting is an anthropometric measure of low height-for-age. It is
an indicator of chronic undernutrition and is the result of prolonged
food deprivation and/or disease or illness. It is measured in terms of
Z-score (or standard deviation score); a child is considered stunted
with a height-for-age Z-score of −2 or lower.

Underweight is an anthropometric measure of low weight-for-age.
It is used as a composite indicator to reflect both acute and chronic
undernutrition, although it cannot distinguish between them. It is
measured in terms of Z-score (or standard deviation score); a child is
considered underweight with a weight-for-age Z-score of −2 or lower.

Wasting is an anthropometric indicator of low weight-for-height. It is
an indicator of acute undernutrition and the result of more recent food
deprivation or illness. It is measured in terms of Z-score (or standard
deviation score). A child with a weight-for-height Z-score of −2 or
lower is considered wasted.

Executive Summary




I
    n 2015, 159 million children under the age of five were chronically
    malnourished or stunted, underscoring a massive global health
    and economic development challenge (UNICEF, WHO, and World
Bank 2015). In 2012—in an effort to rally the international community
around improving nutrition—the 176 members of the World Health
Assembly endorsed the first-ever global nutrition targets, focusing on
six areas: stunting, anemia, low birthweight, childhood overweight,
breastfeeding, and wasting. These targets aim to boost investments in
cost-effective interventions, spearhead better implementation prac-
tices, and catalyze progress toward decreasing malnutrition. Some of
the targets (stunting and wasting) are further enshrined within the
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2), which com-
mits to ending malnutrition in all its forms by the year 2030.



Nutrition Targets: Investment Case
and Constraints
Ending malnutrition is critical for economic and human development.
Childhood stunting, an overarching measure of long-term malnutri-
tion, has life-long consequences not just for health, but also for human
capital and economic development, prosperity, and equity. Being
stunted in early childhood reduces schooling attainment, decreases
adult wages, and makes children less likely to escape poverty as
adults (Fink et al. 2016; Hoddinott et al. 2008; Hoddinott et al. 2011;
Martorell et al. 2010). Conversely, reductions in stunting are estimated
to potentially increase overall economic productivity, as measured
by GDP per capita, by 4 to 11 percent in Africa and Asia (Horton and
Steckel 2013). Thus nutrition interventions are consistently identified
as one of the most cost-effective development actions (Horton and
Hoddinott 2014). Furthermore, investments in early nutrition yield
permanent and inalienable benefits.

Although the investment case for nutrition is strong, efforts to reach
the nutrition SDG targets are constrained by a range of factors

including insufficient financing, complexity in terms of implemen-
tation (that is, how to bridge disciplines and sectoral borders), and
determining the methods and costs (both financial and human
resources) involved in monitoring SDG targets. In relation to nutri-
tion’s contribution to this whole-of-society approach to develop-
ment, these challenges are exacerbated because of the major gaps in
knowledge regarding the costs and resources required for scaling up
these interventions. Two earlier studies have estimated the total costs
of scaling up nutrition interventions (Bhutta et al. 2013; Horton et al.
2010). However, those studies estimate the cost of a comprehensive
package of evidence-based interventions affecting child undernutri-
tion at large but do not focus on achieving specific outcomes (see
chapter 1 in the full report for a discussion of these studies). Fur-
thermore, neither of these studies provides estimates of the costs of
reaching the global nutrition targets, including the SDG targets. In
addition, no previous study has systematically linked the costs with
the potential for impact and the interventions’ returns on invest-
ment, nor assessed the financing shortfall between what is required
and what is currently being spent at the global level. Finally, no prior
study has presented a comprehensive global analysis of domestic
financing from governments and official development assistance
(ODA). This report aims to close these knowledge gaps by providing

a more comprehensive estimate of costs as well as financing needs,
linking them both to expected impacts, and laying out a potential
financing framework. An in-depth understanding of current nutrition
investments, future needs and their impacts, and ways to mobilize the
required funds is included to move the agenda from a political com-
mitment to a policy imperative.



Estimated Financing Needs
These analyses estimate financing needs for the targets for stunting,
anemia in women, exclusive breastfeeding for infants, and wast-
ing among young children. The analyses are not able to estimate the
financing needs to achieve the wasting target, mainly because of a lack
of sufficient evidence on interventions to prevent wasting. Instead,
the analyses estimate costs for the scale-up of the treatment of severe
wasting. Two of the global nutrition targets—those for low birth-
weight and for child overweight—are not included in these analyses
because there are insufficient data either on the prevalence of the
condition (low birthweight) or consensus on effective interventions to
reach the goal (child overweight).

The expected effects of the proposed interventions on the prevalence
of stunting among children, anemia in women, and rates of exclusive
breastfeeding for infants are estimated, along with their impacts on

Executive Summary	                                                                                         xxv
mortality. Benefit-cost analyses are conducted for each intervention,
translating the results into benefits in relation to stunting and anemia
cases prevented, increased numbers of children breastfed, cases of
wasting treated, lives saved, and potential earnings gained over adult
working life. Issues of technical and allocative efficiency as they relate
to the implementation of scaling-up efforts are also addressed.

This report finds that an additional investment of $70 billion over
10 years is needed to achieve the global targets for stunting, anemia
in women, exclusive breastfeeding and the scaling up of the treatment
of severe wasting. The expected impact of this increased investment
is enormous: 65 million cases of stunting and 265 million cases of ane-
mia in women would be prevented in 2025 as compared with the 2015
baseline. In addition, at least 91 million more children under five years
of age would be treated for severe wasting and 105 million additional
babies would be exclusively breastfed during the first six months of
life over 10 years. Altogether, investing in interventions to reach these
targets would also result in at least 3.7 million child deaths averted.

In an environment of constrained resources, if the world could not
afford the $70 billion needed to achieve the targets but instead could
invest in only a subset of interventions, it would have to set priori-
ties. In this context, this report recommends that investments should
kick-off with scaling up interventions with the highest returns (that
is, those that maximize allocative efficiency) and those that are scal-
able now (that is, those that maximize technical efficiency), with the
strong caveat that scaling up only this priority set of interventions
would not achieve the global targets. Financing this more limited set
of actions will require an additional investment of $23 billion over the
next 10 years. When combined with other health and poverty reduc-
tion efforts, this priority investment approach could still yield signifi-
cant returns: an estimated 2.2 million lives would be saved and there
would be 50 million fewer cases of stunting in 2025 than in 2015.

In terms of financing sources—as with other areas that the SDGs aim
to address—a mix of domestic on-budget allocations from country
governments combined with ODA, and newly emerging innovative
financing mechanisms coupled with household contributions, could
finance the remaining gap. This underscores again the extent to which
a whole-of-society effort is needed for financing the achievement of
the nutrition targets in the context of the broader sustainable devel-
opment goals; this mix of financing is also in line with other SDG
challenges.

Box ES.1: A Big Bang for the Buck: The Benefits
of Investing in Nutrition
With many competing development objectives, the main chal-
lenge for policy makers is to decide which actions should be
prioritized. One way to do this is to compare benefit-cost ratios
across interventions and programs. Even though methodolo-
gies differ across studies (see Alderman, Behrman, and Puett
2016 for detailed discussion of these differences), there is a
strong body of evidence that shows very high economic returns
to investing in nutrition (Alderman, Behrman and Puett 2016;
Copenhagen Consensus Center 2015; Hoddinott et al. 2013).
The analyses in this report support that conclusion and report
benefit-cost ratios well above 1, the breakeven point, under a
range of assumptions (see the figure in this box). The benefits of
investments to increase rates of exclusive breastfeeding are par-
ticularly high: $35 in returns for every dollar invested. Not only
are investments in nutrition one of the best value-for-money
development actions, they also lay the groundwork for the suc-
cess of investments in other sectors.

These analyses also confirm the high returns on investment that come
from investing in nutrition among children and women. Not only
do investments in nutrition make one of the best value-for-money
development actions, they also lay the groundwork for the success of
investments in other sectors.

Achieving the targets is within reach if partners work together to
immediately step up in investments in nutrition. Indeed, some coun-
tries (Peru, Senegal, and others) have shown that rapid scale-up of
nutrition interventions can be achieved and lead to swift declines in
stunting rates (see chapter 9 for a discussion of country achievements
in reducing malnutrition).



Key Recommendations
	1.	The world needs $70 billion over 10 years to invest in high-
    impact nutrition-specific interventions in order to reach the global
    targets for stunting, anemia in women, and exclusive breastfeed-
    ing for infants and to scale up the treatment of severe wasting
    among young children.

     Although $7 billion a year may seem to be a large investment, it
     pales in comparison to the $500 billion per year (nearly $1.5 billion/
     day) that is currently spent on agriculture subsidies (Potter 2014)
     and the $543 billion per year (over $1.5 billion/day) spent on fossil
     fuel subsidies (International Energy Agency 2014), or $19 billion
     per year on HIV-AIDS (UNAIDS 2016).

     The nutrition-specific investments presented in this report are
     expected to have large benefits: 65 million cases of stunting and
     265 million cases of anemia in women would be prevented in 2025
     as compared with the 2015 baseline. In addition, at least 91 million
     more children would be treated for severe wasting and 105 million
     additional babies would be exclusively breastfed during the first
     six months of life over 10 years. Altogether, achieving these targets
     would avert at least 3.7 million child deaths. And, every dollar
     invested in this package of interventions would yield between $4
     and $35 in economic returns. This is in line with previous studies
     suggesting returns of $18 (Hoddinott et al. 2013).

	2.	Recent experience from several countries suggests that meeting
    these targets is feasible, although some of the targets—especially

xxviii   	                                An Investment Framework for Nutrition
    those for reducing stunting in children and anemia in women—are
    ambitious and will require concerted efforts in financing, scale-
    up, and sustained commitment. On the other hand, the target for
    exclusive breastfeeding has scope to be much more ambitious.

	3.	Some areas of future research need to be prioritized. These
    include:
    Research on scalable strategies for delivering high-impact inter-
    ventions is necessary, including how to address bottlenecks
    to scaling up, for example through results-based budgeting
    approaches or other ways of incentivizing results. Such research
    will not only facilitate faster scale-up, but it would also have the
    potential to increase the technical efficiency and delivery costs for
    these interventions, thereby reducing the global financing needs.

    Another critical area for future research is the assessment of
    allocative efficiency—that is, identifying the optimum funding
    allocation among different interventions or an allocation that
    maximizes the impact under a specific budget constraint. The
    present analyses show cost per outcome, allowing for only limited
    comparisons of cost-effectiveness among different interventions
    for the same targets.

    Research to improve the technical efficiency of nutrition spending
    is also urgently needed. This includes identifying new strategies
    for addressing complex nutritional problems such as stunting
    and anemia, as well as technologies to help take these solutions to
    scale more rapidly and at lower cost. Because of the multifactorial
    nature of anemia, research is under way to clearly determine what
    fraction of the problem can be addressed by nutrition interven-
    tions; the estimates presented in this report may need to be revised
    accordingly once results become available. Additionally, some
    micronutrient deficiencies are not included here (i.e., iodine defi-
    ciencies), because these were not included in the global targets,
    even though they have significant impacts on morbidity, mortality,
    and economic productivity.

    Strengthening the quality of surveillance data, unit cost data for
    interventions in different country contexts, and building stronger
    data collection systems for estimating current investments in
    nutrition (from both domestic governments and ODA) are also
    crucial. Further research is needed on the costs of interventions

An Investment Framework for Nutrition
    such as maternity protection to support women in the workforce
    so they can exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months.
    In addition, significant resources will be required to build a living
    database of current investments, including closely monitoring
    spending and ensuring accountability, and to undertake national-
    level public expenditure reviews.

    A dedicated effort to understanding which interventions prevent
    wasting is urgently needed. It is also essential to learn more about
    cost-effective strategies for managing moderate acute malnutri-
    tion, and whether or not these can contribute toward the preven-
    tion of wasting.

    More evidence is needed on the costs and impacts of nutrition-
    sensitive interventions—that is, interventions that improve
    nutrition through agriculture, social protection, and water and
    sanitation sectors, among others. It is evident that stunting, as
    well as anemia, are multifactorial and can be improved through
    increasing quality, diversity, and affordability of foods, increasing
    the control of income by women farmers, and also by reducing
    exposure to fecal pathogens by improved water, sanitation, and
    hygiene practices. However, the attributable fraction of the burden
    that can be addressed by these interventions is unknown. The last
    five years have seen a proliferation of studies to improve clarity on
    these issues, as well as on the use of social programs as a platform
    for reaching the most vulnerable. Future work in this area should
    take into account such new evidence as studies are published.



Call to Action
As the world stands at the cusp of the new SDGs, with global pov-
erty rates having declined to less than 10 percent for the first time in
history (World Bank 2016), there is an unprecedented opportunity
to save children’s lives, build future human capital and gray-matter
infrastructure, and provide equal opportunity for all children to drive
faster economic growth. These investments in the critical 1,000 day
window of early childhood are inalienable and portable and will pay
lifelong dividends—not only for the children directly affected but also
for us all in the form of more robust societies—that will drive future
economies.

   Key Messages
   •	    In 2015, 159 million children globally were stunted in their
         physical and cognitive development, yielding poor learning
         outcomes and, eventually, premature death and disabil-
         ity with significant long-term economic consequences for
         future work forces in already constrained economies.
   •	    Low- and middle-income countries, mainly in Sub-Saharan
         Africa and South Asia, bear most of the burden of poor
         nutrition outcomes; stunting prevalence rates exceed
         30 percent in these two regions, albeit some middle-income
         countries in other regions, such as China, Guatemala, Indo-
         nesia, and Mexico, also carry high burdens.
   •	    These losses are largely preventable with adequate invest-
         ments in proven interventions targeting the critical first
         1,000 days of a child’s life, from the beginning of a woman’s
         pregnancy to her child’s second birthday.
   •	    Stunting and other forms of malnutrition can be a life sen-
         tence, but these must not be accepted as the “new normal.”
         Although political commitment is growing rapidly for
         investing in the 1,000-day window of opportunity, more is
         needed to move this agenda from a pet cause to a common

             cause and from a political imperative to an economic
             imperative.
        •	   To galvanize action on these issues, in 2012 the World
             Health Assembly set the first-ever global targets for nutri-
             tion. These focus on six areas: stunting, anemia, exclusive
             breastfeeding, wasting, low birthweight, and overweight;
             the first four of these are the focus of this report.
        •	   This report adds to previous work in three ways: by provid-
             ing a more comprehensive estimate of financing needs,
             by linking financing needs to impacts, and by laying out
             a potential financing framework for four of the six global
             nutrition targets.
        •	   Given the right investments in “gray-matter infrastructure”
             at the right time, every child can achieve her or his full
             potential. The payoffs from these investments are durable,
             portable, and inalienable. An in-depth understanding of
             current nutrition investments, future needs, their impacts,
             and ways to mobilize the required financing is essential.




Objectives of the Report
This report aims to close remaining knowledge gaps related to the
financing needs, impacts, and financing of nutrition interventions by:


•	 estimating investments needed to achieve the global targets for
   reducing stunting in children under five, reducing anemia in
   women, increasing the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
   among infants; and mitigating the impacts of wasting among
   young children by estimating the financing needs to scale up
   treatment of severe wasting;

•	 linking financing needs with potential for impact for the first
   time; and

•	 proposing a financing framework for mobilizing the needed
   resources.

Why Invest in Nutrition?
With so many competing priorities, policy makers naturally ask why
they should invest in nutrition. Current estimates suggest that all
forms of malnutrition (undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and
overweight) cost the global economy an estimated $3.5 trillion per
year, or $500 per individual, creating a major impediment for country
governments in their efforts to reduce poverty and create thriving and
productive communities (Global Panel 2016). Unlike investments in
physical infrastructure, investments intended to reduce malnutrition
(box 1.1) generate benefits that are durable, inalienable, and por-
table. These investments also fuel progress on all of the 17 develop-
ment goals enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
including education and alleviating poverty. Why is this so? Ensuring
optimum nutrition—particularly early in life—can permanently alter
an individual’s development trajectory and maximize her or his pro-
ductive potential.

Globally, over 2 billion individuals are malnourished (IFPRI 2016).
They include 159 million children who are stunted (low height-for-
age), which affects not only their physical but also their cognitive
development (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2015). Each year,
undernutrition accounts for about 45 percent of all child deaths
worldwide (Black et al. 2013). Undernourished children who sur-
vive often suffer serious cognitive delays (Grantham-McGregor et al.
2007), yielding poor learning outcomes and schooling deficits. Ulti-
mately, the consequences of undernutrition are premature death and




   Box 1.1: What Is Malnutrition?
   The term malnutrition encompasses both undernutrition and
   overnutrition. Undernutrition is commonly measured by inade-
   quate height-for-age (stunting), by inadequate weight-for-height
   (wasting), or by deficiencies in micronutrients such as vitamin A,
   iodine, zinc, and iron. Overnutrition is often measured as exces-
   sive weight-for-height (overweight and obesity) using growth
   reference standards for children and body mass index measure-
   ments (weight-for-height squared, or kg/m2) for adults.

d
­ isability—along with the loss of creative and intellectual energy (Lye
2016). These outcomes are compounded by billions in economic losses
due to excess health care spending and lower productivity. Thus
investments in nutrition provide an opportunity not only to improve
nutrition indicators, but also to contribute to achievement of other
goals, such as increasing school completion, raising adult wages, help-
ing children escape poverty, and increasing national gross domestic
product (figure 1.1).

Fortunately, these losses are largely preventable if adequate invest-
ments in proven interventions are made, particularly those that focus
on ensuring optimum nutrition in the critical 1,000 day window
between the start of a woman’s pregnancy and her child’s second
birthday (Black et al. 2008, 2013; World Bank 2006). Not only do these
investments improve the nutritional status of a population for a life-
time (see box 1.2), but they can also stimulate gains in the efficiency
of health and education spending and trigger productivity gains that
further accelerate economic growth.

Stunting and other forms of malnutrition can be a life sentence; they
must not be accepted as the “new normal.” Although political com-
mitment is growing rapidly for investing in the 1,000-day window of
opportunity, more is needed to move this agenda from a pet cause to a
common cause, and from a political imperative to an economic impera-
tive. Given the right investments in “gray-matter infrastructure” at the
right time, every child can achieve her or his full potential. And the
payoffs from these investments are durable, portable, and inalienable.

    Box 1.2: Gray Matter Infrastructure: Early Childhood
    Nutrition as a Determinant of Lifelong Cognitive
    Development
    “Just as a weak foundation compromises the quality and strength of a
    house, adverse experiences early in life can impair brain architecture,
    with negative effects lasting into adulthood” (Huebner et al. 2016).




    “Neural connections are made at a significant speed in a child’s early
    years, and the quality of these connections is affected by the child’s
    environment, including nutrition, interaction with caregivers and
    exposure to adversity, or toxic stress” (Huebner et al. 2016).



Stunting (low height-for-age) is the leading population measure of
chronic undernutrition and has been included as a key indicator under
the SDGs (Target 2.2).1 Moreover, stunting is a remarkable proxy for
exposure to a host of early life behavioral and environmental insults
that limit children’s overall potential. Childhood stunting has life-
long consequences not just for health but also for cognitive function,
human capital, poverty, and equity; these early deficits reverberate
across generations (Victora et al. 2010). Importantly, malnutrition often
exists in an inter-generational cycle, and malnourished mothers are
more than twice as likely to have stunted children as well-nourished
mothers (Ozaltin, Hill, and Subramanian 2010).2 Widespread evidence
from a range of settings and using diverse empirical approaches indi-
cates that malnutrition leads to reductions in schooling and in learn-
ing per year of school, ultimately resulting in lower earnings. Being
stunted in early childhood is associated with a delayed start at school
(Daniels and Adair 2004), reduced schooling attainment (Fink et al.
2016; Martorell et al. 2010), and substantially decreased adult wages

 Stunting is defined among children under five years of age as being of a height that is more than
two standard deviations below the median height for a child of the same age and sex (height-for-age
Z-score <–2) according to the WHO Growth Standard (WHO 2009).
The term malnourished mothers uses maternal short stature (<145 cm) as an indicator of maternal
2

malnutrition.

when measured at both the individual (Hoddinott et al. 2008) and
country level (Fink et al. 2016). One study found that young children
who were stunted were 33 percent less likely to escape poverty as
adults (Hoddinott et al. 2011). These consequences add up to overall
GDP losses of 4 to 11 percent in Africa and Asia (Horton and Steckel
2013) (figure 1.1). Thus the direct nutrition interventions that can miti-
gate the burden of stunting are consistently identified as being among
the most cost-effective development and global health actions (Horton
and Hoddinott 2014).

Wasting (low weight-for-height) occurs when children lose weight
rapidly, generally from low caloric intakes and/or repeated infec-
tions.3 Wasting is an indicator of acute undernutrition. It can result
from ongoing food insecurity in resource-poor settings involving
insufficient diets in terms of quantity, quality, and diversity; subop-
timal breastfeeding; and recurrent episodes of illness—for example,
diarrhea (WHO 2014b). At the same time, children living through
humanitarian crises, such as famine and complex emergencies, are
particularly vulnerable to acute malnutrition. Wasting and infection
can create a vicious cycle, whereby acute malnutrition leads to lower
immune function, which increases susceptibility to infections and
subsequently results in decreased appetite, nutrient malabsorption,
elevated metabolic requirements, and undernutrition (WHO 2014b).
Consequently, wasted children have roughly twice the risk of mor-
tality as stunted children (WHO 2014b), and severely wasted chil-
dren have an 11-fold increase in mortality risk when compared with
healthy children (McDonald et al. 2013). More details are provided in
chapter 6.

Micronutrient deficiencies (sometimes referred to as “hidden hun-
ger”) affect nearly 2 billion people worldwide. Deficiencies of iodine,
iron, vitamin A, zinc, and folic acid are those most commonly identi-
fied in populations and have significant impacts on health and human
capital.


•	 Iodine deficiency is one of the main preventable causes of cogni-
   tive impairment among children. Maternal iodine deficiency, in
   particular, has grave consequences for fetal development and

 Wasting is defined for children under five years of age as being of a weight that is more than two
standard deviations below the median weight for a child of the same height and sex (weight-for-
height Z-score <−2) according to the WHO Growth Standard (WHO 2009).

    child intelligence quotient (IQ). Children born to mothers who
    were iodine deficient during pregnancy experience, on average,
    a loss of 12.5 to 13.5 IQ points (Bleichrodt and Born 1994; Qian
    et al. 2005). Iodine-deficient children lose 13 IQ points on aver-
    age, making them less educable (World Bank 2006).

•	 Iron deficiency is one of the most common direct epidemiologi-
   cal causes of anemia globally, albeit isolated infections (espe-
   cially helminthic infections) and repeated infections as a conse-
   quence of poor hygiene also have a key role to play in anemia,
   as do other factors. Given the multifactorial nature of anemia,
   research is underway to clarify what fraction of the problem can be
   addressed by nutrition interventions. Although anemia can affect
   anyone, children and women of reproductive age in low- and
   middle-income countries are at the greatest risk.4 Anemia is a
   major contributor to maternal and perinatal mortality as well as
   low birthweight among children. The morbidity associated with
   anemia in working-age adults can lead to lower work productiv-
   ity as a result of both impaired cognitive functioning and risk of
   infection. Furthermore, iron deficiency anemia has been associ-
   ated with developmental deficits and delayed brain maturation
   in children under age three (Walker et al. 2011). Supplementation
   for pregnant women with iron and folate has been linked with
   improvements in cognition of the offspring at seven to nine years
   (Christian et al. 2010). More details are provided in chapter 4.

•	 Vitamin A deficiency in childhood is a leading risk factor
   for morbidity, including preventable pediatric blindness, and
   mortality in low-income countries. Vitamin A deficiency results
   from insufficient dietary consumption of vitamin A–rich foods
   (including animal flesh foods, liver, and green leafy vegetables)
   and is often exacerbated by illness (WHO 2010). Vitamin A
   deficiency increases the severity of measles and diarrheal and
   malaria infections in childhood. Conversely, vitamin A supple-
   mentation for children is linked to a 23 percent reduction in child
   mortality (Beaton et al. 1993).

•	 Zinc plays a pivotal role in immune function and growth. Zinc
   deficiency is associated with increased incidence, severity, and

 The current World Health Organization thresholds for mild, moderate, and severe anemia are
110–119, 80–109, and <80 grams of hemoglobin per liter for non-pregnant women and 100–109, 70–99
and <70 grams for pregnant women (WHO 2011).

        duration of diarrhea and, as recent evidence demonstrates, has a
        negative effect on child growth (Imdad and Bhutta 2011).

•	 Folic acid deficiency in mothers before or during pregnancy can
   lead to serious neural tube defects in their infants, resulting in
   cognitive and developmental delays. Folic acid supplementation
   reduces the risk of neural tube defects by over 70 percent (Bhutta
   et al. 2013). However, delivery mechanisms for supplementation
   have proven challenging, particularly for non-pregnant women
   of reproductive age.

Exclusive breastfeeding (defined as the practice of giving an infant
only breastmilk for the first six months of life, with no other food,
other liquids, or even water) has many widely known benefits. How-
ever, in reality, social, societal, and environmental factors make this
practice challenging for millions of mothers globally. Near full scale-
up of exclusive breastfeeding practices could prevent 823,000 annual
deaths in children under five years (Victora et al. 2016). Non-breastfed
children are nearly three to four times more likely to die of illnesses
in the first six months, and there is overwhelming evidence of the
positive effects of breastfeeding in preventing pneumonia and diar-
rhea in young children (Victora et al. 2016). Recent evidence shows
that breastfeeding is also associated with higher IQs (Horta, Loret de
Mola, and Vitora 2015) and, in the longer term, with enhanced labor
market and economic outcomes (Lutter 2016; Rollins et al. 2016). The
existence of pro-breastfeeding policies and supportive environments
to protect breastfeeding as the best source of nutrition for infants is far
from universal, making promotion of exclusive breastfeeding an even
greater challenge. More details are provided in chapter 5.



Global Response
Over time, malnutrition rates have not declined fast enough, mainly
because of the lack of global action and investment in evidence-based
solutions. However, global consensus regarding the essential role
of nutrition in achieving sustainable development is growing (fig-
ure 1.2). Supported by a solid and growing evidence base regarding
what works to address malnutrition, key actors have gradually come
to recognize the importance of investing in nutrition. In 2000, ending
hunger in all its forms was included in the Millennium Development
Goals. A seminal 2006 World Bank report, Repositioning Nutrition as
Central to Development, further galvanized world leaders to recognize

nutrition as a critical element of the global development agenda. The
2008 Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition builds on an
earlier estimate of the impact of nutrition interventions on child mor-
tality (Jones et al. 2003) and provides answers to what interventions
could have the maximum impact. This was followed by Scaling-Up
Nutrition: What Will It Cost?, which was the first-ever effort to estimate
the financing needs of scaling up key nutrition interventions (Horton
et al. 2010), and then another Lancet Series on Maternal and Child
Nutrition in 2013 (Bhutta et al. 2013).

Armed with improved knowledge and increased global commitment,
the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement was launched jointly at the
World Bank in 2010 with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID,
and the governments of Japan and Canada. The political commitment
raised by the SUN movement led to greater demand for investments
in nutrition and a greater response from development partners and
governments. In this same year, the 1,000 Days movement began,
advocating for action and investment in nutrition for women and chil-
dren in the critical days from conception until a child is two years old.
As of 2016, the SUN network includes 57 client countries supported by
over 100 partners from bilateral agencies, academia, and businesses as
well as over 3,000 civil society organizations worldwide.5

The 2013 Nutrition for Growth event organized by the U.K. Depart-
ment for International Development (DfID), the Children’s Invest-
ment Fund Foundation (CIFF), and the Government of Brazil was
another landmark. The event yielded commitments of over $4 billion,
albeit only a small number of stakeholders report have reached or are
on-course to reaching this commitment (IFPRI 2016). Building on this
momentum, the International Coalition for Advocacy on Nutrition
(ICAN) was formed to unite civil society organizations working to
end malnutrition in all of its forms and advocate for the prioritization
of investments and policies that save and improve lives through better
nutrition.

In April 2016, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed a
Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016–2025) to provide a unique oppor-
tunity for all stakeholders to strengthen joint efforts toward ending
all forms of malnutrition. Convened by the WHO and the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Decade
of Action on Nutrition offers an opportunity for accountability for

country-driven, SMART commitments to advance the global nutri-
tion agenda within the SDGs and framed by the Rome Declaration on
Nutrition.6 A Nutrition for Growth media moment highlighting prog-
ress since 2013 was held on the margins of the Rio Summer Olympics
in August 2016 and a future pledging moment is anticipated in 2017.
In August 2016, as part of the sixth Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (TICAD-VI) in Nairobi, the Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) launched a new Initiative on Food and
Nutrition Security in Africa (IFNA), with a plan to scale up nutrition-
specific and nutrition-sensitive actions in 10 countries in Africa.

The World Bank has been integrally engaged in many of these mile-
stones, and momentum continues to build within the organization
(box 1.3), which is catalyzing further action at national and global
levels. In April 2016 and coinciding with the World Bank’s Spring
Meetings, global nutrition leaders gathered in Washington DC to
discuss the main findings from the analyses in this report on costing
and financing and their implications for domestic and overseas aid.
Another key landmark of the World Bank’s commitment to investing
in nutrition is expected to be a summit on human capital with heads
of state and ministers of finance during the 2016 Annual Meetings
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. The
process of translating evidence into action and political and financial
commitments through advocacy has taken time, but the current impe-
tus is significant.



Analytical Framework
The analyses presented here are informed by the conceptual frame-
work for nutrition (see figure 1.3), which illustrates the benefits
during the life course as a result of nutrition-specific and nutrition-
sensitive interventions, as well as the benefits of an enabling environ-
ment. Nutrition-specific interventions are primarily delivered within
the health sector and address the immediate determinants of child
nutrition, such as breastfeeding, adequate food and nutrient intake,
feeding and caregiving practices, and disease prevention and man-
agement. Nutrition-sensitive interventions are delivered through other
sectors—for example, agriculture, water and sanitation, education, or
social protection—and address the underlying or basic influencers on
childhood nutrition outcomes. The synergy between nutrition-specific

     Box 1.3: Scaling Up World Bank Support to End Stunting:
     An Imperative for Developing Economies
     Over the last decade, the World Bank has been a major contribu-
     tor to the dialogue on scaling up actions to prevent stunting.
     More recently, this effort has been spearheaded by President Jim
     Yong Kim, as illustrated in these remarks:

         Economies are increasingly more dependent on digital and higher-
         level competencies and skills, and our investments in “grey matter
         infrastructure” are perhaps the most important ones we can make.
         In too many low- and middle-income countries, children are dis-
         advantaged before they even set foot in school because they did not
         have adequate early nutrition and stimulation, or were exposed to
         toxic environments. Childhood stunting rates of 45 percent—and as
         high as 70 percent in some countries—are a stain on our collective
         conscience.

     This is a turnaround from the early- to mid-2000s, when sup-
     port for the nutrition agenda had waned significantly both at the
     country level and among development partners. In 2002–04, the
     World Bank’s support for nutrition was at a low, with minimal
     staffing, very little analysis of what works, low institutional and
     senior management commitment, and minimal investments.
     This changed dramatically with the publication of the seminal
     report Repositioning Nutrition as Central to Development (World
     Bank 2006), which brought attention to the issue—not just within
     the World Bank, but also among key partners and governments.
     Within the institution, this new attention led to a rapid and
     significant scale-up of staffing for nutrition financed through
     a special contingency fund in 2007–08. The follow-on 2010
     World Bank publication Scaling Up Nutrition: What Will It Cost?
     provided the world with the first estimates of global nutrition
     costs, and the SUNa movement launched in 2010 rallied partners
     around the cause.

     Simultaneously, the World Bank’s commitment to investing in
     the early years (early life nutrition, early learning and stimula-
     tion, and nurturing care and protection from stress to support
     these agendas) is growing exponentially, in scope, scale, and

   sector, but across several sectors, including education, water and
   sanitation, social protection, and agriculture. In addition to Inter-
   national Development Association (IDA) and International Bank
   for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) resources, new
   resources are also becoming available to support this agenda at
   both global and national levels—from partners such as the Bill &
   Melinda Gates Foundation, the Children’s Investment Fund
   Foundation, the Dangote Foundation, Tata Trusts, the Power of
   Nutrition,b and the Global Financing Facility in support of Every
   Woman Every Child.c These and many other partners, including
   civil society organizations, are rallying around to catalyze and
   reinforce the achievement of results in support of the Sustainable
   Development Goals.

Measuring Progress
Lessons from the Millennium Development Goal era demonstrate
that clear, ambitious targets can ignite countries to action. In 2012—
in an effort to rally the international community around improving
nutrition—the 176 members of the World Health Assembly endorsed
­
a Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young
Child Nutrition (WHO 2014a). The plan includes the first-ever global
nutrition targets, focusing on six areas: stunting, exclusive breastfeed-
ing, wasting, anemia, low birthweight, and overweight (table 1.1).
The World Health Assembly targets aim to boost investment in
cost-effective interventions and catalyze progress toward decreasing
malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. Although targets are
set at the global level, member states were urged to develop national
targets to facilitate a harmonized approach to measure progress
toward the goals, provide accountability for actions, and develop
or modify policies to achieve the goals. To help countries set targets
and monitor their progress, the WHO has developed a tracking tool
that allows users to explore scenarios that take into account different
rates of progress (WHO 2015).7 To sustain momentum, world leaders
enshrined some of the World Health Assembly targets within the sec-
ond SDG, committing to end malnutrition in all its forms by the year
2030. Indicators related to stunting, wasting, and child overweight
are included in the SDG framework under Target 2.2 (IAEG-SDG
2016). Although many of these indicators are improving over time, a

continuation of current trends would not allow the world to achieve
the targets. For example, based on current global trends, approxi-
mately 127 million children under five will be stunted by 2025; the
World Health Assembly goal is to decrease this number to no more
than 100 million by 2025 (WHO 2014c).



Building on Previous Estimates of Financing
Needs to Scale Up Nutrition
A broad package of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health
interventions were costed by Stenberg et al. (2014), which included
some related nutrition interventions. However, that analysis did not
establish links with the World Health Assembly targets—nor did it
include the full package of nutrition interventions. Two previous stud-
ies have estimated the global cost of scaling up nutrition interventions
(Bhutta et al. 2013; Horton et al. 2010). The 2010 World Bank report
Scaling Up Nutrition was the first systematic attempt to estimate the
resources needed to scale up nutrition interventions on a global level.
It focuses on estimating the financing needs (not impact) of scaling
up 13 proven interventions, based in part on the findings of the 2008
Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Undernutrition (Bhutta et al.
2008). Financing needs were estimated using the program experience
approach, and the report estimates the additional financing needs to
scale up the set of interventions to be $10.3 billion per year. In the 2013
Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition, Bhutta et al. revisited
the evidence of intervention effectiveness and estimated the financ-
ing needs of a global scale-up of interventions to address all forms
of malnutrition to be about $9.6 billion per year. Similar to Scaling
Up Nutrition, this estimate assumed a one-year scale up but, unlike
Scaling Up Nutrition, it based financing needs on an ingredients-based
approach grounded on the WHO OneHealth Tool (Bhutta et al. 2013).
In addition to these global studies, several country-level costing and
financing studies have contributed to the knowledge base, especially
in gaining a better understanding of unit costs for nutrition interven-
tions and in developing the methods to estimate financing needs,
impacts, and benefits (IFPRI 2016; Shekar et al. 2014; Shekar, Dayton
Eberwein, and Kakietek 2016; Shekar, Mattern, Eozenou et al. 2015;
Shekar, Mattern, Laviolette et al. 2015).

Those studies estimated the costs of a comprehensive package of
evidence-based interventions affecting different aspects of child

undernutrition but did not provide estimates of the financing needs
required to reach the global targets. No previous or planned study
has systematically linked global financing needs with potential for
impact, or assessed the shortfall between what is required and what
is currently being spent to address the World Health Assembly global
targets. Finally, no prior study has presented a comprehensive global
analysis of donor and national government investments, or what
financing scenarios may be needed to close these gaps.

The current report adds to the previous work in three unique ways: by
providing a more comprehensive estimate of financing needs, by link-
ing financing needs to impacts, and by laying out a potential financing
framework (table 1.2). An in-depth understanding of current nutrition
investments, future needs and their impact, and ways to mobilize the
required funds is needed to move the agenda from political commit-
ment to policy imperative. It should be noted that the estimates from
these analyses are lower than the previous two because it includes
a smaller set of interventions than previous estimates (that is, it

lower than the ones used in the previous analyses.



Consultative Process: The Technical
Advisory Group
These analyses were guided by the expert advice of a Technical
Advisory Group (TAG). This group comprised nutrition experts from
around the world, representing country ministries of health, other
implementing agencies, academia, and the donor community (see
appendix A for a list of the TAG members). The TAG met on four occa-
sions to provide feedback on issues such as the selection of interven-
tions, methodology, and data sources, and for validating assumptions
made in the models. Their contribution culminated in a one-day in-
person meeting to review the final methods and interpret the results
(see appendix A for a list of participants).



The Scope of This Report
Two of the global nutrition targets—those for low birthweight and for
child overweight—are not included in the analyses because there are
insufficient data, either on the prevalence of the condition (low birth-
weight) or consensus on effective interventions to reach the goal (child
overweight) is lacking. Financing needs are estimated for scaling up
interventions to treat severe wasting, but it was not possible to esti-
mate the financing needs of achieving the wasting target because of a
lack of evidence about which interventions are effective in preventing
wasting. For the remaining three targets, the analyses focus on cost-
ing a package of primarily preventive nutrition-specific interventions,
which have proven to be efficacious in averting stunting and anemia,
enhancing breastfeeding, and reducing child mortality.

Further, the analyses were limited to low- and middle-income coun-
tries because this is where the undernutrition problem is concentrated.
In addition, high-income countries can finance their own efforts, and
the financing needs and targeting strategies in these countries are
likely to be different from those in low- and middle-income countries.

The remainder of this report is structured as follows: Chapter 2
describes the analytical framework for the costs, impacts, and benefit-
cost analyses. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 present the financing needs and
impacts for reaching targets for stunting, anemia in women, and
breastfeeding for infants, and for treating wasting, respectively. Chap-
ter 7 reports on the total financing needs and benefits of scaling up to
meet all targets, taking into account the fact that some interventions
overlap across targets. Chapter 8 presents scenarios for scaling up
financing to reach the targets by 2025. Chapter 9 discusses the findings
and sets forth policy and programmatic action items for the future,
including areas for future research.

   Key Messages
   •	    The total 10-year costs for scaling up key interventions are
         estimated for reaching the targets to reduce stunting among
         children and anemia in women, increase exclusive breast-
         feeding rates for infants, and mitigate the impact of wasting
         among children.
   •	    For each of these four targets, the analyses cover the
         highest-burden countries; the results are extrapolated to all
         low- and middle-income countries.
   •	    Data and methods derived from country-level costing
         are used to inform the analyses and determine the set of
         evidence-based interventions needed to meet each target.
   •	    The impact of the additional investments on the prevalence
         of stunting, anemia in women, and rates of exclusive breast-
         feeding is estimated, along with the additional impacts on
         child mortality.
   •	    Cost-benefit analyses are performed for each target indi-
         vidually, translating the results into benefits in terms of
         potential earnings gained over adult working life.

        his chapter describes the general methodological approach
        used in estimating the costs and impacts of achieving the four
        World Health Assembly targets: stunting, anemia in women,
and exclusive breastfeeding for infants, and mitigating the impact of
wasting among young children. The methods for estimating benefit-
cost ratios are also described. Target-specific methodological consid-
erations are discussed in chapters 3 through 6. The methods used to
estimate current and future financing scenarios are described sepa-
rately in chapter 8.



Country Sample Selection
Although the nutritional status of women and children is a public
health concern in many high-income countries, this report focuses
on estimating the costs and impacts of achieving the World Health
Assembly targets in low- and middle-income countries only, because
this is where the burden is greatest. Concentrating on low- and
­
middle-income countries allows for greater confidence in the esti-
mates because information on cost, coverage, and service delivery
modality in high-income countries are either not comparable or not
readily accessible. Furthermore, the estimates generated here are
intended to inform policy makers in low- and middle-income country
governments that are considering investing in nutrition as well as offi-
cial development assistance partners and philanthropic foundations
that are developing investment strategies.

A sample of high-burden low- and middle-income countries is identi-
fied for each of the four targets. Figure 2.1 shows the proportion of
the burden of stunting captured by a given number of countries. The
figure indicates that 37 countries account for 85 percent of the global
burden of stunting. Based on this assessment, a decision was made to
systematically cut off the number of countries in the sample to a man-
ageable number for the purpose of these analyses. Thus 37 countries
are included for stunting, 26 for anemia, 27 for breastfeeding, and 24
for wasting (table 2.1). This approach allows global estimates to be
developed more efficiently given the level of effort required to obtain,
often scant, information on cost estimations and impacts.

Each sample includes the 20 countries with the highest burden of a
given aspect of malnutrition (that is, the highest number of stunted
children, of women of reproductive age suffering from anemia, of

In addition, all countries with malnutrition burdens above a specific

Note: a. The prevalence rates in this table are based on the most recent survey available
on the date of access (February 1, 2015) from UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2014.
b. For the stunting target, sample countries have a greater than 40 percent prevalence of
stunting. For anemia in women, sample countries have a greater than 50 percent preva-

exclusive breastfeeding. For wasting, sample countries have a greater than 15 percent
prevalence of wasting.


Twelve countries are included in all four samples, 3 are included in
three samples, and 12 are included in two.

For the stunting target, estimates of financing needs are based on
a sample of 37 countries. This includes 20 countries with the high-
est absolute burden (the highest number of stunted children) and
an additional 17 countries with the highest stunting prevalence (a
prevalence exceeding 40 percent, which is the WHO threshold for
a “very high” stunting prevalence). These countries account for
84.3 percent of the global stunting burden. The sample for the anemia

target consists of 26 countries (20 countries with the highest abso-
lute burden and 6 countries with anemia prevalence higher than 50
percent) and accounts for 82.8 percent of the burden of anemia in
women of reproductive age. The breastfeeding target sample consists
of 27 countries (20 with the highest absolute burden and 7 countries
with exclusive breastfeeding prevalence lower than 10 percent), which
together account for 78.1 percent of the burden of non-exclusively
breastfed children (0 to 5 months). The wasting target sample consists
of 24 countries (20 countries with the highest absolute burden and
4 countries with wasting prevalence higher than 15 percent), together
accounting for 82.9 percent of the burden of wasted children. The
list of countries included in each sample for each target is shown in
table 2.2.

Financing needs and impacts are estimated and modeled for each
country. For each target, the results from the sample are then extrapo-
lated to all low- and middle-income countries. It is assumed that the
financing needs for countries outside the sample are proportional to
their burden of malnutrition. For example, for the stunting target, the
countries in the sample account for 84 percent of the burden of stunt-
ing in all low- and middle-income countries. Therefore it is assumed
that they also account for 84 percent of the total costs. Consequently,
the total cost is calculated for low- and middle-income countries by
multiplying the sample cost by 1/0.84 or 1.19. This is clearly a simpli-
fication but it is consistent with the approach used in previous global
nutrition costing studies (see Horton et al. 2010).

Financing needs are analyzed along two dimensions. The first is geo-
graphic. All low- and middle-income countries are grouped accord-
ing to World Bank regions: Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Central
Asia, East Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle
East and North Africa, and South Asia.1 This geographic classification
serves as a proxy for unobserved factors that may potentially affect
the cost of delivering nutrition interventions (for example, develop-
ment, infrastructure, and structural constraints). A classification based
on geography is intuitive and has been used in the past in studies
assessing the cost of implementation of nutrition interventions (Bhutta
et al. 2008; Bhutta et al. 2013; Horton et al. 2010). Country income com-
prises the second dimension for analyzing financing needs because
wealth has been shown to be one of the key predictors of the cost

Evidence-Based Interventions and
Delivery Platforms
Two key principles guided the selection of interventions: (1) a strong
evidence base must exist for effectiveness in reducing stunting in chil-
dren under five years of age, reducing anemia in women of reproduc-
tive age, increasing exclusive breastfeeding, and reducing wasting;3
and (2) the interventions must be relevant for a substantial portion of
low- and middle-income countries or, as is the case with intermittent
presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, applicable across a
specific region as a result of a high prevalence of malaria.

High-impact interventions are identified based on the 2013 Lancet
Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition and the 2016 Lancet Series on
Breastfeeding. For stunting, wasting, and anemia, literature reviews
were conducted to identify any additional evidence reviews and
meta-analyses published after the publication of the Lancet series. The
literature reviews do not identify any additional interventions that
should be included in the study.

This report focuses on nutrition-specific interventions primarily
because the evidence base for the impact of nutrition-sensitive inter-
ventions on stunting, anemia, breastfeeding, and wasting remains
limited (Ruel et al. 2013), and therefore it is not feasible to cost these
interventions, nor to fully assess their impact on the global targets.
For some targets, the analyses incorporate the potential impact of
­
nutrition-sensitive interventions for which there is evidence, but does
not cost those since it is not possible to apportion a part of the cost
to the nutrition outcomes specifically. For example, in the case of the
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions, even though the
costs are known (Hutton 2015), because they include large infrastruc-
ture costs it is not possible to determine what portion of these costs

 To effectively reach targets for stunting, anemia, and breastfeeding, selected interventions are all
preventive. However, with the limited research on preventing wasting, only treatment interventions
are selected for mitigating wasting.

treatment of severe wasting, the analyses focus primarily on preven-
tive interventions. Chapters 3 through 6 provide additional method-
ological details for each target.



Estimating Unit Costs Based
on Program Experience
The unit costs are estimated using the program experience approach
where data were collected on the actual financing needs of programs,
as in Horton et al. (2010) (table 2.3).4 Unit cost data were obtained
from peer-reviewed publications, gray literature, and costed national
nutrition plans as well as primary data collected by the World Bank
as part of a series of country-level costing studies from Sub-Saharan
Africa (Shekar et al. 2014; Shekar, Dayton Eberwein, and Kakietek
2016; Shekar, Mattern, Eozenou, et al. 2015; Shekar, Mattern, Lavio-
lette, et al. 2015). If no unit cost data are available for a given interven-
tion in a given country, the mean unit cost for other countries in that
region is used. If there are no unit cost data for any country in a given
region, the unit costs are approximated by using the average from
other regions and applying regional adjustment factors from Horton
et al. (2010), if appropriate.

Cost Data

                                  •	 If data are missing for all countries in a region, extrapolate a
                                     regional unit cost estimate based on application of regional unit

 The other main method for estimating unit costs is the ingredients approach, which constructs the
cost of an ideal service delivery model based on the cost of required inputs. See Bhutta et al. 2013.



Chapter 2  Overview of Methods	                                                                          31
Assumptions about the Pace of Scale-Up
The analyses assume program coverage of each intervention increases
at a constant rate over five years from current coverage rates in 2016
to 100 percent coverage rates in 2021, followed by a subsequent five-
year maintenance phase with steady 100 percent program coverage
between 2021 and 2025. This scale-up scenario is used to allow for
the full accrual of the benefits of the interventions affecting stunt-
ing, which are delivered during the first five years of a child’s life.
In particular, full program coverage needs to be maintained for five
years in order for the cohort of newborns to five-year-olds to fully
accrue its benefits. Furthermore, the Lives Saved Tool (LiST)—the tool
used to model the impact of the interventions—is a cohort model in
which the likelihood of stunting depends on interventions, risk fac-
tors, and whether or not the child was stunted in the previous year.
Because LiST is a cohort model, in a given year, a child benefits from
all interventions received in this year (direct impact of interventions)
as well as interventions received in all previous years (indirect impact
of interventions through reduced risk of stunting in previous years).
Therefore, once all interventions are scaled up to maximum coverage,
it will take five years for the cohort of newborns to accrue full benefits
of the interventions.

This same pace of scale-up is used for the anemia and exclusive
breastfeeding targets for two primary reasons. First, some of the
interventions included in the stunting target are also included in the
package of interventions needed to reach other targets (for example,
counseling for mothers and caregivers on good infant and young
child nutrition and hygiene practices for the exclusive breastfeeding
target and antenatal micronutrient supplementation and intermittent
presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic
regions for the anemia target). Second, using the same assumptions
about scale-up allows for easier aggregation and calculation of financ-
ing needs for a comprehensive intervention package (see chapter 7).
However, because there is no overlap of interventions between stunt-
ing and the treatment of wasting, a linear scale-up from 2016 through
2025 is assumed for the treatment of severe wasting, as discussed in
chapter 6.

To account for potential increases in marginal costs as program cover-
age approaches 100 percent (for example, more financing is required



32   	                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
to access the hardest-to-reach groups), the approach adopted in
Horton et al. (2010) is followed: the costs of 100 percent coverage are
calculated, although the impact assessments assume that only 90 per-
cent of the beneficiaries are reached for all interventions.



Estimating Total Financing Needs
for Each Target
For each intervention in each country in each sample, the additional
financing needs to scale up program coverage from the current level
to 100 percent are estimated:

                            FNy = UC p ICy p Popy

where:

    FNy is the annual financing need for a given intervention in year y,
    UC is the unit cost,
    ICy is the incremental coverage assumed for year y, and
    Popy is the target population in year y.

The total financing needs per intervention over the 10-year period
is the sum of the annual financing needs. Total financing needs per
country is the sum of the 10-year financing needs of all interven-
tions for a given target. The total financing needs for the sample for
each target are calculated by summing the country-level total 10-year
financing needs. To take into account the program costs, an additional
9 percent of the estimate was added for capacity development, 2 per-
cent for monitoring and evaluation, and 1 percent for policy develop-
ment on top of the total direct financing needs. This assumption about
the size of program costs follows the methodology used in Horton
et al. (2010). However, making this blanket assumption is recognized
as a limitation and an area where better data are needed.

To determine total financing needs, a multiplier equal to the inverse of
the percentage of the target’s burden contained in each target’s coun-
try sample was applied to extrapolate the sample estimates to cover
all low- and middle-income countries (see table 2.1).




Chapter 2  Overview of Methods	                                        33
Estimating Impacts
The impact analyses are based on LiST (LiST 2015) estimations. LiST
is an epidemiological model for maternal and child health that allows
users to estimate the impact of expanding the coverage of maternal
and child health and nutrition interventions on mortality, morbidity,
and the nutritional status of children under age five. LiST is used to
model the impact of the interventions on stunting prevalence and on
mortality in children under age five. LiST does not include interven-
tions targeting non-pregnant women of reproductive age. It also does
not model the impact of any of the interventions on that target group.
Therefore a separate model was developed (using Microsoft Excel) to
estimate the impact of anemia prevention interventions on the preva-
lence of anemia in women.

LiST is used to model mortality impacts for each intervention in each
country in the samples. The country-specific results are then combined
to obtain a population-weighted reduction in overall prevalence. The
same relative prevalence change in low- and middle-income coun-
tries is assumed for all countries to which the results are extrapolated.
The global reductions in prevalence of stunting and anemia, and the
increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates, are estimated by applying
these relative reductions in the sample to the 2015 baselines in all
low- and middle-income countries (data from UNICEF, WHO, and
World Bank 2015). For mortality reductions, the same multipliers that
are used to extrapolate the financing needs are also used to estimate
reductions in mortality for all low- and middle-income countries (see
table 2.1).



Benefit-Cost Analyses
A benefit-cost analysis is an economic evaluation tool commonly used
by policy makers, industry, and researchers to assess the monetary
value of benefits of interventions relative to their costs. The benefit-
cost ratios are computed in these analyses for all four targets.

For each target, maternal and child mortality averted are translated
into expected earnings gains over adult working lives, up to age
65 or average country life expectancy at birth (whichever is lower).
Similarly, the impact results (number of cases of stunting averted
and additional children exclusively breastfed) are also translated into
benefits in terms of expected earnings gained over adult working life

34   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
via improvements in cognitive development. Estimations of expected
increases in income as a result of the prevention of stunting are based
on Hoddinott et al. (2013) and those as a result of increases in income
are from Rollins et al. (2016). Reductions in anemia in women, are
translated into earnings gained via increased productivity within the
years the intervention was received, based on methods employed in
Horton and Ross (2003). Specific assumptions about these benefits are
explained in chapters 3 through 6.

Beneficiary earnings projections are based on GDP per capita; labor
share of income; and, for anemia, the percent share of all work that is
manual labor. In an effort to keep the estimates conservative, a 3 per-
cent per year GDP growth rate is assumed for all low- and middle-
income countries, even though the average annual GDP growth rate
for the countries in this sample has been approximately 5 percent over
the past decade (World Bank 2016).5 It is assumed that a maximum of
90 percent of earnings gains could be realized (Hoddinott et al. 2013)
and that labor wages are responsible for 52 percent of gross national
income (Lübker 2007).

Discounting is needed in this analysis since there may be up to a
65 year gap between incurring costs and yielding some of the ben-
efits of investments in nutrition. However, the appropriate discount
rate to use continues to be a topic of debate. Guidelines from WHO-
CHOICE (Edejer et al. 2003) and, more recently, the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation’s Methods in Economic Evaluation Project (BMGF
2014) both advise that the base-case scenarios in economic evaluations
of health interventions assume a 3 percent discount rate for both costs
and benefits. Three percent is argued to reflect the cost of public sector
borrowing of capital at market rates (Hoddinott 2016; Wethli 2014).
Recent work on economic evaluations pertaining to reducing the
impact of climate change over the next hundred or more years have
proposed social discount rates as low as 1.4 percent would be appro-
priate (Stern 2008) or time-varying discount rates that decline after
many years and affect future generations (Arrow et al. 2012; Hoddi-
nott 2016; Sunstein and Weisbach 2008). For the analyses in this report,
benefit-cost ratios are presented for a base-case scenario using a
3 percent discount rate on costs and benefits, as per the existing guide-
lines, as well as a 5 percent discount rate in the sensitivity analyses to
parallel recent seminal nutrition economic analyses (Hoddinott 2016;
Horton and Hoddinott 2014; Rajkumar, Gaukler, and Tilahun 2012).

benefit-cost ratios for each region and income group—to allow the
reader to interpret the results as appropriate for different contexts.
More accurate estimates can be developed through country-level
studies and ex-post benefit-cost analyses of programs within specific
country contexts.



Data Sources
Data on the baseline prevalence of stunting, anemia, exclusive breast-
feeding, and wasting are from the latest update of the World Health
Assembly Global Nutrition Tracker dataset (September 2015). Baseline
intervention coverage data are from Demographic and Health Sur-
veys (DHS) or from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). The
World Population Prospects 2015 (UN DESA 2015) is used to obtain
population data, including the projected 2015 population baseline
and projected population growth from 2016 through 2025. Data on
GDP and population living under the poverty line are from the World
Development Indicators database. Other sources specific to one target
are declared in the target-specific chapters that follow.

Reaching the Global Target
for Stunting

   Key Messages
   •	    Reaching the stunting target is feasible but will require
         large coordinated investments in key interventions and a
         supportive enabling environment.
   •	    The analyses focus on key high-impact interventions with
         strong evidence of effectiveness in reducing stunting.
         Scale-up costs are estimated for a sample of 37 high-burden
         countries and extrapolated to all low- and middle-income
         countries. The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is used to model the
         impact of scale-up on stunting.
   •	    Scaling up high-impact interventions in all low- and
         middle-income countries, along with expected improve-
         ­
         ments in underlying determinants of undernutrition, would
         lead to a 40 percent decline in the number of stunted chil-
         dren by 2025 and allow the world to achieve the stunting
         target. The total financing needed to reach this target over
         10 years is $49.5 billion.




Chapter 3  Reaching the Global Target for Stunting	                     41
     •	   This scale-up in intervention coverage, along with improve-
          ments in underlying determinants, would result in 65 mil-
          lion fewer children stunted in 2025. Furthermore, those
          interventions would, over 10 years, prevent about 2.8 mil-
          lion deaths among children under age five.




S
      tunting is not only being short for one’s age but recent evidence
      suggests that it is also a predictor of many other developmental
      constraints, including cognitive deficits and future economic
opportunities. In 2012 the World Health Assembly agreed on a global
target to reduce the number of stunted children under age five by
40 percent by 2025. This chapter describes the methods used to
estimate the financing needs for achieving this target, the estimated
resources required, and the impact those investments will be expected
to have on nutrition, health, and economic outcomes.



Stunting Prevalence and Progress to Date
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines stunting as height
(or length) that is two or more standard deviations below the global
WHO child growth standards reference (WHO 2016).

In 2015, 159 million children under age five were stunted, with the
highest burden concentrated in low- and middle-income countries
(map 3.1; UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2015). Since the 1990s, the
worldwide prevalence of stunting declined from 40 percent to just
under 24 percent in 2014. However, stark regional differences per-
sist, with South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa remaining above the
global average both in terms of prevalence and numbers of stunted
children (figure 3.1). Indeed, South Asia is home to the largest num-
ber of stunted children worldwide (figure 3.1; UNICEF, WHO, and
World Bank 2015). Thirty-seven percent of all children under five were
stunted in South Asia in 2014, although the share is down from 49 per-
cent in 1990. Even though the prevalence of child stunting in Sub-
Saharan Africa fell from 48 percent in 1990 to 35 percent in 2014, the
total number of stunted children in Africa increased by 12.8 million

during the same period as a result of high fertility rates and lower
rates of decline in stunting in Africa as compared with other regions
(figure 3.2).

Of all the regions, East Asia and Pacific have made the most progress
in decreasing stunting. Stunting prevalence there fell by almost three-
quarters, from 42 percent to 11 percent, and the number of stunted
children decreased by 64 million between 1990 and 2014. Much of that
decline, however, was driven by improvements in China, and many
countries—such as Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
and Cambodia—continue to carry very high burdens of child stunting.
Albeit more slowly than Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Carib-
bean, the Middle East and North Africa have also made considerable
progress in decreasing stunting, and stunting prevalence in those
regions remains well under the global average. The combined share of
the number of stunted children for these three regions decreased from
30 percent to 14 percent between 1990 and 2014. Based on current
global trends, approximately 127 million children under five will be

number to no more than 100 million by 2025 (WHO 2014).

Not only do stunting rates remain high in many low- and middle-
income countries, but stunting affects all echelons of society and the
richest groups are not immune (figure 3.3). Across many low- and
middle-income countries, a similar pattern emerges: stunting rates are
highest among the poorest wealth quintiles but they are unacceptably
high even in the highest wealth quintile. This finding debunks a com-
monly held view that stunting is caused by poverty alone. Instead,
research shows that other factors, such as the burden of disease,
access to adequate sanitation, food diversity, and optimal feeding and
caregiving practices, also affect levels of stunting. Stunting-reduction
strategies need to be designed with this in mind, so that free services
that consume large public resources are targeted toward the poor,
while the better-off are provided better knowledge and information
through traditional and social media.

The Effects of Stunting
Childhood stunting warrants serious policy attention because not
only does it affect long-term health and cognitive ability, but it is also
inextricably linked to sustainable and equitable growth of a whole
society. The societal costs of stunting during childhood are high and
include increased mortality, increased morbidity (both in childhood
and later in adulthood), decreased cognitive ability, poor educational
outcomes, lost earnings, and losses to national economic productivity.
Conversely, investing in nutrition provides many benefits for pov-
erty reduction and economic growth. A recent National Academy of
Medicine paper (Huebner et al. 2016) reports on the opportunities in
the U.S. context: “the return on investments during the prenatal and early
childhood years average between 7 and 10 percent greater than investments
made at older ages (Carneiro and Heckman, 2003). Although there are other
opportunities to enhance human development, cost-effective strategic invest-
ments made during children’s early years can mitigate the deleterious effects

46                   	                                                             An Investment Framework for Nutrition
of poverty, social inequality, and discrimination, ultimately resulting in long-
lasting gains that reap benefits for children and youth, families, communities,
and nations” (Huebner et al. 2016, p. 1).


Increased Child Mortality and Morbidity
Stunting involves multiple pathological changes marked by linear
growth retardation (low height-for-age z-score), which increases mor-
bidity and mortality and decreases physical, neurodevelopmental, and
economic capacity (Prendergast and Humphrey 2014). Malnutrition in
the form of stunting, wasting, fetal growth retardation, suboptimum
breastfeeding, and micronutrient deficiencies is an underlying cause
of about 45 percent of the deaths of children under five years of age
and one-fifth of maternal deaths in developing countries (Black et al.
2013). Furthermore, low gestational or preterm weight and suboptimal
breastfeeding practices are among the main causes of neonatal deaths
(Black et al. 2013). In several large studies reviewed by Prendergast
and Humphrey (2014), a clear dose-response relationship could be
seen between height-for-age z-scores and morbidity. Children with
poor linear growth are more than 1.5 times more likely to contract
respiratory infections and diarrhea; children with severe stunting are
more than six times more likely to contract these conditions. Severely
stunted children also have a threefold increased risk of mortality from
other infections such as sepsis, meningitis, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and
cellulitis (Prendergast and Humphrey 2014).


Irreversible Cognitive Damage and Diminished
Educational Attainment
Conditions that give rise to stunting, such as poor feeding practices
or persistent diarrhea, have detrimental effects on a child’s brain by
causing changes in the temporal sequence of brain maturation, which
in turn disturb the formation of neural circuits (Udani 1992) and
result in cognitive deficits (Kar, Rao, and Chandramouli 2008). Wide-
spread evidence from a range of settings and using diverse empirical
approaches indicates that malnutrition leads to negative educational
outcomes. Stunted children are more likely to start school late and to
repeat a grade or drop out of school (Daniels and Adair 2004; Mendez
and Adair 1999). Martorell et al. (2010) show that adults who were
stunted at age two completed one less year of schooling. Adair et al.
(2013) estimate that improving linear growth for children under two
years of age by one standard deviation adds about half a grade of


Chapter 3  Reaching the Global Target for Stunting	                          47
school attainment. Behrman et al. (2009) report increased schooling
attainment and higher test scores from improved nutrition in early
childhood. In studying the provision of lipid-based nutrition supple-
ments for malaria and diarrhea treatment, Prado et al. (2016) show
that the intervention independently affected developmental scores,
such as motor and language skills.


Links with Poverty
Stunting and poverty are interrelated and exacerbate each other.
A recent study (Hoddinott et al. 2011) concludes that children who
are not stunted at 36 months are one-third less likely to live in poor
households as adults. Poverty increases the risk of stunting and other
forms of undernutrition by lowering poor households’ purchasing
power, reducing access to basic health services, and exposing these
households to unhealthy environments, thereby compromising food
intake (both quality and quantity), reducing access to health services,
and increasing exposure to infections. Poor households are also more
likely to have frequent pregnancies, larger family sizes with high
dependency ratios, more infections, and increased health care costs
(Victora et al. 2003). At the same time, malnutrition contributes to poor
health and poor cognitive development, resulting in poor human capi-
tal and long-term productivity losses (Horton and Steckel 2013).


Reduced Wages and Losses to GDP
Undernutrition costs developing countries billions of dollars in lost
revenue through reduced economic productivity, particularly through
lower wages, lower physical and mental capabilities, and more days
away from work as a result of illness. At the individual level, child-
hood stunting is estimated to reduce a person’s potential lifetime
earnings by at least 10 percent (World Bank 2006). Other studies have
shown that a 1 percent increase in adult height results in a 2.4 percent
increase in earnings (Thomas and Strauss 1997). The economic costs
of undernutrition have the greatest effect on the most vulnerable in
the developing world. A recent analysis estimates these losses at 4 to
11 percent of GDP in Africa and Asia each year (Horton and Steckel
2013)—equivalent to about $149 billion of productivity losses each
year. Most of those losses are due to cognitive deficits. Another recent
study by Lin, Lutter, and Ruhm (2016) shows that cognitive perfor-
mance is positively linked to future labor market outcomes in terms
of increased lifetime earnings. Fink et al. (2016) also find that growth


48   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
faltering in children from developing countries leads to 0.5 years lost
in educational attainment, resulting in global economic losses of more
than $175 billion and average loss of lifetime earnings of $1,400 per
child. As the world moves from economies based on unskilled manual
labor to ones based on skilled labor requiring high mental capacity,
the impact of childhood stunting and other forms of undernutrition
on incomes and economies will likely increase. Because stunting is
concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, it will weigh
heavily on the ability of these countries to benefit from technological
progress and catch up with high-income countries, potentially further
exacerbating global income inequalities.



Interventions That Reduce Stunting
The etiology of stunting is complex. It is caused by the lack of appro-
priate quality and quantity of foods, repeated bouts of disease, and/or
poor birth outcomes including low birthweight and preterm delivery,
which in turn may result from poor feeding behaviors and poor nutri-
tion knowledge on the part of parents and caregivers, poor sanitation
and hygiene, lack of access to health care services, low purchasing
power of the household, insufficient supply of appropriate quality
foods in the market, and other factors (Black et al. 2013). Preventing
stunting therefore requires multifaceted and multisectoral approaches.
To date the evidence base regarding the most effective strategies
remains a work in progress.

There is strong evidence regarding interventions that affect the
proximal determinants of stunting—the nutrition-specific interven-
tions. Two Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition (in 2008
and 2013) provide a summary of global evidence based on systematic
literature reviews and meta-analyses. In contrast, the evidence base
regarding the effectiveness of interventions that target more distal
determinants of stunting (the nutrition-sensitive approaches) remains
limited (see Ruel et al. 2013 for a review). Some evidence links poor
water and sanitation to a greater incidence of diarrheal diseases,
which is a risk factor for stunting (Bhutta et al. 2013). Evidence of
the impact of nutrition-sensitive interventions on stunting—such as
improving food security and dietary diversity as well as women’s
education and empowerment—is more limited. Therefore this chapter
focuses primarily on the nutrition-specific interventions, as outlined
by Bhutta et al. 2013, where the evidence is the strongest and allows


Chapter 3  Reaching the Global Target for Stunting	                 49
for estimating both the costs of the interventions and their impact on
nutrition outcomes, including stunting.


Interventions for Pregnant Women and Mothers of Infants
and Young Children
Interventions for pregnant women, such as micronutrient supplemen-
tation, affect child stunting by improving fetal growth and reducing
conditions effecting growth outcomes, such as iron deficiency anemia.
Current evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions focuses
primarily on birth outcomes rather than on the linear growth of
children. Interventions included in this study are those with proven
effectiveness. Other interventions that show great promise—such as
small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements,1 and the provision of
deworming tablets to prevent parasitic and helminth diseases—can be
added as the evidence base grows.


Antenatal micronutrient supplementation  Antenatal micronutri-
ent supplementation consists of multiple micronutrient supplements,
which are broadly characterized as containing more than two micro-
nutrients.2 The UNICEF UNIMAP supplement contains 14 micronu-
trients, including iron, folic acid, and vitamin A, at levels appropriate
for daily intake during pregnancy. Although antenatal micronutrient
supplements have been shown to reduce low birthweight and small-
for-gestational-age births by 11 to 13 percent according to a Cochrane
review (Haider and Bhutta 2015), other studies have shown little
direct effect on child anthropometric outcomes, with the exception
of child head circumference (Lu et al. 2014). Peña-Rosas et al. (2015)
found that giving pregnant women any supplementation with iron
increases birthweight in infants by over 20 grams as compared to
giving no supplements or supplements without iron. Nonetheless,
antenatal micronutrient supplements are a low-cost and feasible way
to provide essential micronutrients to improve birth outcomes, which
in turn reduce the risk of stunting (Haider and Bhutta 2015). In this

 Despite some promising studies on small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (Adu-­
Afarwuah et al. 2015; Ashorn et al. 2015), it is not clear which populations would benefit most
from these supplements, nor are there global recommendations on its use. Furthermore, no large-
scale production and distribution is yet available, leaving many cost and implementation issues
unresolved. A World Bank–supported study on these lipid supplements is currently ongoing in
Madagascar.

 The intervention antenatal micronutrient supplementation is sometimes referred to by different names
in the literature. Alternative names include maternal micronutrient supplementation, multiple micronutri-
ent supplementation in pregnancy, multiple-micronutrient supplementation for women during pregnancy,
and the acronyms MMN, MNS, and MMS.

analysis, financing needs were estimated for antenatal micronutrient
supplementation.
Counseling for mothers and caregivers on good infant and young
child nutrition and hygiene practices  This intervention name is
shortened throughout this analysis to infant and young child nutrition
counseling. Optimal feeding of infants and young children includes
immediate initiation of breastfeeding, early and exclusive breastfeed-
ing until six months of age, and age-appropriate complementary
feeding from 6 to 24 months with continued breastfeeding until
two years of age. Good infant and young child feeding and hygiene
practices are promoted at various levels: health facilities, community/
home settings, and through mass media campaigns. Health facilities
are the main outlet for nutrition counseling, but community health
workers play an immensely important role in reaching outlying and
hard-to-reach areas where the most vulnerable live. Education on
complementary feeding alone, in food insecure populations, has been
shown to significantly improve linear growth (height-for-age Z scores)
and weight gain (weight-for-age Z scores) and decrease stunting rates
(Lassi et al. 2013). Breastfeeding promotion and resulting increases in
exclusive breastfeeding rate affect stunting by reducing diarrhea inci-
dence. The impact estimate used in this analysis comes from Lamberti
et al. (2011) which presented the effects of suboptimal breastfeeding
on diarrhea incidence.
Balanced energy-protein supplementation for pregnant women 
Balanced energy-protein supplements refer to food supplements that
contain less than 25 percent protein as their total energy content; they
are intended for pregnant women who are undernourished or at risk
of becoming undernourished, and promote gestational weight gain
and improve birth outcomes. The 2013 Lancet Series on Maternal and
Child Malnutrition reports a 34 percent reduction in the risk of small-
for-gestational age babies and stillbirths from 16 studies. Furthermore,
data from five studies demonstrate a 32 percent reduction in the risk
of low birthweight, with effects more clearly pronounced in under-
nourished women than in adequately nourished women (Imdad
and Bhutta 2012). More recently, Ota et al. (2015) found an increase
in mean birthweight and a significant reduction in the incidence of
infants born small for gestational age with balanced energy protein
supplementation.
Intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in
malaria-endemic regions  The WHO recommends at least two doses,
preferably four, of intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in

Chapter 3  Reaching the Global Target for Stunting	                  51
pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as part of routine antena-
tal care in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission, particularly
Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO 2012). Trials of intermittent presumptive
treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions to
estimate their effect on birth outcomes have shown significant reduc-
tions in low birthweight and increases in mean birthweight of infants
(Garner and Gülmezoglu 2006; Radeva-Petrova et al. 2014), which in
turn have significant effects on stunting. Further studies have also
shown that, among first and second pregnancies in malaria-prevalent
areas, prevention interventions such as intermittent presumptive treat-
ment of malaria in pregnancy were found to have a pooled protective
efficacy of 35 percent on reducing low birthweight (Eisele, Larsen, and
Steketee 2010). Although this intervention stands out as the only non-
nutrition intervention included in the analyses, its significant impacts
on birth outcomes, and thus on stunting, justifies its inclusion.

Interventions for Infants and Young Children
Vitamin A supplementation for children  Vitamin A deficiency
causes visual impairment and blindness among children, and con-
tributes to diarrheal diseases and child mortality. The WHO recom-
mends the provision of 100,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A
for infants 6–11 months of age, and 200,000 IU of vitamin A every
four to six months for children age 12–59 months, in settings where
night-blindness prevalence is 1 percent or higher among children
24–59 months, or where vitamin A deficiency is 20 percent or higher
in infants and children age 6–59 months (WHO 2011). A Cochrane
systematic review of 43 randomized controlled trials and clus-
ter randomized controlled trials in community settings found no
effect of vitamin A supplementation on linear growth (Imdad et al.
2010). However, vitamin A indirectly influences stunting, by reduc-
ing diarrheal incidence, and the effects of vitamin A supplementa-
tion on ­diarrhea-specific mortality among children have been well
documented. Within the same systematic review, seven of the trials
reported a 30 percent reduction in diarrhea-specific child mortal-
ity with preventive vitamin A supplementation (Imdad et al. 2010).
Results from an evaluation of 21 studies show that vitamin A supple-
mentation reduces all-cause mortality in children 6–59 months by
25 percent and reduces diarrhea-specific mortality by 30 percent in
children 6–59 months (Imdad et al. 2011).
Prophylactic zinc supplementation  Zinc is an important micronu-
trient that is associated with immune function, cellular growth and
differentiation, and metabolism. A systematic review of 36 randomized

52   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
controlled trials shows that mean height increased significantly, by
0.37 centimeters, and diarrheal incidence decreased by 13 percent in
children who received prophylactic zinc supplementation for 24 weeks
(Imdad et al. 2011). At present, the WHO does not have any specific
recommendations on preventive zinc supplementation.
Public provision of complementary food for children  Interventions
to ensure adequate nutrient intake for children 6–24 months of age
can provide anywhere from 100 to 1,500 additional calories, as well
as essential micronutrients, to improve height-for-weight z-scores in
these children. Imdad, Yakoob, and Bhutta (2011) found that comple-
mentary food supplements with or without nutrition counseling,
significantly improves weight and height z-scores. Furthermore, the
provision of complementary food, with or without education, can
reduce stunting by 67 percent in food-insecure populations (Lassi
et. al. 2013).


Analytic Approaches Specific
to the Stunting Target
This section considers the methods used in the analysis that are
specific to the stunting target, looking at the applicable interventions,
assumptions about delivery, the selection of sample countries, and the
sources of data used as well as methods used to estimate impact. For
more detail on methodology, see chapter 2.


Interventions Included in the Analyses
Seven key interventions have strong evidence of effectiveness in
reducing stunting. Table 3.1 shows the pathways and estimates of the
impact each intervention has on the likelihood of stunting. Four of
these interventions are directed at pregnant women and mothers of
infants and young children; three are directed at infants and young
children (table 3.1). For women, antenatal micronutrient supplementa-
tion and infant and young child nutrition counseling would be scaled
up for all pregnant women, balanced energy-protein supplementation
would be scaled up for all pregnant women living under the pov-
erty line, and intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria would
be scaled up only for pregnant women living in malaria-endemic
regions.3 Vitamin A supplementation and prophylactic zinc supple-
mentation would be scaled up for all children 6–59 months of age, and

the public provision of complementary food would be scaled up for
all children living under the poverty line. The poverty line is defined as
persons living on less than $1.25 per day (World Bank 2009).4


Assumptions about Delivery Platforms
Several of the interventions—infant and young child nutrition coun-
seling, vitamin A supplementation for children, and intermittent
presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic
regions—have existing large-scale delivery platforms that could be
scaled up to increase coverage rates to full coverage. For other inter-
ventions, however, there is little experience with large-scale program-
ming and so assumptions have been made about delivery platforms.
For prophylactic zinc supplementation for children, for the purposes
of this analysis, zinc is assumed to be delivered in a manner similar to
that of multiple micronutrient supplementation through community-
based programs. Antenatal micronutrient supplementation is assumed
to be delivered through existing antenatal and postnatal services. Bal-
anced energy-protein supplementation for pregnant women could be
delivered through existing food distribution and/or social safety net
programs.


Sample Selection
Stunting cost estimates are based on a sample of 37 countries, which
includes 20 countries with the highest absolute burden (the number of
stunted children) and additional 17 countries with the highest stunt-
ing prevalence (a prevalence exceeding 40 percent, which is the WHO
threshold for a “very high” stunting prevalence) (see table 2.2 for the
list of countries). The 20 countries with the highest absolute burden
account for 77 percent of the burden worldwide and the 17 countries
with the highest prevalence account for an additional 7 percent, so
taken together this sample accounts for 84 percent of the global bur-
den of stunting.


Data Sources
Population and population growth estimates are obtained from the
UNDP World Population Prospects (UN DESA 2015a, 2015b). Current

intervention coverage data are extracted from the most recent Demo-
graphic and Health Surveys. Current coverage for antenatal micronu-
trient supplementation, balanced energy-protein supplementation for
pregnant women, and prophylactic zinc supplementation is assumed
to be 0 percent because no countries implement those interventions at
scale. The cost and impact of intermittent presumptive treatment of
malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions are estimated only
for Sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria incidence is high enough to
justify this intervention.


Estimating Impact
The additional effect of the seven nutrition interventions on stunting
prevalence is modeled using LiST. The specific pathways and effect
estimates used in LiST are shown in figure 3.4. Overall, 37 coun-
try models are estimated and the results are combined to obtain a
population-weighted reduction in the overall prevalence in the sample
­
of countries. The same relative prevalence change is assumed to occur
in the remaining low- and middle-income countries not included
in the sample. Reductions in the number of stunted children in all
low- and middle-income countries are calculated by applying the
relative reduction in the number of stunted children in the sample to
the 2014 baseline estimate of the global number of stunted children
worldwide—159 million (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2015).
­

The impact of a scale-up of interventions is estimated in terms of
(1) the number of cases of stunting prevented in 2025 as compared
with the 2015 baseline; (2) the percent reduction in the number of chil-
dren who are stunted; and (3) the number of deaths among children
averted.

It is widely recognized that linear growth is affected by both direct
and indirect or underlying factors, and that improvements in the
underlying determinants of malnutrition will lead to reductions in
stunting prevalence. As such, our model estimates additional reduc-
tions in stunting that would be accrued from improvements in food
availability and food diversity; in women’s health status, education,
and empowerment; and in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).

For the WASH interventions, we estimated the impact on stunting
using LiST for five interventions: handwashing with soap, improved
excreta disposal, improved water source, hygienic disposal of chil-
dren’s stool, and water connection at home.

For each of the 37 countries in the sample, a linear expansion of cover-
age is modeled from the level exhibited in 2016 to 90 percent in 2021
and maintenance of the 90 percent coverage from 2021 to 2025. These
interventions were not included in the analysis of total financing
needs because of the inability to proportionately allocate these costs to
nutrition programming. Costs for WASH and other nutrition-sensitive
interventions are likely much higher than those for the nutrition-­
specific interventions, and including them without proper apportion-
ment will probably skew the costing estimates.

The magnitude of the impact of the improvements in other underly-
ing conditions, such as food availability and food diversity, women’s
health status, education, and empowerment could not be directly
estimated using LiST. Recognizing that changes in these conditions
will also make a significant contribution to achieving the World
Health Assembly stunting reduction target, we approximated their
impact using estimates from Smith and Haddad (2015). Smith and
Haddad use a country-level regression model to assess the impact of
food availability (measured as average daily kilocalories consumed
per capita), food diversity (measured as the percentage of total diet
derived from non-staples), women’s education (measured as female
secondary enrollment rate), and women’s health and empowerment
(measured as female-to-male life expectancy ratio) on country-level
stunting prevalence. For each of the 37 countries in the sample, a trend
is calculated in each of the four variables based on the changes over
the previous five years (2011–15), with the assumption that the same
trend will continue over the 10-year period 2016–25. Using the regres-
sion coefficients reported in Smith and Haddad, reductions in stunting
during 2016–25, expected if the previous five-year trend continues,
are calculated. Data on women’s secondary enrollment and female-to-
male life expectancy ratio are from the World Development Indicators
(WDI) database. Data on food availability and diversity are extracted
from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food balance
sheets.

The potential reductions in stunting that result from improvement in
WASH and the other underlying determinants are combined with the
estimates from the 37 models to obtain a population-weighted reduc-
tion in the overall prevalence in the sample of countries.

Benefit-Cost Analyses
Benefits of the scale-up of the key nutrition-specific interventions
are calculated based on estimates of lives saved and cases of stunt-
ing averted obtained from the LiST model (see figure 3.4). In the base
case scenario, one life saved at age five was valuated as GDP per
capita. One case of stunting averted is valuated at 21 percent of GDP
per capita based on estimates of the impact of childhood stunting on
adult wages (Hoddinott et al. 2013); this result is adjusted to account
for the proportion of income from wages (see chapter 2 for detailed
methodology).

The economic benefits are approximated in all low- and middle-
income countries using the same methods used to approximate the
cost: multiply the total benefits by the inverse of the total proportion
of the stunting burden in the 37 high-burden countries included in the
sample (see chapter 2 for details). The benefit-cost ratio is calculated
by dividing the total discounted monetary benefits that will accrue to
the beneficiaries over their lifetime by the total discounted scale-up
costs. As described in chapter 2, a 3 percent discount rate is used for
both costs and benefits; in the sensitivity analysis, the discount rate is
varied to 5 percent.



Results
This section presents the results of the analysis of the interventions
described above for stunting, including costs, impacts, and benefit-
cost analysis.


Unit Costs
Summary measures of the unit costs by intervention are shown in
table 3.2. Micronutrient supplementation (vitamin A and prophylactic
zinc for children and antenatal micronutrient supplementation) have
the lowest unit costs, each at less than $4 a year (or $4 per pregnancy
in the case of antenatal micronutrients). The unit cost for intermittent
presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic
regions is equally low-cost: about $2.00 per pregnancy. The public pro-
vision of complementary food for children entails higher unit costs,
but it is important to note that these interventions are much more
narrowly targeted to those living under the poverty line. The cost of
providing one year of public provision of complementary foods for

children living in poverty is about $43 per year per child, and the cost
for providing balanced energy-protein supplementation for pregnant
women living in poverty is about $24. Appendix C provides detailed
unit costs and data sources for each target.


Total Scale-Up Costs
The total 10-year costs of scaling up the package of the seven interventions
affecting stunting are estimated to be $49.5 billion (table 3.3). This includes
$44.2 billion in direct service delivery and an additional $5.3 billion for
monitoring and evaluation, capacity building, and policy development.
Prophylactic zinc supplementation and the public provision of comple-
mentary food for young children together account for about 60 percent
of the intervention costs (32 and 29 percent, respectively). Infant and
young child nutrition counseling (including breastfeeding promotion and
counseling on appropriate complementary feeding) account for some
15 percent of the total cost, and balanced-energy protein supplementa-
tion for 16 percent. Antenatal micronutrient supplementation, vitamin A
supplementation for children, and intermittent presumptive treatment
of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions account for the
remainder of the estimated direct scale-up costs (5 percent, 2 percent,
and 1 percent, respectively).

During the five-year scale up period (2016–20), the expected resource
requirement is $16.3 billion; during the five-year maintenance phase
(2021–25) an additional $33.1 billion would be required (figure 3.5)
(for the rationale for the two phases of scale-up, see chapter 2).

About 50 percent of the estimated global cost ($23.5 billion) is needed
for the scale-up of nutrition interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa (fig-
ure 3.6), with South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific each accounting
for a little over 20 percent ($10.8 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively).
Two countries, India and China, account for about a quarter of the
global cost (26.3 percent) because of the large size of their populations
of children under age five and pregnant women, the beneficiaries of
the interventions included in the analyses.

The costs in South Asia and other regions decrease from 2020 through
2025 even though the intervention coverage level is maintained
through this period (see figure 3.7). This is because of the projected
population declines with greater uptake of family planning programs
and families having fewer children. In contrast, in Sub-Saharan Africa,

An Investment Framework for Nutrition
the costs of these interventions increase over the same period of time
because of projected population increases and slower uptake of family
planning programs.

Low-income countries account for about 30 percent of the total scale-
up cost (figure 3.8). Lower-middle income countries account for about
50 percent of the total scale-up cost, largely because three of the four
countries with the largest populations (India, Nigeria, and Pakistan)
are in that income group. Upper-middle-income countries account
for about 20 percent of the total scale-up cost; this is mostly driven by
China, because of its large population.

Impact
Together, scaling up the key nutrition-specific interventions to 90 per-
cent coverage along with expected improvements in the underlying
determinants of stunting are estimated to lead to about a 40 percent
decline in the number of stunted children by 2025, enabling the
achievement of the global target for stunting (figure 3.9). Scaling up
nutrition-specific interventions would result in a reduction of 19.5 per-
cent in the number of stunted children in the 37 high-burden countries

by 2025.5 The changes in the underlying determinants drive the
remaining decline in stunting. Assuming a similar relative reduction
in the other countries with the remaining 15.7 percent of the global
stunting burden, this translates into 65 million fewer children stunted
in 2025 than the 159 million children stunted in 2015. In addition, the
interventions would, over 10 years, prevent about 2.8 million deaths
in children under five years of age.

Comparing the costs and impacts of specific interventions shows that
the promotion of good infant and child nutrition and hygiene prac-
tices and vitamin A supplementation for children have the lowest cost
per case of stunting averted ($273 and $266, respectively) (table 3.4).6

    The model incorporates a country-specific population growth of children under five years of age.

 In this analysis, the two components of the promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and
hygiene practices—complementary feeding education and breastfeeding promotion—are evaluated
separately and then together. The low cost per case of stunting averted is driven largely by comple-
mentary feeding education.

Despite having low relative impact on stunting prevalence (because
vitamin A supplementation is modeled via diarrhea incidence),
vitamin A supplementation is a very low cost intervention, making
it highly cost-effective. Other interventions, especially those target-
ing pregnant women (for example, balanced energy-protein supple-
mentation for pregnant women) have a much higher cost per case of
stunting averted and are relatively less cost-effective. It is also worth
noting that some interventions that have a relatively high cost per case
of stunting averted have a relatively low cost per death averted (for
example, breastfeeding promotion) and vice versa (complementary
feeding education). Chapter 7 offers a more in-depth discussion of
cost-effectiveness and technical and allocative efficiency of interven-
tions targeting stunting and the other three nutrition targets consid-
ered in this report.


Benefit-Cost Analyses
Under the base case scenario, the scale-up of the key nutrition-specific
interventions is estimated to generate about $417 billion in annual eco-
nomic benefits over the productive lives of beneficiaries (discounted
at 3 percent) in low- and middle-income countries. The bulk of the
benefits (about 98 percent) would be the consequence of the cognitive
losses avoided in children under age five and the resulting improve-
ments in economic productivity. The remaining 2 percent would result
from premature mortality averted by the interventions. Comparing
those benefits with discounted costs yields a benefit-cost ratio of 10.5.
This means that one dollar invested in stunting reduction will gener-
ate more than 10 dollars in economic returns.

Changing the discount rate from 3 percent to 5 percent changes the
benefits from $417 billion to as much as $172 billion over the produc-
tive lives of the beneficiaries, with a benefit-cost ratio varying from
10.5 to 5.0. The results are sensitive to discount rate changes because,
although most of the costs are incurred immediately and are not much
affected by discounting, most of the benefits accrue in the future
and thus are affected by discounting much more than the costs (see
table 3.5). However, it needs to be noted that even under the more
conservative scenario with a 5 percent discount rate, the benefit-cost
ratio remains very comfortably above 1, indicating that preventing
stunting is a sound economic investment.

Discussion
The analyses make a number of important contributions to the exist-
ing literature. First, they provide estimates for the costs of reaching
the global targets for stunting. They find that significant investments
in both the high-impact interventions costed here and in underlying
determinants of stunting are required in order to achieve the target.

Cost estimates are consistent with the extant literature (see table 3.6).
Horton et al. (2010) combine hygiene promotion and community-level
WASH behavior change interventions with breastfeeding promotion
and complementary feeding education. This is probably why their
total costs are higher than those estimated by Bhutta et al. (2013) and
by our study. Also, the Horton et al. study includes the cost of iron
supplementation in pregnancy rather than multiple micronutrient
supplementation, which is the probably the reason that their estimates
of the cost of this intervention are lower.

Note: Intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic
regions is not included in these above-mentioned studies since financing for this inter-
vention is assumed to come from other health budgets; n.a. = not available.


Unlike the two previous studies, which estimate the cost of scaling up
from current coverage to 90 percent in one year, these analyses model
more realistic scale-up over 10 years and incorporates the under-five
population change dynamics. Bhutta et al. (2013) assumed these inter-
ventions would lead to a 20 percent reduction in stunting. In contrast,
these analyses directly model the stunting decline in each country
separately. For this reason, this model provides a more explicit analy-
sis of the declines in stunting prevalence over 10 years, rather than
assuming a given level of decline.

Another difference from previous studies is that the estimates pre-
sented here show higher costs for Sub-Saharan Africa than for South
Asia. This is mainly because, although the number of stunted children

70   	                                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
is greater in South Asia, the costs of addressing stunting are greater
in Sub-Saharan Africa because of high unit costs, particularly costly
food supplements. The estimated target populations are larger in Sub-­
Saharan Africa for two of the three most costly interventions: the public
provision of complementary foods for young children and balanced
energy-protein supplementation for pregnant women (see table 3.7).

The unit costs of nutrition interventions are assumed to be fixed over
the coming decade. Future analyses should assess new delivery mod-
els that could reduce unit costs and help nutrition technologies and
services become more efficient; this should be done through a combi-
nation of research and development, economies of scale, and changes
in service delivery models. Some of the interventions costed here are
ready for immediate scale-up, but there are binding constraints for
others (see chapter 7 for a detailed discussion of binding constraints).
For example, rates for vitamin A supplementation for children are
already relatively high and could be scaled up to full coverage rela-
tively easily.

There are some important limitations to the analyses presented above.
The cost estimates focus on the impact of nutrition-specific interven-
tions and do not include nutrition-sensitive interventions—those
delivered through sectors such as the agriculture, education, and
WASH sectors that have the potential to have an impact on nutrition
outcomes. The cost of improving women’s health and education and
the cost of food availability and diversity could not be estimated here
because there are no specific and well-defined intervention packages
to improve those outcomes. While assumptions, informed by the
literature, were made regarding how increasing female-to-male life
expectancy by 0.1 may affect stunting prevalence, without a well-
defined package of interventions it was not possible to estimate how
much increasing female-to-male life expectancy by 0.1 would cost.

WASH interventions are an exception to this rule. Estimates of the
impact of these interventions on diarrhea incidence are available and
their indirect impact on child nutrition outcomes, including stunting,
can be modeled. Therefore the LiST tool was used to model the impact
of WASH interventions on stunting prevalence. The costs of scaling up
WASH interventions have been estimated elsewhere (Hutton 2015).
Those estimates are not included here, because—while indispens-
able for achieving the stunting target—expanding the coverage of
the WASH interventions will be financed by the water and sanitation
sector. It needs to be noted that the benefit-cost analyses presented

An Investment Framework for Nutrition
above also do not include the impact of changes in the underlying
determinants of undernutrition on stunting prevalence. Only costs
and impacts of nutrition-specific interventions are included. The
estimates generated in this report assume a relatively rapid scale-up of
the interventions. Although this is ambitious, countries such as Peru
and Senegal (see box B9.1 and box B9.2) have shown that it is feasible.

Chapter 4
Reaching the Global Target for Anemia
Dylan Walters, Julia Dayton Eberwein, Lucy Sullivan,
and Meera Shekar




   Key Messages
   •	    Anemia is a condition where red blood cells in the body
         are not able to deliver oxygen to tissues. This leads to a
         higher risk of infections and impaired cognitive function
         and physical work capacity. Maternal anemia is associated
         with intrauterine growth restriction. The three particularly
         vulnerable groups are: pregnant women (age 15–49 years),
         non-pregnant women (age 15–49), and pre-school children
         (age 6–59 months).
   •	    Interventions to prevent anemia in pregnant and non-­
         pregnant women include antenatal micronutrient supple-
         mentation, intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria
         in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions, iron and folic
         acid supplementation for non-pregnant women of repro-
         ductive age, and staple food fortification.
   •	    Achieving the global target of reducing anemia in women
         of reproductive age would require $12.8 billion over
         10 years. This includes scaling up micronutrient interven-
         tions for non-pregnant women to unprecedented levels,
         and thus will require strong political will and effective
         delivery platforms.




Chapter 4  Reaching the Global Target for Anemia 	                      79
     •	    At full scale-up, investment in these four key interven-
           tions will reduce anemia for 265 million women globally
           over 10 years and reduce anemia prevalence to 15.4 percent
           among all pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproduc-
           tive age, averting nearly 800,000 child deaths. Preventive
           treatment for malaria in pregnant women, in particular, will
           prevent 7,000–14,000 maternal deaths.
     •	    The net return on this investment in low- and middle-
           income countries is $110.1 billion with a pooled benefit-cost
           ratio of 12.1.




A
         nemia is a widespread public health problem with vast
         human, social, and economic consequences. In 2012, the World
         Health Assembly called for a 50 percent reduction of anemia
among women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years), including both
non-pregnant and pregnant women (WHO and 1,000 Days 2014).1
This chapter reports on the costs of scaling up a set of key interven-
tions necessary to reach the anemia target, the impact of reaching the
target, and potential returns on investments.



Anemia and Its Effects
Anemia is defined as a low concentration of hemoglobin in the blood
or a low red-blood cell (also called erythrocyte) count. This condition
inhibits the delivery of oxygen to the body’s tissues. Anyone can be
affected by anemia, although children and women of reproductive age
in low- and middle-income countries are at highest risk.

Anemia can result in adverse health and developmental effects,
including maternal and perinatal mortality, intrauterine growth
restriction, and low birthweight of newborns. The morbidity associ-
ated with anemia in women of reproductive age can lead to lower
work productivity as a result of impaired cognitive functioning and

 Although anemia is a concern in both women of reproductive age (15–49 years of age) and young
children (6–59 months of age), the anemia target as set by the World Health Assembly refers only to
anemia in women of reproductive age—that is, both pregnant and non-pregnant women aged 15–49.
Throughout this report we use the term anemia in women to refer to anemia in women of reproduc-
tive age.

higher risk of infections and reduced physical work capacities (Ste-
vens et al. 2013; WHO 2015b; WHO and 1,000 Days 2014).

In 2011 the global prevalence of anemia was estimated to be 29 percent
for non-pregnant women and 38 percent for pregnant women—over
half a billion women total. Among these women, it is estimated that
19 million non-pregnant and 750,000 pregnant women suffer from
severe anemia (see table 4.2). Even though the prevalence of anemia in
women has declined by 12 percent since 1995, it remains a moderate
to severe public health problem in 142 of 182 World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) member states (Stevens et al. 2013; WHO 2015b; WHO
and 1,000 Days 2014).



Causes of Anemia
The determinants of anemia (see figure 4.1) cover the spectrum of
political, social, and economic factors as well climate change and food
diversity (Balarajan et al. 2011). Poorer and less-educated women are
more likely to be anemic, which, in turn, can be a strong predictor of
child anemia status. The WHO estimates that, because iron deficiency
is the most common direct cause of anemia, half of the world’s anemia
burden in women could be eliminated with iron supplementation
(WHO 2015b). It is estimated that the prevalence of iron deficiency
anemia alone is 19 percent in pregnant women and 18 percent in
children under five years of age around the world (Black et al. 2013).
The remaining cases are attributable to a number of other nutritional
causes (for example, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin A deficiencies)
and non-nutritional causes (for example, hookworm, sickle-cell, thal-
assemia, malaria, chronic infection, schistosomiasis, genetic condi-
tions, and so on) (Kassebaum et al. 2014; Stevens et al. 2013).



Interventions That Effectively Prevent Anemia
The 2013 Lancet Series on Maternal and Child Nutrition costed and
recommended the scale-up of one intervention—multiple micronutri-
ent supplementation—to prevent anemia in pregnancy, but did not
address the issue of anemia in the broader non-pregnant population
(Bhutta et al. 2013). In order to achieve the new global anemia target, a
multisectoral approach for both pregnant women and the larger non-
pregnant population of women is needed, plus efforts to address other

underlying determinants of anemia, such as poverty, a lack of educa-
tion, lack of dietary diversity, and gender equity.


Micronutrient Supplementation
It is estimated that approximately half of anemia in high-burden coun-
tries is the result of iron deficiency, but figures may vary by context.

82    	                                                          An Investment Framework for Nutrition
A Cochrane review of daily iron supplementation during pregnancy
estimates a 70 percent reduction in anemia among pregnant women
(Peña-Rosas et al. 2012). Antenatal multiple micronutrient supple-
ments, such as the UNICEF Multiple Micronutrient Preparation
(UNIMAP) supplement that contains 14 micronutrients, may provide
additional benefits to neonatal outcomes and early childhood stunt-
ing, although there is no difference in its effectiveness for reducing
maternal anemia compared to iron and folic acid supplementation
(Haider and Bhutta 2015). Therefore, despite the two to three times
higher costs, prioritizing the scale-up of antenatal multiple micronu-
trient supplementation may deliver the best long-term benefits for
both mother and child.

For non-pregnant women, an intermittent (weekly) dosage of iron
and folic acid supplementation is estimated to lead to a 27 percent
reduction of anemia (Fernández-Gaxiola and De-Regil 2011; WHO
2011a). In areas of high prevalence (greater than 40 percent), the WHO
recommends daily iron supplementation for this group (WHO 2016).
Table 4.1 shows recommended dosages for non-pregnant and preg-
nant women based on country anemia prevalence.

Three other emerging supplementation interventions have been con-
sidered to address anemia, but these are not yet recommended by the
WHO for full scale-up. Micronutrient powders were found to have
effects similar to those of multiple micronutrient supplementation

(WHO 2011b) and WHO guidelines for scaling up supplements are
forthcoming. Small quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements also
had effects similar to iron and folic acid supplementation in some
studies, but evidence of effectiveness is not yet conclusive (Choud-
hury et al. 2012; Suchdev, Peña-Rosas, and De-Regil 2015). Further-
more, evidence of the effect of vitamin A supplementation on anemia
in adolescents and pregnant women remains mixed (Michelazzo et al.
2013). Because these interventions have not yielded significant results,
there are no WHO guidelines for scaling these up as yet.


Food-Based Interventions
Food-based approaches—mainly through the fortification of sta-
ple grains and cereals and, less commonly, salt, sauces, and milk
products—have also shown to be effective in reducing anemia in
­
women (Gera, Sachdev, and Boy 2012). However, less is known about
the impact of these interventions at scale. Fortification of wheat flour
with iron and other micronutrients—which include zinc, folic acid,
and B vitamins—is mandatory in 81 countries, some of which also
require fortification of maize flour. Although Pachon et al. (2015)
found limited effectiveness of flour fortification reducing prevalence
of anemia in women, another review found that countries that fortify
wheat flour at WHO guideline levels,  after controlling for the level of
development as measured by the Human Development Index and for
malaria prevalence, yield a 2.4 percent reduction in the odds of ane-
mia in non-pregnant women per year compared with countries that
do not fortify (Barkley, Wheeler, and Pachon 2015). Therefore fortifica-
tion can prove beneficial for large-scale reduction in anemia in general
populations, and particularly among non-pregnant women.

Interventions to improve iron intakes through greater dietary diver-
sity of food produced on the homestead, biofortification, and increas-
ing meal frequency may have potential for future impact but are dif-
ficult to measure and have limited evidence of impact at scale to date
(Cercamondi et al. 2013; Olney et al. 2009).


Treatment of Diseases and Infections
In areas of moderate-to-high risk of malaria transmission, particularly
Sub-Saharan Africa, WHO guidelines recommend that all pregnant
women receive intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at each scheduled antenatal care
visit starting as early in the second trimester as possible, but coverage

84   	                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
remains low (WHO 2014). Intermittent presumptive treatment of
malaria in pregnancy has shown to reduce the risk of moderate-to-
severe anemia by 40 percent and the risk of any anemia by around
17 percent among women in their first or second pregnancy (Radeva-
Petrova et al. 2014). Evidence suggests that the use of insecticide-
treated bed nets to prevent malaria during pregnancy reduces anemia
by 5 to 12 percent, but these results are not statistically significant
(Gamble, Ekwaru, and ter Kuile 2006). Overall, preventing anemia
by reducing malaria transmission can be an effective intervention for
pregnant women. Although hookworm infection and human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV) are associated with anemia, deworming and
antiretroviral therapy have not been shown to reduce anemia.2



Analytic Approaches Specific
to the Anemia Target
This section lays out the methods used in the analyses that are specific to
estimating the financing needs, impact, and benefit-cost ratios of reach-
ing the anemia target. For more detail on methodology, see chapter 2.


Measurement of Anemia in Women
Anemia in women refers to anemia in women of reproductive age,
which includes all non-pregnant women 15 to 49 years of age and all
pregnant women.

Anemia in women, for the purposes of the World Health Assembly
target, is measured by the prevalence of any form of anemia spanning
from mild to severe forms (WHO 2015a; WHO and 1,000 Days 2014)
in the above-mentioned target groups (table 4.2). Data on anemia, or
low concentrations of hemoglobin, are collected through the Demo-
graphic and Health Surveys (DHS), Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS),
Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS), national micronutrient sur-
veys or Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), or other similar
national surveys and modeled to estimate the prevalence of women
below the cutoff of 110 grams of hemoglobin per liter of blood for

2
 Hookworm infection is associated with the prevalence of anemia in both pregnant and non-
pregnant women (Smith and Brooker 2010), but a review of deworming interventions, such as
antihelminthics, shows that they do not significantly impact hemoglobin levels or anemia prevalence
(Salam et al. 2015). Anemia is also a strong predictor of disease progression and death among people
infected with HIV, including those who have initiated anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Generally ART
improves hemoglobin status but it does not always resolve anemia and, in some contexts, leads to a
higher risk of anemia (Johannessen et al. 2011; Takuva et al. 2013; Widen et al. 2015).

pregnant women and 120 grams per liter for non-pregnant women.
Anemia prevalence as of 2011 was 38 percent in pregnant women and
29 percent in non-pregnant women, translating to 32 million pregnant
women and 496 million non-pregnant women, respectively (Stevens
et al. 2013).

In the country sample used in the analyses, prevalence of anemia
among women ranges from 14.4 percent in Mexico to 57.5 percent in
Senegal, with 12 of 26 countries above 40 percent (high prevalence)
and 5 countries below 20 percent prevalence (high absolute burden).


Interventions Included in the Analyses
In order to achieve the World Health Assembly target for anemia in
women, the target population benefiting from anemia prevention
and control interventions will need to be significantly expanded from
the 125 million pregnant women to reach 1.5 billion non-pregnant
women of reproductive age. Achieving this ambitious target will
require approaches across multiple sectors. The analyses estimate the
costs and impact of scaling up a minimum core set of interventions
that (1) are applicable to all countries, (2) have a strong evidence base
for effectiveness in preventing anemia, and (3) together can plausibly
achieve the proposed target.

Applying these criteria in consultation with the Technical Advisory
Group (see appendix A), the analyses estimate the financing needs for
scaling up four core anemia prevention interventions: (1) antenatal
micronutrient supplementation, (2) intermittent presumptive treat-
ment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions; (3) iron
and folic acid supplementation in non-pregnant women 15–49 years
of age, and (4) staple food fortification (wheat flour, maize flour, and

rice) with iron for the general population at WHO guideline levels
(see table 4.3). Since targeting the fortification of staple foods to a
subgroup of women would not be feasible, nor is it recommended,
and since anemia affects men as well, the target beneficiaries for staple
food fortification are the entire general population (males and females
of all ages).

a. WHO guidelines are expected in late 2016.


Antenatal micronutrient supplementation is included in the analyses
for pregnant women instead of iron and folic acid ­  supplementation—
despite its higher costs—because of its effectiveness in improving
birth outcomes and thereby preventing childhood stunting. In addi-
tion, this allows the analysis for the anemia target to align with the
stunting target and to avoid any underestimation. New WHO guide-
lines on antenatal micronutrient supplementation are expected in late
2016, after which this strategy can go to scale.3

Daily iron and folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women
is recommended by the WHO for countries where the prevalence of
anemia is greater than 40 percent. For the large population of non-­
pregnant women, weekly iron and folic acid supplementation is
included in the analyses because of the greater feasibility of delivering
a weekly supplement than a daily supplement. In this population, the
analysis assumes supplementation is delivered to adolescent girls age
15–19 through school programs and to other non-pregnant girls and
women through community health workers, outpatient visits, and the
private marketplace (see table 4.4).

anemia (table 4.3). Though not included in this package, it is also
important for the health system to provide for the treatment for ane-
mia where feasible; this may require medical consultations, testing,
and diagnosis of the cause in addition to micronutrient supplemen-
tation. This may be particularly important for women with severe
anemia, which has a prevalence of only 1.8 percent in non-pregnant
women and 2.0 percent in pregnant women globally (Stevens et al.
2013).


Sample Selection
The analysis for the anemia target is based on a sample of 26 coun-
tries, which includes 20 countries with the highest absolute bur-
den and an additional 6 countries with the highest prevalence (see
table 2.2 for the list of countries). The threshold for highest prevalence
is a prevalence rate of anemia in women of reproductive age greater
than 50 percent. Altogether, the sample accounts for 82 percent of the
global burden of anemia in women of reproductive age.4


Estimating Costs
The total additional costs of achieving the anemia target is the sum
of the annual costs of scaling up the four selected core interventions
from baseline coverage levels in 2015 to full coverage over a 10-year
timeframe for the sample of countries identified in chapter 2 (see
table 2.2).

 For the purposes of this report, the term anemia in women of reproductive age has been shortened to
anemia in women.

Unit costs for these interventions are derived from either the pro-
gram or the ingredients approaches, depending on data availability.
The cost of the iron and folic acid supplement per woman per year
($0.12) is obtained from the OneHealth Tool manual (Futures Institute
2013), to which a 10 percent transportation cost is added. In addi-
                                                             pregnant
tion, the costs of four different delivery platforms for non-­
women are included since there is no existing platform from which
to extrapolate (table 4.4). The cost of delivery through school-based
programs for girls age 15–19 enrolled in secondary school (World
Bank 2016) includes an additional program cost of $0.33 for the Sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia regions and $0.50 for other regions
(WHO 2011c).5 Up to 30 percent of women living above the poverty
line are assumed to potentially purchase iron and folic acid supple-
ments through private retailers similar to coverage levels achieved
with micronutrient powder distribution in some cases (Bahl et al.
2013), although this could vary widely across contexts.

Bahl et al. (2013) find that, on average, multiple micronutrient supple-
ments are sold with an 83 percent markup. Therefore this analysis
assumes that private retailers would mark up the cost of iron and
folic acid supplements to the same degree. Of the remaining women
and girls above and below the poverty line, 70 percent are assumed
to be able to access iron and folic acid supplements through consul-
tations with a community health worker and 30 percent through a
consultation in a hospital setting with a nurse. The distribution of
iron and folic acid supplements to a woman is estimated to require
two consultations of five minutes each with a health worker per year.
Human resources for health costs are estimated by multiplying the
time allocation for all annual consultations by salary estimates for
community health workers, which range from $80 to $917 per month
(Casey et al. 2011; Dahn et al. 2015; Maternal and Child Health Inte-
grated Program 2011), and nurse salaries, which range from $3,047 to
$40,265 per annum in sample countries (WHO 2005). Five countries
in the sample have a prevalence of anemia in women below the WHO
threshold of 20 percent for this intervention, but were selected because
of their high absolute burden of anemia. However, a maximum attain-
able coverage of 75 percent is assumed for countries with a prevalence
of between 15 and 19 percent (that is, China, Brazil, and Ethiopia) and
50 percent for countries with a prevalence below 15 percent (that is,
Mexico and Vietnam.

  A program unit cost, in addition to the cost of the micronutrient supplement, is included in order
to develop and sustain the infrastructure with the education system and schools for the effective
delivery to adolescent girls.

Estimating the costs of staple food fortification is challenging since
there are large gaps in data regarding food consumption and forti-
fication coverage as well as a wide variability of fortification costs
between settings (Fiedler and Puett 2015; Fiedler, Sanghvi, and
Saunders 2008). Primary sources of cost and coverage data are from
the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) costing model
(Ghauri et al. 2016) and the Food Fortification Initiative (FFI) coverage
data (Pachon 2016). The per capita fortification unit costs are lowered
to 0 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent if the available data suggest
that there is, respectively, no, low, or moderate demand for consump-
tion for each particular type of food staple in each country—this is an
attempt to take into account dietary differences across populations.
Baseline coverage of fortified foods is assumed to be 50 percent in
countries that have legislated mandatory fortification of wheat flour,
maize flour, and rice to reflect the fact that small and medium-sized
mills and food producers may be excluded from legislation. The
estimated total cost is the product of the unit cost for each food in each
country and the gradual scale-up of fortification to the whole country
between baseline coverage in 2015 and full potential coverage.

Following the GAIN costing model, domestic governments and
donors would each be responsible for approximately 5 percent of
the total costs—mainly for start-up programs and social marketing
costs—and the remaining 90 percent would be borne by the private
sector to be recouped through consumer sales of fortified products.
The costs of fortifying all other foods, such as vegetable oil, dairy
products, and other vegetables or grains, are not included, nor are the
costs of biofortification explicitly included since there may be overlap
or redundancy in fortification vehicles. Costing of two interventions—
antenatal micronutrient supplementation and intermittent presump-
tive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions—
uses a methodology similar to the stunting target (see chapter 3).


Estimating Impact
For the impact analysis, a model in Microsoft Excel was developed to
parallel the pathways for interventions that affect anemia in women
in the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) (Bhutta et al. 2013; Walker, Tam, and
Friberg 2013; Winfrey, McKinnon, and Stover 2011). The specific
pathways and effect sizes used in this model are shown in figure 4.2.
Preventative interventions for the non-pregnant female population are
included in this model, but not other modeling tools. Effect sizes of
interventions are taken from recent systematic reviews (see table 4.3).

The Excel model computes the number of cases of anemia in women
averted in each sample country over the 10-year scale-up of interven-
tions compared with the baseline. A limitation of all these models is
the inability to differentiate between mild, moderate, and severe cases
of anemia (see table 4.2). The number of child and maternal deaths
averted attributed to the scale-up of interventions that affect anemia
is estimated using LiST.6 Because it is not possible to distinguish
between the effects of iron and folic acid supplementation and those
of food fortification on mortality in the model, it is assumed that the
child deaths averted are attributable to the combined impact of the
two interventions. The analyses did not estimate potential reductions
in low birthweight and small for gestational age of children born to
anemic mothers.

In addition, a historical trend for declining anemia rates is assumed
to extend over the next 10 years. The modeled 1.1 percent decline per
year in anemia rates is based on the WHO Global Nutrition Tracker
dataset (WHO 2015a). This trend may capture the effects of underly-
ing determinants of anemia—such as food diversity, levels of women’s
education, and previous delivery of interventions at lower coverage
levels. The cost per case-year of anemia averted and the cost per death
averted by these interventions are also estimated in order to assess the
allocative efficiency of each intervention and the full package.


Benefit-Cost Analyses
The benefit-cost analysis of investing in the selected anemia inter-
ventions uses a methodology similar to that for the stunting target
(see chapter 3). Monetary benefits, are estimated for three economic
outcomes attributed to reductions in the prevalence of anemia in
women: (1) female earnings gained as a result of increased productiv-
ity, (2) earnings gained as a result of maternal deaths averted, and
(3) earnings gained as a result of child mortality averted. The outputs
from the Excel model for projected anemia prevalence reductions and
the LiST results for the number of maternal and child deaths averted
over the 2016–25 period are inserted as inputs into the benefit-cost
analysis. This approach is used by Horton and Ross (2003, 2007) and
Casey et al. (2011) for estimating the earnings gained by women as
a result of increased productivity in terms of gross domestic prod-
uct (GDP) per capita, in which a 50 percent labor share of GDP is
assumed. The earnings gained are estimated as the product of the

    A beta version of LiST (version 5.41 beta 13) is used for the analyses.

number of cases of anemia averted because of interventions and
the higher wages in manual occupations because of higher produc-
tivity without anemia (wages are 5 percent higher for light labor,
17 percent higher for heavy manual labor, and 4 percent for other
work). The female labor force participation rate is also factored in
using the International Labour Organization’s ILOSTAT database so
as not to overestimate the number of employed women (ILO 2015).
Productivity-related earnings gained in adults are assumed to be
­
incurred in the same year as the intervention is delivered (Horton and
Ross 2003).

Estimating the earnings gained related to mortality averted uses the
same methodology as in the stunting target analysis, which assumes
that earning gains would be incurred for children over their work-
ing lives from age 18 until mean life expectancy in each country or 65
years of age, whichever is lower. For earnings gains due to maternal
mortality averted as a result of the intermittent presumptive treatment
of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions, earnings gained
between the mean maternal age in each country until the mean life
expectancy or 65 years of age, whichever is lower, is estimated (World
Bank 2016). A 3 percent GDP growth rate is assumed across countries,
which is lower than the historical average of low- and middle-income
countries. The analysis varies the discount rates of benefits and costs
to 3 percent and 5 percent for comparison, as done in Horton and
Hoddinott (2014).

This benefit-cost analysis does not include potential benefits, includ-
ing savings from reduced health care costs for the diagnosis and treat-
ment of anemia, other indirect consequences of anemia in women,
and benefits of reduced anemia in children and men attributed to the
scale-up of staple food fortification. In that sense, the total benefits
described are underestimates.


Sensitivity Analyses
As mentioned above, there are gaps in data required for the analy-
ses, particularly related to projections for feasible scale-up scenarios
of interventions, the effectiveness of fortification, and unit costs
for emerging delivery platforms. One-way sensitivity analyses are
presented for the key drivers of costs, impacts, and benefit-cost ratios
by altering several variables for each analysis. Sensitivity analyses
are presented for the total 10-year costs of anemia interventions with
the following variable changes: (1) removing public sector human

resource for health delivery costs for iron and folic acid supplementa-
tion, (2) adjusting the target coverage of iron and folic acid supple-
mentation in the five countries with a prevalence of anemia below
the 20 percent WHO guideline threshold to coverage ranging from
0 percent to 100 percent (signifying fully including or excluding in
those countries),7 and (3) lowering the maximum scale-up coverage
achievable for all interventions from 90 percent to a more feasible
50 percent or 75 percent. The impact sensitivity analysis shows the
change in impact expected by varying the same last two variables as
in the cost sensitivity plus the effectiveness of food fortification equal
to no effect (0 percent reduction of anemia per year) and the effective-
ness of the other three interventions to the lower and upper bounds of
the 95 percent confidence interval estimates stated in the literature.



Results
This section presents the results of the analyses of the interventions
described above, including costs, impacts, and benefit-cost results.


Unit Costs
The unit costs employed in the analyses for the interventions targeting
pregnant women are the same as those used for the stunting target in
chapter 3. The costing literature for interventions for anemia preven-
tion in non-pregnant women is less well established, and micronutri-
ent costs are known to vary widely between contexts (Fiedler, Sang-
hvi, and Saunders 2008; Fiedler and Semakula 2014). See table 4.5 for
a list of the minimum, maximum, and population-weighted mean
unit cost by intervention used across the sample countries. Gaps in
cost data are filled by proxy values from a similar country in the same  
region or income group.


Total Scale-Up Costs
The total additional costs of scaling up the selected core set of inter-
ventions necessary to meet the World Health Assembly anemia target
in low- and middle-income countries is approximately $12.9 bil-
lion from domestic government resources and official development
assistance (ODA) from 2016 to 2025. Under this scale-up scenario, the

The five countries with anemia prevalence below 20 percent are Brazil, China, Ethiopia, Mexico, and
7

Vietnam (Stevens et al. 2013).

total annual additional costs would escalate from baseline to $1.7 bil-
lion by 2021 (see figure 4.3), and would then increase slightly over the
maintenance phase because of the population growth in women of
reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries. The majority
of domestic government and ODA financing needs are for iron and
folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women ($6.7 billion)
and smaller investments for staple food fortification for the general
population ($2.4 billion), for antenatal micronutrient supplementation
($2.0 billion), and for intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in
pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions ($337 million).

In addition, there are further household costs in the amount of
$505 million for the purchase of iron and folic acid supplementation
by a share of women above the poverty line and $19.1 billion for the
expected incremental additional cost of fortified foods (compared with
unfortified foods) purchased by households (table 4.6).

East Asia and the Pacific region requires a $5.24 billion share of the
total financing needs, while Sub-Saharan Africa ($2.50 billion) and
South Asia ($2.45 billion) each require smaller shares of the total
10-year public sector/official development assistance cost, respectively

(figure 4.4). The total cost for East Asia and the Pacific is greater than
it is for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa in this model primarily
because of the higher quantity of fortified rice expected to be con-
sumed proportional to other less costly fortified foods in other regions
as well as higher delivery costs for iron and folic acid supplementa-
tion than in the South Asia and African regions. By income group,
low-income countries account for 13 percent of the total costs, lower-
middle-income countries for 40 percent, and upper-middle-income
countries for 47 percent (figure 4.5).


Sensitivity Analyses of Estimates of Financing Needs
The total costs for reaching the anemia target are sensitive to changes
in several key variables. One of the uncertainties pertaining to this
analysis is the unprecedented scale-up of iron and folic acid supple-
mentation for non-pregnant women, which is needed to meet the

target. The sensitivity analysis tornado diagram (figure 4.6) shows
that, if public health system personnel costs are removed (which
would be possible only if this intervention could be bundled with
an already existing intervention for this population group), the total
10-year financing needs would decrease by $7 billion. Another factor
that has a large effect on total financing needs is the scale-up of iron
and folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women in the five
countries that have less than a 20 percent prevalence of anemia. Ini-
tially either 50 percent or 75 percent of the female populations in these
countries have been included as potential target beneficiaries. Exclud-
ing the scale-up in countries with less than 20 percent national preva-
lence would reduce the global costs by about $3 billion over 10 years,
but there would be a tradeoff in terms of prevalence reductions.
Lowering the maximum attainable coverage level for all interventions
to 75 percent or 50 percent would be more realistic and would lower
the total 10-year costs by $4 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Replac-
ing the private sector delivery of iron and folic acid supplementation
for non-pregnant women living above the poverty line with public
sector delivery would add about $2 billion in human resource costs for
delivery over 10 years.

An Investment Framework for Nutrition
Impact
The model suggests that there is a scenario, albeit an ambitious one,
whereby the World Health Assembly target for anemia in women can
be achieved by 2025. This investment in anemia prevention interven-
tions is projected to result in 265 million fewer anemic women in the
year 2025 compared with the baseline in 2015 (see figure 4.7). Under
this scenario, the prevalence of anemia is projected to decrease to
15.4 percent in 2025, resulting in 799,000 child deaths averted in the
next 10 years. This includes the impact of the four nutrition interven-
tions plus the continuation of the 1.1 percent per year annual rate of
reduction (that is, the historical trend) across all low- and middle-
income countries, based on the WHO Global Nutrition Tracker dataset
(WHO 2015a). In addition, the scale-up of intermittent presumptive
treatment of malaria in pregnant women in malaria-endemic regions
would prevent between 7,000 and 14,000 maternal deaths over the
next 10 years. The five countries with the highest total child deaths
averted in the projected scenario are India, Nigeria, Pakistan, China,
and Bangladesh,8 which together account for 63 percent of estimated
child deaths averted across all low- and middle-income countries.

In terms of allocative efficiency, both micronutrient interventions
demonstrate a relatively low cost per case-year for anemia compared
with the cost for intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in
pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions. Not surprisingly, the two
interventions targeting pregnant women—antenatal micronutrient
supplementation and intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria
in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions—demonstrate lower cost per
death averted than the interventions for non-pregnant women and the
population at large (table 4.7). The effects of iron and folic acid supple-
mentation and staple food fortification on child mortality are not mod-
eled separately because they have overlapping causal pathways for
anemia and mortality and are modeled jointly in LiST.


Sensitivity Analyses of the Impact of the Scale-Up
This global projection for achieving the World Health Assembly target
for the reduction in anemia prevalence over the next 10 years depends
on major assumptions about the collective ability to secure financing
and implement interventions on an unprecedented scale. The sensitiv-
ity analyses for impacts (see figure 4.8) demonstrate that reducing the

  The estimated number of child deaths averted is 286,854 in India; 83,612 in Nigeria; 65,762 in Paki-
stan; 36,825 in China; and 33,989 in Bangladesh.

a. This figure is the combined cost per death averted estimated to result from iron and
folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women and the cost of staple food fortifi-
cation in the pre-conceptual stage, since it was not possible to independently estimate
the impact on mortality of these interventions in the model.


attainable level of scale-up coverage or varying the effectiveness of
staple food fortification of other micronutrient interventions results in
underachieving the target by 5 to 10 percentage points. Furthermore,
if the assumption on the extension of the historic trend in declining
anemia rates does not continue, then the prevalence will underachieve
by an additional 0 to 10 percentage points.


Benefit-Cost Analyses
The benefit-cost analysis of investing in the modeled package of
interventions to prevent anemia in women suggests that there would
most likely be a positive return on investment for low- and middle-
income countries in the sample. Assuming a 3 percent GDP growth
rate across countries and 3 percent discount of costs and benefits proj-
ects a total net benefit from the investment in anemia prevention of
$110.1 billion over 10 years and a pooled benefit-cost ratio of 12.1 (the
median ­ benefit-cost ratio in sample is 10.6). When pooled by income
group, the result is a benefit-cost ratio of 4.2 for low-income countries,
15.2 for lower-middle-income countries, and 10.9 for upper-middle-
income countries, respectively (table 4.8). By region, this translates
into a benefit-cost ratio of 13.1 for Sub-Saharan Africa, 14.0 for South
Asia, and 10.9 East Asia and the Pacific.

Note: *Sample countries only.

Using 5 percent discount rates for comparison, the benefit-cost ratios
decrease slightly across the sample. This more conservative model
projects a total net benefit of over $66 billion and a pooled 8.2 benefit-
cost ratio across countries (median benefit-cost ratio in sample is 7.4).
In general, the benefit-cost analyses suggest that there would be a
positive return on investment and substantial productivity gains to be
generated from preventing anemia in women.


Discussion
Achieving the anemia target will improve the lives of millions of
women and their newborns and may contribute toward a more pro-
ductive economy. However, achieving this ambitious goal will be a
challenge because the current trend in the decline of prevalence rates
is vastly insufficient to reach the target. A major investment is needed
to rapidly scale up evidence-based interventions that reduce the bur-
den of anemia among women.
Chapter 4  Reaching the Global Target for Anemia 	                                                      105
Expanding micronutrient programs from the current focus on chil-
dren and pregnant women to all the 1.5 billion non-pregnant women
in low- and middle-income countries requires a leap in supply chain
logistics and increased availability and access to health services.
Reaching the target also depends on large-scale expansion of food
fortification. Staple food fortification has been shown to be highly
effective and—with further advances in research and implementa-
tion at scale—could well be part of the solution. For example, iodized
salt is one of the most effective interventions for reducing disabilities
including cognitive losses due to iodine deficiency. It is mandated in
several countries throughout the world, but in most regions, cover-
age has reached only 50 percent to 70 percent of households (Mannar
2014). It is not, however, incorporated into this analysis because iodine
deficiency is not included in the global targets.

The analyses are limited by the quality of the data and the validity
of assumptions made in their place. The cost analysis could be vastly
improved with more rigorous unit cost data and food consumption
coverage data. Additional ex-post evaluations and a review of case
studies on real-world scale-up scenarios as well as an analysis of both
barriers and enablers to scale up would also be helpful so that the
models can more accurately reflect reality.

Anemia in women is easily preventable through low-cost interven-
tions that provide positive returns on investment and reduce its signif-
icant mortality costs. Reducing anemia in women may also contribute
to reducing gender wage gaps and help some women escape poverty.
Governments, donors, and communities should together seize the
opportunity to increase investment in anemia prevention and control.

for Breastfeeding

   Key Messages
   •	    Optimal breastfeeding promotes child growth and cogni-
         tive and socio-emotional development, prevents childhood
         illness and death, and protects against maternal morbidity,
         including breast cancers. It also protects against diseases in
         adulthood and enhances future incomes and labor-market
         productivity of children in adulthood.
   •	    The World Health Assembly set the target of increasing
         exclusive breastfeeding for infants up to six months of age
         from 37 percent in 2012 to 50 percent by 2025.
   •	    Creating an enabling culture and environment in support of
         breastfeeding requires interventions to provide education
         and counseling to mothers, widespread media campaigns
         to promote optimal breastfeeding practices, as well as the
         development of appropriate policies and legislation to pro-
         tect exclusive breastfeeding.
   •	    The estimated global financing required to scale up a core
         set of interventions across all low- and middle-income
         countries to achieve the World Health Assembly target for
         exclusive breastfeeding by 2025 is $5.7 billion, or approxi-
         mately $4.70 for every newborn.



Chapter 5  Reaching the Global Target for Breastfeeding 	                 113
      •	   The extension of maternity leave cash benefits from cur-
           rent status to six months in duration, which may increase
           breastfeeding rates and generate other social, health, and
           developmental benefits, is estimated to cost an additional
           $24.1 billion over 10 years, albeit these resources will need
           to come from other sectors.
      •	   This investment in protecting and promoting breastfeed-
           ing is estimated to prevent over 520,000 child deaths over
           10 years and to generate a pooled benefit-cost ratio of 35.
      •	   Although achieving this target requires substantial effort,
           it appears less ambitious than the other global nutrition
           targets. The sensitivity analyses presented in this chapter
           show that there may be scope to go beyond the current
           target by 2025 or 2030.




T
       he World Health Assembly set a global nutrition target to
       “increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six
       months to 50 percent” globally by 2025 (WHO and UNICEF
2014). This chapter reports on the estimated global financing needs
of key breastfeeding interventions needed to reach this target and
presents the estimated impacts and returns on investment of those
interventions. These results are intended to inform the prioritization
of investments by governments, official development assistance, and
other stakeholders.



Optimal Breastfeeding and Its Benefits
Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as the practice of giving an infant only
breastmilk for the first six months of life, with no other food, other
liquids, or even water (UNICEF 2011). Optimal breastfeeding practices
also include the early initiation of breastfeeding immediately after
birth and continued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond.
Optimal breastfeeding could have the single largest potential impact
on child mortality of any preventive intervention (Bhutta et al. 2013).

The evidence of the health, nutritional, cognitive, and long-term eco-
nomic benefits of breastfeeding is clear. Breastfeeding has protective

114    	                                    An Investment Framework for Nutrition
effects for newborns and young children that prevent common
diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia, which are the major causes
of child mortality (Victora et al. 2016). Breastfeeding may also reduce
the risk of childhood obesity and diabetes and, for nursing mothers,
reduce the risk of breast cancer later in life. Exclusive breastfeeding for
the first six months is also a natural contraceptive that can be helpful
in increasing birth spacing (Victora et al. 2016). Recent evidence shows
that breastfeeding is also associated with higher intelligence quotients
(IQs) (Horta, Loret de Mola, and Victora 2015) and, in the longer term,
with enhanced labor market and economic outcomes (Lutter 2016;
Rollins et al. 2016).



The State of Breastfeeding Worldwide
Victora et al. (2016) report that only 37 percent of infants younger
than six months globally are exclusively breastfed (Victora et al. 2016;
WHO and UNICEF 2014).1 The Global Nutrition Report suggests that
47 countries are off-course for reaching the breastfeeding target, and
a further 110 have missing data for this indicator (IFPRI 2016). Sub-
Saharan Africa and South Asia have experienced significant increases
in exclusive breastfeeding rates in the last two decades; however,
rates in the East Asia and Pacific region (excluding China) have been
stagnant (Cai, Wardlaw, and Brown 2012). Although beyond the scope
of this report, many high-income countries also have very low rates of
exclusive breastfeeding, and comparable data for many high-income
countries are lacking.

In low- and middle-income countries with available time-series
breastfeeding data, the rates of exclusive breastfeeding have increased
from 24.9 percent in 1993 to 35.7 percent in 2013 (Victora et al. 2016).
Furthermore, 36.3 million newborns and infants age 0–6 months in
low- and middle-income countries were not being properly fed at the
time of the most recent survey (see footnote 1) and face a preventable
risk of disease, cognitive and economic losses, and death. The recent
Lancet breastfeeding series estimates that optimal breastfeeding could
help prevent 823,000 child deaths per year and 20,000 maternal deaths
from breast cancer per year (Rollins et al. 2016; Victora et al. 2016). In
addition, the current low breastfeeding rates globally are estimated to
result in economic losses of about $302 billion annually, or 0.49 percent
of world gross national income (Victora et al. 2016).

    This finding is based on the most recent survey reports from countries included in the analysis.

The determinants of breastfeeding are complex. There are numerous
social, cultural, economic, and commercial forces that act as barriers
to breastfeeding or promote inadequate breastfeeding, as outlined
in figure 5.1 (Rollins et al. 2016). The pressures to not breastfeed also
increase as a country transitions to a higher income level.

Although there have been modest gains in exclusive breastfeeding
rates globally in recent years, the trends are not expected to continue
without investment in comprehensive breastfeeding strategies. Cur-
rent levels of investment in breastfeeding, though largely undocu-
mented, are perceived to be insufficient to increase rates beyond
where they are now (Holla-Bhar et al. 2015; Piwoz and Huffman 2015).

Given the undeniable benefits of breastfeeding and proven returns
on investment in terms of economic and human development gains,
greater investment is needed toward this highly cost-effective strategy.



Interventions That Effectively Promote
Breastfeeding
Having a comprehensive breastfeeding strategy at the national level
is the most effective way to influence the powerful social, economic,
and cultural forces affecting a mother’s decision to breastfeed (Rollins
et al. 2016) (see figure 5.1).

A comprehensive breastfeeding strategy is composed of several types
of interventions; the exact mix of interventions may vary from coun-
try to country, depending on the local context. For the purposes of
the analyses, two interventions for pregnant women and mothers
of young children (infant and young child nutrition counseling and
maternity leave cash benefits),2 as well as two interventions directed
at the entire society (pro-breastfeeding social policies and national
breastfeeding promotion campaigns) (table 5.1), are assumed to
comprise a minimum core of the comprehensive strategy applicable to
most contexts, which can be adapted and added to as need be.




In the analyses, maternity leave cash benefits refers to the actual cash transfer to the woman, not the
2

policy that required it. Any policies or guidelines on maternity leave benefits are included within the
pro-breastfeeding social policies intervention.

Counseling for Mothers and Caregivers on Good Infant and Young
Child Nutrition and Hygiene Practices
This intervention includes individual or group-based counseling ses-
sions delivered in the community and/or health facility to promote
exclusive breastfeeding, depending on country context. Breastfeed-
ing counseling or education delivered at the community level may be
required in countries with weak health systems and lack of access to
health facilities. A review by Haroon et al. (2013) demonstrates that
breastfeeding counseling results in a 90 percent increase in rates of
exclusive breastfeeding in infants age 0–5 months. Sinha et al. (2015)
also find that counseling delivered in a health facility or in the com-
munity increases the likelihood of breastfeeding when compared with
not receiving any counseling.


Pro-Breastfeeding Social Policies
Pro-breastfeeding social policies are designed to create an enabling
environment for breastfeeding and motivate maternal and house-
hold decision-making toward optimal child care and feeding prac-
tices. Among countries with an exclusive breastfeeding rate below
30 percent, those that rate high on a composite indicator for pro-­
breastfeeding social policies are estimated to have seen improvements
in exclusive breastfeeding by 1 percent per year, or five times higher
than countries with a low rating on this indicator (Rollins et al. 2016).
Estimating the effect sizes for each individual policy intervention is
challenging given their varying timing, degree of implementation, and
number of cofounders. In particular, the adoption and enforcement of
national legislation in line with the World Health Organization Inter-
national Code on Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes is considered
necessary to address aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes
(Baker et al. 2016).3

Access to maternity leave is associated with higher rates of breast-
feeding (Sinha et al. 2015) and even lower infant mortality in some
countries (Nandi et al. 2016). For new mothers who are working,
one study found that national policies guaranteeing breastfeeding
breaks in the workplace were associated with an increase in the rate
of exclusive breastfeeding of infants younger than six months of age


3
 To date, 39 countries have fully legislated the International Code on Marketing of Breastmilk Substi-
tutes while another 96 have some legal measures in place, although many continue to lack resources
for monitoring implementation and enforcement against violations of the Code (WHO, UNICEF, and
IBFAN 2016).

by 8.9 percentage points (Rollins et al. 2016). Although most low- and
middle-income countries have some form of maternity leave and pro-
tection policies in position, only a few have adequate enforcement of
laws or a sustainable financing scheme in place.

The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, established in 1991 by the WHO
and UNICEF as a broad program designed to strengthen the culture of
breastfeeding in hospitals (Labbok 2012), may also be a policy option
for certain countries. The integration of the WHO Ten Steps of Suc-
cessful Breastfeeding (WHO 1998) into existing hospital accreditation
systems is an important policy approach in that direction. The specific
orientation of pro-breastfeeding social policies in each country will
vary because of country context, but the core policies that foster a
culture that supports breastfeeding need resources for development,
legislation, monitoring, and enforcement.


Extension of Maternity Leave Benefits
Maternity leave cash benefits refer to a cash transfer to the woman,
from public funds or private employers, for a stipulated duration and
level of compensation, which varies widely by country. Cash benefits
reduce the opportunity cost for mothers of taking maternity leave
for caregiving of newborns and infants. Sinha et al. (2015) show that
maternity leave is associated with a 52 percent increase in exclusive
breastfeeding, but this is not specific to the effect of the extension of
maternity leave cash benefits or to certain durations or levels of cash
transfers. Maternity leave for new mothers probably also results in
broader social, developmental, and health benefits for working moth-
ers and their newborns. Furthermore, the high rates of informal sector
work in low- and middle-income countries adds to the low coverage
of maternity leave cash benefits and, therefore, limits the popula-
tion reach of these benefits. However, these benefits will be more and
more important for working mothers as wealthier and transitioning
economies develop (Rollins et al. 2016). More research is needed on
the effect of maternity leave cash benefits and workplace interventions
on breastfeeding.


National Breastfeeding Promotion Campaigns
Evidence suggests that mass media campaigns to promote breast-
feeding are important elements in increasing national breastfeeding
rates. Sinha et al. (2015) show that strategies with media intervention
integrated with counseling and community mobilization may have

a significant effect on increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates. As an
example of what is possible, the integrated Alive & Thrive program in
Vietnam (see box 9.3 in chapter 9)—which includes a mass media cam-
paign at scale in addition to infant and young child nutrition counsel-
ing and advocacy for pro-breastfeeding social policies—demonstrated
a total 28.3 percentage point increase in exclusive breastfeeding for
the first six months compared to control sites over the period 2010–14
(Walters et al. 2016). There are positive signs that investing in large-
scale media promotion and social marketing are important for coun-
teracting the influence of marketing for breastmilk substitutes and
developing a culture that supports optimal breastfeeding.



Analytic Approaches Specific to the
Breastfeeding Target
The methods for estimating costs, impacts and benefit-cost ratios are
presented in chapter 2; this section reviews important definitions,
sample selection, and data specific to the breastfeeding target.


Measuring Exclusive Breastfeeding
In 2012, the indicator selected to measure progress with regard to
exclusive breastfeeding was the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
for all infants in the first six months of age (WHO and UNICEF 2014).
The primary source of breastfeeding practice data for this analysis,
the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indica-
tor Cluster Surveys (MICS) household surveys, asks mothers if they
have breastfed their infants within the last 24 hours. Exclusivity of
breastfeeding is determined by mothers reporting that infants did not
receive any liquids or foods while breastfeeding. The data on national
exclusive breastfeeding for this analysis is drawn from the WHO/
UNICEF Global Nutrition Tracker (September 2015 version) (WHO
2015). India’s exclusive breastfeeding rate of 65 percent, found in the
recent Rapid Survey of Children (RSOC), is included in this analysis
since the previous survey reported was a decade ago (Government of
India and UNICEF 2015).


Sample Selection
The estimates in this chapter are based on a sample of 27 coun-
tries (20 with the highest absolute burden and 7 with exclusive

Chapter 5  Reaching the Global Target for Breastfeeding 	            121
breastfeeding prevalence lower than 10 percent). These 27 countries
account for 78 percent of the burden of non-exclusively breastfed
infants (up to six months of age) (see table 2.2 for the list of countries.)
A multiplier of 1.28 was then used to extrapolate the sample cost to all
low- and middle-income countries.


Interventions Included in the Analyses
As discussed above, the most effective way to increase rates of exclu-
sive breastfeeding requires implementing a comprehensive strat-
egy that includes, at minimum, pro-breastfeeding social policies, a
national breastfeeding promotion campaign, and infant and young
child nutrition counseling for expectant and new mothers. These inter-
ventions are included because they (1) are applicable to all countries,
(2) address multiple levels of complex factors affecting breastfeeding,
and (3) together can plausibly achieve the estimated impact on the
rate of exclusive breastfeeding. In the long term, it is also important
to reduce the perceived opportunity costs of breastfeeding either
through maternity leave and cash benefits or workplace supports. The
analyses estimate the global costs of extending maternity leave cash
benefits for working mothers in the formal sector, but these costs are
not included in the package of nutrition-specific interventions since it
is an intervention that aims to achieve multiple social, economic, and
health outcomes and will need to be financed from other sectors. See
table 5.1 for further descriptions and effect size estimates used in the
impact analyses. While all these interventions may have an indepen-
dent effect on exclusive breastfeeding, only the effect of nutrition
counseling is included in the impact model, whereas the costs include
the cost of scaling up all four interventions. Therefore the overall
benefit-cost ratios are an underestimate.


Estimating Unit Costs
Because of a lack of cost data on policy and media interventions at
scale, the annual national unit costs of the pro-breastfeeding social
policies and national breastfeeding promotion campaigns are based
on the experience of the Alive &Thrive program (Alive & Thrive 2013,
2014; Walters et al. 2016). The following assumptions are made: there
are combined national costs for the pro-breastfeeding social policies
and national breastfeeding promotion campaigns interventions of
$1.0 million, $3.0 million, $5.0 million, and $10 million in countries
with a population of less than 10 million, 10–50 million, 50–250 mil-
lion, and more than 250 million, respectively. Twenty percent of the
122   	                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
national costs are earmarked for the pro-social breastfeeding social
policies and 80 percent for the national breastfeeding promotion
campaigns. It is assumed that economies of scale could be achieved
for these two interventions in larger countries. Unit costs for infant
and young child nutrition counseling come from a review of literature
on cost data (see appendix C). Since the target definition is specific to
exclusive breastfeeding until six months, and not optimal breastfeed-
ing until age two, costs include only one year of infant and young
child nutrition counseling intervention delivery per mother and child
pair.4 The unit costs for the extension of maternity leave cash benefits
include the costs of extending cash benefits from current duration to
six months paid from public sources at a rate of 67 percent of mini-
mum wage level in each country (ILO 2015).


Estimating Existing Levels of Coverage
For breastfeeding counseling, the analyses rely on the Lives Saved
Tool (LiST) default rate for breastfeeding promotion coverage in
each country, which is equivalent to the exclusive breastfeeding rate
of infants age 1–5 months. Although this measure has weaknesses,
mainly because there is wide variation in what constitutes “counsel-
ing” and coverage varies accordingly,5 it is considered the best avail-
able measure at this time. Similar analyses in the future would benefit
from standardized data on counseling coverage. Existing coverage of
pro-social breastfeeding is estimated based on qualitative evidence
of full or partial implementation of the International Code of Breast-
milk Substitutes (WHO, UNICEF, and IBFAN 2016) and maternity
leave policies (ILO 2015). Coverage of maternity leave cash benefits
is estimated as the product of female labor force participation rate
and the International Labour Organization (ILO) coverage in practice
estimates for each country.6


Estimating Total Costs
The costing methodology is similar to all other targets included in the
analyses. The total additional financing needs of achieving the target

This is different from what was costed to achieve the stunting target, which included two years of
4

promotion of good infant and young child nutrition and hygiene (see chapter 3).
5
 For some, “counseling” may be a short interaction between a pregnant woman and a health care
professional as part of antenatal care. At the other end of the spectrum, “counseling” may entail up
to 15 nutritional consultations from pregnancy through the infant’s second year of life.
6
 The ILO estimates the coverage in practice of maternity leave cash benefits for women in each
country; this is defined as the number of people who have the right to receive benefits but are not
necessarily currently beneficiaries.

Chapter 5  Reaching the Global Target for Breastfeeding 	                                         123
is the sum of the annual additional costs of scaling up the core inter-
ventions from baseline coverage level to full coverage, assuming the
same linear scale-up scenarios from current to full coverage in the first
five years plus a five-year maintenance phase is used. The number of
beneficiaries (that is, mother-child pairs) for infant and young child
nutrition counseling and maternity leave is calculated by subtracting
the number of twin pairs at birth from the population of children at
birth (WHO 2015).


Estimating Impacts
For the impact analyses, a Microsoft Excel model was developed to
parallel the approach used by LiST (Bhutta et al. 2013; Walker, Tam,
and Friberg 2013; Winfrey, McKinnon, and Stover 2011). Although
multiple interventions are costed for the breastfeeding target, in the
final analysis only one intervention—infant and young child nutri-
tion counseling—is included in the impact model. The other policy
and media-oriented interventions are recommended interventions,
but there are too few effectiveness studies completed to confidently
include their effects in the impact model. The formulae and odds
ratios from the re-analysis of pooled estimates conducted by Sinha
et al. (2015) for the LiST update (version 5.41 beta 13) are used in the
model for estimating the impact of infant and young child nutrition
counseling on exclusive breastfeeding prevalence (see table 5.1). The
re-analysis suggests that children whose mothers receive breastfeed-
ing promotion intervention delivered in the health system, home/
community setting, and both health and community settings have
odds ratios of 2.5, 2.61, and 5.1, respectively, for being exclusively
breastfed compared to children whose mothers do not receive the
intervention. It is assumed that the effect size for delivery in the health
system is most suitable for upper-middle-income countries and deliv-
ery in home/community setting is suitable for low-income and lower-
middle-income countries. In order to be conservative in the impact
projections, the higher effect size option associated with the combined
delivery of breastfeeding promotion in both health system and home/
community setting is not used in the model for the analyses. In LiST,
breastfeeding promotion has an indirect effect on preventing neonatal
and infant mortality through diarrhea and acute respiratory infections
(that is, pneumonia). Therefore the breastfeeding counseling cover-
age projections from the Microsoft Excel model are inserted into LiST
to estimate the number of child deaths averted that is attributable to
breastfeeding promotion.


124   	                                   An Investment Framework for Nutrition
Benefit-Cost Analyses
The benefit-cost analyses of investing in breastfeeding include two
main types of monetary benefits attributed to increases in exclusive
breastfeeding prevalence: (1) earnings gains related to all-cause child
mortality averted and (2) earnings gains related to cognitive losses
averted in children. For the estimation of cognitive losses, this analysis
employs an approach similar to the method used in Rollins et al. 2016
and Walters et al. 2016. However, this analysis estimates the potential
earnings gains due to cognitive losses averted in children over their
entire adult working lives from age 18 until they reach their average
life expectancy or 65 years of age, whichever is earlier, rather than
potential earnings in a one-year steady-state period. Key factors for
this calculation are that ever being breastfed results in a 2.62 point
IQ increase compared to not being breastfed (Horta, Loret de Mola,
and Victora 2015), and 1 standard deviation increase in IQ leads to
a 17 percent increase in wage earnings (Hanushek and Woessmann
2008). Potential benefits not included are the savings from reduced
health care costs for the treatment of diarrhea and pneumonia attrib-
uted to inadequate breastfeeding, indirect costs borne by families
related to the treatment of attributed childhood illnesses, costs of
purchasing infant formula, and the mortality costs attributed to the
higher risk of breast cancer in the mothers of non-breastfed children.
The benefit-cost analyses are, therefore, conservative estimates.


Sensitivity Analyses
The analyses employ one-way sensitivity analyses for the key drivers
of cost, impact, and benefit-cost ratio results. For the cost sensitivity
analysis, the assumption about the baseline coverage of breastfeeding
counseling varies in line with other plausible proxies. For the impact
sensitivity analysis, the overall exclusive breastfeeding rate projec-
tion in 2025 is presented, with the following changes in variables: (1) a
less conservative delivery setting option in LiST for the effect size of
breastfeeding promotion (combined delivery in health system and
home/community setting) is included; (2) India’s exclusive breast-
feeding result from the 2014 RSOC is excluded; (3) an effect of GDP
growth across low- and middle-income countries (based on historical
trends) is included, resulting in an average annual reduction in the
rate of exclusive breastfeeding of 0.34 percentage points per year in




Chapter 5  Reaching the Global Target for Breastfeeding 	              125
children 0–5 months of age (Victora et al. 2016);7 and (4) the average
historical trend of increase in exclusive breastfeeding rates equivalent
to +0.40 percentage points per year across low- and middle-income
countries is extended into future projections (WHO 2015).



Results
This section presents the results of the analyses described above,
including both costs and impacts.


Breastfeeding Prevalence
The WHO Global Nutrition Target Tracker reports the global exclusive
breastfeeding prevalence as 38 percent (WHO 2015), similar to the
findings in the Lancet Breastfeeding Series (Victora et al. 2016). Because
of India’s size and influence over global nutrition indicators, the
inclusion of India’s new exclusive breastfeeding rate from the RSOC
increases the lower-middle-income country rate—from 38 percent
in 2012 to 43 percent in 2015. Therefore India single-handedly achieves
40 percent of the global World Health Assembly target for breastfeeding. This
new result for India is included in the baseline prevalence of exclusive
breastfeeding for the analyses.


Unit Costs
The population-weighted mean unit cost estimate for good infant and
young child nutrition counseling is $7.32 per year per mother and child
pair, but country-level unit costs range from $0.7 per year in Guate-
mala to $13.35 for Middle East and North Africa countries. The range
of all unit costs for interventions included is shown in table 5.2. The
unit costs of extending maternity leave cash benefits to six months vary
greatly because of differences in country-level policies and wages.

  The Lancet Breastfeeding Series suggests a strong inverse correlation between GDP and breastfeed-
ing rates and estimates that for “each doubling in the gross domestic product per head, breastfeed-
ing prevalence at 12 months decreased by ten percentage points” (Victora et al. 2016, 477). For
this study, this effect size was modified to suit by the sensitivity analysis pertaining to exclusive
breastfeeding rates and the low- and middle-income countries subject to this analysis. Assuming
the 10-year historical (2004–14) GDP per capita growth rate in low- and middle-income countries of
5.5 percent (World Bank 2015) will continue, this is expected to yield only a 70 percent increase by
2025, not double. Furthermore, as estimated by Victora et al. (2016), the correlation between GDP
per capita and exclusive breastfeeding is approximately half as strong (that is, −0.41) as at 12 months
(that is, –0.84)). Therefore the authors’ calculations for an effect of GDP growth on exclusive breast-
feeding in the context of the WHA target costing are:
              –10% * 70% * (−0.41/−0.84)/10 years = −0.34 percentage points per year.

Total Scale-Up Costs
The total additional costs of scaling up the selected core set of inter-
ventions necessary to meet the breastfeeding target in low- and
middle-income countries is $5.7 billion over 10 years (see table 5.3).
This translates to approximately $4.70 per newborn. The majority of
costs are for infant and young child nutrition counseling ($4.2 billion)
and smaller amounts for pro-breastfeeding social policies ($111 mil-
lion) and national breastfeeding promotion campaigns ($906 million).
The annual additional costs would increase from $136 million in 2016
to $763 million by 2021 as programs scale up to full coverage over five
years (see figure 5.2).

The total financing needs for the extension of maternity leave cash
benefits from current status to six months in duration is estimated to
be $24.1 billion over 10 years across low- and middle-income coun-
tries. Since maternity leave cash benefits are important for other social,
labor, gender, and development objectives—not only ­   breastfeeding—
these costs are excluded from the nutrition-specific interventions
package listed above.

The East Asia and Pacific region requires a 38 percent share of the
total costs ($2.3 billion), the Sub-Saharan Africa region requires one-
quarter ($1.5 billion), South Asia ($0.7 billion), and other regions
require smaller total scale-up costs (figure 5.3). By income group (see
figure 5.4), the total costs are shared equally between lower-middle-
income countries and upper-middle-income countries (45 and 46 per-
cent, respectively); low-income countries require a much smaller share
of the total (9 percent).

Sensitivity Analyses for Cost Estimates
Adding a second year of infant and young child nutrition counseling,
as per guidelines and in line with the costing of the stunting target,
increases costs to a total of $8.7 billion. Coverage rates for infant and
young child nutrition counseling may be the largest source of uncer-
tainty in this model. The sensitivity analysis tornado diagram (see
figure 5.5) shows that assuming a more conservative coverage rate—
such as exclusive breastfeeding at 4–5 months as reported by DHS
and MICS, or simply assuming no coverage at all (0 percent cover-
age)—would bring the total target financing needs over 10 years to
$6.3 billion or $7.3 billion, respectively. The minimum coverage level
required to reach the target is 53 percent, but the reduced cost would
come with the tradeoff of a substantial reduction in the number of
child deaths and diseases averted.


Expected Impacts of Scale-Up
This investment in the breastfeeding intervention package is esti-
mated to result in an additional 105 million children being exclu-
sively breastfed globally over the next 10 years and an increase in the
exclusive breastfeeding rate to 54 percent (see figure 5.6). Achieving
this level of exclusive breastfeeding in low- and middle-income coun-
tries will result in a cumulative total of 520,000 child deaths averted
over the next 10 years. In addition, millions of cases of diarrhea and
pneumonia will have been prevented, and more children will reach
their potential in terms of cognitive development. The five countries
with the highest total child deaths averted in the projected scenario
are India, Pakistan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and
Ethiopia, which together account for 57 percent of estimated child
deaths averted across all low- and middle-income countries. Though
not calculated in the analyses, this increase in exclusive breastfeed-
ing rates will also lead to substantially fewer women dying of breast
cancer as a result of the protective effects that breastfeeding extends to
the mother.

It should be noted that the current modeling approach used by LiST
and in the Excel model may be problematic for particular countries
with extremely low-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence in the 0 to
10 percent range. Since the formulae determining the effect size of
breastfeeding counseling are dependent on the problematic default
indicator for coverage (that is, 1–5 month exclusive breastfeeding
prevalence), countries with extremely low exclusive breastfeeding

rates can achieve only a limited increase in breastfeeding rates in these
models. For example, in the LiST model, Djibouti can achieve a rise in
exclusive breastfeeding rates from 1 percent in 2015 to only 3.1 percent
in 2025 despite scale-up to 90 percent coverage of counseling over
10 years. This is a limitation in the current LiST modeling of breast-
feeding promotion which will affect the country-level projections for
countries with low baseline rates. However, this limitation will have
minimal impact on the global results of this analysis since most coun-
tries in the sample were chosen on the basis of high absolute burden.


Sensitivity Analyses of the Impacts of the Scale-Up
With the confluence of factors affecting breastfeeding behaviors across
different country contexts, it is challenging to make accurate predic-
tions into the future. The sensitivity analyses show the change in
exclusive breastfeeding projection if the effect size for breastfeeding
promotion in LiST is set to the combined effect of counseling in both
health system and home/community settings. Excluding the new
India RSOC exclusive breastfeeding result from baseline exclusive
breastfeeding prevalence reduces the global projection for 2025 from
54 percent to 50 percent. It also demonstrates the potential change in
the exclusive breastfeeding rate projection in 2025 by considering the
inclusion of an effect of GDP on future exclusive breastfeeding rates
and extending the historical trend in exclusive breastfeeding (see fig-
ure 5.7). In both cases, the target would still be achieved.

Although achieving this target requires substantial effort, it appears
less ambitious than the other global nutrition targets. These analyses
show that there may be scope to go beyond the current breastfeeding
target by 2025 or 2030.


Benefit-Cost Analyses
Investing in a comprehensive breastfeeding promotion and support
package is an excellent investment for countries. Assuming a conser-
vative 3 percent GDP growth rate and a 3 percent discount rate for
costs and benefits yields an estimated net benefit of $298 billion over
10 years, a pooled benefit-cost ratio of 34.7, and a median benefit-cost
ratio of 17.5 (see table 5.4). By region, this translates into a benefit-
cost ratio of 18.2 for Sub-Saharan Africa, 37.0 for South Asia, and

  benefit-cost ratio of 6.3 for low-income countries, 27.7 for lower-­
a ­
middle income countries, and 46.3 for upper-middle income countries.

When assuming a more conservative 5 percent discount rate, the
median benefit-cost ratio decreases to 7.6 and the pooled rate to 15.8.



Discussion
Humans have known and science has shown that breastfeeding pro-
vides unparalleled nutritional and immunological benefits for infants
and young children. The analyses demonstrate that, although there
may be notable costs to investing in breastfeeding promotion, protec-
tion, and support, reaching the global target for breastfeeding can be
achieved and would result in saving a large number of children’s lives
and also in substantial reductions in maternal morbidity. In fact, there
is potential to surpass the current target for breastfeeding and there
may be scope to revise this target to be more ambitious.

The return on the investment across countries is positive and strong:
estimates show that the investment would generate a net present
value of $298 billion in benefits over 10 years, a pooled benefit-cost
ratio of 34.7, and median benefit-cost ratios of 17.5 (15.8 and 7.6,
respectively, under more conservative discounting assumptions).
Recent research shows that lifetime labor earnings gains for a breast-
fed child would amount to approximately $20,000 in the United States
(Lutter 2016). Although projected earnings gains estimated in the anal-
yses are lower than those in the United States given the lower-income
status of countries in the sample, this new finding further reiterates
the need for the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding.

The accuracy with which future behavior patterns can be predicted
is only as good as the tools and data available and the assumptions
made. These analyses were conducted with the best available data, but
there is an urgent need for improved data on intervention coverage,
costs, and effectiveness (for certain interventions). Interventions and
policy levers such as maternity leave cash benefits currently generate
high costs and cover only the formal labor sector. Since large numbers
of women, especially in developing countries, work in the informal
sector, reaching these women is essential for achieving greater impact.
Better measurement of the coverage of infant and young child nutri-
tion counseling, from pregnancy through age two, is urgently needed.

136   	                                 An Investment Framework for Nutrition
It is expected that a recently added DHS survey question addressing
breastfeeding counseling will help with the estimation of coverage of
any counseling, but will not be sufficient to assess intervention cover-
age of comprehensive counseling for new mothers all the way through
to age two.

There is also an urgent need for implementers and researchers to
collect and publish cost data so that future costing studies can be
based on stronger data. Impact modeling software also must adapt to
include a variety of breastfeeding interventions and to make stron-
ger projections for the highest-burden countries. Further advances
in experimental and quasi-experimental methods are also needed to
better understand the impact of interventions such as policies, media,
and maternity leave, among others. Decades of underfinancing sup-
port for nursing mothers have resulted in creating a culture, particu-
larly among higher-income and emerging economies, that stigmatizes
breastfeeding and downplays the tradeoffs of not breastfeeding. Now
the case for investing in a breastfeeding renaissance in the 21st century
is clear. The analyses show that scaling up a core set of interventions
that enable optimal breastfeeding can have a major impact on prevent-
ing child deaths and generating strong returns on investment over
time for societies, labor markets, and their economies.

   Key Messages
   •	    Given the current state of evidence on the prevention of
         wasting, it is impossible to estimate the costs of reaching
         the global wasting target. Rapidly developing the evidence
         base and policy and intervention guidelines is imperative if
         the world is to meet this target.
   •	    Unlike prior chapters, the analyses included in this chap-
         ter focus on estimating the costs of treating severe acute
         malnutrition and mitigating its impacts. It does not include
         the costs or impacts of treating moderate acute malnutrition
         since the evidence base and World Health Organization
         (WHO) guidelines for treatment are lacking.
   •	    Scaling up the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for
         91 million children in low- and middle-income countries
         will require about $9.1 billion over 10 years. This averages
         to about $110 per child in Africa and $90 per child in South
         Asia.
   •	    During that timeframe, the scale-up would prevent at least
         860,000 deaths in children under age five.




Chapter 6  Scaling Up the Treatment of Severe Wasting	                  141
      •	   A conservative estimate is that the scale-up of treatment of
           severe acute malnutrition for children would result in at
           least $25 billion in annual increases in economic productiv-
           ity over the productive lifetimes of children who benefited
           from the program. Every $1 invested in treatment would
           result in about $4 in economic returns (discounted at 3 per-
           cent annually).
      •	   These are conservative estimates based only on mortality
           reductions. It is possible that wasting treatment has other
           benefits for child development (for example, reducing
           cognitive losses and physical disability). Such additional
           benefits have, however, yet to be quantified.
      •	   More research is needed on the pathways leading to the
           incidence of wasting; on understanding the cyclical nature
           of wasting (for example, whether and how frequently a
           given child experiences multiple bouts of wasting during
           a given year) and subsequent consequences and vulner-
           ability created by repeated episodes; and the relationship
           between wasting and stunting and the short-, medium-,
           and long-term impacts of wasting on children’s physical
           and cognitive development. Without a rapid investment
           in knowledge, it is not possible to build an effective global
           investment case for preventing wasting.




Wasting and Its Effects
Wasting, also known as acute malnutrition, is a reduction or loss of
body weight in relation to height. The World Health Organization
(WHO) classifies wasting as severe or moderate, according to the
WHO growth standard for weight-for-height.1 Severe acute malnutri-
tion is defined as severe wasting and/or mid-upper arm circumference
(MUAC) less than 115 millimeters and/or bilateral pitting edema.
Moderate acute malnutrition is defined as moderate wasting and/or
mid-upper arm circumference greater than or equal to 115 millime-
ters and less than 125 millimeters (WHO 2014). The variations in the

classification of wasting pose challenges in identifying children for
treatment. Although neither weight-for-height nor mid-upper arm cir-
cumference are shown to be good predictors of mortality, on balance,
the mid-upper arm circumference has shown better predictive power
(ENN et al. 2012). Because of this, clinical assessment of complications
such as bilateral pitting edema are essential for distinguishing severe
cases needing inpatient treatment versus uncomplicated cases that can
be treated at community levels. Children suffering from severe acute
malnutrition have a mortality risk 11 times higher than children who
are not malnourished. The WHO estimates that wasting accounts for
about 2 million deaths among children under age five globally—5 per-
cent of all deaths in that age group (McDonald et al. 2013).

In 2014, 50 million children globally were wasted (UNICEF, WHO,
and World Bank 2015), one third of whom were severely wasted. Of
the total number of wasted children, about 34 million live in South
Asia and about 14 million live in Sub-Saharan Africa. India, Sri Lanka,
Djibouti, and South Sudan face the greatest burden of wasting, with
over 15 percent prevalence in each country, although the etiology
and causes of wasting may be different across regions. Particularly in
South Asia, wasting is often seen in children well below six months
of age, pointing to more chronic and societal etiologies such as poor
maternal nutrition, poor infant feeding practices, and lower class/
caste status contributing to wasting rates (Menon 2012). A grow-
ing burden is also developing in the Middle East and North Africa,
with countries such as Yemen seeing wasting rates of over 16 percent
(UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2015). In total, 14 countries glob-
­
ally have wasting rates above the public health emergency range
(greater than 10 percent prevalence). Unlike stunting, trends in wast-
ing probably underestimate the true burden of wasting because this
is a measure of acute or short-term incidences in malnutrition, which
can occur during peak times of famine, crises, low harvest periods, or
bouts of illness. Therefore during survey times, which may be outside
of seasonal peaks in wasting, a relatively large prevalence of incidence
cases may be missed. Nonetheless, wasting prevalence has remained
steady at 8 percent globally with a recent minimal decline to 7.5 per-
cent (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank 2015).

The 2012 World Health Assembly target is to reduce and maintain
childhood wasting to less than 5 percent. Like the stunting target, the
World Health Assembly target for wasting has been incorporated into
Sustainable Development Goal 2 and its target 2.2. This target focuses


Chapter 6  Scaling Up the Treatment of Severe Wasting	               143
on reducing the prevalence of wasting and, consequently, on prevent-
ing and treating wasting. In order to reach the target, effective strate-
gies are needed to treat current cases and to prevent future cases of
wasting. However, to date, evidence on how to prevent wasting is lim-
ited and inconclusive. Coffey (2016) identifies five systematic reviews
and a meta-analysis examining the impact of nutrition-specific inter-
ventions on weight-for-height z-scores. The interventions include food
supplementation and micronutrient supplementation (including lipid
nutrient supplements, hot meals, and fortified milks, combined with
nutrition, health, and hygiene education) for children under five, and
weight-for-height is analyzed only as a secondary outcome of interest.
Food supplementation shows no impact on weight-for-height. One
meta-analysis shows a statistically significant but very small impact of
zinc supplementation on weight-for-height (Ramakrishnan, Nguyen,
and Martorell 2009). Evidence is also inadequate for the impact of
nutrition-sensitive interventions on wasting. A Cochrane review of
the literature on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions
finds no evidence of the impact of WASH on wasting (Dangour et al.
2013). The lack of documented impact is at least partly due to the poor
quality of the studies reviewed and the fact that weight-for-height
is included only as a secondary outcome (see Coffey 2016 for a more
in-depth discussion). One study of cash transfer programs combined
with food supplementation shows significant and substantial reduc-
tion (84 percent) in the risk of wasting for children in a group that
received unconditional cash transfers and food supplementation
compared with children who received only food supplementation
(Langendorf et al. 2014). However, more evidence is needed to estab-
lish a robust evidence base of the impact of similar social protection
programs.

In sum, the extant literature has not focused on understanding the
pathways leading to the incidence of wasting and the effectiveness
of interventions to prevent it from occurring in different contexts. It
is possible that a better understanding of the determinants of acute
malnutrition could be gained by reanalyzing the data collected as part
of the existing studies. However, to date, this has not been a priority
for researchers. Most of the attention has been given to recovery and
relapse. Therefore one of the conclusions from these analyses is to rec-
ommend that more research be undertaken to document the evidence
base for preventing wasting.

On the other hand, the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in
children has a strong and well-established evidence base (see Lenters
et al. 2013 for a review). For this reason the analyses included in this
chapter focus on estimating the costs of treating severe acute malnu-
trition and mitigating its impacts.2 In the context of the global target
for wasting, these analyses provide an estimate of the costs of not
reaching the wasting target. In the absence of effective prevention
strategies, the world will need to invest in an expansion of treatment
programs in order to avoid deaths among children suffering from
severe acute malnutrition.



The Treatment of Severe Acute Malnutrition
among Children
The WHO recommends outpatient treatment of children with uncom-
plicated severe acute malnutrition (85 to 90 percent of cases) using
ready-to-use therapeutic food and a seven-day preventive course of
antibiotics (WHO 2013). This treatment has been shown to reduce
mortality and lead to recovery in about 80 percent of cases (Hossain
et al. 2009; Khanum, Ashworth, and Huttly 1994, 1998; Lenters et al.
2013).

Although the treatment of severe acute malnutrition has been proven
to be highly effective, the scale-up of these interventions is limited:
only about 15 percent of children with severe acute malnutrition have
access to treatment (WHO 2014). One of the reasons for low access
to treatment is its relatively high cost (see, for example, Bhutta et al.
2013; Horton et al. 2010). A number of studies examine different strate-
gies for reducing costs and improving cost-effectiveness of severe
acute malnutrition treatment interventions. Several authors compare
out­patient and inpatient-based treatment regimens (Bachmann 2009,
2010; Greco et al. 2006; Puett et al. 2013; Sandige et al. 2004). Some
authors compare the costs and cost-effectiveness of using locally pro-
duced ready-to-use therapeutic food products (Greco et al. 2006; Singh
et al. 2010).

 In this report, the term wasting is used when discussing prevalence rates or reaching the global
wasting target. However, since diagnosis is measured by wasting and/or mid-upper arm circumfer-
ence and/or bilateral pitting edema, the term acute malnutrition is most appropriate when referring
to treatment. The costs and impact analyses in this report are based specifically on the treatment of
severe acute malnutrition.




Chapter 6  Scaling Up the Treatment of Severe Wasting	                                           145
This chapter presents an analysis of the investments needed to expand
the current coverage of this intervention to reach 90 percent of children
suffering from severe acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income
countries by 2025 and the impact of such scale-up on child mortality.
A benefit-cost analysis is also included here, along with a comparison
of the investment costs and the estimated economic benefits resulting
from the treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children.

These analyses do not include the management of moderate acute
malnutrition. Treatment of severe acute malnutrition is a well-defined
intervention with supporting WHO guidelines (see WHO 2013). In
contrast, the management of moderate acute malnutrition is much less
well defined. No guidelines exist for the treatment of moderate acute
malnutrition.3 As a result, different countries and different agencies
use very different approaches. These variations range from blanket
provision of fortified or unfortified staples including corn-soy blends
and other specialty cereal-based products (such as SuperCereal),
which targets populations at large to prevent acute malnutrition and
to treat existing cases of moderate acute malnutrition in children, to
programs that provide lipid-based nutrition supplements to target
populations. In the absence of global guidelines or standards, the
entry and exit criteria for benefiting from such feeding and supple-
mentation programs vary widely. Furthermore, the literature on the
impact of the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition is limited (see
Lenters et al. 2013). In light of this, the treatment of moderate acute
malnutrition is not included in these analyses.



Analytic Approaches Specific
to the Wasting Target
The methods used in these analyses are described in chapter 2. A few
key methodological considerations specific to the coverage expansion
of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children are summa-
rized below.


Measuring the Incidence of Wasting
The target population for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition is
defined as children 6–59 months of age suffering from severe wasting,

 To date, the WHO has issued only a Technical Note on the use of supplemental foods for the man-
agement of moderate acute malnutrition; see WHO 2012 at http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/

determined by measurement of weight-for-height or mid-upper arm
circumference, or clinical assessment of bilateral pitting edema. Rou-
tinely collected data on the nutrition status of children—for example,
through Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or Multiple Indica-
tor Cluster Surveys (MICS)—includes information on the prevalence
of severe wasting in a given year. However, annual prevalence very
likely underestimates the number of children who require treat-
ment for two reasons. First, severe wasting is an acute condition the
prevalence of which likely varies within a year. In the lean season,
or during periods of drought or other natural (or manmade) disas-
ters, the percentage of children with acute malnutrition can increase
rapidly. Second, it is possible, and even likely, that a single child can
experience multiple episodes of acute malnutrition in a given year.
At present, longitudinal data are limited to surveillance systems used
in emergency situations, particularly in Ethiopia, Niger, and Sudan,
where data on cases of severe acute malnutrition are captured over
time in highly food insecure areas (Tuffrey 2016). This does not fully
allow for estimating the incidence of severe acute malnutrition in a
way that would capture seasonal variations and multiple episodes of
acute malnutrition outside of emergency situations. For this analysis,
the UNICEF programmatic guidance is used (UNICEF 2015). Follow-
ing the methodology presented in that guidance, the annual incidence
of severe acute malnutrition is approximated by multiplying the
annual prevalence by a factor of 1.6. The annual population in need of
severe acute malnutrition treatment is calculated as:

(Number of children 6–59 months)  (Prevalence of severe wasting)  (1.6)


Measuring Existing Treatment Coverage
No country-level estimates of the coverage of the treatment of severe
acute malnutrition for children currently exist. To develop baseline
coverage, these analyses rely on data from the Coverage Monitoring
Network on the percentage of children suffering from severe wasting
at subnational levels (for example, districts) for a number of coun-
tries.4 This database is based on information collected from organi-
zations implementing programs in specific subnational geographic
locations. For countries where coverage data were available from only
one region, these data are used to represent coverage at the national
level. For countries where data from multiple regions were available,

The Coverage Monitoring Network is a consortium of nongovernmental organizations (led by
4

Action Against Hunger) that implement community-based management of acute malnutrition
programs globally.

Chapter 6  Scaling Up the Treatment of Severe Wasting	                                     147
a population-weighted average is used as a proxy for the national
level. It should be noted that this approach probably overestimates the
current treatment coverage. For countries without available data, the
current coverage of treatment is assumed to be zero. Baseline coverage
data used in the analyses are presented in appendix B.


Sample Selection
The estimates of financing needs are based on a sample of 24 countries
(20 countries with the highest absolute burden and 4 countries with
wasting prevalence higher than 15 percent), together accounting for
82.9 percent of the burden of wasted children. The list of countries
included in each sample for each target is shown in table 2.2.


Unit Costs and Assumptions about Changes over Time
Unit costs are obtained through a literature review from 2000 onward,
a scan of gray literature, and websites of organizations providing
treatment of severe acute malnutrition (UNICEF, Save the Children,
Action Contre la Faim, and others). If no unit cost data were available
for a given intervention in a given country, the average (mean) unit
cost for other countries in that region is used. If there were no unit cost
data for any country in a given region, the average from the countries
with available unit costs is used. All costs are converted to U.S. dollars
($) and inflated to 2015 values. A list of unit costs used as well as unit
cost data sources is included in appendix C.

Treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children has higher unit
costs than other nutrition interventions. This is partly because of the
intensive curative nature of the intervention, which, even if delivered
in the outpatient setting, requires a significant amount of time to be
spent with health care providers (this includes initial triage, anthro-
pometric measurement and diagnosis, assessment for complications,
drug and ready-to-use therapeutic food dispensing, nutrition counsel-
ing for mothers and/or caregivers, and weekly follow-up visits). In
addition, ready-to-use therapeutic food is an expensive commodity
as compared to those used in other nutrition interventions. Currently,
dried skimmed milk is estimated to account for between 40 and 50
percent of the ready-to-use therapeutic food input costs and over
one-third of the total ready-to-use therapeutic food manufacturing
cost (Manary 2006; Santini et al. 2013). It is assumed that, in the next
10 years, a more cost-effective formulation of ready-to-use therapeu-
tic foods will be developed to replace dried skimmed milk with an

148   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
alternative source protein that is comparable to the current formula-
tion with respect to recovery rate and time. Such an alternative formu-
lation could potentially lead to a 33 percent reduction in ready-to-use
therapeutic food price per kilogram. The estimated monetary value of
the reduction is based on the average price charged by 17 global and
local suppliers that sold ready-to-use therapeutic food to UNICEF in
2015. The average global price of a carton (15 kilograms) of ready-to-
use therapeutic food was $51.57 (in 2015 U.S. dollars; UNICEF Supply
Division 2015 data). The assumed 33 percent decline in the product
cost is equivalent to a $17.02 cost reduction per case treated. Those
cost reductions are assumed to be realized by 2020.

A further 20 percent reduction in the cost of delivery of treatment of
severe acute malnutrition for children over the 10-year period is also
assumed. This is expected to result from improved protocols and
better integration of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition into
national health care delivery systems. Empirical literature on cost
savings in nutrition programming that result from changes in deliv-
ery platforms is very limited.5 However, the assumed cost reduction
of 20 percent is consistent with the findings from Khan and Ahmed
(2003), who examine the difference in cost per case of community
nutrition services provided through a vertical program run by non-
governmental organizations and a government program run through
the health system in Bangladesh.6 Like the declines in prices of ready-
to-use therapeutic food, those cost savings are assumed to be realized
by 2020 (figure 6.1).

Based on the assumptions presented above, the overall costs of the
scale-up of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children
globally is estimated to be 21 percent lower than if no cost savings
were realized over the same period (see figure 6.1 for estimated
annual costs for 2016 to 2025 under both sets of assumptions). This
result is consistent with existing projections for cost declines in the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition (for example, Shoham, Dolan,
and Gostelow 2013). However, this assumption—of a 21 percent
decline in costs by 2020—is probably optimistic.



5
 Currently, randomized controlled trials are examining differences in delivery platforms. In particu-
lar, integration of treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children into the existing community-
level delivery within the health system is under way in Mali and Pakistan; preliminary results are
expected at the end of 2016.
6
  These cost reductions were not applied in East Asia because the unit cost used already assumed a
fully integrated severe acute malnutrition delivery model (see Alive & Thrive and UNICEF 2013).

Assumptions about the Pace of the Scale-Up over 10 Years
A gradual, linear scale-up was assumed for each country from the
current coverage level to 90 percent by 2025. This coverage expansion
scenario is different from the ones for stunting, anemia, and breast-
feeding. For these three targets, a five-year rapid expansion phase
and a five-year maintenance phase were modeled to allow for the
full accrual of the full scale-up interventions for all children under
age five (see chapter 2 for details). Because severe wasting is an acute
condition, with treatment affecting the beneficiaries immediately, and
because the treatment of severe acute malnutrition is not included
under any of the other targets, a linear scale-up was assumed here.
Given the nature of the causes of severe acute malnutrition and the
fact that the treatment is resource intensive and costly, and to be
consistent with the extant literature (Bhutta et al., 2013; Horton et al.,
2010), it was assumed that 100 percent of coverage is unrealistic even
in a 10-year timeframe. Thus, coverage expansion of up to 90 percent
was modeled.


Estimating Impact
The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) is used to estimate the number of deaths
averted. LiST models the impact of severe acute malnutrition mor-
tality indirectly: in the model, severe acute malnutrition increases
a child’s risk of dying from four specific conditions: post-neonatal
diarrhea, post-neonatal measles, post-neonatal pneumonia, and

150               	                                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
post-neonatal other.7 Figure 6.2 summarizes the LiST severe acute
malnutrition impact model.

In LiST, the impact of severe acute malnutrition on child mortality
depends critically on the incidence of the four key causes of mortality
in a given country. Children suffering from severe acute malnutrition
will be much more likely to die in a country where the incidence of
diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, and other post-neonatal causes (see
note 7) is high than in a country where the incidence of those diseases
is low. This also means that the treatment of severe acute malnutri-
tion will have a different impact in different countries depending on
the incidence of these diseases. For example, if severe acute malnutri-
tion increases the risk of dying from diarrhea by three times, and if
10 percent of all children who get diarrhea die, in country A where
10 percent of children get diarrhea, one would expect that among
1,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition there would
be about 30 excess deaths from diarrhea. In contrast, in country B,
where 50 percent of children get diarrhea, among the same num-
ber of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, 150 excess
deaths would be expected. Furthermore, assuming that treatment
cures 80 percent of the children suffering from severe acute malnutri-
tion, treating all 1,000 children in country A would avert 24 deaths
but treating all 1,000 children in country B would avert 120 deaths—
almost six times more (see table 6.1).

Using LiST, mortality is modeled in all sample countries separately;
the impact is then extrapolated to all low- and middle-income coun-
tries by multiplying the number of deaths averted in the sample by 1.2
(derived by 1/0.829, where 0.829 is the proportion of children suffer-
ing from wasting in the sample countries).


Benefit-Cost Analyses
The economic benefits of the expansion of treatment coverage are
estimated on the basis of mortality reductions. Each life saved as
a result of the treatment is valued at one times GDP per capita per
year (discounted); the assumption is that children would start work-
ing and contributing to the economy at 18 years of age and continue
working until they reach their country’s life expectancy or the age of
65, whichever is lower. It is possible, and indeed likely, that children
experience multiple episodes of acute malnutrition before they reach

    In the LiST model, “other” indicates a specific category of mortality.

age five. Understanding how often a child experiences acute mal-
nutrition is critical for estimating the economic benefits of treating
acute malnutrition based on deaths averted. To calculate benefits, the
analysis assumes that each treated child will survive past age five and
then, once she reaches adulthood, will contribute to the economy of
the country. If an average child experiences only one episode of acute
malnutrition over five years, then that child’s future contributions to
the economy are compared to the cost of a single treatment episode. If
an average child experiences two or three episodes of acute malnutri-
tion, the cost (of treatment) will need to be multiplied accordingly two
or three times.

Unfortunately, no longitudinal studies exist that would allow an esti-
mation of the number of acute malnutrition episodes a child experi-
ences on average during a given period of time. Some studies report
the percentage of children who do not respond to treatment or who
relapse (Isanaka et al. 2011), but those numbers capture only children
in treatment and very likely severely underestimate the number of
acute malnutrition episodes per year per child. Given the absence of
data, an assumption is made that each child under five who was ever
acutely malnourished experienced about 1.6 episodes in his or her life-
time.8 For the base case scenario, a 3 percent discount rate is assumed
for costs and benefits, along with a 3 percent annual GDP growth rate.


The same correction factor is used as the one used by the UNICEF guidance for translating wasting
8

prevalence into incidence (UNICEF 2015).

Results
This section presents the results of the analysis of the intervention
described above for the wasting target via the treatment of severe
acute malnutrition, including costs, impacts, and benefit-cost analyses.


Estimated Costs
Scaling up the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children in
low- and middle-income countries would require about $9.1 billion
over 10 years. Of this amount, about $8.1 billion would be required
for direct service provision with an additional 12 percent of the direct
services costs ($971 million) for capacity strengthening; for develop-
ing the necessary policies, protocol, and guidelines; and for monitor-
ing and evaluation of treatment programs. Those investments would
allow treatment for an additional 91 million of cases of severe acute
malnutrition in all low- and middle-income countries over 10 years.

When considered by region, about 45 percent of the total costs would
be needed to expand the coverage of the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition in South Asia (figure 6.3). Within South Asia, over

80 percent is estimated for treatment expansion in India. Another
25 percent of the total financing needs are to scale up treatment in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Scale-up costs are higher in South Asia than in
Sub-Saharan Africa despite the fact that the estimated average unit
cost of treatment is higher in Sub-Saharan Africa ($110 per child
treated, compared with $90 per child treated in South Asia). This is
because of the higher estimated absolute burden: 40 million cases
would be treated in South Asia over 10 years compared with 11.4 mil-
lion cases in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 16 percent of the total financ-
ing needs are to expand coverage in the Middle East and North Africa
region, 11 percent in the East Asia and Pacific region, and the remain-
ing 3 percent in the Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe, and
Central Asia regions.

Low-income countries account for about 20 percent of the total financ-
ing needs, with the other 80 percent for middle-income countries
(70 percent for lower-middle-income countries and 10 percent for
upper-middle-income countries) (figure 6.4). India alone accounts for
more than half of the financing required for lower-middle-income
countries.

financing is required to scale up the treatment of severe acute malnu-
trition for children with about $1.6 billion in the last year to reach and
maintain 90 percent coverage in all low- and middle-income coun-
tries. As noted above, the assumption is that cost savings from new
formulations of ready-to-use therapeutic food and improved service
delivery would be realized by 2020. Those savings account for the cost
reduction from 2019 to 2020, even though treatment coverage would
continue to expand.


Estimated Impacts
These analyses estimate that about 91 million cases of severe acute
malnutrition in children 6–59 months will be treated over 10 years as a
result of the expanded treatment coverage. The average cost per case
treated would be about $90. This figure incorporates the assumption
about declines in the unit cost that result from reductions in ready-
to-use therapeutic food prices and improvements in the efficiency of
service delivery.

Based on LiST modeling, the scale-up of the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition for children in all low- and middle-income countries
over 10 years would prevent about 860,000 deaths in children under
five years of age (table 6.2). About 49 percent of those deaths would
be averted in Sub-Saharan Africa, 44 percent in South Asia, and the
remaining 7 percent in other regions.

Note: a. The unit cost is $89, plus 12 percent program costs.



Benefit-Cost Analyses
Under the base case scenario (3 percent discount rate for cost and
benefits and 3 percent annual GDP growth rate),9 expanding the cov-
erage of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children in all
low- and middle-income countries and the resulting mortality averted
would generate about $25 billion of annual increases in economic
productivity over the productive lifetimes of children who benefited
from the program (table 6.3). The pooled benefit-cost ratio under the
base case scenario is 3.6,10 suggesting that every dollar invested in the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition would result in about four dol-
lars in economic returns.

These results are sensitive to changes in the assumptions. Increasing
the discount rate to 5 percent changes the benefit cost-ratio to 1.5.
When changing the assumption regarding the number of wasting
episodes a child under age five experiences on average from 1.6 to 2.0
or 3.0, the benefit-cost ratio declines from 3.6 to 2.7 or 1.4, respectively
(table 6.4).

9
    The same assumptions were used in benefit-cost analyses across all targets.
 Note that the benefit-cost ratio is calculated by dividing discounted benefits ($25 billion) by dis-
10

counted costs ($7.1 billion) using the 3 percent annual discount rate in the base case scenario.

Discussion
Given the current state of evidence of the prevention of wasting, it is
impossible to estimate the costs of reaching the global wasting tar-
get. Therefore the first major recommendation from these analyses
is to prioritize research on the prevention of wasting. It is clear that,
without such evidence, reaching the global wasting target will not be
possible. Because the cost of reaching the wasting target cannot be
estimated, this chapter focuses on the costs of expanding the treatment
of severe acute malnutrition for children, even though it is entirely
possible that preventing wasting would be more cost-effective than
treating it, especially given the high costs of treatment. Thus expand-
ing treatment can be considered to be the cost of mitigating the impact
of wasting, rather than preventing wasting.

In the absence of preventive interventions, treatment will be necessary
to save the lives of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition.
Currently, only a small minority of children with severe acute mal-
nutrition receive treatment. In fact, the coverage of outpatient treat-
ment programs in low- and middle-income countries remains largely
unknown. In order to expand treatment to 90 percent by 2025, an
additional $9.1 billion dollars in new financing will be needed.

These cost estimates are lower than those reported in earlier studies
for a number of reasons (table 6.5). First, baseline unit costs used here
are lower than those in Horton et al. (2010) and Bhutta et al. (2013).
This is largely because new unit cost data available from country
studies (see, for example, Alive & Thrive and UNICEF 2013; IFPRI
2014; Shekar et al. 2014; Shekar, Mattern, Eozenou et al. 2015; Shekar,
Mattern, Laviolette et al. 2015; Tekeste et al. 2012) are lower than
those used in previous estimates. Second, these analyses assume some
reductions in treatment unit costs over time as a result of lower prices
of ready-to-use therapeutic food and improvements in the efficiency

of service delivery. Finally, unlike the previous two global studies, the
present analyses incorporate population growth dynamics over the
next decade. Annual scale-up costs are lower because of the popula-
tion declines projected in the South Asia, East Asia and Pacific, and
Middle East and North Africa regions.

Based on the modeling using LiST, the scale-up of the treatment of
severe acute malnutrition for children would prevent about 860,000
deaths over 10 years. This estimate is lower than those published
previously. For example, Schofield and Ashworth (1996) estimate that,
in the absence of any treatment, up to 30 percent of children suffering
from severe acute malnutrition will die. Similarly, Bulti et al. (2015)
estimate that the mortality rate for untreated severe acute malnutri-
tion in Nigeria is about 250 per 1,000 (or about 25 percent).

Calculating baseline mortality risk resulting from severe wasting
in LiST is somewhat challenging because, as mentioned above, it
is modeled through specific diseases, such as pneumonia, diar-
rhea, and measles, and therefore depends on the incidence of those
diseases in a specific country. In other words, this model takes into
account the underlying causes of death in children who are severely
malnourished.

In order to calculate the baseline morality risk in LiST, the numbers of
deaths resulting from changes in wasting prevalence in each coun-
try was calculated. However, LiST allows for calculating changes
in mortality that result only from decreases in wasting prevalence
(rather than from increases in prevalence). Therefore, for each country,
reductions in mortality were estimated for lowering the prevalence of

severe wasting by (only) one percentage point.11 The number of cases
of severe wasting and the number of deaths were then compared for
the baseline prevalence and the reduced prevalence.

 The difference in the number of children suffering from severe acute
malnutrition between the baseline and the reduced scenario was
interpreted as the additional number of children suffering from severe
acute malnutrition:

                       Number of children in SAM (baseline)
Additional SAM cases = 
                       – Number of deaths (reduced SAM prevalence)

where SAM = severe acute malnutrition.

Similarly, the difference in the number of deaths between the baseline
scenario and the scenario with reduced severe wasting prevalence
was interpreted as the number of deaths resulting from the increased
number of children suffering from severe acute malnutrition:

                        Number of deaths (baseline)
Additional SAM deaths = 
                        – Number of deaths (reduced SAM prevalence)

Put simply, the calculation offers a direct measure of how many deaths
would occur if the number of wasted children increased by a specific
number. The ratio of the additional deaths and additional severe acute
malnutrition cases was interpreted as the underlying risk of dying
from severe wasting:

 SAM mortality risk = Additional SAM deaths/Additional SAM cases

These analyses show that, in the sample of the 24 countries with a
high burden of wasting, the pooled risk of mortality that results from
severe acute malnutrition is 1.43 percent.12 For individual countries,
the risk ranges from 0.1 percent for Sri Lanka to 6.2 percent for Chad.
As expected, the mortality risk is higher in countries with higher


11
   Changes only in severe wasting were modeled because the focus of this chapter is the treatment of
severe wasting. One percentage point was an arbitrary rate of change; it was chosen because it could
be easily implemented for the purposes of this simulation.
 The pooled risk is the total number of severe acute malnutrition cases from all 24 countries divided
12

by the total number of additional severe acute malnutrition cases from all 24 countries.

mortality risk from diarrhea, measles, pneumonia, and other causes.
Consequently, the average mortality risk is higher in Sub-Saharan
Africa (3.5 percent) than in the overall sample.

If severe acute malnutrition mortality risk were adjusted to the level
estimated by Bulti et al. (2015) (25 percent), expanding the coverage of
severe acute malnutrition treatment would, over 10 years, prevent over
15 million deaths (see table 6.6). It would also significantly decrease
the cost per death averted and increase the cost-effectiveness of severe
acute malnutrition treatment. In the LiST-based model, preventing one
death through treatment of severe acute malnutrition would cost about
$10,000; if the baseline mortality risk is adjusted to the level reported
by Bulti et al., the cost would drop to about $600. Consequently, the
benefit-cost ratio could increase from 3.6 to as much as 62.6.

Estimates from Bulti et al. (2015) and from Schofield and Ashworth
(1996) seem high. The study by Schofield and Ashworth is over two
decades old and it is very likely that mortality from wasting would
now be lower thanks to healthier environments in which children
grow up, better vaccination coverage, greater access to maternal
and child health services, and so forth. Estimates from Bulti et al.
were derived from data from a community-based management of
acute malnutrition program in northern Nigeria, where mortality in
general—and therefore wasting mortality as well—was higher than
­
in many other countries included in this study. If we applied this rate
to India, where about 8 million children in 2015 suffered from severe
wasting, a 25 percent mortality risk would result in about 1.3 mil-
lion deaths annually. This, in turn, would translate to a mortality
rate attributable to wasting of about 10.5 per 1,000. Given that the

162   	                                              An Investment Framework for Nutrition
total under five mortality rate in India in 2015 was estimated to be 48
(World Bank 2015), it seems very unlikely that wasting is an underly-
ing cause of 21 percent of all under five deaths in India.13 Therefore,
clearly, using high mortality risk values from either the Schofield and
Ashworth or Bulti studies will likely overestimate the impact of the
scale-up of the severe acute malnutrition treatment. Nevertheless, the
adjusted mortality estimates could be treated here as an upper-bound
estimate, with the LiST-generated estimates considered as a conserva-
tive lower bound.

The advantage of the LiST approach is that it models the impact of
wasting by looking at mortality from infectious disease and thus takes
into account the overall underlying mortality risk in different country
contexts. Therefore the gains from mortality reductions in this target
are higher in countries with a greater underlying disease burden. This
is reflected in the analyses presented above: even though only about
25 percent of the total costs are for program expansion in Sub-Saharan
Africa, about 47 percent of deaths averted are from that region. Con-
sequently, the cost per death averted is much lower in Sub-Saharan
Africa (about $6,400) than it is in South Asia, as well as in the overall
sample of high-burden countries ($12,600 and $10,500, respectively),
and the benefit-cost ratio is much higher in Sub-Saharan Africa (about
11.6) than in the overall sample or in other regions (3.6 in the 24 high-
burden countries, 2.1 in South Asia).

The economic benefits result from expanding the treatment of severe
acute malnutrition for children are estimated to be about $25 billion
(discounted at 3 percent). These are conservative estimates based only
on mortality reductions. It is possible that severe acute malnutrition
treatment has other benefits for child development (such as reducing
cognitive losses and physical disability). For example, existing studies
suggest that episodes of wasting negatively affect linear growth (Black
et al. 2008; Khara and Dolan 2014). However, the evidence base is not
currently strong enough to allow the quantification of such additional
benefits.

The analyses presented in this chapter suggest that treatment of
severe acute malnutrition for children can be a cost-effective interven-
tion, with a very high cost-effectiveness ratio, especially in countries
where risk factors such as infectious diseases and poor hygiene and

 The same exercise conducted for Nigeria would result in a wasting-related mortality of about 4.5
13

per 100 or about 4 percent of the total mortality in children under five (109 per 1,000 in 2015); World
Bank (2015), which is much closer to the global WHO estimate of 5 percent.

sanitation are rampant. However, to better understand the benefits
of investing in both the treatment and prevention of acute malnutri-
tion, more research is needed on the incidence of wasting; the number
of acute malnutrition episodes children may suffer; the relationship
between wasting and stunting and other child health outcomes; and
the short-, medium-, and long-term impacts of acute malnutrition
on children’s physical and cognitive development. Furthermore,
although treatment of severe acute malnutrition can be cost-effective,
it is an expensive intervention (approximately $110 per child in Sub-
Saharan Africa and $90 per child in South Asia per episode). Future
research efforts must focus on finding strategies to prevent wasting so
as to reduce the numbers of children that need treatment. Without a
rapid investment in knowledge, it is not possible to build an effective
global investment case for achieving the wasting target.

Financing Needs to Reach the Four
Global Nutrition Targets: Stunting,
Anemia, Breastfeeding, and Wasting

   Key Messages
   •	    Reaching the targets to reduce stunting among children and
         anemia in women, increase exclusive breastfeeding rates,
         and treat 91 million wasted children will require an invest-
         ment of $70 billion over the next 10 years.
   •	    This investment can yield tremendous returns: 3.7 million
         child lives saved, at least 65 million fewer stunted children,
         265 million fewer women suffering from anemia, 105 mil-
         lion more infants exclusively breastfed up to six months
         of age as compared to the 2015 baseline, and 91 million
         children treated for wasting, in addition to other health and
         poverty reduction efforts.
   •	    Every dollar invested has the potential to generate between
         $4 and $35 in economic returns, depending on the target.
         Thus the returns on these investments in nutrition are high
         and positive, but they will vary in different country con-
         texts. Of particular significance is the high return on invest-
         ment of increased breastfeeding practices ($35 in economic
         returns for every dollar invested).




Chapter 7  Financing Needs to Reach the Four Global Nutrition Targets	     169
      •	   When resources are constrained, and to kick-start the
           scale-up, priority should be given to a set of the most
           cost-effective actions that can be scaled up immediately.
           Financing this more limited set of actions will require fewer
           resources—$23 billion over 10 years—but will not reach the
           targets. Combined with other health and poverty reduc-
           tion efforts, this priority investment can yield significant
           returns: an estimated 2.2 million lives can be saved and
           there would be 50 million fewer cases of stunting in 2025
           compared with the 2015 baseline.




C
        hapter 2 described the methods used for estimating scale-up
        costs to reach each of the four global targets included in these
        analyses. This chapter describes how the costs for these four
targets are aggregated and presents the total costs, financing needs,
and benefits of reaching all four targets.



Method for Aggregating Financing Needs
across All Four Targets
Because some interventions overlap across targets, it is not possible
to aggregate costs by simply adding up the scale-up costs across the
four targets. Instead, to avoid double counting, interventions that
address more than one target were counted only once toward the
grand total. This pertains to three interventions: antenatal micronutri-
ent supplementation, infant and young child nutrition counseling,
and intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in
malaria-endemic areas.1 For these interventions, if the cost varies
across different targets, the highest cost is applied toward the total.
For example, the cost of scaling up infant and young child nutrition
counseling for achieving the stunting target is estimated at $6.8 billion
dollars: this estimate includes the two years of counseling needed to
prevent stunting. This intervention is also key for increasing exclusive
breastfeeding, but for that target, only $4.2 billion is required because

  Note that this intervention is included only for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, where malaria is
endemic.

only one year of the intervention is needed.2 Therefore, when aggre-
gating costs, the larger of the two numbers ($6.8 billion) is included
toward the grand total; table 7.1 shows the costs from each interven-
tion/target that contributed to the grand total costs highlighted in red.

As described in chapter 2 on methods, program costs (for capacity
strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and policy development)
are added to the costs of intervention delivery for each target (see
table 7.1). The following assumptions are made for these program
costs: 9 percent of the total intervention costs for capacity strengthen-
ing for program implementation, 2 percent for monitoring and evalu-
ation, and 1 percent for policy development, following the method
used by Horton et al. (2010). There is one exception: in the case of the
target for breastfeeding, an additional 1 percent for policy develop-
ment is not included because the development, adoption, and enforce-
ment of pro-breastfeeding policies are already counted explicitly as an
intervention.



Total Financing Needs to Achieve All
Four Targets
An estimated additional $69.9 billion will be required over 10 years to
achieve all four nutrition targets (table 7.1). This includes $62.4 billion
for direct intervention costs and $7.5 billion in estimated costs for
capacity strengthening for program implementation, monitoring and
evaluation, and policy development.

Two interventions for children—prophylactic zinc supplementa-
tion and the public provision of complementary food—account for
over 40 percent of the total global costs (23 percent and 20 percent,
respectively). Four interventions account for a further 45 percent of
the global total: the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for chil-
dren, balanced energy-protein supplementation for pregnant women,
infant and young child nutrition counseling, and iron and folic acid
supplementation for non-pregnant women (13 percent, 11 percent,



2
 Since the World Health Assembly target related to breastfeeding uses the 0–5-month exclusive
breastfeeding indicator to measure progress, the assumption in this analysis is that only one year of
infant and young child nutrition counseling would adequately cover the timeframe from the third
trimester of antenatal care to when an infant reaches six months of age. Although a second year of
counseling is recommended, this second year would not have any effect on increasing exclusive
breastfeeding.

11 percent, and 11 percent, respectively).3 Antenatal micronutrient
supplementation and staple food fortification were each estimated to
account for 4 percent of the total,4 and national breastfeeding pro-
motion campaigns account for about 2 percent of the total. Finally,
vitamin A supplementation for children, intermittent presumptive
treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions, and
pro-breastfeeding social policies each account for 1 percent or less of
total costs.

The relative proportion of the global costs devoted to each target is
shown in figure 7.1. However, there is overlap in some of the costs
across targets. The lion’s share of the costs goes toward interven-
tions to reduce stunting ($49.5 billion), followed by costs for prevent-
ing anemia in women ($12.9 billion), then costs for treating wasting

 The costs for iron and folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women include only expected
costs for the supplements for all women and the costs of distribution either through the community
health system or the hospital system for 70 percent of women and through schools for enrolled girls
(girls not enrolled in school are assumed to be supplemented through the health system). An addi-
tional 30 percent of women living above the poverty line are assumed to be able to purchase supple-
ments through private sector retailers and pharmacies. This cost is excluded from these estimates.

 The cost of staple food fortification in these estimates includes only costs to the public sector (that is,
domestic government and official development assistance). Not included are the costs to the private
sector food manufacturing, retail, and marketing, which will be eventually borne by consumers of
fortified foods.

Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for the largest share of the costs (39 per-
cent), followed by South Asia (24 percent) and East Asia and Pacific
(24 percent) (figure 7.2). When considered by country income group,
low-income countries account for about one fourth (27 percent) of the
total additional scale-up costs, lower-middle-income countries for
about half of all costs (51 percent), and upper-middle-income coun-
tries account for less than a quarter (22 percent) (figure 7.3).



Expected Impacts: Method for Aggregating
across Targets
Chapter 2 lays out the methodology for estimating financing needs,
impacts, and benefits for each target. For each target, target-specific
benefits are estimated. These take the form of reductions in the
number of stunted children for the stunting target, reductions in the
number of women suffering from anemia for the anemia target, and
increases in the number of infants who are exclusively breasted for
the breastfeeding target (see table 7.2). For wasting, the estimate is the
number of children treated for severe acute malnutrition because it is

not possible to estimate a reduction in the number of children wasted
(see chapter 6 for a detailed discussion on this point).

In addition, deaths averted as a result of the expansion of all interven-
tions under the four targets are calculated using the Lives Saved Tool
(LiST). Because three interventions—antenatal micronutrient supple-
mentation, infant and young child nutrition counseling, and inter-
mittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-
endemic regions—are included under several targets (see table 7.1), an
estimation of total mortality reductions is adjusted to account for this
overlap. The cumulative health gains are calculated as follows: first,
total deaths averted in children under age five are estimated for all
the interventions included under the stunting target: infant and young
child nutrition counseling, vitamin A supplementation for children,
prophylactic zinc supplementation for children, public provision of
complementary food for children, antenatal micronutrient supplemen-
tation, balanced energy-protein supplementation for pregnant women,
and intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in
malaria-endemic regions. Based on the LiST model, scaling up these
interventions would avert about 2.8 million deaths in children under
five in low- and middle-income countries (see chapter 3 for details).

                                                     intervention—infant
For the breastfeeding target, the impact of only one ­
and young child nutrition counseling—is modeled. Reductions in
child mortality resulting from the scale-up of this intervention are
included in the estimates for the stunting target. Similarly, for the
anemia target, mortality in children under age five averted as a result
of the scale-up of intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in
pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions and antenatal micronutri-
ent supplementation is already included in the mortality reductions
estimated for the stunting target. An additional 380,000 child deaths
averted because of iron and folic acid supplementation (delivered in
the pre-conceptual period through the fortification of staples) are esti-
mated and added to the impact estimates for stunting interventions.

Finally, for the wasting target, mortality reductions resulting from the
scale-up of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition are added to the
grand total of deaths averted.5 Mortality reduction from the expansion

 As indicated in chapter 6, the term wasting is used in this report when discussing prevalence rates
or reaching the global wasting target. However, since diagnosis is measured by wasting and/or mid-
upper arm circumference and/or bilateral pitting edema, the term acute malnutrition is most appro-
priate when referring to treatment. The costs and impact analyses in this report are based specifically
on the treatment of severe acute malnutrition.

of severe acute malnutrition treatment is adjusted to account for the
fact that the expansion would happen in parallel with the scale-up of
all the other interventions. As noted in chapter 6, in the epidemiologi-
cal model used in these analyses, mortality resulting from acute mal-
nutrition depends on the prevalence of risk factors such as diarrhea
and other infectious diseases. Because interventions implemented to
achieve the other three targets could reduce the prevalence of those
risk factors, the impact of severe acute malnutrition and its treatment
on mortality is less than it would be if the treatment of severe acute
malnutrition were scaled up on its own (as modeled in chapter 6).
Based on the LiST model results, scaling up the treatment of severe
acute malnutrition would avert about 30 percent fewer deaths if
implemented in conjunction with the other interventions in the pack-
age (554,000 over 10 years) than if it scaled up on its own (860,000 over
10 years). Therefore the sum of deaths averted due to stunting (2.8
million), anemia (380,000), and wasting (554,000) equals the cumula-
tive deaths averted of 3.7 million.

In sum, the total investment of $69.9 billion over 10 years is estimated
to yield tremendous returns: 3.7 million deaths would be averted and
at least 30 million fewer children would be stunted in 2025 compared
with the 2015 baseline (table 7.2). In addition, 265 million fewer
women would be expected to suffer from anemia in 2025 as compared
to the 2015 baseline. Over the 10-year period, an additional 105 million
children would be estimated to have been exclusively breastfed for the
first six months of life.

In the long run, these outcomes produce more productive workers
with higher cognitive and physical work capacities who generate
higher earnings. The reductions in morbidity and mortality as a result
of these investments are therefore estimated to yield high, positive
benefit-cost ratios. With the assumption of a 3 percent discount rate, it
is estimated that investing in the stunting, anemia, breastfeeding, and
wasting package proposed will generate returns of $10.5, $12.1, $34.7,
and $3.6 respectively for every dollar invested (see table 7.3). Using
a more conservative 5 percent discount rate also generates positive
estimates for benefit-cost ratios.

These benefit-cost ratios should, however, be interpreted with cau-
tion. First, aggregating results across countries may distort the results
because benefit-cost ratios are driven by country-specific factors such as
gross domestic product (GDP), expected economic growth, prevalence
of disease, and the effectiveness of interventions in specific contexts.

These figures are conservative estimates. For stunting, cross-­
generational effects of the interventions were not considered. The liter-
ature suggests that mothers’ short stature is a risk factor for childhood
stunting (Aguayo and Menon 2016). Therefore preventing stunting in
girls, in addition to improving their cognitive ability and productivity,
may also decrease the risk of stunting in their children. The estimated
benefits from the treatment of severe acute malnutrition capture only
deaths averted. It is likely that severe acute malnutrition also has long-
term consequences for children’s cognitive and physical development
and that the treatment of severe acute malnutrition, which mitigates
its impact, may have benefits beyond mortality reductions. Fortifica-
tion of staples with iron will benefit many groups in society in addi-
tion to women of reproductive age, including men and children, and
thereby generate additional improvements in health, cognition, and
economic productivity. Last, the assumed future GDP growth of 3 per-
cent across the sample of countries in these analyses is well below the
historical trend of the previous decade, as discussed in chapter 2, and
is likely to be a very conservative estimate for the future.

Given the methodological uncertainties in the analyses of benefit-cost
projections, the key message is that the aggregate returns on these
investments in nutrition are high and positive, but will vary in differ-
ent country contexts.



A Priority Package of Interventions
In an environment of constrained resources, what if the world could
not afford the $70 billion needed to achieve the targets but instead
could afford only a subset of interventions? In that case, first priority

178   	                                           An Investment Framework for Nutrition
should be given to interventions with the highest returns on invest-
ment that maximize technical efficiency and those that are scalable
now, with the strong caveat that scaling up only this priority set
of interventions would not achieve the global targets laid out in
chapter 1.

The first step in identifying priority interventions is to review their
technical efficiency, as measured by relative cost per outcome. As
described in chapter 2, interventions are compared based on cost per
death averted (table 7.4).

As discussed in earlier chapters, some interventions are not imme-
diately ready to take to scale (table 7.5) because of a lack of global
guidelines or evidence base, constraining scale-up. For example, the
provision of prophylactic zinc supplementation for children to prevent
stunting is not only expensive, but it also lacks global recommenda-
tions from the World Health Organization on its administration. For
this cost analysis, it was assumed that, in theory, zinc could be deliv-
ered in a manner similar to that of multiple micronutrient supplemen-
tation (for example, in the form of “Sprinkles”) for children under age
five. However, to date there is no large-scale experience with this deliv-
ery mechanism, nor are there any global guidelines for it. Iron and folic
acid supplementation for non-pregnant women also lacks an estab-
lished delivery mechanism. Delivering this intervention is expected to
be more challenging because non-pregnant women generally receive
fewer preventive health care services, making it harder to bundle
the supplementation with existing health services delivery, such as
antenatal care visits. It might be possible to add iron and folic acid
supplementation to family planning services, but even those do not
reach all non-pregnant women. For this analysis, scale-up of delivery
is assumed through multiple delivery mechanisms including school-
based programs for girls aged 15–19 years and a mix of community
health worker consultation, health facility–based clinics, and private
retailer distribution (for women living above the poverty line). Clearly,
however, more operational research is needed on this (see chapter 4).

Taking into account both technical efficiency (cost per outcome) and
the availability of delivery platforms for rapid scale-up, a subset of
interventions is identified that would be less costly to implement and
for which rapid scale-up would be possible (see table 7.6).

This set of priority interventions is more cost-effective than the full set
of interventions needed to achieve the targets (table 7.7). Yet overall

this package of interventions is less effective than the full package: it
leaves about 15 million more children stunted in 2025 and 1.4 million
child deaths are not prevented as compared with the full set of inter-

initial scale-up, but not as an end in itself.

Discussion
Expanding the coverage of the full package of nutrition-specific
interventions needed to achieve the four global nutrition targets
would cost about $70 billion over 10 years. Estimates here indicate
that this investment would avert about 3.7 million deaths of children
under five, reduce the number of stunted children by about 65 mil-
lion in 2025 compared with the 2015 baseline, reduce the number of
women of reproductive age suffering from anemia in 2025 by about
265 million compared with 2015, and increase the number of infants
under six months of age who are exclusively breastfed by 105 million
compared with 2015. In addition, 91 million children would be treated
for wasting.

However, not all of the interventions included in this package are
ready for an immediate scale-up. Some lack tested delivery platforms,
and for some there are no global guidelines. Expanding the coverage
of a more limited package of priority interventions that have high
benefit-cost ratios, are cost-effective, and have tested delivery chan-
nels supported by global recommendations would require $22.7 bil-
lion over 10 years. This package of priority interventions would be
more cost-effective (with a lower cost per death averted and a lower
cost per case of stunting averted) but would be, overall, less effective
and would not allow for reaching the global targets by 2025 based on
data available today. Therefore, this limited package of priority inter-
ventions is recommended as an initial “surge” but not as an end game
for achieving the global targets.

As discussed in chapter 6, the decline in mortality resulting from the
treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children that is estimated in
this report using LiST is lower than that estimated by other authors.
It is therefore likely that this model also significantly underestimates
mortality reductions that would result from expanding the coverage
of the treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children. It is possible
that mortality reductions from the treatment of severe acute malnutri-
tion may be several-fold higher. If this is the case, the cost per death
averted for the full and the priority package would be significantly
lower. However, alternative estimates of severe acute malnutrition-
attributable mortality risk (Schofield and Ashworth 1996; Bulti
et al. 2015) seem significantly overinflated (see chapter 6 for an in-
depth discussion). It is therefore difficult to offer a credible alternative
to the costs per death averted presented here. Nevertheless, the reader
should consider these to be lower-bound, conservative figures.

Several interventions contribute to the achievement of multiple
targets. The infant and young child nutrition counseling package
helps reduce the prevalence of stunting and increases the number of
children who are exclusively breastfed. Similarly, antenatal micronu-
trient supplementation and the intermittent presumptive treatment
of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic areas interventions help
prevent stunting as well as anemia in pregnant women. Some evi-
dence also suggests a relationship between repeated episodes of acute
malnutrition and the risk of stunting (see chapter 6). The analyses
demonstrate that scaling up the coverage of the key evidence-based
nutrition-specific interventions will help achieve multiple nutrition

targets. This in turn suggests that prioritizing a comprehensive
approach to improving the nutrition of children, pregnant women,
and adolescent girls and other women of reproductive age may be a
more useful and more cost-effective approach than focusing only on a
specific aspect of malnutrition (for example, only anemia).

The next chapter discusses how the anticipated $70 billion in financing
can be raised from domestic budgets, overseas development aid, and
innovative financing sources to achieve the global nutrition targets.

   Key Messages
   •	     Approximately $3.9 billion is currently being spent annu-
          ally on the costed package of interventions by governments
          in low- and middle-income countries and donors. Assem-
          bling the $70 billion of additional financing (above current
          spending on nutrition) that is needed to reach the global
          nutrition targets is a major challenge, but one that is achiev-
          able. Increments of about $7 billion annually, on average
          on top of current contributions, will be required every year
          through 2025.
   •	     A continuation of “business as usual”—extrapolating cur-
          rent spending growth trends for nutrition forward—will
          not be enough. About $13.5 billion in additional financing
          on top of current investments is expected to be contrib-
          uted over the next 10 years if “business as usual” contin-
          ues. However, such a scenario would result in falling far
          short of the global nutrition targets with a resource gap of
          $56 billion.
   •	     If governments, official development assistance (ODA), and
          new innovative financing mechanisms each contribute in
          alignment with a “global-solidarity” scenario to mobilize the
          additional resources needed, meeting these targets is feasible.

      •	   The analyses estimated that about $1 billion is currently
           provided by ODA for nutrition interventions, 53 percent or
           $531 million of which is allocated to treat severe and acute
           malnutrition. Another $358 million (36 percent) is allocated
           to the interventions costed for the stunting target. Much
           lower amounts are directed to interventions to increase
           exclusive breastfeeding ($85 million or 8.5%) and reduce
           anemia in women of reproductive age ($78 million or
           7.8 percent). Approximately 65 percent of ODA for nutrition
           is allocated to the 37 highest-burden countries.




T
       he preceding chapters—including the sections on financing
       needs, benefits, and rationale and evidence for investing in
       nutrition—lead naturally to the main question addressed in
this chapter: how to ensure that sufficient financing will be available
to achieve the global nutrition targets? At the heart of that question is
another: who will need to contribute and how much?

Governments,1 official development assistance (ODA),2 and other
sources,3 all help cover the costs of implementing nutritional interven-
tions in various ways. Success in reaching the targets will depend on
how much each of them can contribute in the years ahead. Estimates
of current financial contributions, by source, can help inform global
efforts to understand what is needed to close gaps and how to mobi-
lize action.

 The word governments refers in this chapter to the national authorities of low- and middle-income
countries, most of which are in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Other designations sometimes used
here and elsewhere for that same concept include countries, country governments, aid-recipient countries
or governments, and donor-assisted countries or governments. Developing countries, not used here, is com-
mon elsewhere. High-income countries and governments are excluded from these definitions; they
are covered under the section on “ODA.”
2
 ODA refers to official development assistance and similar kinds of aid. This comprises bilateral
assistance agencies (and the high-income countries to which they belong), multilateral organizations,
a wide variety of charitable institutions (not least of which are the large international nongovern-
mental organizations). Support from consortia of ODA funders, especially the Global Financing
Facility and the Power of Nutrition, is also important.
3
 Other sources include households (principally through their purchasing of nutrition-related products
and services); the private sector (as investors in nutrition-related ventures, and as buyers and sellers
of their outputs, and, less commonly, as charitable supporters); and non-state funders such as non-
governmental organizations that are not funded by bilateral or multilateral aid so are not counted
together with the bigger entities under “ODA.”

A projected $70 billion of additional financing on top of current con-
tributions is required over the next 10 years, according to the findings
presented in chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6, and aggregated across four of the
six global nutrition targets (stunting, anemia, breastfeeding, and wast-
ing) in chapter 7.

That $70 billion goal is mapped out over the next 10 years with a
scale-up plan beginning with an additional $1.5 billion needed in
2016, ramping up to an additional $9.7 billion per year by 2025. These
annual financing needs are in addition to the $3.9 billion the world
currently spends on nutrition every year. Thus, the required total—at
3.5-fold the level of current expenditure by 2025—is a very substantial
goal.

This chapter discusses the available evidence of current financing for
nutrition and important implications for future financing to achieve
the targets. The next section analyzes the current levels of investments
for nutrition by governments and ODA. It does so by laying out the
steps involved in determining that essential baseline, or current level
of spending, which is key for understanding what might ensue in
subsequent years. The following section then presents and interprets
two financing scenarios for the ten-year period until 2025 (first the
business-as-usual scenario and then the global-solidary scenario). The
chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of the results
of the analyses.



Current Levels of Spending on Nutrition
Current levels of spending on nutrition globally—through govern-
ments, ODA, and other sources—are not immediately obvious from
the extant data. This section describes the data sources and methods
used to estimate current global investments in the costed package of
interventions from governments and ODA. 4

 Funding for nutrition from civil society, nongovernmental organizations, philanthropic organiza-
tions, and other sources that is not easily captured could be substantial. There are numerous small
and medium sized nongovernmental organizations in low- and middle-income countries that
may not be tracked through donor reporting or through the national treasuries. These kinds of
contributions are termed off-budget sources and are very difficult to track (SPRING 2016a, 2016b).
Unfortunately, there is currently little to no data to estimate their share of global nutrition financing.
Accordingly, they were excluded from the current analysis.

Domestic Financing from Governments
Assembling good data on how much low- and middle-income coun-
tries currently spend on nutrition interventions by low- and middle-
income countries is complicated by the fact that many countries do
not routinely track or report spending on nutrition. As a result, they
do not have extensive information on hand on (1) the amount they
budget for and spend on nutrition, (2) interventions and programs
that are funded, and (3) the sectors funding those interventions. In
general, it is widely assumed that governments typically devote
relatively modest fractions of their own domestic budgets to nutrition
interventions.5 This report compiles and analyzes publicly available
data from the following sources:


•	 Public Expenditure Reviews for health.

•	 The World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Global Health
   Expenditure Database, which is a repository for data generated
   through the System of Health Accounts (SHA). At the time of
   this review, 15 countries had reported expenditures on nutri-
   tional deficiencies through the SHA (also known as the National
   Health Accounts).

•	 Case studies of nutrition budget and expenditure analyses
   including Tanzania’s public expenditure review for nutrition
   (United Republic of Tanzania, Ministry of Finance 2014), John
   Snow International’s SPRING project nutrition budget analysis
   in Uganda (SPRING 2016b) and Nepal (SPRING 2016a), and
   Save the Children UK’s budget analyses in Malawi, Zambia, and
   other countries (Save the Children and CSONA 2015).

•	 Nutrition budget allocation information reported by 30 Scal-
   ing Up Nutrition (SUN) countries in the 2015 Global Nutrition
   Report (IFPRI 2015). These data came from national or sectoral
   budgets, and were reviewed by researchers to ensure that what
   was counted as nutrition specific spending was standardized to
   match the costed package of interventions across all countries.
   For integrated programs marked as nutrition-specific (that is,
   wider maternal and/or child health programs without a clearly
   identified nutrition component), a lower bound of 10 percent
   and an upper bound of 50 percent were taken across these

    programs, assuming that nutrition components of wider mater-
    nal and child health programs are rarely over 50 percent of the
    entire program. In the end, the midpoint of the resulting estimate
    was taken as the “best” and simplest estimate for all these cases
    after expert consultation.

•	 Publicly available financial reports and national budget
   documents.

From these sources, data on domestic nutrition financing for 31 coun-
tries were compiled. The results are presented in appendix D.6

Regression models were used to assess the association between domes-
tic nutrition financing and various other variables such as health bud-
gets, gross economic product (GDP), general government expenditure,
and regional variations. Government expenditure on health per capita
was found to be positively correlated with government expenditure
for nutrition per stunted case.7 Although the sample size was low, this
model is intuitive, implying that nutrition financing is concentrated
among the countries with higher health spending. This model, based
on government health expenditure per capita and applied to all low-
and middle-income countries, provided an estimate of about $4.8 bil-
lion being spent globally by governments on all nutrition-specific
programs in 2015. Further analysis had to be conducted in order to
align the baseline with the costed package of interventions.

While some intervention-level financing data were available for a
few countries within the sample of 31 countries—India, Guatemala,
Malawi, Mexico, and Tanzania—this level of granularity was mostly
not available and had to be estimated in order to align the baseline
with the costed package of interventions.

The costed nutrition plans prepared for SUN countries, while they
do not provide information on budget allocations or actual spending,

6
 Where amounts spent are not obtainable, amounts budgeted are used. Spending often falls short of
budget targets, but the difference is generally not worrisomely large for purposes of this analysis.
Tanzania’s Public Expenditure Review for nutrition finds that 79 percent of the amount budgeted
was actually spent (United Republic of Tanzania, Ministry of Finance 2014).The methods and
approaches used in this chapter were presented to—and received general support from—various
convenings of experts over the course of the study including through the TAG. For example, at the
“Global Harmonization of Budget and Expenditure Analysis Methods for Nutrition” workshop held
November 3–4, 2015, in Arlington, VA, there was broad consensus that the methods are appropriate.
7
 Government expenditure on health per capita is found to be associated with government expen-
diture on nutrition per stunted child (r-squared is 0.58; regression coefficient 1.69). Analysis of the
residuals finds no significant bias. To minimize any potential impact from extreme outliers (and the
possibly incorrect data on them), the lowest-spending country (South Sudan) and the highest-
spending country (Costa Rica) were omitted.

offer some insights on the percentage distribution of allocations across
nutrition categories (SUN 2014). These costed plans were used only
to estimate the breakdown of nutrition spending by categories and not
for estimating the total spending (total spending was estimated using
the above mentioned sources only). For countries with costed nutri-
tion plans, intervention-level breakdowns reflect, albeit not perfectly,
how much a country has planned to invest in nutrition interventions.
A major limitation of this approach is that what is planned often does
not adequately reflect what gets financed; however, the approach was
thought to be the best approximation of intervention-level financing
for nutrition with data currently available.

Additional analyses were performed for India since it is home to the
highest absolute global burden of chronic malnutrition, and it is also a
lower-middle-income country already spending considerable domes-
tic resources for public health and nutrition schemes. Using the more
extensive nutrition-related data available for India, the analysis found
that the country contributed approximately $0.9 billion in 2013–14
to the programs and target groups of interest here.8 The majority is
directed toward public provision of complementary food for children
through the Integrated Child Development Services scheme, though
India also contributes about $50 million annually through the National
Health Mission for nutrition specific interventions such as micronutri-
ent supplementation and the treatment of acute malnutrition.

Of the $4.8 billion estimated to be spent for domestic financing for
nutrition, the average spending breakdown based on all available data
is as follows: 24 percent toward behavior change interventions for
good nutrition practices, 2 percent on treatment of acute malnutrition,
7 percent on micronutrient supplementation, 2 percent on fortifica-
tion, 26 percent on supplementary feeding, 12 percent on governance

 Nutrition-relevant budget allocation and utilization data are reported by the Government of India’s
Ministry of Women and Child Development through Lok Sabha (Unstarred Question No 861,
answered on February 2, 2015, in the Lok Sabha database of questions; see Lok Sabha, Parliament of
India (2016)). National Health Mission (NHM) budget documents were downloaded from the NHM,
Ministry Health and Family Welfare, Government of India website http://nrhm.gov.in/nrhm-
in-state.html. About $50 million was spent through NHM on nutrition-specific interventions in
2013–14. In 2013–14, the Government of India released about $1 billion to states for the Supplemen-
tary Nutrition Program (SNP) delivered through its Integrated Child Development Services, which
states equally match, resulting in about $2 billion for the program. Financing for that program is
included in the analysis since the program incorporates complementary food provision to vulnerable
households in need. However, some of that funding goes to older children (25 months to 6 years)
than the 6 to 24 months of interest here. Based on Government of India–reported beneficiary data of
the SNP program, 45 percent of the total is assumed to remain after that exclusion. See Lok Sabha,
Parliament of India (2016), Unstarred Question No 1327, answered July 18, 2014.

for nutrition, and 29 percent goes toward other nutrition programs
not aligned with the costed package of interventions (the majority of
this includes funding from India as mentioned in the footnote above).9
These proportions were applied to country estimates of total nutrition
funding in order to estimate funding by intervention.10 In total, it was
estimated that $2.9 billion in government contributions is aligned with
the costed package of interventions.


Official Development Assistance (ODA)
Figures on current nutrition ODA can be obtained from data reported
in the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (OECD 2016).
The CRS’s “purpose codes” make it possible to identify the amounts
associated with nutrition interventions, including those relevant for
the targeted package of interventions covered in these analyses..

The purpose code 12240 for “basic nutrition” is defined as “Direct
feeding programmes (maternal feeding, breastfeeding and weaning
foods, child feeding, school feeding); determination of micronutrient
deficiencies; provision of vitamin A, iodine, iron, etc.; monitoring of
nutritional status; nutrition and food hygiene education; household
food security.”

The basic nutrition purpose code is often used as a proxy for ODA
targeted to nutrition-specific interventions (IFPRI 2016). However,
based on its current definition, it includes funding for interventions
not considered nutrition specific based on the Lancet definition and
not included in the costed package of interventions. Also, funding for
many nutrition-specific programs can be coded under other purpose
codes within health and emergency responses (ACF 2012). To establish
an estimate of current ODA for nutrition aligned with the costed pack-
age of interventions, project level line items associated with 16 CRS
purpose codes (listed in appendix E) were examined, as described
below.

9
  The governance category includes information management, monitoring and evaluation, surveil-
lance, research, coordination and partnership, advocacy, communication, policy development, and
system capacity building.
10
  In order not to overestimate spending on wasting for countries with low wasting prevalence, it
was assumed that countries with a wasting prevalence of less than 5 percent are not investing in the
management of acute malnutrition because it likely would not be a priority for those countries. The
proportions for the other interventions were then normalized to 100 percent.

Basic nutrition: Qualitative review of project descriptions  In
2013, a total of $946 million in ODA was disbursed to basic nutrition
investments.11 In order to determine the amount of ODA allocated to
the costed package of interventions, project-level line items tied to
these disbursements were reviewed and categorized into interven-
tion categories based on qualitative project descriptions. This analysis
included all basic nutrition disbursements going to the 60 countries
with the highest global burdens of stunting, anemia, breastfeeding,
and wasting. Those countries represent 95 percent of the global stunt-
ing burden and received 70 percent of all disbursements to basic nutri-
tion in 2013 (representing 945 unique line items).

As shown in figure 8.1, ODA for basic nutrition has been increasing
since 2006 and the predominant share goes to African countries. In
2013, the majority of ODA for basic nutrition was allocated directly to
recipient countries (80 percent), with another 13 percent allocated to
regions to fund multi-country projects (not pictured), and 7 percent
was unspecified.12 Fortunately, donor reporting for basic nutrition
has been improving, as the amount of unspecified disbursements was
22 percent in 2006, as reported by the CRS.

The qualitative review of projects was conducted on the basis of all
available information through the CRS, including through review of
project titles and short and long descriptions that are meant to provide
a brief description of activities and objectives for the associated fund-
ing. Supplementary desk research was undertaken where information
directly from the CRS did not provide enough detail to categorize the
funding into an intervention category. Researchers used this informa-
tion to code line items with intervention categories. The full list of
intervention categories is shown in appendix E.




11
   At the time of analysis, 2013 data were the most recent information available and the intervention-
level analysis was conducted with this dataset. Financing for subsequent years (2014 and 2015)
was estimated by applying annual OECD growth rates for each year (1.8 percent and 1.9 percent,
respectively). See OECD Data, 2014, Real GDP Forecast, available at https://data.oecd.org/gdp/
real-gdp-forecast.htm. Subsequently, 2014 disbursement data became available and were reported
as $937 million, which is $26 million lower than predicted based on OECD growth. Because of the
two-year lag in CRS reporting and the resource-intense method to extract intervention-level data, it
is not possible to determine whether intervention or recipient country donor prioritization changed
between 2013 and 2015. All 2015 figures reported in this chapter for ODA for nutrition are based on
the analysis of 2013 data because these were the most recent data at the time of analysis. Future work
to track these resources year-on-year is needed for the purposes of monitoring and accountability.
12
  In order to estimate how regional disbursements are distributed to countries within the region, the
regional disbursement was assumed to be spread across the countries in each region in the same
proportions as the amounts directly going to countries. Aid classified as “unspecified” is excluded
since it could not be assigned definitely to a country or region.

During the review, the majority of projects were assigned to more than
one intervention category. For example, maternal and child health
projects often include both infant and young child nutrition counsel-
ing for mothers and supplementation. Since costs vary widely across
interventions, it is not accurate to assume funding is split evenly
across interventions. Therefore, disbursements were allocated across
interventions in accordance with the relative total costs of the inter-
ventions in a given country (relative costs were based on estimates
from the current analysis).13

Validation analyses were conducted for 1 percent of the projects
(n = 12): a team of 5 researchers independently coded project disburse-
ments and then verified their results against each other. Coding was
found to be reliable across coders.

The qualitative review of projects provided information on which
interventions were funded by donors within the 60 countries included
in the analyses (shown in appendix E). The average across these
60 countries was used to estimate what interventions are being funded
through all other disbursements within the basic nutrition code
(that is, recipient countries not included in the analyses and regional
disbursements).


Health and emergency response: Rapid keyword search assess-
ment  In addition to the basic nutrition purpose code, ODA for nutri-
tion is also substantial within sectors such as health and emergency
response. Indeed, the nutrition content of projects not specifically
labeled as nutrition projects can be significant, not least because those
other projects are often large overall when compared with nutrition
projects. Desk review and stakeholder interviews identified 15 addi-
tional purpose codes likely to contain funding for nutrition (listed in
appendix E). A rapid keyword search was conducted throughout all
titles and project descriptions under each purpose code to identify
relevant program disbursements.

Within health purpose codes, less than one percent to six percent of
disbursements were related to nutrition. Rapid assessment indicated
these investments went toward infant and young child nutrition coun-
seling, treatment of severe acute malnutrition for children, antenatal

 A few categories require special attention. For example, “capacity building” often has to be sepa-
13

rated from “research and development,” and nutrition interventions pertinent for this study have
to be isolated from other types of nutrition-related initiatives. In most cases, the project descriptions
provide good pointers for devising assumptions that mirror the reality.

micronutrient supplementation, vitamin A supplementation for
children, and prophylactic zinc supplementation for children. Within
emergency response purpose codes, less than one percent to five per-
cent of disbursements were related to nutrition, all of which went
toward the treatment of severe acute malnutrition.


Summary  Using OECD growth projections, ODA disbursements for
nutrition were estimated to be $1 billion in 2015. This figure is com-
prised of disbursements for the costed package of nutrition interven-
tions across the 16 purpose codes included in the analyses, includ-
ing about 13 percent through health, 34 percent through emergency
response, and 53 percent through basic nutrition.


Adding It All Up: Total Current Financing
Proceeding along the lines described above, the current total level
of financing from governments and ODA for the costed package of
interventions is estimated to be approximately $3.9 billion annually.
Contributions from other sources may exist; however, because of data
limitations they are not included.

Figure 8.2 shows the contributions by government and donors across
targets. Notably, proportional contributions between governments
and donors vary across different interventions and across regions.
India alone contributes about a third of the total government contri-
bution for the package of costed interventions across all four targets,
which is mainly directed toward one intervention—public provision
of complementary food for children through the Integrated Child
Development Services scheme (making up the majority of government
funding toward the stunting target). ODA presently contributes rela-
tively little to interventions costed for the stunting and anemia targets,
compared to governments; however, ODA does play a major role on
the treatment of wasting.

Notable patterns in current investments on nutrition can be seen for
countries grouped by income level:


•	 Low-income countries: Of the 15 low-income countries with nutri-
   tion financing data, the average estimated spending on nutri-
   tion interventions is just $0.85 per child under age 5 (standard
   deviation = 1.34; appendix E, table E.1). This group consists of
   the poorest countries with some of the highest rates of stunting

      globally. There are 35.9 million children under age 5 living across
      30 low-income countries in the world, where the prevalence of
      stunting ranges from 22 percent in Haiti to as high as 58 percent
      in Burundi. These countries rely on external assistance for health
      (that is, ODA) as an important source of fiscal space (Tandon
      and Cashin 2010), giving rise to potentially little prioritization
      of nutrition in the public sector. Based on data from the current
      analysis, low-income countries received 47 percent of all ODA
      for nutrition in 2013.

•	 Lower-middle-income countries: Of the 13 lower-middle-income
   countries with data, the average estimated spending on nutrition
   interventions is $4.66 per child under age 5 (standard deviation
   = 8.12; appendix E, table E.1).14 This group consists of coun-

   and delivery systems are typically more advanced than they
   are in low-income countries, indicating a higher ability to pay
   for health and nutrition services (Tandon and Cashin 2010).
   Included in this group are India and Nigeria, the two countries
   with the highest absolute burden of stunting. They have 58 and
   11 million stunted children under age 5, respectively. Even with-
   out these 2 countries, there are still 51 million children under age
   5 who are stunted in 42 other lower-middle-income countries.
   Based on data from the current analyses, lower-­    middle-income
   countries received 47 percent of all ODA for nutrition in 2013.

•	 Upper-middle-income countries: Of the 3 upper-middle-income
   countries with data, the average estimated spending on nutrition
   interventions is $8.15 per child under age 5 (standard deviation
   = 3.72; appendix E, table E.1). This group consists of countries
   with stable economies and higher public sector income than
   low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries.
   Because of their level of development, the double burden of
   malnutrition is common in these countries: although under-
   nutrition is persistent, overnutrition and obesity are rapidly
   becoming severe public health concerns (NCD-RisC 2016), and a
   strong reason for increased financing toward nutrition services.
   Although many upper-middle-income countries have a low
   stunting burden, there are still 20 million children stunted across
   38 upper-middle-income countries. Almost half of this burden is
   borne by China and Mexico, two large countries that are among
   the highest burden countries in the world. Upper-­  middle-
   income countries have stronger public sector health systems
   and a greater ability to implement nutrition interventions than
   low-income countries or lower-middle-income countries. Upper-
   middle-income countries rely less on external financing for
   health and nutrition. Based on data from the current analyses,
   upper-middle-income countries received six percent of all ODA
   for nutrition in 2013.

Additional insights can be gleaned from looking in more detail at the
results for ODA:


•	 The intervention-level analysis found that, on average, the
   basic nutrition code funds the following types of programs:
   behavior change communication for nutrition, including infant
   and young child nutrition counseling (14 percent of the total),
   the treatment of acute malnutrition (15 percent), micronutrient
Chapter 8  Financing the Global Nutrition Targets	                    199
       supplementation and fortification (9 percent), provision of com-
       plementary foods for children (4 percent), research and devel-
       opment (3 percent), system strengthening initiatives including
       capacity building (13 percent), and nutrition sensitive programs
       such as school feeding (42 percent). Less than one percent went
       to other interventions including deworming and salt iodization.

•	 In 2015, it was estimated that about $1 billion was disbursed to
   the costed package of interventions (including funding through
   basic nutrition, health, and emergency response).15 This includes
   $531 million (53 percent) going toward the treatment of severe
   and acute malnutrition and $358 million (36 percent) going
   toward the interventions costed for the stunting target. Much
   lower amounts are directed toward breastfeeding promotion
   ($85 million or 8.5%) and anemia ($78 million or 7.8 percent).
   Note that the amounts across targets cannot be summed to the
   total due to some intervention overlap within targets.

•	 Figure 8.3 shows how the total $1 billion in ODA for nutrition is
   distributed by region and income group of the recipient country.
   About 56 percent was disbursed to Sub-Saharan Africa, repre-
   senting the largest share among regions, where among these
   African countries, 67 percent of ODA for nutrition went to low
   income countries. About 65 percent of this funding for nutrition
   ($647 million) was disbursed to the 37 highest stunting burden
   countries.

•	 About 28 percent of total ODA for nutrition goes to 5 countries,
   which are spread across 3 regions. In order from highest to low-
   est, Ethiopia received $69 million (7 percent of total financing),
   Yemen $67 million (7 percent), South Sudan $50 million (5 per-
   cent), India $48 million (5 percent), and the Syrian Arab Republic
   $43 million (4 percent).16

   This includes $54 million reported by the CRS as disbursed to basic nutrition through the Interna-
tional Development Association (IDA). However, this is a small subset of the total nutrition portfolio
from the World Bank Group. As stated by the CRS, “differences between these OECD data (based on
World Bank reporting) and data published by the World Bank for economic sectors and themes (i.e.,
purpose of activities), are due to the use of different classification systems. The taxonomy used by
the World Bank provides a disaggregated depiction of World Bank activities more closely aligned to
its mandate and business model” (OECD 2015) and it is not possible to track IDA/IBRD contribu-
tions to nutrition via OECD/CRS databases. This is further complicated by the fact that IDA/IBRD
funds cannot be earmarked for future commitments.

     The majority of aid going to Syria was for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition.

Financing the Scale-Up to Reach
the Global Targets
The evidence on current levels of nutrition spending has been dis-
cussed in the previous section, and the core questions of this chapter
as noted at the outset can now be considered: how can the financ-
ing needs to achieve the World Health Assembly nutrition targets be
mobilized and how to pay for it? This section draws on everything
discussed so far as a baseline from which to start, looking closely to
determine whether enough financing can plausibly be raised to meet
the $70 billion additional financing needed over the 10 years from
2016 to 2025. If this is plausible, the issue is precisely how this can be
done—which sources of financing can do more, and how much will be
needed from each compared to the baseline starting point.

This section defines and explores two future financing scenarios,
one under assumptions of “business as usual” and the other under
assumptions of “global solidarity” to meet the World Health Assem-
bly targets for nutrition. The financing scenarios exclude costs to scale
up intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in
malaria-endemic regions as well as costs borne by households for food
fortification for the following reasons:


•	 Funding the cost to scale up intermittent presumptive treatment
   of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-endemic regions ($0.5 bil-
   lion) is covered by other health initiatives, including the Presi-
   dent’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB
   and Malaria, and to some extent national governments (Jhpiego
   MCHIP 2012; Thiam, Kimotho, and Gatonga 2013). Funding for
   this intervention is not likely to be counted as nutrition spending
   either by governments or donors.

•	 Household out-of-pocket expenditure on fortified food prod-
   ucts is expected to amass to about $19 billion over the 10-year
   period. These costs are discussed in a previous chapter, and are
   not included in the financing scenario in order to align with
   the $70 billion cost aggregation borne by the public sector and
   donors.

The Business-as-Usual Scenario
This scenario looks at trends in nutrition investments based on histori-
cal and projected economic growth and current commitments, and

202   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
assumes that all funding sources continue spending the same pro-
portion of their budgets on nutrition as they do now. Financing for
nutrition still increases, but only insofar as overall budgets increase.
For example, if a country currently spends 0.7 percent of its general
government expenditure on nutrition in 2015, it would spend that
same proportion in future years; but that may still imply added sup-
port for nutrition if general government expenditure rises as a result
of economic growth or other causes. In effect, all baseline investments
are maintained annually and additional financing arising from eco-
nomic growth is added on top of current spending.

Another way of thinking about this scenario is that governments,
ODA, and others are assumed to give no more (or less) priority to
nutrition in the future than they are giving to it now. That trend
would obviously be a very disappointing outcome from the perspec-
tive of those seeking faster progress toward reducing the burden of
nutritional deficiencies. It is, from that viewpoint, a low-case scenario
generating a lower-bound result.

To explore the ramifications of the business-as-usual scenario, the
likely trends in government budgets and ODA through 2025 are
considered:


•	 For governments, projections for (1) economic growth (GDP),
   (2) total government spending, and (3) the share of total spend-
   ing that goes to health are available for many countries and
   provide indicative guideposts for how budgets for nutrition are
   likely to develop. Using data from the International Monetary
   Fund’s World Economic Outlook provides a plausible basis for
   estimating how governments’ spending on nutrition will possi-
   bly develop.

•	 For ODA, future support for nutrition will be sensitive to
   changes in total, global ODA, which in turn will be sensitive to
   donor countries’ economic growth (GDP). From projections of
   those variables using OECD-reported data for 2013, estimates
   for aid for nutrition—for each recipient country—were devel-
   oped for 2014, 2015, and 2016, utilizing OECD growth rates for
   those years. The corresponding figures for 2017 through 2025
   were projected using the average of the growth rates for 2014–16
   (2.08 percent).



Chapter 8  Financing the Global Nutrition Targets	                    203
The business-as-usual scenario takes into account the commitments
that specific sources of ODA made at the Nutrition for Growth Sum-
mit in 2013, where $4.15 billion was pledged in support of nutrition-
specific programs by 2020 (Nutrition for Growth Secretariat [UK]
2013). It was assumed about half of those commitments are realized
($2.07 billion).17 That financing is attributed to each target in propor-
tion to current donor investments within the basic nutrition code.18

In addition, a very small contribution was assumed to be made
by households purchasing nutrition commodities. As discussed in
chapter 4, the literature shows that a fraction of non-pregnant women
above the poverty line purchase iron and folic acid supplements
through private retailers (Bahl et al. 2013) and this is also true for
other micronutrient commodities (Leive and Xu 2008; Rannan-Eliya
et al. 2012; Siekmann, Timmer, and Irizarry 2012). While most of the
costs to scale up micronutrient supplementation (including iron and
folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women) are borne by
the public sector and donors, theoretically, some of the scale-up costs
would be offset by household spending. Across the 10-year period, it
was estimated that households would contribute $748 million toward
these out-of-pocket purchases.19 The same assumption is made for the
global solidarity scenario.


The Global-Solidarity Scenario
The global-solidarity scenario was constructed with the explicit objec-
tive of demonstrating how the resource gap associated with meet-
ing the global nutrition targets can be closed through a coordinated
increase by governments and ODA, supplemented by innovative
financing mechanisms. Principles of sustainability and country ability
to pay were taken into account. The defining principles of the global-
solidarity scenario are shown in table 8.1.20

17
     ACTION scorecard indicates many ODA commitments are off track.
 Because of the nutrition-sensitive investments included in basic nutrition, as well as irrelevant
18

nutrition-specific interventions, only 76 percent ($1.57 billion) of Nutrition for Growth 2013 com-
mitments are attributed to the 4 targets. This financing is split equally each year for 2013–20, and
maintained at that level for 2021–25.
 Household contributions were generated by calculating the percentage of households that spend
19

regularly on these commodities using the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey data, and
applying this share to the estimated additional cost. This includes $505 million in out-of-pocket
spending for iron and folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women reported in an earlier
chapter, and a relatively modest amount toward all other micronutrient commodities.
20
  Note that support for intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria in pregnancy in malaria-
endemic regions (total cost = $416 million) is not included in the global-solidarity scenario. That
is because financing for that purpose is likely to be forthcoming under other initiatives, possibly
related to the sources that are funding this area currently, including the President’s Malaria’s Initia-
tive and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.

Chapter 8  Financing the Global Nutrition Targets	                                                   205
Results from the Two Scenarios
Given the above characterizations of the two scenarios—and the pre-
ceding discussion on current levels and required future flows that has
led up to this point—we present the bottom-line results and conclu-
sions from the analysis of financing requirements.

The business-as-usual scenario leads to a shortfall of about $56 bil-
lion over the next 10 years (figure 8.4). It highlights the magnitude
of the significant gap that—if governments, ODA, and others do not
do more than continue with what they are doing now—will persist
between what is needed to achieve the global nutrition targets and
what is projected to be spent in the next decade. The $56 billion figure
also calls attention to the stark reality that anything less than a major
expansion of financing over and above current trends will not be
enough: the targets will not be achieved. Also implicit in these results
is the need for swift action: given how large the gap is, failure to ramp
up quickly will make it impossible to raise sufficient funds by 2025.

The global-solidarity scenario (figure 8.5) shows how the financing
shortfall can be closed through the following coordinated efforts to
mobilize resources from national governments, ODA, and new inno-
vative funding mechanisms such as the Power of Nutrition and the
Global Financing Facility (GFF) for reproductive, maternal, neonatal,
child, and adolescent health and nutrition.


•	 Country governments would need to provide an additional
   $39.7 billion over 10 years from domestic budgets. Figure 8.5
   shows an increasing trend from the initial to later years, begin-
   ning with an additional $707 million in 2016 and ramping up to
   an additional $7 billion contributed by all governments by 2025.
   While this seems a drastic leap, it is worth noting that about
   80 percent of this additional $7 billion in the end year 2025 is
   contributed by middle-income countries.

•	 Traditional ODA would need to contribute an extra $25.6 billion
   over the 10 years. Figure 8.5 shows donors contributing to the
   scale-up phase within the first 5 years and increase to a maxi-
   mum amount of spending at $3.9 billion in additional contribu-
   tions by 2021. In addition to increased amounts of ODA, donor
   investments must be refocused to the most effective interven-
   tions and high burden geographies. From 2022 to 2025, donors

•	 Innovative sources would contribute another $3.4 billion over
   the 10 years.

To achieve these goals, high-burden country governments would
need to increase the share of their projected spending on health that is
directed to nutrition from about 1.0 percent to 2.9 percent. ODA would
need to boost expenditures on nutrition from an average of 1.0 percent
of total ODA to about 2.8 percent by 2021, after which this could taper
back to 1.8 percent by 2025.

All together, closing the resource gap would mean that the $3.9 billion
in current annual financing for nutrition interventions would need to
rise to $13.5 billion by 2025, a 3.5-fold increase.



Discussion
As noted at the outset of this chapter, mobilizing the $70 billion of
additional financing (over and above current spending on nutrition)
that is needed to reach the global nutrition targets will be a major
challenge, but it is one that is achievable. Meeting that goal is feasible
if governments, donors, and others contribute their share in align-
ment with a “global-solidarity” scenario that is defined and explored
in this chapter. On the other hand, a continuation of business as usual,
extrapolating current spending growth trends forward, will not be
enough; that scenario will result in falling far short of the global
nutrition targets. The challenge that exists is clear: a major increase in
financial commitments for nutrition will help solve a global problem
that has bedeviled humanity since the beginning; anything less will
condemn current and future generations to continued unnecessary
loss of life and opportunity. Investing in the early years of a child’s
life—or the first 1,000 days—will save lives and build economic
potential. The economic gains that will result from investing in better
nutrition are a way to garner increased government commitment to
improving nutrition.

Global success is possible. Past experience from other initiatives
shows that the dramatic acceleration of financing for the global nutri-
tion targets over a decade is feasible (Kim 2013). Between 2001 and
2011, the global AIDS movement saw funding for prevention and

Chapter 8  Financing the Global Nutrition Targets	                     209
treatment grow from less than $0.5 billion to more than $15 billion—a
rate of expansion greater than what is needed to scale up nutrition
programs (UNAIDS 2016).

Looking forward, the nutrition financing figures presented in the
global solidarity scenario fit within projections of future global health
financing. In terms of development assistance for health, while it has
been plateauing in recent years—between 2010 and 2015, development
assistance for health grew by just 1.2 percent annually—it is expected
to rise to $64.1 billion [95% confidence interval; $30.4–161.8 billion]
by 2040 (Dieleman, Schneider et al. 2016). Under the global solidar-
ity financing scenario, the maximum total contribution from donors
is about $4.9 billion ($3.9 billion on top of current spending) by 2021.
This $4.9 billion would represent approximately 14 percent of total
development assistance for health projected for 2021 (Dieleman,
Schneider et al. 2016), up from 3 percent in 2015. As such, this would
require a significant—but not unachievable—increase in the priority
given to nutrition within development assistance for health.

In terms of government health spending, Dieleman, Templin et al.
(2016) estimate that per capita health spending will increase by
3.4 percent in upper-middle-income countries, 3.0 percent in lower-
middle-income countries, and 2.4 percent in low-income countries
annually. Under the global solidarity financing scenario, upper-­
middle-income countries pay for 100 percent of the annual additional
costs needed to scale up the core package of nutrition interventions
in their countries. Lower-middle-income countries and low-income
countries pay for 70 percent and 50 percent of annual additional costs
by 2025, respectively. In 2025, total contributions for nutrition would
represent less than one percent of total projected government health
spending for upper-middle-income countries, less than two percent
for lower-middle-income countries, and about six percent for low-
income countries (Dieleman, Templin et al. 2016).21

Decisions on how to allocate resources for health depend on many
factors, including burden, cost-effectiveness of interventions, devel-
opment partner ability and willingness to contribute, intertemporal

tradeoffs (that is, balancing short-term contributions with longer-
term gains such as surveillance and monitoring), and health equity
(Dieleman and Haakenstad 2015; Resch, Ryckman, and Hecht 2014).
The high burden of malnutrition that exists today, combined with
the strong evidence for cost-effective interventions to prevent and
treat malnutrition, should be cause for accelerated prioritization of
nutrition—not only within health, but within all nutrition-relevant
­
sectors. The analyses presented here can help prioritize nutrition
within key global health investment frameworks for reproductive,
maternal, newborn, and child health that include nutrition as a cross-
cutting theme (Black et al. 2016; Stenberg et al. 2013).

With a combination of political will, widespread advocacy, and
smart investments, it is possible to move toward the global nutrition
­
targets—but only if the global community truly comes together to
accelerate and sustain financing and action. What will it take to mobi-
lize sufficient support for a transition to the global-solidarity scenario?
A full discussion of that important question requires in-depth com-
mentary that is beyond the scope of this chapter, the main purpose
of which is to provide a technical exposition of the basic numbers
defining future nutrition financing if the scale-up is to be achieved.
Nevertheless, the following points are offered as point of departure
for a larger strategy discussion that will be required.


Advocacy.  Advocacy efforts aimed at pushing the nutrition agenda
forward will be required at the local, state, national, and international
levels. Key policy messages will need to reach all relevant sectors in
order to maximize nutrition investment opportunities and leverage
funding multisectorally.


Political decision making.  To achieve the global nutrition targets by
2025, rapid and prioritized resource mobilization will be necessary.
The global solidarity scenario places a large cost-sharing responsibility
on domestic financing from high-burden governments. This is in line
with the agreements on sustainable financing from the Financing for
Development (FFD) conference held in Addis Ababa in July 2015. For
government contributions to increase, an investment case for nutri-
tion, country by country, will need to be presented to the appropriate
political leaders and stakeholders and will need to include the minis-
tries of finance for each country.



Chapter 8  Financing the Global Nutrition Targets	                     211
The scale-up of nutrition financing requires leaders to commit to
increasing nutrition investments and prioritizing nutrition within
their budgets. This will be needed both domestically and within
external development partner organizations in order to mobilize an
additional $70 billion by 2025.


Prioritization.  As discussed in an earlier chapter, under constrained
resources, priority should be given to the most cost-effective actions
that can be scaled up immediately. Increased efforts for research and
implementation science could help improve the technical efficiency of
interventions (lowering costs and maximizing impact), and maximize
service delivery opportunities for interventions.


Widespread implementation.  Simply achieving the $70 billion goal
in additional financing will not be enough, as implementation and
capacity constraints are critical components to scale-up. Even with
ample financial resources, many other factors—including technical
support, delivery systems, and supporting infrastructure—will need
to work well in synergy. Considerations of absorptive capacity need
due attention.


Monitoring and accountability.  All stakeholders will need to be
held accountable to their commitments through better resource track-
ing, analysis, and reporting for financial investments for nutrition.
In addition, linking investments with outputs in terms of improved
nutrition indicators across all global goals will help to increase tar-
       evidence-based programs. While these analyses represent a first
geted, ­
approximation on current investments for nutrition globally, future
analyses will depend on continued and improved expenditure track-
ing systems and better financing data. For governments, this means
enhanced focus on tracking resources for nutrition, preferably through
an institutionalized financial tracking system that monitors progress
toward a costed nutrition plan. For donors, it will be important to con-
sider a way to revise the way ODA for nutrition is coded. As described
above, the current basic nutrition code includes more than what is
typically considered nutrition-specific, while other health and emer-
gency codes include significant amounts going to nutrition-specific
interventions. A revised definition of the basic nutrition code could
exclude school feeding schemes, household food security, and other
          sensitive programs; and at the same time a policy marker
nutrition-­
could be put in place to mark disbursements across sectors and


212   	                                 An Investment Framework for Nutrition
purpose codes that are related to nutrition. Not only will this improve
resource tracking for nutrition-specific interventions, but it will also
lend itself to tracking nutrition-sensitive investments.


The underlying determinants of malnutrition improve.  While these
analyses focus on the cost of high impact, nutrition-specific interven-
tions, it is important to note that for these programs to be successful,
the underlying causes of malnutrition must be addressed through
multisectoral nutrition-sensitive programs. Efforts within WASH, agri-
culture, poverty reduction and social security, education, and other
nutrition-sensitive programs should continue and be enhanced. Cost
and financing analysis on nutrition-sensitive programs is warranted
for future study, especially assessment of the marginal costs associated
with making a program “more” nutrition-sensitive by building in core
nutrition-oriented components across sectors.

   Key Messages
   •	    The world needs $70 billion over 10 years to invest in high-
         impact nutrition-specific interventions in countries that
         carry the highest burden of stunting, anemia, and wasting,
         and the lowest rates of breastfeeding. This translates to just
         over $10 a year per child under age five. A smaller package
         of priority interventions would require $23 billion over 10
         years, or just over $4 per child.
   •	    Although the estimates of what it would take to achieve
         the global nutrition targets are based on ambitious scale-up
         assumptions, some countries have shown that rapid scale-
         up of nutrition interventions can be achieved and can lead
         to swift declines in stunting and other forms of malnutri-
         tion. Rapid declines in stunting have been achieved recently
         in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Peru, Senegal,
         Tanzania, and Vietnam, among other countries. In fact, the
         analyses suggest that at least one of the targets—the one for
         breastfeeding—has the scope to be much more ambitious.
   •	    The benefits of achieving these targets would be enor-
         mous. There would be 65 million fewer cases of stunting
         and 265 million fewer cases of anemia in women in 2025 as




Chapter 9  Reaching the Global Targets	                                   217
           compared to the 2015 baseline. In addition, at least 91 mil-
           lion more children would be treated for severe wasting
           and 105 million additional babies would be exclusively
           breastfed during the first six months of life over 10 years.
           Altogether, investing in interventions to reach these tar-
           gets would also result in at least 3.7 million child deaths
           averted. Furthermore, these analyses show that significant
           investments in both the key interventions and other health
           and poverty reduction efforts are required in order to
           achieve the targets.  
      •	   In an environment of constrained resources, investments
           should kick off by scaling up interventions with the high-
           est returns and those that are scalable now, with the strong
           caveat that scaling up only this priority set of interventions
           would not achieve the global targets. Financing this more
           limited set of actions will require an additional investment
           of $23 billion over next 10 years. When combined with
           other health and poverty reduction efforts, this priority
           investment approach could still yield significant returns: an
           estimated 2.2 million lives would be saved and there would
           be 50 million fewer cases of stunting in 2025 than in 2015.
           Further investments would be needed over time to build up
           to scaling up the full package.
      •	   The analyses also identify critical areas of research that
           need to be prioritized by the global community, including
           determining scalable strategies for delivering high-impact
           interventions, developing new tools to help countries prior-
           itize the most cost-effective interventions, and understand-
           ing how to effectively prevent wasting among children.  
           Better data on annual domestic and official development
           assistance (ODA) financing would also greatly facilitate
           future progress tracking.
      •	   Stunting and other forms of malnutrition can be a life sen-
           tence, but they must not be accepted as the “new normal.”
           Although political commitment is growing rapidly for
           investing in the 1,000-day window of opportunity, more is
           needed to move this agenda from a pet cause to a common

         cause, and from a political imperative to an economic
         imperative.
   •	    Given the right investments in “gray-matter infrastructure”
         at the right time, every child can achieve her full poten-
         tial. And the payoffs from these investments are durable,
         inalienable, and portable. An in-depth understanding of
         current nutrition investments and their impacts, future
         needs, and ways to mobilize the required financing pre-
         sented here will pave the way forward for action.




Rationale for Investing in Nutrition
Decades of chronic underinvestment in nutrition have led to progress
that is slow and uneven. This underinvestment is a primary reason
why malnutrition remains an underlying cause of almost half of all
deaths among children under age five, a driver of maternal mortal-
ity, and a barrier to more rapid economic development and poverty
reduction in scores of countries around the world. Currently, all forms
of malnutrition (undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and
overweight) cost the global economy an estimated $3.5 trillion per
year, or $500 per individual, creating a major impediment for country
governments to reduce poverty and create thriving and productive
communities (Global Panel 2016). Unlike investments in physical
infrastructure, investments to promote optimal nutrition generate
benefits that are durable, inalienable, and portable. Why is this so?
Ensuring optimum nutrition—particularly early in life—can perma-
nently alter an individual’s development trajectory and maximize his
or her productive potential. If this window of opportunity is missed, it
is missed for life.

In 2015, nearly 159 million children remain stunted in the world,
depriving individuals of their full potential and economies of human
capital to drive economic growth (UNICEF, WHO, and World Bank
2015). In addition, nearly 50 million children are wasted, predisposing
them to premature death and disability (UNICEF, WHO, and World

                                             remain anemic each year,
                                             exposing them to the risk
of perinatal mortality as well as consigning them to reduced work
capacity and lower productivity (WHO 2008).

In 2012—in an effort to rally the international community around
improving nutrition—the World Health Assembly endorsed a Compre-
hensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant, and Young Child Nutri-
tion (WHO 2014a), including the first-ever global nutrition targets
(see table 1.1). These targets aim to boost investments in cost-effective
interventions and catalyze progress toward decreasing malnutrition
and micronutrient deficiencies. To sustain the momentum, world
leaders enshrined some of the World Health Assembly targets within
the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.2, committing to end
malnutrition in all its forms by the year 2030. With this in mind, this
report aims to identify the financing needs for achieving four of the
six World Health Assembly targets: stunting, anemia, breastfeeding,
and wasting. It also lays out two possible financing scenarios that can
generate the resources—from domestic government, official develop-
ment assistance (ODA), and innovative financing sources—needed for
this purpose.  

The analyses in the previous chapters show that an additional invest-
ment of $70 billion would allow the world to achieve the global
targets for stunting, anemia, breastfeeding, and to scale the treatment
of severe acute malnutrition for children. This investment includes
$62.4 billion in direct service delivery costs and an additional $7.5 bil-
lion for capacity strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and policy
development.

The benefits of achieving these targets would be enormous (figure 9.1).

women would be prevented in 2025 as compared with the 2015 base-
line. In addition, at least 91 million more children would be treated for
severe wasting and 105 million additional babies would be exclusively
breastfed during the first six months of life over 10 years. Altogether,
investing in these targets would also result in averting at least 3.7 mil-
lion child deaths. The estimates presented in the previous chapters
have focused on nutrition-specific actions. However, the analyses show
that significant investments in both the nutrition-specific interventions
and nutrition-sensitive actions in agriculture, water and sanitation, and
the enabling environment are required to achieve the stunting, breast-
feeding, and anemia targets (and probably the wasting target as well).  

The analyses confirm that the benefits of investing in preventing
malnutrition in children and women vastly outweigh the costs. The
benefit-cost ratios presented for the stunting, anemia, and breastfeed-
ing packages are all substantially greater than one, the breakeven
point, and this holds true across many different contexts.

Although the estimates of what it would take to achieve the global
nutrition targets are based on ambitious scale-up rates, some coun-
tries have shown that rapid scale-up of nutrition interventions can
be achieved and can lead to swift declines in stunting rates. Rapid
declines in stunting have been achieved recently in Bangladesh,
China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Vietnam,
among other countries (figure 9.2). Experiences from two other coun-
tries that have achieved remarkable progress, Peru and Senegal, are
described in detail in boxes 9.1 and 9.2, respectively. Evidence from
Vietnam shows that interventions to promote breastfeeding and to

The global experience on Vitamin A supplementation is another such
example which shows that nutrition outcomes can be achieved with
commitment, financing and capacity building to deliver and sustain
programs at scale (box 9.4).



Discussion
Although the additional investment of nearly $70 billion over the next
10 years represents a large price tag in absolute terms, it is a miniscule
investment in relative terms when compared with other issues the
world cares about. For example, the world spends nearly $1.5 billion
per day (about $500 billion per year) in untargeted and often unpro-
ductive subsidies for agriculture (Potter 2014) in addition to another
$543 billion per year (about 1.5 billion per day) on fossil fuel subsidies
(IEA 2014). With the right political commitment and economic impera-
tives, channeling resources toward productive investments such as
nutrition is therefore feasible and could yield significant benefits for
global and national economies.

Furthermore, even within the health sector, an instructive precedent
for building a successful nutrition financing “movement” is avail-
able from the recent history of HIV financing. In 1998, when the AIDS
epidemic was raging, low- and middle-income countries were spend-
ing around $500 million annually to fight HIV. Fifteen years later, with
a strong push from civil society organizations representing affected
groups as well as governments, nearly $20 billion is being spent each
year in these countries on HIV control, more than half of which is
from low- and middle-income country governments (UNAIDS 2013).
The proposed financing approach for nutrition is somewhat different

      Box 9.1: Peru’s Success in Reducing Stunting
      If ever anyone doubted that stunting rates could be halved in just one
      decade, they have only to look to Peru. In 2000, one in three Peruvian
      children was chronically undernourished. In 2005—five years and mil-
      lions of dollars later—the numbers remained virtually unchanged at
      28 percent of children stunted. But by 2014, something extraordinary
      had happened. Stunting fell to only 14 percent, which begs the ques-
      tions, “Just how did Peru do it? What parts of the Peruvian experience
      are replicable elsewhere?”

      In 2010, the country awoke to the pressing crisis of child undernutrition.
      High-level political officials endorsed an effort known as “5x5x5”—
      which aimed to reduce stunting in children under 5 by 5 percentage
      points in 5 years and to lessen the resource and health access inequali-
      ties between rural and urban areas. With a budding knowledge base on
      factors influencing nutrition outcomes, a community of practice involv-
      ing government and stakeholders paved the way for targeting and
      scaling up nutrition programs. Massive media campaigns put the face
      of malnutrition into each and every home and health center through
      radio and television spots and videos, such as My Future in my First Five
      Centimeters. That media effort also promoted the importance of essential
      health and nutrition services, including child growth promotion and
      early child development sessions. To support the supply and expansion
      of high-quality services, a strong monitoring system was linked to a
      performance incentive mechanism in the Ministry of Finance to redi-
      rect resources to the areas where they were most needed and to reward
      improved coverage and delivery of those services that were assessed to
      be the most cost-effective in improving child nutrition. A multisectoral
      effort, spearheaded by the Ministry of Finance and the Prime Minister’s
      office, strengthened the link between the existing conditional cash trans-
      fer program JUNTOS and the supply of health and nutrition services.
      This contributed to more than doubling the uptake of regular child
      health and nutrition checkups in rural areas—from 20 percent in 2008 to
      58 percent in 2013.

      A further outstanding element of Peru’s success is the significance of
      having annual data on stunting. The power of regular data collection

   and use cannot be understated in terms of its contribution to endur-
   ing political support. As a result of the comprehensive nutrition policy
   and the trifecta of supply, demand, and accountability, stunting among
   particularly vulnerable rural populations fell from 44 percent in 2008 to
   28 percent in 2014 (INEI 2015) (figure B9.1.1). Despite leveling economic
   growth during this period, Peru demonstrated a remarkable effort to
   not only curb stunting rates, but also to create strong commitment and
   collaboration across sectors to integrate nutrition into social protection
   programs and, in return, save millions of lives.

  Box 9.2: Senegal’s Nutrition Policy Development Process:
  A Work in Progress
  Senegal has long been plagued by rampant malnutrition. However, prior to
  2000, the country’s attention was focused primarily on providing humani-
  tarian assistance in the wake of shocks or crises. In 2001, Senegal recog-
  nized that the pressing problem of stunting was significantly reducing the
  cognitive development and growth potential of as many as 30 percent of
  the nation’s children under age five. Three main factors contributed to the
  country’s proactive effort to reduce stunting: high-level political commit-
  ment, a multisectoral strategy, and direct and largely government-driven
  nutrition financing. Under these pillars, the government undertook a
  shift from crisis mitigation to prevention and promotion, cutting program
  costs dramatically by using local resources and creating an institutional
  arrangement specifically to fight malnutrition under the Prime Minister’s
  office, which gave voice and responsibility to all those invested. The use of
  evidence-based programming led to innovative approaches to community
  mobilization, participation, and, ultimately, ownership over improvements
  in nutrition programming.

  The result of this shift in priorities was impressive. The program scaled up
  to reach 50 percent of children under age five by 2010 with vital outreach
  services that included the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, vitamin
  A supplementation, and service utilization. In just three years following
  this scale-up, the prevalence of stunting in children under five fell from
  26.5 percent to 18.7 percent (ANSD and ICF International 2012, 2015).
  Senegal now has one of the lowest rates of stunting in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  Remarkably, nutrition in Senegal improved even though the economy
  showed weak and uneven growth, which on average hovered between
  1 and 2 percent.

and must be tailored to the nutrition context, since young children do
not have the same voice that HIV-affected groups did. But the argu-
ment for investing in children’s early years is building rapidly, with
support from world leaders, including the President of the World
Bank, the African Nutrition Leaders initiative supported by the
African Development Bank, and finance ministers and heads of state
from several high-burden countries. Therefore this report develops a
scenario wherein ODA financing will kick off the effort with a surge
of financing (3.5 times current investments) for the first five years,

followed by a slower but more sustained scale-up from domestic
resources over the second five years.  

To provide the $70 billion needed to reach the stunting, anemia, and
breastfeeding targets and mitigate the impacts of wasting, national
governments will need to mobilize an average of $4 billion more of
domestic resources per year, and ODA will need to mobilize an addi-
tional $2.6 billion annually over the next 10 years (table 9.1).

The additional financing required under the proposed global-­
solidarity scenario (see chapter 8) to reach the global target will
require large efforts by all stakeholders. For the governments in high-
burden countries, it will be challenging to allocate, on average, nearly
2.9 percent of their health budgets to nutrition, an increase from the
current average of only 1 percent. Although this level of domestic
spending is ambitious, many countries have shown that it is achiev-
able. In order to propose a sustainable financing scenario, the plan is
for high-­burden countries to gradually scale up their domestic budget
shares over 10 years. If they start early and sustain their efforts, and
if political commitment translates into budgets, the year-on-year rate
of increase is feasible. Countries such as Ethiopia, India, Malawi, and
Pakistan are already moving in this direction.

For external financiers, meeting their share of the global-solidarity
scenario through ODA will require them to substantially raise their
share of development assistance for health devoted to stunting reduc-
tion and overall improvement of nutrition outcomes in the early
phases. For some donors such as Canada, which already contributes

  Box 9.3: The Vietnam Experience: Investing in ­
  Promotion and Anemia Reduction
  Vietnam is currently on track to meet at least two of the global targets:
  increased exclusive breastfeeding and reduced anemia by 2025. The
  country has proven that investing in the right policies and strategies can
  significantly improve indicators. In 2010 in Vietnam, nearly one-third of
  children under five years of age were stunted and fewer than 20 percent
  of infants under six months of age were exclusively breastfed. Key
  challenges included general perceptions that women could not produce
  sufficient breastmilk, the common practice of giving pre-lacteal feeds to
  newborns, the early introduction of water and other foods, aggressive
  marketing and widespread availability infant formula, lack of commu-
  nity and workplace support, and limited health worker commitment
  and skills to support mothers to breastfeed.

  During this time, a social franchise model was successfully imple-
  mented to increase breastfeeding counseling for mothers, the govern-
  ment extended maternity leave from four to six months and expanded
  the ban on the marketing of breastmilk substitutes, and an integrated
  pro-breastfeeding mass communication campaign was launched—­
  reaching 85 percent of mothers nationwide. This comprehensive strategy
  changed perceptions, practices, policies, and services toward a more
  ­
  breastfeeding-friendly society (Alive & Thrive 2014). The social franchis-
  ing model, which covered over 500,000 women in 15 of 58 provinces,
  raised the rate of exclusive breastfeeding (in children 0–5 months of age)
  compared with the rate in control sites by 28.3 percent over the 2010–14
  period.

  Targeted interventions to address micronutrient ­  deficiencies—including
  supplementation, diet diversification, and food fortification—have also
  resulted in promising and steady reductions in deficiencies, particu-
  larly anemia among women. In the past two decades, the government
  of Vietnam has prioritized the control and prevention of micronutrient
  deficiencies through national policies and strategies, including specific
  policies on prevention of iron deficiency. Since then, Vietnam has seen a
  steady decline in anemia rates among women of reproductive age to a
  current prevalence of 14 percent (Stevens et al. 2013).

  The Vietnam experience clearly shows that prioritizing the investment
  in policies and strategies to reduce malnutrition through increased
  breastfeeding rates and reduced anemia prevalence puts achieving, and
  even maybe exceeding, the global targets within reach.

over 11 percent of health ODA to basic nutrition, the challenge will be
easier to meet. At present, 13 Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) member countries are providing less than
$1 million each in direct aid for nutrition (OECD 2016); they could
potentially be encouraged by the evidence presented in this report to
make shifts in their policies to prioritize nutrition. New and innova-
tive sources of external financing, including the Global Financing
Facility in support of Every Woman Every Child, and the Power of
Nutrition which leverages traditional financing to access new philan-
thropic and private funding, will also be crucial to help fill the gap.1

In an environment of constrained resources, if the world could not
afford the $70 billion needed to achieve the targets, investments
should kick off by scaling up interventions with the highest returns
and those that are scalable now (that is, those that maximize both
technical and allocative efficiency), with the strong caveat that scaling
up only this priority set of interventions will not achieve the global
targets. Financing this more limited set of actions will require an
additional investment of $23 billion over next 10 years. When com-
bined with other health and poverty reduction efforts, this priority
investment approach could still yield significant returns: an estimated
2.2 million lives would be saved and there would be 50 million fewer
cases of stunting in 2025 than in 2015. This would, however, need to
be sustained and built up over time to scale up to the full package so
as to achieve the global targets. During this initial scale-up phase, it
will also be critical to boost investments in agendas that will support
further scale-up—including implementation science and bottlenecks
to scaling up.

Furthermore, the key to sustainable financing for nutrition lies with
ministers of finance in the affected countries, and domestic financing
will remain the highest priority as agreed at the Addis Ababa Financ-
ing for Development meeting in 2015.



Limitations and Constraints
Several important limitations of the analyses presented in this report
should be considered.

 See box 1.3 in chapter 1 for more information on the Power of Nutrition and the Global Financing
Facility in support of Every Woman Every Child.


Chapter 9  Reaching the Global Targets	                                                        229
Data on unit costs are available only for a limited number of coun-
tries and regions, so some analyses are based on extrapolated unit
costs. Furthermore, unit cost data are often based on regional or local
programs (for example, Puett et al. 2013). It was assumed that the unit
cost for large-scale national programs would be similar, but this may
not necessarily be the case. Finally, the analyses assume unit costs
remain constant over time (with the exception of the costs of treatment
of severe acute malnutrition; see chapter 6 for details). It is likely that
the unit cost will in fact change over time as a result of the expan-
sion of scale (economies of scale and scope), program maturation and
efficiency gains in program delivery, changes in protocols, and other
factors.  Unfortunately, currently no empirical assessments of nutrition
program unit cost changes over time exist either in peer-reviewed or
gray literature. This is identified as an area for future work.

Similarly, although data on baseline coverage of some interventions
(such as vitamin A supplementation for children) are easily available,
for other interventions—including infant and young child nutrition
counseling, treatment of severe acute malnutrition, and staple food
fortification—data are sparse. Data on breastfeeding and complemen-
tary feeding counseling are not routinely collected by flagship surveys
(for example, the Demographic and Health Surveys, DHS). Therefore,
proxy measures (such as the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding)
had to be used. Data on the treatment of severe acute malnutrition
are not collected at all in the DHS or any other standardized survey
instruments, even though outpatient treatment of severe acute mal-
nutrition has been recommended as the gold standard for nearly a
decade (WHO et al. 2007). As noted in chapter 6, the extrapolation of
the coverage data from the coverage monitoring network probably
overestimates the current coverage and, consequently, leads to an
underestimation of the financial needs.  

Robust data on domestic financing for nutrition remain limited
despite recent efforts, with data currently available for only 31 coun-
tries, and these data are derived mainly from aspirational plans or
budgets rather than actual expenditures. Moreover, since domestic
government and ODA financing estimates are rarely disaggregated to
the intervention level, the numbers presented here are best estimates.

Another limitation is that the estimates of the impact of the interven-
tions are based primarily on results from clinical trials in experimental
settings, rather than on large-scale real-world implementation of inter-
ventions. Therefore they likely overestimate the impact the scale-up

230   	                                  An Investment Framework for Nutrition
of the interventions may have on nutrition outcomes, morbidity, and
mortality. This is a general limitation of studies using mathemati-
cal modeling in the context of public health. However, it is clear that
more evidence of effectiveness from large-scale programs is needed to
inform nutrition program planning and management.

Evidence regarding wasting prevention is very limited (see chapter 6
for a more in-depth discussion). Consequently, it was impossible
to estimate the cost of reaching the wasting target. Instead, the esti-
mates presented include costs for treating severe acute malnutrition
(wasting). This is an expensive intervention (approximately $110
per episode per child in Sub-Saharan Africa and $90 in South Asia).
Furthermore, the treatment of wasting comprises over 50 percent of
the current ODA for nutrition. It is possible that effective wasting
prevention interventions may turn out to be more cost-effective than
treatment. This is especially likely given the emerging evidence of
the long-lasting health and developmental effects of wasting in early
childhood (WHO 2014c). However, the current state of evidence is
insufficient to determine whether this is indeed the case. As discussed
in chapter 6, data on wasting-related mortality are also limited. The
approach used here—based on Olofin et al. (2013) analyses of wasting
as a risk factor increasing mortality from pneumonia, sepsis, measles,
and other conditions—seems to underestimate the impact of wasting
on mortality. Alternative estimates, on the other hand, seem to inflate
wasting-attributable mortality. More precise, recent, and generaliz-
able (outside of Sub-Saharan Africa) data regarding the impact of
wasting on mortality and morbidity are needed to accurately assess
     effectiveness and benefits-cost ratios of wasting prevention and
cost-­
treatment interventions.

The global estimates presented in this report are based on assump-
tions that may or may not apply equally to every regional/country
context or to fragile and conflict-affected settings. For this reason, the
conclusions and recommendations that follow are kept at the global
level, with some indications for regional levels.

Following earlier global nutrition cost studies (Horton et al. 2010), an
assumption was made that the program cost would account for an
additional 12 percent of the total service delivery cost. It is possible
that this is an underestimate of actual program costs. For example,
a recent study from Kenya shows that program management cost
(capacity building, monitoring and evaluation, general program
overhead, advocacy) accounted for as much as 60 percent of the direct

Chapter 9  Reaching the Global Targets	                                 231
service delivery cost (UNICEF 2015). At the same time, however,
program costs may be lower in other regions where stronger and more
efficient health systems require less investment in capacity develop-
ment, supervision, monitoring, and other program costs than those
needed in Sub-­ Saharan Africa. Systematic examination of actual nutri-
tion program costs in a variety of contexts is urgently needed.

Further limitations include barriers to the immediate scale-up of two
of the most expensive interventions—prophylactic zinc supplemen-
tation for children and public provision of complementary food for
­
children—that account for 43 percent of total intervention costs. In
addition, delivery of iron and folic acid supplementation for non-
pregnant women age 15–49 outside of schools and balanced energy-
protein supplementation for pregnant women also account for a large
share of the total financing needs (about 11 percent). However, to
date there is little experience with scaling up these interventions, and
World Health Organization guidelines on their delivery are yet to be
issued. Because these interventions are highly effective and needed
to reach the global targets, it is imperative that development of such
guidelines be prioritized. A related issue is the strong need to explore
new mechanisms for service delivery at scale that improve upon
allocative efficiency—that is, to direct resources toward the most cost-
effective interventions and those that contribute to multiple targets.
For these reasons, this report presents an alternative priority package
of interventions that are ready for immediate scale-up. This priority
package requires a much lower financing of $23 billion over 10 years.

The analyses presented in the report show that reaching the stunt-
ing and anemia targets will be possible only if improvements in the
underlying determinants of malnutrition accompany the nutrition-
specific investments identified in the report. Improvements in these
underlying determinants may come from so-called nutrition-sensitive
actions for which evidence on costs and benefits is very limited, and
therefore they are not included in the report. One exception is that
WASH interventions are included in the stunting analyses (see chap-
ter 3). The interventions are well defined (with the exception of the
hygienic disposal of children’s stool) and their impact on nutrition
outcomes (via diarrhea incidence) is well documented. WASH inter-
ventions were excluded from cost and benefit-cost estimates, how-
ever, because it is expected that these will be financed under separate
financing mechanisms aimed at reaching the Sustainable Develop-
ment Goal WASH targets.


232   	                                 An Investment Framework for Nutrition
Policy Implications and Recommendations
Three key policy recommendations flow from this report:

	 1.	The world needs $70 billion over 10 years to invest in high-impact
     nutrition-specific interventions in order to reach the global targets
     for stunting, anemia, and breastfeeding and to scale up the treat-
     ment of severe wasting. This translates to just over $10 per child.
    These investments are expected to have large benefits: 65 million
    cases of stunting and 265 million cases of anemia in women would
    be prevented in 2025 as compared with the 2015 baseline. In addi-
    tion, at least 91 million more children would be treated for severe
    wasting and 105 million additional babies would be exclusively
    breastfed during the first six months of life over 10 years. Alto-
    gether, achieving these targets would avert at least 3.7 million
    child deaths. And, importantly, every dollar invested in this pack-
    age of interventions would yield between $4 and $35 in economic
    returns. This is in line with previous studies suggesting returns of
    $18 (Hoddinott et al. 2013).

    If resources are scarce in the initial phases, priority may be given
    to scaling-up a smaller package of highly effective and interven-
    tions that are ready for immediate scale-up at a cost of just over $4
    per child, or $2.3 billion per year. This must, however, be accom-
    panied with investments in implementation science and address-
    ing bottlenecks to scaling up the rest of the package.

	 2.	Even though some of the targets, especially those for reducing
     stunting and anemia in women, are ambitious and will require
     concerted efforts in financing, scale-up, and sustained commit-
     ment, recent experience from several countries suggests that it is
     feasible. On the other hand, the target for breastfeeding has scope
     to be much more ambitious.
	 3.	Some areas of research need to be prioritized:
    a.	 Research on scalable strategies for delivering high-impact interven-
        tions is critical. This includes determining how to address
        bottlenecks to scaling up, for example through results-based
        budgeting approaches, or other ways of incentivizing results
        (World Bank 2016a). Such implementation research will not only
        facilitate faster scale-up, but it would also have the potential

  Box 9.4: Achieving High Coverage of Nutrition-Specific
  Interventions: Lessons from Vitamin A Supplementation
  Vitamin A supplementation provides a salient example of the poten-
  tial to achieve sustained, high coverage of evidence-based nutrition
  programs. Over 95 million children under the age of five globally have
  compromised immunity as a result of vitamin A deficiency. The semi-
  annual provision of vitamin A capsules is an effective way to reduce
  vitamin A deficiency and its associated morbidity and mortality.

  Vitamin A supplementation can be delivered through routine health
  facility contacts (for example, well-child and immunization visits for
  children under age five). However, because of bottlenecks in the provi-
  sion of public health services (low utilization, broken supply chains,
  low-quality health care, and so on), nontraditional mechanisms are
  necessary to reach vulnerable populations. Vitamin A campaigns serve
  as an effective means of achieving high and equitable population vita-
  min A supplementation coverage. Vitamin A campaigns serve to bridge
  the gap between the needs of the underserved and the formal health
  sector.

  Vitamin A supplementation has a number of features that make it
  feasible to achieve high population coverage, even in countries that lack
  well-resourced and high-capacity health systems:

  •	 Clear, strong evidence of positive health impact and cost-­
     effectiveness: Strong evidence has facilitated political support.
     Community trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated the posi-
     tive association between supplementation and decreased mortality
     (Imdad et al. 2010), while experts routinely cite vitamin A supple-
     mentation as one of the most cost-effective nutrition interventions
     (Horton, Alderman, and Rivera 2008). The analyses in this report
     support the cost effectiveness of vitamin A supplementation (see
     table 7.4).
  •	 Clearly defined target populations and routine delivery schedules:
     For countries with a high under five mortality rate, where vitamin
     A deficiency is defined as a public health problem or that have a
     history of programming for vitamin A distribution, vitamin A is
     delivered to all children age 6–59 months on a regular, twice-annual
     basis.
  •	 Simplicity of intervention: Community health volunteers can safely,
     effectively, and easily deliver vitamin A supplementation without
     intensive training and through twice-yearly campaigns.

   Box 9.4: Achieving High Coverage of Nutrition-Specific
   Interventions: Lessons from Vitamin A Supplementation
   (cont.)
   Through integration with child vaccination campaigns or maternal and
   child health days/weeks, a number of countries have successfully insti-
   tutionalized the provision of vitamin A supplements and achieved sus-
   tained, high coverage (figure B9.4.1). These countries demonstrate that
   near-universal access to this essential nutrition intervention is possible.

           to increase the technical efficiency and delivery costs for these
           interventions, thereby reducing future global financing needs.
    b.	 Another critical area for future research is the assessment of alloca-
        tive efficiency—that is, identifying the optimum funding allocation
        among different interventions, or an allocation that maximizes
        impact under a specific budget constraint. The present analyses
        show cost per outcome, allowing for only limited comparisons
        of cost-effectiveness among different interventions for the same
        targets.

      c.	 Research to improve the technical efficiency of nutrition spending is
          also urgently needed. This includes research on new strategies
          for addressing complex nutritional problems such as stunt-
          ing and anemia, as well as technologies to help these solutions
          scale up more rapidly and at cheaper rates. Because of the
          multifactorial nature of anemia, research is underway to get
          clarity on what fraction of the problem can be addressed by
          nutrition interventions; these estimates may need to be revised
          accordingly once results become available. Additionally, some
          micronutrient deficiencies are not included in this report (that
          is, iodine), because these were not included in the global tar-
          gets, even though they have significant impacts on morbidity,
          mortality, and economic productivity.
      d.	 Strengthening the quality of surveillance data, unit cost data for
          interventions in different country contexts, and building stronger
          data collection systems for estimating current investments (from
          domestic governments and ODA) in nutrition are vital. Further
          research is needed on the costs of interventions such as mater-
          nity leave to support women in the workforce to encourage
          them to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months.
          Not only are improvements needed to better track national-
          level expenditures for nutrition, but also spending must be
          closely monitored to track progress, ensure accountability, and
          identify areas for further efficiency gains, including allocative
          efficiency.
      e.	 A dedicated effort to understand which interventions prevent wast-
          ing is urgently needed. It is also essential to learn more about
          cost-effective strategies for managing moderate acute malnu-
          trition, and whether or not these can contribute toward the
          prevention of wasting.  
      f.	 More evidence is needed on the costs and impacts of nutrition-­
          sensitive ­interventions—that is, investments to improve nutrition
          through agriculture, social protection, and water and sanitation
          sectors, among others. It is evident that stunting, as well as
          anemia, are multifactorial and can be improved by increasing
          the quality, diversity, and affordability of foods; by expanding
          the control of income by women farmers; and also by reduc-
          ing exposure to fecal pathogens by improved water, sanita-
          tion and hygiene practices. However, the attributable fraction
          of the burden that can be addressed by these interventions
          is unknown. The last five years have seen a proliferation of

236   	                                      An Investment Framework for Nutrition
        studies to increase clarity on these issues, as well as on the use
        of social programs as a platform for reaching the most vulner-
        able. Future work in this area should take into account such
        new evidence as studies are published.
As the world stands at the cusp of the new Sustainable Development
Goals, with global poverty rates having declined to less than 10 per-
cent for the first time in history, there is an unprecedented opportunity
to save children’s lives, build future human capital and gray-matter
infrastructure, and provide equal opportunity for all children to drive
faster economic growth. These investments in nutrition are inalienable
and portable and will pay lifelong dividends—not only for the children
directly affected but also for us all in the form of more robust societ-
ies—that will drive future economies. What happens in the first 1,000
days of early childhood will stay with children for their lifetimes.

Although $7 billion per year may seem to be a large investment, it
pales in comparison to the $500 billion per year (nearly $1.5 billion/
day) spent on agriculture subsidies (Potter 2014) and $543 billion per
year (over $1.5 billion/day) spent on fossil fuel subsidies (IEA 2014).

Stunting and other forms of malnutrition can be a life sentence, but
they must not be accepted as the “new normal.” Although political
commitment is growing rapidly for investing in the 1,000-day window
of opportunity, more efforts are needed to move this agenda from a
pet cause to a common cause, and from a political imperative to an
economic imperative.

based on DHS survey data for 1-to-5 month exclusive breastfeeding rates. Maternity
leave cash benefits coverage rates are based on ILO estimated coverage in practice (ILO
2015). See chapter 5 for more information.

Sources: No country-level estimates of the coverage of the treatment of severe acute mal-
nutrition for children currently exist. To develop baseline coverage, this analysis relies
on data from the Coverage Monitoring Network on the percentage of children suffering
from severe wasting at subnational levels (for example, districts) for a number of coun-
tries. This database is based on information collected from organizations implementing
programs in specific subnational geographic locations. For countries where coverage
data were available from only one region, these data are used to represent coverage
at the national level. For countries where data from multiple regions were available,
a­population-weighted average is used as a proxy for the national level. It should be
noted that this approach likely overestimates the current treatment coverage. For coun-
tries without available data, the current coverage of treatment is assumed to be zero.

                                        Sources for iron and folic acid supplementation for non-pregnant women: The unit costs of four different delivery platforms for non-pregnant women each include
                                        the cost of a supplement at $0.12 per woman per year from the OneHealth Tool manual (Futures Institute 2013) plus a 10 percent transportation cost. In
                                        addition, the cost of delivery through school-based programs for the girls age 15–19 enrolled in secondary school (World Bank 2016) includes an additional
                                        program cost of $0.33 for the Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia regions and $0.50 for other regions in the sample (WHO 2011). It was assumed that the
                                        cost of iron and folic acid supplements purchased through private retailers would include an 84 percent markup, similar to the markup found by Bahl et al.
                                        (2013) for multiple micronutrient supplements, totaling $0.24 per woman per year. The distribution of iron and folic acid supplements to a woman through
                                        community health or hospital/clinic consultation is estimated to require two consultations per year of five minutes each. Therefore, human resources for
                                        health costs are estimated by multiplying the time allocation for all annual consultations by salary estimates for community health workers, which range
                                        from $80 to $917 per month (Casey et al. 2011; Dahn et al. 2015; Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program 2011), and nurse salaries, which range from
                                        $3,047 to $40,265 per annum in sample countries (WHO 2005). See chapter 4 for more detail.
                                        Sources for staple food fortification: Unit cost of staple food fortification per person per year were drawn either from the Global Alliance for Improved Nutri-
                                        tion (GAIN) costing model (Ghauri et al. 2016) for wheat and maize fortification or from Alavi et al. (2008) for rice fortification. For countries for which
                                        estimates did not exist, the best possible proxies were used. In an attempt to take into account dietary differences across populations, the available data
                                        from GAIN costing model or Food Fortification Initiative (FFI) suggested that there is, respectively, no low or moderate demand for consumption for each
                                        particular type of food staple in each country, so the per capita fortification unit costs are lowered to 0 percent, 25 percent, and 50 percent.
                                        Note: Unit costs for antenatal micronutrient supplementation are detailed in table C.1. All unit costs from the literature were converted into U.S. dollars and
                                        inflated to 2015 values.

Appendix C  Intervention Unit Costs and Data Sources for Unit Costs	         271
Appendix D
Current Government Investments
in Nutrition




Table D.1 presents estimates of government investments on nutri-
tion specific programs by source, indicating where expenditure data
versus budget data were available. These data were compiled through
a systematic review of all available data on government nutrition
financing, as described in chapter 8.

While access to data on government financing for nutrition is lim-
ited, efforts to track government investments in nutrition have been
growing as a result of promotion by the SUN Movement and other
platforms advocating for countries to build an investment case for
nutrition. Data availability has come a long way forward over the last
few years. However, many limitations in the quantity and quality of
government nutrition financing data still exist. With the paucity of
domestic expenditure data in the public domain, it is impossible to get
a precise estimate of what is actually spent on nutrition programming.
Even when data on nutrition budget allocations and expenditures do
exist, the granularity of this information at the program and project
level is commonly not accessible. More research is needed in this area,
along with capacity building to ensure financial tracking systems are
established within countries and used to monitor progress toward
national nutrition plans.

All data on donor funding for nutrition were extracted from the Credi-
tor Reporting System (CRS) of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD).

Table E.1 provides a summary of all the purpose codes included in
this analysis. As discussed in chapter 8, the basic nutrition purpose
code does not capture all official development assistance (ODA) for
nutrition, so multiple purpose codes within health and emergency
relief—identified by stakeholders as most likely purpose codes to
contain nutrition programs—were explored. The following section
describes in more detail the methods used for exploring the other
purpose codes.

Capturing nutrition investments within the CRS purpose code for
basic nutrition. Chapter 8 described the methods used to track
intervention-level disbursements within the basic nutrition purpose
code. Table E.2 presents the results of this analysis by showing the
breakdown of how disbursements for basic nutrition to the 60 highest
burden countries are distributed between interventions.

Capturing nutrition investments within CRS purpose codes for health.
In practice, nutrition interventions are often delivered through mater-
nal and child health programs and other health initiatives, and ODA
for these programs is most often coded under health. To that end, this
study analyzed ODA disbursement data under six health codes: basic
health care, reproductive health, health education, health person-
nel development, infectious disease, and personnel development for

population and reproductive health. These six were chosen through
consultations with nutrition financing experts, donors, and nutrition
advocates, and desk research.

A keyword search for “nutrition” was conducted within project titles
and short/long descriptions of the additional health codes (Table E.1).1
For purpose codes for basic health care, reproductive health, health
education, and health personnel development, projects containing
the word nutrition represented 1 to 6 percent of total disbursements
to that code. No mention of nutrition was found within the code for
personnel development for population and reproductive health.

A rapid assessment of project descriptions indicated that the major-
ity of these disbursements were linked to the following interventions:
infant and young child nutrition counseling, treatment of severe acute
malnutrition for children, antenatal micronutrient supplementation,
vitamin A supplementation for children, and prophylactic zinc supple-
mentation for children. In order to disaggregate the estimated nutri-
tion disbursement by the interventions included in the health code,
the same relative-cost weighting method that was used for the basic
nutrition code analysis, as described in chapter 8, was employed.

Capturing nutrition investments within CRS purpose codes for emer-
gency relief and food aid. A similar methodology was used for the
additional health codes on emergency and food aid codes. Keyword
searches for “nutrition,” “community based management of acute
malnutrition,” “severe acute malnutrition,” “ready to use therapeu-
tic foods,” and all acronyms used to describe these terms were con-
ducted across project descriptions. The following purpose codes were
included: general budget support-related aid, food aid/food security
programs, import support, material relief assistance and services,
emergency food aid, relief coordination, reconstruction relief and
rehabilitation, and disaster prevention and preparedness. No mention
of the keywords was found in general budget support-related aid or
import support (capital goods and commodities), so these codes were
removed from the rest of the analysis.

Table E.1 shows that from less than 1 percent to a maximum of
5 percent of disbursements to these purpose codes were captured
within the keyword search. Rapid assessment of project descriptions

of severe acute malnutrition for children.

Searching for food fortification. The agriculture sector code (311)
was analyzed to search for funding for food fortification efforts. No
additional financing for staple food fortification was found within this
code.
