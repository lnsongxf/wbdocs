This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the b ottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      The geotechnical survey is necessary for establishing the cost of

      Request and obtain building permit

      The application for a building permit will be filed at the City
      Council with jurisdiction for the construction area (Bamako
      District for this case). An agent receives the documents and
      verifies that they are complete. The agent will subsequently issue
      a receipt indicating the day the permit will be ready and the fees
      that should be paid for the certificate (frais d'instruction). This
      same agent has 3 days to forward the application documents to
      the Ministry of Urbanisme.

      Upon receipt of the documents, the Ministry also has 3 days to
      forward the documents to the other agencies involved. One
      week later, the agencies will meet to discuss their comments on
      the documents. The Ministry will then take 3 additional days to

      decision. If for any reason all the documents needed are not in
      the file, the agent would not accept the file and would request
      that BuildCo complete the file and re-submit it.

      If there is no response within this deadline, BuildCo may file a
      complaint and the City Hall has 8 days to respond. If there is no
      response within this time period, the silence-is-consent rule
      applies.

      The charges related to public buildings, industrial buildings,
      commercial and offices are FCFA 50,000 (processing fee) + FCFA
      5,000 for the Geographical Institute of Mali + FCFA 5,000 for the

      Department - I

      Officials from the Regional Urban Planning Department are
      always on patrol to check projects without building permits. The
      possibility of receiving an inspection is noted in the authorization
      letter of the building permit, but these are conducted randomly.
      There are foundation, elevation and cover inspections. Therefore,
      a construction like the one in the case study would receive at
      least one such inspection whereby officials of the Regional Urban
      Planning Department would check whether or not BuildCo has a
6     building permit.                                                         1 day        no charge

      Given the silence-is-consent rule, some companies begin
      construction without the building permit. In such cases, these
      companies provide the inspectors with a receipt obtained from
      the Urban Planning Department at the moment of application.
      There are three inspector brigades available at Bamako.

      Purchase material for external works

      The distribution department of EDM relies on the supply department for
      transformers. When there is a stock supply issue, EDM helps its clients
      find a transformer in the private sector and deduct it from the bill.

      Importing a transformer takes on average 3 months. Transformers can be
      imported from Europe (often from France) within 13 weeks. Recently,
      new trends have appeared: transformers might be obtained from Ivory    45 calendar days           XOF 0

      The client can either wait for the utility to buy the transformer or buy it
      themselves directly to gain time.

      Obtain external works and meter installation from EDM

      The client can choose to hire either EDM or a private firm for the external
      works. In the latter case, the private firm would need the
      authorization/certification of EDM in order want to install the material.
      In practice, it is assumed EDM will carry out the works because it is less
      expensive and as such, is often the client’s choice. EDM subcontracts
      when it is not able to face the demands of its customers.

      In this case, an expansion (installation of a transformer) of the network is
      necessary.

      • The quotation for the cable and the material:
4     If a company resorts to EDM and uses an overhead cable (not an            45 calendar days   XOF 12,630,681.17
      underground cable), EDM will deduct XOF 2,300,000 from the total
      amount of the works. This explains mainly why EDM is cheaper.
      If the cable is dealt with by a private company, the beneficiary will not
      have this reduction but will be able to charge other customers the use of
      cable. Yet, after 5 years, this cable becomes the property of EDM.
      • The quotation for the transformer
      EDM proposes 2 types of transformers:
      An overhead transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,407,000
      A pad-mounted transformer at 160 kVA costing XOF 4,538, 280
      Private companies tend to charge more for their transformers (higher
      margin).

        service is overhead and another is underground (in any case, that side of
        the river is already saturated and cannot accommodate new customers).
        On the right shore, about 90% of installations are overhead, so it is
        assumed the service to connect to will be overhead.
        In this case, the total cost would be about XOF 13 – 13.5M. EDM would
        deduce XOF 2.3M from this, and then the client will need to pay an
        additional 10% of the final cost to EDM.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

The indicators reported here are based on a set of

what the indicators cover). The procedures, along
with the associated time and cost, are summarized

       title

       The buyer should perform due diligence before entering into a sale
       agreement with the owner of the property. Due diligence can simply be
       done by requesting from the buyer the number of the property lot. With
       the given number, the buyer can personally go to the Land Registry and
       ask the register clerk to provide him with a certificate called “Réquisition
       Foncière”. This is done very promptly by searching the property lot
       number and making a copy of it. The information included in the                 2 days             3,500 FCFA

       certificate relates to property’s area, its exact location, the name of its
       actual owner (and all previous ones). It also includes all information
       relating to potential mortgages or liens encumbering it. The certificate
       engages the state’s responsibility and is more important than the deed
       of ownership presented by the seller. The deed can be outdated and not
       reflect the actual situation or it might be a fake.

       Obtain an assessment of the true value of the property

       It is common practice that the potential buyer hires a price expert to
       assess the true value of the property before the sale agreement. These
       are commonly called “courtiers informels de l’immobilier”. After
       investigating the place and the building these private experts provide a                      0.5 % of property

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                            with its creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court
                            will convert the proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of
                           the proposal (article 33 of the Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that
                                is later converted into liquidation is the most likely proceeding in Mali.

                                     According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
