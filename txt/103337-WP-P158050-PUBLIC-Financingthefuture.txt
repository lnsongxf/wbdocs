                            Building an open, modern and

FINANCING THE FUTURE
Building an open, modern and
 Myanmar’s          system system
                financial
 inclusive ﬁnancial         is undergoing a rapid transformation. A history of economic isolation has left Myanmar
with small and underdeveloped financial institutions and very low access to financial services. Since 2011, however,
demands on the financial system have grown exponentially with increased trade and investment, growing house-
hold income, and expanding government operations. While recent reforms have stimulated financial sector growth,
much more needs to be done to establish a competitive and vibrant financial sector that can meet the needs of
Myanmar’s expanding economy, boost incomes, and reduce poverty particularly among those living in rural areas.
Increasing access to financial services is critical to achieving shared prosperity in Myanmar.




  Context and opportunities for change

The financial system in Myanmar has significant
potential to grow and become a much larger part of
the economy. The ratio of private sector credit to GDP
for Myanmar in 2013 was very low at only 9 percent
in 2013 (figure 1). The formal financial system consists
of 23 small-scale banks and four state-owned banks.
There are 48 foreign bank representative offices, and
nine foreign bank branches were issued limited licenses
in 2015. State-banks dominate with 50 percent of
banking sector assets and accounting for the majority
of bank branches. There is one state-owned insurance
company in Myanmar and 12 private insurance com-
panies were licensed in 2013. In addition, despite 251
new licenses issued to micro-finance institutions (MFI)
since 2013, the industry remains small and fragile.

 Regional experiences and lessons



 Thailand
The recovery of Thailand’s financial system from
the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis offers lessons that
may be relevant for Myanmar in how to address
large scale financial sector challenges. The Thai
financial system incurred massive costs in terms of a
drop in asset quality (43 percent Non-Performing Loan
ratio) and profitability, which prompted a comprehen-
sive, emergency restructuring plan. Whilst Myanmar’s
financial system is not in a crisis, elements of the
restructuring in terms of special audits of weak banks,
followed by recapitalization, debt restructuring and cor-
porate governance reforms provide useful experience
for restructuring Myanmar’s SOBs.

After containing the immediate crisis, the Thai
authorities aggressively pursued financial regulation
and supervision reforms. Key elements of the reforms
centered on risk-based supervision under Basel II
(an accord on banking regulations), consolidated
supervision and the phased implementation of IAS
39 (a more rigorous method of measuring financial
transactions). These reform efforts were coordinated
under the broad agenda of the Financial Sector Master
Plan Phase I (2004–08) which aimed to improve the
financial system’s efficiency, broaden access to finance,
and improve consumer protection. Underpinning
this Plan was a strong dialogue between the Bank of
Thailand and industry associations.

By mid-2007, when the global financial crisis erupted,
many weaknesses in Thailand’s regulatory and
supervisory framework had been reduced. Consolidation
in the financial system brought the number of deposit-
taking institutions down to 45 from 124 before the
1997/98 crisis, while the process of deleveraging in the
private sector was more or less complete, with the debt-
to-equity ratio declining from 1.2 in 1998 to 0.7. The
domestic capital market also grew rapidly in response
to the funding needs of Thailand’s government and
firms, further strengthening the system’s resilience.
Importantly, these improvements resulted in much
stronger balance sheets for firms and banks.
