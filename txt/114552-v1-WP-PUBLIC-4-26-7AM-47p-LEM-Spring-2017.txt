vers un développement prospère et inclusif
(Centre d’intérêt spécial). A cette fin, les réformes
sont proposées suivant un ordre de priorités qui sera
exécuté en deux temps — à court et à moyen termes.
Le premier ensemble des réformes en question
vise à mettre en place un bilan des réalisations et
à rétablir la crédibilité du gouvernement qui est
actuellement particulièrement absent; sans un tel
bilan clair, l’efficacité de l’élaboration de politiques
sera limitée. Les réformes détermineront également
la plateforme à moyen terme qui est plus systémique.

                                                     Box 1. Oil and Gas Decrees.

  In January 2017, the Cabinet of Ministers (CoM) passed two long-awaited oil decrees paving the way for the first
  licensing round of offshore gas exploration in Lebanon’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The first decree divides
  the EEZ into 10 blocks, only some of which would be open for bidding during the first licensing round. It also
  establishes a buffer zone spanning the coastline with a width of 3 nautical miles, within which no petroleum
  activities would be allowed. The second decree includes (i) the tender protocol; (ii) the exploration and production
  agreement; and (iii) annexes that detail the accounting and financial procedures and the joint operating agreement.
  According to the exploration and production agreement, royalties paid to the State on gas production is set at 4
  percent, while royalties on oil production are progressive ranging from 5 percent to 12 percent. Once royalties are
  paid out, Right Holders are able to recover capital expenditure (CAPEX) costs, Cost Petroleum, which is a biddable
  component starting from a set ceiling of 65 percent of Disposable Petroleum.*
  The remainder, Profit Petroleum, is then divided between the State and Right Holders according to the R-factor,
  defined as:
                                                                          **

  such that the State’s share of Profit Petroleum, denoted by SP hereafter, is determined as follows:
  •	 For R≤1; SP=A percent, where A is a biddable component with the condition that A≥30 percent. That is, A is
      the minimum profit share for the State, which would be during the pre-breakeven point for the Right Holder.
  As cumulative cash inflow increases with time, R rises, leading to an increasing SP , such that:
  •	 For
  •	 For R≥RB ; SP=B percent

  where B and RB are biddable items that determine the maximum share of Profit Petroleum that the State would earn
  beyond RB under the condition that RB≥1 . To summarize A,B, and RB are to be determined via a bidding process,
  such that A≥30 percent, B>A percent and RB≥1, thus constituting the commercial proposal of the competitive
  process. The Right Holders’ portion will be RHP=100—SP, for every value of R.

  Finally, petroleum activities will be subject to Tax Payments, including corporate and individual tax, tax on
  dividends, import tariffs etc. This would be specified by a new tax law currently under discussion by an inter-
  ministerial committee that has been formed to discuss a draft taxation law governing the oil and gas sector. Once
  the tax law passes cabinet, it would then need parliament ratification.
  As such, Total State Income (TSI) from oil and gas activities will be:
                                         TSI = Royalties + SP + Tax Payments

  The commercial proposal, as summarized above, is given a 70 percent weight in the grading process, while the
  remaining 30 percent would be assigned to the technical proposal. In the technical proposal, the consortium bids
  for the minimum work commitment pertaining to the (i) geophysical survey given by the 3D seismic data carried
  out and processed, in square kilometers; (ii) other geological and geophysical activities given by line kilometers
  for airborne, gravity, aero-magnetics, and other means, and square kilometers for advanced technologies, such as
  electro-magnetics; (iii) the number and minimum depth of exploration wells.

* “Disposable Petroleum” means the balance of petroleum extracted which is not reinjected and thus remaining and set aside
to determine the Right Holders entitlements to Cost Petroleum and Profit Petroleum after deduction of (i) petroleum allocated to
satisfying the Right Holders obligations to pay the royalty or deliver it in kind to the State; and (ii) that portion of petroleum that has
been consumed, burned or in any way released or lost between the point of extraction and the point where aforesaid portion of Cost
Petroleum or Profit Petroleum may be taken.
** Cumulative cash inflow is cumulative profit plus cumulative Cost Petroleum since the beginning of the production phase minus
operating expenses. Cumulative CAPEX is all capital expenditures recorded.

29.	    Commercial banks’ already high exposure
to sovereign credit risk, as they have long been
large investors in public debt24, has been further
intensified, especially that denominated in FX.
Hence, while Lebanese banks’ sovereign debt
exposure (FX plus LBP)25 increased by only 2.2
pp (yoy) to 60.7 percent by January 2017, that
denominated in FX rose by a much more substantial
15.5 pp over the same period, to reach 45.6 percent.
The mild (substantial) increase in the former (latter)
is due to the nature of the swap operation, where
the face value of aggregate debt is minimally
impacted, while that of the currency compositions
are strongly affected. However, this renders banks
highly exposed to FX sovereign debt.




24  Interest income, as obtained from BilanBanques, amounted
to 66.15 percent and 66.31 percent of total consolidated banks’
income in 2013 and 2014, respectively.

commercial banks’ aggregate investment in Treasury Bills and
Bonds, Eurobonds and deposits at BdL relative to total assets.

potential to alter the country in fundamental
ways in the short to medium term. These include:
security spillovers and economic challenges of
the war in Syria; prolonged domestic political
impasses and institutional paralysis; hosting the
largest per capita refugee population in the world,
most of whom made an influx over a period of
only 2-3 years. The sense of urgency is reinforced
by a palpable deterioration in the quality of
public services, institutions, governance and the
business climate. Moreover, a frail macro-fiscal
framework, underpinned by unsustainable debt
ratios and persistent and sizable fiscal and current
account deficits, exposes the country to significant
refinancing risks. As a result of these compounding
risks, Lebanon can ill afford not to proceed with
deep and expansive structural reforms (see Special
Focus).

H. The Refugee Crisis:
Creating Opportunities
92.	    The Syrian conflict and the ensuing
influx of an unprecedented number of displaced
persons into Lebanon since 2011 has created
tremendous pressure on the Lebanese economy,
social sectors and infrastructure. In its sixth
year, and with little short term prospects of an
end to the conflict in Syria, the strain on Lebanon
is clear. The international community’s response
has been significant but is not sufficient to match
either the needs of the refugees nor those of the
hosting communities. Going forward, the following
suggestions are provided:

•	 The Government to continue to implement plans
   to provide access to schools, primary health
   care centers and hospitals, social development
   centers and other public services to refugees,
   while seeking and insisting on more international
   financing assistance to finance this increased
   demand.

than their Jordanian counterparts), other Lebanese
exporters have started to export to Syria to fill the gap
in Syrian production. Further econometric analysis
suggests that Syrian refugees in Lebanon provide
important impetus to Lebanese services exports.

Challenges in the Lebanese energy sector (Special
Focus 2): The Lebanese electricity sector has
been underperforming and in crisis for several
decades, requiring urgent action to avoid further
deterioration of the quality of electricity delivery. The
macroeconomic impact has been massive; accruing
debt on investments in and transfers to Electricité
du Liban’s (EdL) amounts to 40 percent of Lebanon’s
gross public debt and is escalating rapidly as transfers
now account for over half of the fiscal deficit.
Some of the measures needed to improve EdL’s
financial situation are well known, such as increased
investment, tariff reforms and corporatization of
EdL. Political and confessional obstacles, however,
have so far hindered any progress.

Water in Lebanon – Coupling Infrastructure with
Institutional Reform (Special Focus 3): Despite the
relative availability of water resources, the Lebanese
water sector has not achieved suitable levels of
service provision and is not in line with the level of
economic development reached by the country. The
cost of inaction in the water sector is estimated at
about 1.8 percent of GDP, or 2.8 percent of GDP if
the cost of environmental degradation is included.
Several factors have led to this situation and require
sustained attention. These include: (i) low continuity
of water supply due to small storage capacity, large
amount of water lost to the sea, growing demand for
water and deficiency of the existing water networks;
(ii) unfinished reform agenda that contributed
to institutional uncertainty and fragmentation
of functions particularly relating to wastewater
and irrigation; (iii) an irrigation sector that is
characterized by inadequate water storage capacity,
lack of proper maintenance and a heavy reliance on
subsidies; and (iv) regional water establishments
(RWE) that severely lack management and financial
autonomy and are impeded by limited inter-
