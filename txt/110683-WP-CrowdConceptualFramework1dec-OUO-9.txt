Overview

Over recent decades, millions of people gained access to improved water sources. However,
these gains are being undermined by increasing contamination of water sources from intensive
agricultural practices, unregulated industrial discharges and inadequate sanitary infrastructure
in both urban and rural areas. The contamination of drinking water, whether by microbes or
chemicals, persistently remains one of the world’s predominant human health hazards. Poor
health is a drain on household finances that could be used for food, transport, education, business
or savings. The consumption of contaminated water threatens the physical and neurological
development of children, compromising the development potential of future generations.

As governments begin to tackle water quality issues, water quality monitoring is a logical starting
point. After all, you can only effectively manage that which you measure and understand. However,
traditional water quality monitoring infrastructure is expensive, requiring laboratories, sophisticated
testing technologies, specialists to conduct tests and comply with sampling and testing protocols,
and information systems to control and manage data flows and reporting. Recent technological
developments in sensors and telemetry are revolutionizing the monitoring landscape, enabling the
collection of high frequency data from remote locations with high accuracy.

At the same time, the ubiquity of mobile phones and the internet enables citizens to participate
actively in social causes. Information and communication technologies are providing citizens and
communities with greater access to data and a means of communication that allow for more
informed decision making. By harnessing the power of technology, the ability of citizens to assist
in the collection of information and to expand our understanding of water quality issues has the
potential to increase our ability to provide these citizens with knowledge of the water they are
consuming in order to make more informed decisions. Developing a conceptual framework for
achieving this goal is the first step in the process of realizing this future. This report documents
the theoretical background that is being used to pilot the concept of crowdsourcing water quality
data. It explores the theory of change, citizen science and crowdsourcing, and provides a short
overview of water quality indicator selection as well as an outline for conducting a crowdsourced
water quality study.

Introduction
Using mobile phone technologies coupled with water quality testing, there is great opportunity to
increase the awareness of water quality throughout rural and urban communities in developing
countries. Whether the focus is on empowering citizens with information about the quality of water
they use in daily life or providing scientific data to water managers to help them deliver safe water
to the citizens, the integration of citizen science, crowdsourcing, and innovative technologies has
the potential to create positive and lasting change.

The methodology proposed herein combines empowerment of the public through participation
in the scientific process (citizen science) with modern technologies to collect, gather, and
disseminate data (crowdsourcing). Citizen science, defined as “the practice of public participation
and collaboration in scientific research to increase scientific knowledge” (National Geographic
Society, 2016), has proven to be effective in: i) enabling large data sets to be collected at costs
not feasible with conventional sampling programs; ii) informing citizens of the local and regional
conditions; and iii) providing a common platform from which citizens, resource managers, and
scientists can discuss issues and develop management alternatives (Rotman et al. 2012, Buytaert
et al. 2014).

When citizen science is coupled with crowdsourcing, “the practice of obtaining information or
input into a task or project by enlisting the services of a large number of people, either paid or
unpaid, typically via the Internet” (Oxford Dictionary 2015), the quantity of data and speed of
reporting increases while the cost of data collection decreases. By employing a crowdsourcing
approach with innovative technologies, there is potential to harness large amounts of data in
areas previously considered either too remote or costly to access.

The purpose of this conceptual framework is to outline the considerations and activities
to be undertaken for a successful water quality monitoring project using citizen science and
crowdsourcing. Specifically included in the framework are: 1) the research question to be
answered through the project; 2) the theory of change that will lead to desired outcomes; 3)
project design considerations to promote a successful pilot; and 4) the methodology outlining
implementation steps. Though this conceptual framework is being developed to support a pilot
project in India, the theories, considerations, and methods presented herein can be applied to
other citizen science/crowdsourcing projects globally.


Research Question
How can crowdsourcing water quality monitoring tools be used to increase community participation
and understanding of water quality?

This fundamental research question spurs a series of subsequent questions that must be addressed
for a successful project:

•	 What are the design principles that encourage participation and support quality science?
•	 What are the focus areas to test the crowdsourcing approach and tools?
•	 What level of participation will citizens be involved in with regard to data collection, analysis,
   and feedback?
•	 What are the most effective processes for collection, analysis, and feedback?
•	 Which stakeholders play what roles in water quality monitoring?
•	 How can the citizen science approach and crowdsourcing tools be transferred to other
   crowdsourced water quality projects?

                                                                                                        9

     Theory of Change
     Given the complex nature of integrating citizen science and crowdsourcing to better understand
     water quality, the Theory of Change serves as the structure and identifies considerations necessary
     for project activities to effect the desired outcomes. Employing the Theory of Change starts with
     the end in mind and works backwards. It begins with identifying the outcomes to be achieved;
     moves through understanding the social, political, and environmental context of the study area;
     and finishes with identifying the inputs that can be used to influence the context to achieve the
     desired outcomes (Figure 1). Note, it is very important to characterize each contextual element
     thoroughly before embarking on the project as failure to properly understand them can lead to
     limited success or failure of the project.

     Desired Outcomes
     While developing a project, identifying the desired benefits and outcomes of each group has
     proven to be important when implementing citizen science methodologies. The desired outcomes
     from this crowdsourcing water quality project are expected to benefit citizens and communities,
     resource management agencies, and policymakers and scientists. Citizens are expected to receive
     real-time water quality status on the source of water they are about to use, feedback on the local
     and regional water quality conditions, and, potentially, actions from water quality incidents from
     management agencies. Water management agencies are expected to benefit from real-time water
     quality status reports from a much denser network of sampling locations, less costly water quality
     screening as the citizens are supplying labor, ability to identify and respond to water quality
     incidents in a more timely manner, and a common platform from which to educate and work with
     communities on water management. Finally, depending on the ancillary data collected, scientists
     and policymakers can benefit from a data set that provides not only water quality conditions
     throughout the study area but the type of water use, locations of water sources accessed, timing
     of use, seasonality patterns of water use, and so on. These data can also be mapped to other
     data sets such as disease, use of fertilizers and pesticides, and investments in water distribution
     systems to provide a more holistic understanding of how anthropogenic activities are influencing
     local water quality and community well-being.

     Pilot: Social, Political, and Environment Contexts
     To achieve the desired outcomes, social, political, and environment contexts must be well
     understood in order to effectively apply citizen science methodologies and crowdsourcing
     technologies. Failure to understand and accommodate any of these three contexts will likely lead
     to limited success. For example, when considering the political context for a specific site, if there
     is no belief in transparency on the part of governmental leadership, the ability of the pilot to effect
     change through citizen-involved science may not be possible. The following section outlines these
     contexts in greater detail.

     Social Context: When operating in a pilot site, it is critical to understand the nuances of the
     local community to ensure the pilot design is aligned with the needs of the community. Table
     1 lists the social elements included in the Theory of Change. Further analysis will need to be
     completed regarding the site specific content of each element, why it is important to understand
     this information, and potential ways to access the information.

     Political Context: In developing and executing this pilot program, there is great dependency
     and need for support from Water Management Agencies (WMA) and community leaders on
     multiple levels. Due to the nature of the information being gathered, analyzed, and reported
     in crowdsourcing water quality projects, it is necessary to have clarity regarding the purpose,
     processes, roles, and desired outcomes of the project. Without complete buy-in into the operation
     of the project, the ability to be transparent and open with information may not be possible. Given
     that the design of the project is intended to provide citizen empowerment around water quality, if
     buy-in into transparency and openness is not achieved, the ultimate success of the pilot will be at
     risk. Table 2 outlines considerations within the political context.

     Inputs
     To achieve the desired outcomes of the pilot, there are a variety of inputs that help to positively
     position the work for success. The involvement of agencies and partners early in the process
     assists with both effective design and buy-in of the pilot. Ensuring proper resource availability and
     allocation are necessary for successful project execution. Innovation technology solutions provide
     a means for faster, more cost effective, and higher quality results. Staffing the project with experts
     in water quality, technology, and community engagement at both the global and local levels
     brings the power of experience to bear on the pilot. Given the iterative nature of this process,
     maintaining focus on the desired outcomes while remaining flexible in the approach will increase
     the likelihood of success.

Citizen Science
For a project to be successful in empowering citizens with respect to water quality, it is necessary
to determine a level of engagement that will contribute to likely success. The level of involvement
must be sustainable over the long term and scalable to other geographies after completion of the
pilot. Bonney et al. (2009) outline three tiers of participation that are typical of scientific research
involving the public: contributory, collaborative, and co-created, as defined below.

•	 Contributory projects: these are the most common form of participation. These projects are
   usually designed by scientists and citizens participate mostly through data collection;
•	 Collaborative projects: these are also mostly designed by scientists and citizens contribute
   through data collection, but the public might also assist with project design, data analysis,
   and/or communication of study findings; and

•	 Co-created projects: the design of these projects is shared by scientists and community
   members with some of the public involved in the scientific process.

For purposes of the pilot, it is recommended that community engagement be modeled around the
collaborative approach. For citizens to be truly empowered and have the potential for positive
change, it is important for them to be active participants in contributing data and in understanding
the results of that information. At a minimum, the public should be involved in both data collection
and communication of results. Building in a sense of ownership of the process is critical for on-
going engagement on the part of the community. In terms of data analysis, it is likely that the
technologies being tested during the pilot will have analysis built in. Therefore, it is not likely that
specific data analysis will be necessary on the part of the citizen; however, trend data or other
larger scale analysis may be relevant.

More specifically, citizens could assist with refining the design of the pilot and determining protocols
for data collection. Once the data have been collected and analyzed, discussion of the results
with local government agencies could lead to water quality improvements. These improvements
might come from greater awareness on the part of the community to activities that are causing
disturbances in water quality. A campaign to educate other members of the community on
water management practices could be a positive and very visible way to show how a change in
behavior can result in improved water quality. Using a collaborative approach is likely to be an
effective approach if the desired result is community empowerment toward improved water quality.
While the benefits of collaboration with citizens are evident, for truly successful collaboration to
occur, it is critical to understand the motivators that will encourage and keep citizens engaged.
Dana Rotman states:

“Existing projects have demonstrated the value of using volunteers to collect data, but few projects
have reached the full collaborative potential of scientists and volunteers. Understanding the
shared and unique motivations of these two groups can help designers establish the technical and
social infrastructures needed to promote effective partnerships .… Identifying the pivotal points
of motivational shift and addressing them in the design of citizen-science systems will facilitate
improved collaboration between scientists and volunteers.”

The use of the collaborative approach for the pilot study is a viable option, especially when
attention is given to clarity and support for motivating factors.

     Participation
     Within the collaborative approach, motivators are key in terms of generating initial interest in
     being involved, but also in the decision to continue to participate. As stated in Building and
     Sustaining Critical Mass Engagement in Crowdsourcing, Idea Wonks (2015), it is possible to
     predict participation levels along a spectrum: latitude of rejection, latitude of non-commitment,
     and latitude of acceptance. To be successful, it is imperative to understand the motivators that
     move people to the latitude of acceptance and keep them there throughout the engagement.

     Citizen Motivators: Initial Participation
     Rotman et al. (2009) investigated the motivating and demotivating factors for initial and continual
     participation in citizen science projects. They found that citizens initially decide to participate
     typically based on four elements, with the first element clearly being the leading motivator (Figure
     2):

          1.	 Understanding of or curiosity about a specific factor of the project that
              stems from personal interest or potential personal gai

          2.	 Prior work on scientific projects

          3.	 A hobby related to the project

          4.	 View of the work as a potential building block toward a scientific career

Citizen Motivators: On-going Participation
For citizens to continue to participate after the initial work of the project is complete, there are
different factors in play:

•	 Need to be recognized and their work attributed to them;
•	 Desire for feedback and to know that the work they did was making an impact and what that
     impact included;
•	 The sense of community involvement and that their participation was making a difference for
     members of their community; and
•	 The ability to advocate based on the education gained from initial participation.
Given these particular motivators, the need for clear, targeted communication and feedback to
participants throughout the pilot cycle is critical. Setting up these mechanisms prior to launch
will be a key step in setting up the pilot. Without continued oversight and engagement with
the community to ensure they see value in participating, they could become demotivated, non-
committal, and/or reject continued collaboration efforts.

Scientist Motivators
The motivators for scientists to participate have some overlap with citizen motivators when it comes
to personal gain.

1.	 Ability to gather large amounts of data – to be successful, scientists are often dependent on
    the ability to gather relevant data and citizen science projects are typically designed with this
    in mind.
2.	 Leading the scientific process – for the majority of projects, scientists preferred to limit the
    scope of citizen involvement to field data collection. With the design of the pilot to include
    a broader role for citizen participation, attention must be paid to understanding specific
    motivations and how best to influence the expansion of the citizen role.
3.	 Contributing to the greater good through education and policy – this motivator included
    both an introduction to the specific scientific focus areas, as well as the scientific process as
    a whole.

Demotivators
1.	 Mutual apprehension and a sense of distrust – for volunteers, the idea of working with scientists
    can be intimidating. Scientists can have concerns about the quality of work and willingness
    to maintain commitment to the project. They want to ensure the volunteers are well matched
    both in terms of capability and capacity prior to beginning their work together.
2.	 Scientists not understanding the key motivations of the volunteers – this results in false
    assumptions on the part of the scientists in terms of the initial motivator to participate and the
    need for strong communication and recognition of the participants.


Crowdsourcing
When undertaking a crowdsourcing project, it is important to consider the technology capabilities
and how people interface with it. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are
benefiting citizens, governments, and organizations by providing access to information, enabling
communities to coalesce around issues of concern, and making communication more immediate
(Hutchings et al. 2012). A subset of the ICT is the use of mobile phones to help collect and
disseminate data, as well as promote communication between stakeholders in order to alleviate
poverty and improve development (Qiang et al. 2011).

     Mobile phone applications (m-Apps) cover a variety of sectors. In reviewing mobile use in eastern
     Africa, Hellström (2010) identified m-Apps that have been developed for agriculture and rural
     development (m-ARD), education (m-learning), finance (m-Transactions, m-Banking), governance
     (m-Governance), and health (m-Health). Qiang et al. 2011 evaluated 92 m-ARD initiatives with
     respect to their potential to increase development. Within agricultural and rural development,
     the m-ARD initiatives ranged widely from agriculture (support, marketing, trade, research,
     innovation), resource management (water, climate), human development (employment, education
     and training, rural youth, rural woman opportunities, micro business development), governance
     (administration), and rural finance, infrastructure, and ICT (transactions, micro-finance, agricultural
     insurance, transport). Finally, Hutchings et al. (2012) evaluated 10 mobile phone crowdsourced
     applications that target water, sanitation, and health (m-WASH). Of these m-Wash applications,
     the researchers identified four main themes: assess poor or non-existent access, post-construction
     failures of systems, service reliability, and long-term sustainability of the resource. Thus, m-Apps
     cover a wide range of development initiatives and plenty of models exist to draw upon for
     developing crowdsourcing projects.


     Important in developing a crowdsourcing project is to identify the key actors interfacing in the
     mobile ecosystems, how they relate to the m-App, what information they require, and their
     capacity with respect to the technology available, financial situation, and education levels. Primary
     categories of key actors include policy makers and regulators, mobile network operators and
     service provides, content providers, m-App developers, NGOs, the private sector, researchers,
     media, and citizens (Hellström 2010, Qiang et al. 2011, Hutchings et al. 2012). The roles and
     uses of m-Apps for key actors are listed in Table 4. All should be considered when developing an
     m-App, though some may have lesser importance. For example, private sector actors were less
     important in m-WASH applications.

As observed in Table 4, the flow of data and communication methods vary based on the purpose
and uses of the m-App developed. This variation is illustrated in the primary means of short
messaging service (SMS) messaging in m-Governance, which include notification, pull SMS, listen,
and transaction (Susanto and Goodwin 2010). Notifications are one-way transmissions such
as government broadcast of weather warnings. Pull SMS enables citizens to request particular
information such as local crop reports. Listen service is an avenue for citizens to send information
to government agencies such as flow observations and service complaints. Finally, transactional
SMS support services include such transactions as paying bills or taxes. The typical informational
flow in m-WASH applications is from the user to a server (Figure 3). Once received, the server then
collects, packages, and disseminates the information to a variety of users via different methods
including mobile phone messages, websites, dashboards, and social media. It is envisioned that
this is the model that will be adopted for crowdsourcing water quality projects in India. Associated
with data flow, consideration of the technology platform, network coverage, and messaging type
are important elements in developing m-Apps (Hellström 2010, Qiang et al. 2011).

The technology developments required include m-Apps for collection and technologies (for
example, websites, emergency messaging) for dissemination. For adoption by citizens, the m-App
purpose must be in line with the project but also perceived as easy to use, useful, reliable, adding
value, trustworthy, and responsive to the users (Susanto and Goodwin 2010). Incorporating the
key actors (especially citizens) early in the development process builds trust and technologies
that are customized for user needs and, thus, is more likely to be adopted (Mechael et al. 2010,
Hellström 2010, IDEO 2011). Similarly, data dissemination needs to be developed in relation to
the end user needs. For some users, new web-portals or dashboards will need to be developed or
adapted from existing technologies. For WMAs, service providers, and stakeholders with existing
business processes that rely on water quality data, linking the m-App data server with the user
system augments the data upon which business decisions can be made and requires little to no
additional training.

Platforms for developing m-Apps vary between developed and developing countries (Qiang et
al. 2011). In developed countries, platform providers (for eample, Apple’s App Store) allow for
posting of m-Apps and provide users with many services and access to substantial digital data.
In developing countries, mobile network operators control the systems and the content provided

                                                                                                          19
      Crowdsourcing Water Quality Data




         Pilot Considerations: Data Flow. The crowdsourcing water quality project will likely
         involve citizens reporting water quality testing results to a regulating agency with the
         agency then analyzing and publishing the data to a variety of end users. For the pilot, the
         platform, network coverage, and method of exchanging data will need to be determined
         during development.


     tends to be hyper-local often not available in digital forms. Thus, developing m-WASH apps in
     developing countries will frequently involve designing and implementing local solutions. This can
     be an impediment to scaling the m-App application to broader areas.

     For long-term sustainability, it is important to have an effective supporting infrastructure, strong
     business model, and performance indicators for assessing the effectiveness of the m-App. For
     the business model and funding, the development horizon for an m-App can be broken into
     three stages: pilot, scalability, and sustainability (Qiang et al. 2011). Funding for each stage is
     different. Commercial applications are primarily driven by profit and thus a sustainable business
     plan will balance pricing structure with material, marketing, and management expenses. That
     said, initial stages may require seed money from donors or government agencies (Hellström
     2010, Qiang et al. 2011). Qiang et al. (2010) found that 85 percent of m-ARD apps received
     donor, government agency and corporate social responsibility funding during the pilot stage.
     When moving from the pilot stage to the scalability stage, access to donor funding diminished
     which should be taken into account.

     Non-commercial m-Apps determine value from the social and/or economic benefits from the
     targeted audience (Qiang et al. 2011). Funding streams for non-commercial m-Apps tend to
     operate as long as donor, government agency, and corporate social responsibility funding exists.
     Therefore, for non-commercial m-Apps it is important to have clear goals for the business model
     in order to show benefit to the funding organization (Hellström 2010). Reliance on funding
     organizations may limit scalability if the funding is insufficient to expand the m-App services.

Performance Indicators
For evaluating project effectiveness, as well as determining areas that need improvement,
performance indicators are crucial. Categories of performance indicators include citizen testing,
technology (testing, m-App, dissemination applications, and server performance), impact on
water management, and financials. Performance metrics include process indicators to track if
the technology and its implementation are performing well and outcome indicators to determine
if the crowdsourcing project is benefiting citizens and WMAs (the outcomes in the Theory of
Change). Often, combinations of qualitative and quantitative indicators provide effective means
of characterizing the processes and outcomes of the project. Annex 2 provides a list of appropriate
performance indicators for crowdsourcing water quality using m-Apps.


Project Design Considerations
When pursuing a crowdsourcing project, it is advised to consider social design, technical design,
and program design from the outset (Hutchings et al. 2012). The following text lists the important
components to consider, potential barriers restricting long-term sustainability of the project, and
actions to take for each design element.

Social Design
For successful adoption, it is crucial to develop m-Apps that are relevant and beneficial to the
key actors. Developing this awareness involves many of the elements of citizen science but also
includes defining socio-cultural context. In defining the socio-cultural context, the crowdsourcing
literature overlaps many of the same design considerations that are outlined in citizen science,
including literacy rates, household incomes, and motivators. In addition, who uses technology in
a community or household may be a factor. For example, within a household, mobiles may be
used by men only, thus an m-App developed for this community may inadvertently omit input from
the women who collect water for consumption and washing.

User perception is a key factor in user adoption or rejection of m-Apps. Susanto and Goodwin
(2010) received 159 responses from surveys, questionnaires, and interviews in 25 countries
concerning people’s perceptions of m-Governance apps. From this effort, the researchers identified
15 perceptions that influence m-App adoption. These perceptions include:

 •	 Ease of use              •	 Efficiency in time and space    •	 Availability of devices and
 •	 Responsiveness           •	 Usefulness                         infrastructure
 •	 Trust in SMS             •	 Relevance, quality, and         •	 Value for money
    technology                  reliability of data             •	 Convenience
 •	 Risk to user privacy     •	 Reliability of mobile network   •	 Trust and quality of public
 •	 Risk to money                                                  services
 •	 Self-efficacy in using                                      •	 Compatibility
    SMS


For increased likelihood of adoption, the m-App needs to be developed with regard to the user
perceptions and thus it is important to determine user needs at the outset of the project. Additional
training, education, and marketing can also be used to increase the likelihood of adoption as they
help to inform and dispel misconceptions (ibid).

Therefore, collaboration between key actors (for example, citizens, agencies, stakeholders, m-App
developers) during the m-App development and implementation is a key factor in m-App adoption


                                                                                                        21

     (Mechael et al. 2010). Methods exist for assisting in the development of technology to suit user
     needs. The Human Centered Design (HCD) toolkit (IDEO 2011) provides a structured method to
     evaluate community needs, create solutions, and design m-Apps. The first step in the HCD method
     is “hearing”, which stresses involvement of the target communities in learning about the issues
     and background, as well as creating and designing solutions. Findings from the “hearing” stage
     guide the design of m-Apps that fits the user needs. Development projects where the HCD toolkit
     methodology was successfully applied include providing children’s eye care in rural India; the
     Ripple Effect project, which aims to improve access to safe drinking water for the world’s poorest
     and most underserved people by stimulating innovation and capacity building; and the Fitted Ear
     Project which developed a systemic solution to providing hearing tests and fitting hearing aids
     (https://www.ideo.com/expertise/social-innovation/).

     Potential barriers to adoption of m-App are trust in the service provider or WMA developing the
     m-App and data privacy. Positive trust in service providers and WMAs manifests in expectations
     that the regulating organization will respond to requests or complaints sent in by the citizens
     (Susanto and Goodwin 2010). Systems that respond to users’ submittal of data are deemed to be
     more trustworthy than the agency receiving the data and having the ownership of responding. It
     is also important that citizens have access to the data being generated. Not providing notification
     of the receipt of submitted data nor access to the data create trust issues around transparency and
     can be a demotivator in participation (Rotman et al. 2009).

     Transparency and access need to be balanced against data privacy. Citizens may not wish for
     personal information collected during reporting sampling to be released. Care must be taken to
     ensure that the service providers and WMAs collecting the data do not distribute this information
     as doing so can be a barrier towards adoption (Susanto and Goodwin 2010, Hutchings et al.
     2012).

     Technical Design
     Technical design is focused on the development of data collection (m-App) and data dissemination,
     as well as for crowdsourcing water quality projects, selection of the sampling methods and
     equipment. Considerations and barriers to address when selecting the data collection methods
     include phone type, messaging method, cost, and network coverage and reliability.

     Mobile Phone and Messaging Options: Mobile phones and messaging options vary from
     simple unstructured to sophisticated smartphone applications (Table 5). In rural communities in


        Pilot Consideration: Social Design. When developing and implementing the proj-
        ect, the following considerations should be addressed.
          •	 Socio-cultural context of communities within the potential project areas needs to be
             understood;
          •	 Roles and data needs of key actors involved in the project need to be identified and
             documented;
          •	 Th project is to be developed and implemented collaboratively with all key actors;
          •	 Citizens’ perceptions of the ease of use, reliability, relevance to their lives,
             trustworthiness, and benefit of the m-App should be determined;
          •	 Potential trust barriers including transparency, data sharing (for example, WMA
             sharing with public) need to be identified;
          •	 Data privacy and protection concerns of key actors should be addressed; and
          •	 End users can be informed and educated on the technology application and
             benefits, as well as the purpose and relevance of the data being collected.

developing nations, basic phones are most prevalent whereas smartphones are increasingly used
in urban communities in developed nations. For m-ARD projects in developing countries, Qiang
et al. (2011) noted that the information provided to the farmers must be highly localized in order
for them to know where to sell or trade crops and livestock. Similar inclinations are likely for
monitoring water quality conditions. Websites, such as ICTWorks.org, provide information on
ICT with respect to sustainable development of applications for use in rural and underserved
communities across the developing world.

     Design criteria for the m-App are ease of use, relevance, convenience, and reliability for the
     user along with achieving the data collection goals of the project. Susanto and Goodwin (2010)
     observe that perceived ease of use, value for money, convenience, and availability of the device
     and infrastructure were the most important in adoption. Hellström (2010) noted that simple, easy
     to use interfaces were an important factor when designing m-Apps, in addition to the m-App
     achieving the primary purposes of the project. Thus, m-App development should be simple and
     pragmatic.

     Citizen users need to be confident that the technology supporting the data collection method is
     accurate and reliable. Conversely, methods should be put in place that ensure the data collected
     are valid and correctly entered. In forms, minimizing manual data entry can help prevent errors
     associated with mistyping and data validation criteria can help catch errors. Otherwise, service
     providers and WMAs may question data accuracy and thus be hesitant to respond, creating a
     potential trust barrier (Frefield et al. 2010, Hutchings et al. 2012).

     Combining HCD with rapid prototyping methods in the design and development of the m-App
     creates greater opportunities for achieving a usable and relevant m-App. In these methods, user
     needs are determined in defining the design challenge and investigation that provide context for
     m-App design. The m-App design is created with the end user’s needs at the forefront and may
     involve key users. Once the m-App has been designed, rapid prototyping and piloting methods
     involving users can be employed to expedite the development and customization of the m-App.
     An effective approach to rapid prototyping and piloting is the Lean Startup Method. This method
     involves providing users a “minimum viable product” that is functional, but has not been built to
     final functionality (Ries 2011). The user tests the “minimum viable product” over a short period of

time, providing feedback to the developer who then uses the feedback to rapidly alter the product.
The new version of the product is then returned to the user for another iteration with the process
continuing until a desirable product has been created. This rapid prototyping method minimizes
the effort to build unnecessary m-App functionality that developers originally conceived as being
necessary but the end user does not require or want.

Costs: Costs of technology include the phone purchase, services charges, and m-App development.
Hellström (2010) indicated the costs of SMS, voice, and data transfer are the biggest barrier to
widespread adoption of m-App in eastern Africa. Users will weigh the cost of using an m-App if
they feel the perceived value it provides is not worth it (Susanto and Goodwin 2011). Thus, careful
consideration of the user benefits and costs is required when selecting the platform and type of
messaging for the m-App.

Networks Coverage and Reliability: Effectively being able to connect to the mobile network
influences the trust and usability of m-Apps. Rural areas that do not have mobile network coverage
are potentially limited in using m-Apps. Networks that are frequently out of service may require
data to be stored on the mobile for sending when the network returns to operation. Furthermore,
during natural disasters (for example, flooding during large precipitation events) or crises, mobile
networks are less reliable than satellite based networks.

Data Dissemination: Following collection, results need to be disseminated to key stakeholders,
which may include citizens, service providers, WMAs, NGOs, and researchers. The content
and format in which end users receive m-App data should vary based on their needs (Table
6). Similar to the m-App development, dissemination should be developed collaboratively with
end users and follow the rapid prototyping methods. For developing m-Apps for government
agencies, service providers and stakeholders involved in water management, business operations
should be reviewed to determine how the m-App data augment their management processes
and in what format it is best consumed. Often, these organizations have existing systems (for
example, dashboards, graphs, reports) that can be used for disseminating the m-App data in a
relevant and familiar format for decision makers, water managers, and operators. In addition,
the technical infrastructure (which includes the data server and ancillary connections to networks,
data exchange protocols, and software and hardware requirements) needs to be considered in
the data dissemination and design.

When developing the disseminating application, privacy should also be taken into account. That
said, it is important for the citizens and communities involved in data collection to have access to
the results. Failure to report m-App data to these groups will create a barrier as the crowdsourcing
project will be perceived as not relevant or useful and untrustworthy, thus the likelihood of long-
term adoption could be put at risk (Susanto and Goodwin 2010).

     Water Quality Indicator (WQI) Sampling Methods: As these projects are using citizen science,
     water quality sampling will be conducted by citizens. Therefore, selection of the technology must
     be simple and accurate enough for citizens with limited training to screen for water quality
     conditions, and not overly complex and expensive that testing is prohibitive. Criteria for WQI
     sampling method selection include:

          1.	 Relevance to water quality issues of the project area.
          2.	 Applicable to the sampled water source: local groundwater wells, distributed systems,
              or surface water bodies.
          3.	 Easy of use: this is an important factor when asking citizens to collect data.
              Additionally, how much training and practice is required to effectively conduct a test?
          4.	 Accurate, reliable, and repeatable: additionally, is the method subject to interpretation?
          5.	 Analytical range extends over the range required for reporting.
          6.	 Cost per test and financial feasibility.
          7.	 Stores well and is easily distributed.


     Program Design
     Program design involves evaluating the political and agency supporting the infrastructure, financial
     model, and metrics for evaluating the project. In addition, where the data server is housed, who
     manages it, and how it is financed will also need to be considered.

     Political and Agency Supporting Infrastructure: Mapping the governmental, water management
     agencies, and research institutions as well as the policies, laws, programs, and operations involved
     in monitoring and managing water resources provides context for the m-App project. Done
     thoroughly and effectively, this activity will identify opportunities and barriers to implementation

of the crowdsourcing project. Special attention should be paid to organizations collecting similar
data as well as the use of water quality data in managing water resources.

Financial Models: An important task is to develop a financial model of the m-App project. This
involves computing the revenues and expenses associated with the project. Funding a project
comes from revenues generated (commercial) and donors, government agencies, and corporate
social responsibility funding (non-commercial). Potential pricing models for commercial m-Apps
include (Qiang et al. 2011):

•	 Non-chargeable model: the user does not pay and receives only basic market information
   provided. Examples are government based weather forecasts;
•	 Transactional model: the provider charges the subscriber for using m-App based on the
   number of transactions conducted;
•	 Embedded model: the m-App is provided for free, but used to generate demand and strengthen
   customer loyalty to the provider’s primary, chargeable product or service;
•	 Freemium: basic services are provided for free with users paying for additional premium
   services; and
•	 Revenues must be balanced against expenses: typical expenses to consider are presented in
   the budget checklist (Table 7).

        Pilot Considerations: Technical Design. When developing and implementing the
        project, the following technical considerations should be addressed:
          •	 Data needs for all key stakeholders are defined;
          •	 m-App is developed and implemented collaboratively with citizens through HCD and
             rapid prototyping methods;
          •	 m-App is developed such that users perceive it to be easy to use, convenient, reliable,
             and relevant in order to increase the likelihood of long-term adoption;
          •	 Trust is ensured by notifying users of test submittal and response to requests. At a
             minimum, users need a return notification that the server has received their data
             message. Ideally, they have access to results, as well;
          •	 Data privacy and protection of key actors has been addressed. This may include
             willingness of WMAs to share data with the public. Failure for the WMA to share
             data is a potential barrier to adoption;
          •	 Similar to the m-App development, data dissemination applications should be
             developed collaboratively with end users and follow the rapid prototyping methods;
          •	 Business processes should be evaluated when developing dissemination methods for
             government agencies, service providers, and stakeholders. Often, existing platforms
             can be used saving time and effort in development and training, as well as expense
             in hardware; and
          •	 WQI sampling methods need to be selected based on the criteria presented above.



     Metrics: Performance metrics are used to evaluate the project and guide modifications. Performance
     metrics relevant to crowdsourced water quality projects are categorized into citizen adoption,
     technology performance (m-App, data dissemination applications, WQI sampling methods),
     financial performance, and development impacts. The performance metrics are collected
     before, during, and after project implementation. Annex 2 lists performance metrics relevant to
     crowdsourced water quality projects.


     Water Quality Indicators
     Properly assessing water quality conditions in relation to identified user needs involves the selection
     and use of water quality indicators. Selection of water quality indicators will depend on the
     water quality conditions, current and potential influences that affect water quality conditions, and
     testing technologies available that support crowdsourcing objectives of real-time water quality
     monitoring. Water quality is influenced by natural factors and anthropogenic (human) influences
     (UNEP and WHO 1996), both of which must be considered when selecting the analytes to
     monitor and the study area for conducting the crowdsourcing project. Natural factors include the
     geological, topographical, meteorological, hydrological and biological systems in the drainage
     basin. In addition, water quality conditions can vary from diurnally to seasonally to annually
     due to differences in runoff volumes, weather conditions and water levels. Primary influences
     of surface and ground water quality in natural settings include leaching of heavy metals (for
     example, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and selenium), major ions (sodium, potassium,
     calcium, chloride, sulfate), fluoride, and radionuclides (for example, uranium and radium) from

Human Activities Influencing Water Quality
Anthropogenic activities that influence water quality include discharges of domestic, industrial,
urban and other wastewaters into the watercourse (point source), and the spreading of chemicals
on agricultural land (diffuse) in the drainage basin (Table 8). Point sources load water quality
constituents at discrete locations (for example, outfalls to major rivers). Typical sources include
sewage treatment, industrial waste effluent, solid waste disposal, animal feedlots and mine-adit
runoff and processing plant effluent. Diffuse (non-point) sources arise from many small inputs over
a wide area. Examples include unsewered fecal pollution, agricultural land runoff, solid waste
facilities runoff, and mine waste pile runoff. Types of constituents associated with anthropogenic
activities include:

    •	   Urban sewage and wastewater runoff: Sewage can run off or leach to
         groundwater introducing petroleum products, bacteria (including pathogens), fecal
         matter, food waste, fertilizers/pesticides from lawns, and household products such as
         cleaning solvents, used motor oil, paints, paint thinners, and detergents.

    •	   Industrial effluent and wastewater runoff: A wide variety of chemical, bacterial,
         and organic matter is used by businesses and industries for production (raw materials
         and processing) and cleaning and sanitation, as well as resulting by-products. Common
         analytes associated with industrial productions include:

             o	 Filling stations and refineries: petroleum, gasoline, motor oils, benzene;
             o	 Manufacturing: heavy metals, ammonia, volatile organic compounds, organic
                solids (biochemical oxygen demand - BOD);
             o	 Dry cleaners: cleaning solvents containing trichloroethaline and
                tetrachloroethaline;
             o	 Tanneries: chromium, sulfides, ammonia, volatile organic compounds, organic
                solids (BOD); and
             o	 Food processing: ammonia, cleaning solvents, bacteria, organic solids (BOD).

    •	   Agriculture: Farmers apply nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and potassium
         in the form of chemical fertilizers, manure, and sludge as insecticides, herbicides, and
         fungicides containing organic compounds and heavy metals to kill pests (US EPA 2005).
         Runoff from precipitation or excessive irrigation can transport pathogens, nutrients, heavy
         metals, pesticides and oxygen-demanding organics and solids. In arid areas, evaporation
         of irrigation water can concentrate salts limiting crop yields, and cause a buildup of
         selenium that can harm waterfowl reproduction.
    •	   Mining: Mineral extraction uses water to extract minerals, process ore, control dust, store
         ore/waste and general operation. Associated with metal mines, water contaminated with
         high concentrations of metals, sulfide minerals, low levels of pH (Acid Rock Drainage -
         ARD), processing chemicals, and suspended and dissolved solids can negatively affect
         surface  and groundwater quality  in the catchment. Mining exposes sulfide minerals
         to oxygen, breaking down the minerals and potentially releasing aluminum, arsenic,
         cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, mercury, magnesium, nickel, lead, selenium and zinc
         (Environment Canada 2009). In addition, oxidation of sulfides produces sulfuric acid
         and when drained, creates ARD, which is low in pH and high in metals. In the process of
         separating gold, ore, mercury and cyanide are commonly used.

     Analyte Selection Consideration
     The list of water quality indicators varies depending on the monitoring purpose and setting. A
     general list of water quality indicators is presented in Table 9. Common water quality field tests
     include alkalinity, ammonia, chlorine, color, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, hardness,
     iron, lead, nitrite, nitrate, odor, pH, phosphorous, and temperature. These provide a general
     overview of the water quality conditions, but lack the ability to quickly evaluate biological indicators
     which must be grown. In addition, field tests for pesticides are not common. For drinking water,
     the Government of India has set the water quality standards for a complete suite of water quality
     indicators at IS10500 (http://hppcb.gov.in/eiasorang/spec.pdf).

  Pilot Considerations: Program Design
    •	 Consider the social, political, and technical infrastructure supporting the project;
    •	 Develop a viable business plan; and
    •	 Metrics are selected to measure citizen adoption of technology, impact to the citizens
       and communities, technology performance, and financial performance of the project.




Crowdsourcing Project Methodology
Using a combination of the fundamental principles of citizen science and crowdsourcing as it
pertains to the use of mobile phones in assessing natural resources, a methodology has been
developed to assess water quality conditions. The development of a crowdsourced water quality
project is conducted in four phases: 1) investigation and scoping;, 2) initiation and customization;
3) implementation; and 4) evaluation and reporting. Primary activities in each phase include:
1.	 Investigation and Scoping: the preliminary investigation to determine the best site, methods to
    use, and feasibility of a crowdsourcing water quality project. Activities in this phase include
    site selection; identifying and chartering team members; stakeholder needs assessments; water
    quality indicators; cost estimates; risk assessment and mitigation planning; and performance
    metric selection. With respect to the Theory of Change, the context information and desired
    outcomes of the participating groups gleaned during this phase provide the foundation for
    moving ahead with the project and are crucial to its long-term success.
2.	 Initiation and Customization: building on the background information in Phase I, Phase II
    involves creating, developing, and implementing technological solutions, as well as water
    quality testing distribution and educational awareness programs. Technological developments
    progress along two fronts: i) m-App development for water quality screening; and ii) developing
    dissemination applications to provide information to citizens, agencies/service providers, and
    interested stakeholders (for example, media, researchers, private sector). Rapid prototyping
    is used to customize technological applications to meet end-user needs, thus increasing the
    likelihood of long-term adoption.
3.	 Implementation: the execution of the crowdsourcing project. During this phase, communities
    and management agencies are educated; testing kits are distributed; water quality is screened
    by citizens and uploaded to the project database; results are disseminated to the community
    and used by water management agencies to manage the resources and communicate with
    stakeholders.
4.	 Evaluation and Reporting: Compiling information and computing metrics, surveying and taking
    testimony of participants, and reporting results to the communities, managing agencies, and
    interested stakeholders. Outputs can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and
    determine areas where improvements are required. If the program is to be continued, this is
    likely a periodic report.
The following text outlines the tasks and associated objectives, activities, limitations, and
outcomes. If not explicitly stated, development and implementation should be done with regard
to the citizen science and crowdsourcing principles outlined above. This methodology assumes
that mobile phones will be the technology to report the water quality analyses. Note, though the
project methodology is being established for application in India, principles can be applied to
crowdsourcing efforts in general.

     Crowdsourcing Water Quality Data




     1. Phase 1: Investigation and Scoping
     As stated, this phase is to provide the background and impetus for conducting the study along with
     laying the foundation for the other phases. The objectives, activities, assumptions, and outcomes
     of tasks associated with Phase 1 are presented in this section.

     Task 1.1. Site Selection
     Objectives: Select the geographic area for the project with consideration of the social and
     environmental factors.

     Activities: Site selection is an important first step in implementing a water quality crowdsourced
     project. Ideally projects are set in a water quality limited area where citizens have limited access
     to water quality results and resource managers have limited resources to monitor water quality
     conditions. When determining specific geographies to target during execution of a project, key
     factors for considerations include:

     Theory of Change Contexts: The baseline information regarding the social context (Table 1), po-
     litical context (Table 2), and environmental context (Table 3) as outlined in the Theory of Change.

        •	 Water Quality Limited Areas:  Selection of areas that include both impacted and
           non-impacted water quality conditions could provide an additional means of testing the
           technologies.  At a minimum, the area should be water quality limited as monitoring in
           non-impacted areas will result in a limited evaluation of how crowdsourcing water quality
           testing could impact daily lives. Additionally, water quality limiting sources should be
           identified such as area of agricultural fields, tanneries, manufacturing plants, power plants,
           mining operations, and so on. Land use/land cover maps identifying irrigated, commercial,


       Pilot Considerations: WQI Selection
       •	 The standard water quality issues identified as influencing rural drinking water include
          microbial contaminants, fluoride, arsenic, iron, nitrate, salinity, heavy metals (cadmium,
          lead, zinc), organic pollutants, and pesticides (Wateraid 2008);
       •	 The Central Groundwater Board and State Groundwater and Public Health and Engineering
          Departments in India monitor water at discrete locations, thus providing the background on
          the extent and magnitude of water quality issues in proposed study areas;
       •	 Monitoring data should be gathered and compared against the citizen screening test
          data to ensure data quality, as well as determine the efficacy of all monitoring systems in
          characterizing water quality conditions;
       •	 Crowdsourcing water quality is intended to educate citizens (in real-time) of the quality of
          the water resources they are using. Thus, the selection of WQI needs, at a minimum, to
          target the WQIs that influence and are meaningful to local citizens. Citizen education of
          water quality conditions and risks can be used to create informed selection; and
       •	 Spatio-temporal frequency of sampling should to be designed to characterize the land and
          water use practices given the local hydrology. As the pilot is meant to investigate the most
          effective sampling frequency, variable sampling schemes should be tested. For example,
          one village should be asked to measure daily while another might be asked to measure
          every time villagers use a water source. Note, it is preferred to “over sample” the monitoring
          effort as data points can be removed from the dataset during evaluation to determine the
          most effective sampling frequency. It is impossible to add data locations if the pilot is under
          sampled.

     municipal/domestic, and industrial land types are good screening tools for identifying
     potential sources of pollutants;

   •	 Managing Agency Readiness:  Much of the data collection, storage, and analysis
      will occur in partnership with managing agencies. In addition, there must be openness
      and transparency with the data if the crowdsourcing approach is to be successful. For
      these reasons, it is crucial that the partner managing agencies have willingness to partner
      in developing and using the data, as well as developing the infrastructure (cultural and
      technology) to support the project.

   •	 Organizing Entities: For distribution, education, and selection of monitoring individuals
      and information distribution, it is important to select an area where supporting organizations
      are active. These organizations might include Water User Associations (WUAs), NGOs,
      community outreach groups, farmer organizations, and so on. 

   •	 Watershed Based:  It would be advantageous if the location included both rural and
      urban settings that influence and use the same water body. It is not required to look at the
      entire catchment, just representative areas of rural and urban settings. It is preferable that the
      site locations are in close proximity to each other because maps showing the influence will
      be more illustrative.

Assumptions/limitations: Actively seek a cross-section of participants based on demographic
factors, for example, gender, economic sectors.

Outcomes: A list of potential project areas and associated background information.

Task 1.2. Local Team Identification and Chartering
Objectives: Develop the Local Team that will sponsor, promote, manage, and participate in the
project, as well as the organization that will manage the infrastructure supporting the project.

Activities: The core Local Team should be made up of community members, managing agency
officials, service provider representatives, NGO representatives, and other water user stakeholders.
The size of the team should be large enough for effective representation of the various stakeholder
groups, but right-sized to ensure timely implementation.

It is critical that the specific roles and responsibilities of each of the stakeholder groups be clearly
delineated at the outset. Typical questions to ask when selecting team members include:

    •	   Who will serve as the project sponsor?

    •	   Who will provide direct project management and oversight?

    •	   How will the team interact (meetings, briefings, updates)?

    •	   How will decisions be made?

    •	   What does it mean to serve as a representative on the team?

Assumptions/limitations: Local Team members have the time, commitment, expertise, and authority
to participate and contribute to the project.

Outcomes: Selection of Local Team members.

     Task 1.3. Stakeholder Needs Assessment
     Objective: Identify the needs of key stakeholders to ensure the project design and implementation
     are aligned to meet those needs and desires.

     Activities: To sustainably engage key stakeholders in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating
     information, it is necessary to understand their motivation in participating in the monitoring program.
     To determine stakeholder needs and motivations, the use of HCD processes and techniques offers
     an effective means for identifying the needs, desires, and behaviors of stakeholders (IDEO 2011).
     Throughout the project, it is critical that the needs of the stakeholders are well understood so that
     the potential innovative solutions brought forth meet those needs. In addition, it is necessary to
     understand the technical and procedural readiness of the community to participate as citizen
     scientists in this crowdsourcing pilot. Lastly, these exercises serve as the beginning of a process
     of engagement that will occur throughout the pilot and provide participants with the chance to
     experience what this kind of engagement entails. Examples of assessment techniques include:
     interviews, immersion, card sort, and photo documentation (IDEO 2015). A description of each
     technique is provided below.

       •	 Interviews: Tables in Annex 1 outline the interviewees and questions for initial site visits.

       •	 Immersion: To fully understand the needs of the community, experiencing how citizens,
          agency personnel, and other water users interact with and use water and technology in
          their daily lives provide a powerful context for clarifying needs. If it is possible to shadow
          individuals as they go about their day and document what is seen and heard, this information
          can be of high value for use throughout the planning and execution of the pilot. It is important
          to simply listen and learn without trying to interpret what is occurring at the time of the
          immersion. Once there is a complete picture of water and technology use and needs, greater
          interpretation and application of the knowledge gained can occur.

       •	 Card Sort: In this exercise, stakeholders are provided with a deck of cards with a word or
          image on each card. They are asked to sort the cards in priority order depending on what
          is most important to them. This can be an effective exercise for those where literacy is a
          challenge. It can also serve to begin a deeper discussion about overall values. In addition,
          because the cards can be tailored to the specific needs of the project, customization of the
          exercise is relatively simple. The result of this activity is clarification on what is important to
          each of the stakeholder groups, which will indicate areas of overlap, as well as divergence.
          This is important knowledge given the interdependencies these stakeholder groups will
          maintain throughout the pilot.

       •	 Photo Documentation: With the prevalence of smartphones in many communities,
          requesting that stakeholders provide photos of how they use water and technology, as well


      Pilot Considerations: Site Selection
      The pilot project is intended to test methodologies and tools, therefore it is advised to focus on
      specific locations that possess a breadth of conditions to provide the greatest opportunity for
      learning. For the proposed project, two additional factors should be considered:
        •	 Rural Area Includes a Command Area:  Ideally, the rural community would be in
           an irrigated area receiving water from a reservoir as these often have salinity and fertilizer
           impacts to surface and ground water; and 
        •	 Urban Diversity: It would be beneficial to have residential neighborhoods of different
           economic means as well as local industrial activities. Covering an entire city is not required,
           but including one or two wards of varying socioeconomic conditions is important.

    as what is important to them in that use is another means of gaining an understanding of
    desires and needs. Asking them to describe the photos from their perspective augments that
    understanding. This photo documentation can also serve as a physical example of community
    engagement if the photos are posted for community members to see. These visible symbols
    of the work of the project and the engagement of the community in participating in this work
    are critical to ensure initial participation and continued engagement throughout the pilot and
    beyond.

Assumptions/limitations: Stakeholders are willing and available to participate in the needs
assessment and resources are available to conduct the assessment.

Outcomes: The numerous outcomes from this task that are crucial to the project success include:

    1.	 Identification of the participants and communities that will be engaging in the citizen
        science project.

    2.	 An understanding of:
        •	   Community water uses, as well as the water sources and quantity used;
        •	   Level of community awareness of water quality issues. If aware, method used to
             receive information;
        •	   Processes, protocols, and needs of agencies, NGOs, and the scientific community;
        •	   Drivers to foster long-term participation in the project; and
        •	   Mobile devices that are used, technical knowledge of participants, data plans and
             cost of usage.
    3.	 Dissemination of data: The preferred method to receive and provide information. This will
        provide the foundation for adapting technology in the initialization and customization
        phase.

    4.	 The training method most likely for success.

Task 1.4. WQIs and Sampling Methods Selection
Objectives: Select the WQIs to be monitored during the crowdsourcing project. Identify the
potential sampling methods that citizens can use to measure the WQIs.

Activities: This task builds upon information gleaned in the previous tasks and will be shaped by
known water quality limitations, types of anthropogenic and natural pollution sources in the study
area, use of water by the communities, interests of the agencies, NGOs, and scientific community.
Steps for selecting the suite of analytes to be monitored include:

    1.	 Determine the project area and the associated communities.

    2.	 Determine the sources where people obtain water for drinking, as well as sanitization
        and health. Is the water primarily extracted from local groundwater wells, distributed
        systems, or surface water bodies?

    3.	 Review existing water quality monitoring efforts to determine the water quality constituents
        that have been collected and documented. Potential sources for water quality monitoring
        data include the state government’s Department of Public Health and Engineering, central
        and state Departments of Surface Water and Groundwater, and the sate’s Department
        of Agriculture.



                                                                                                       35
     Crowdsourcing Water Quality Data




         4.	 Inventory the current and future anthropogenic activities that may affect water quality
             conditions in the project area. Watersheds dominated by agriculture will have a different
             set of analytes than one that is primarily industrial. If the area has potential to have
             change in landuse or development, parameters should be included that represent the
             future conditions.

         5.	 Determine the audience for the analysis. As stated, the citizen science/crowdsourcing
             approach involves, at a minimum, individuals using water resources for drinking water and
             those managing it. Analytes should be chosen that are relevant to both, though priority
             should be given to the individuals conducting the sampling as they will need incentives
             to remain in the program. Collection of data that the samplers view as irrelevant to their
             well-being will likely not support continued commitment to the monitoring effort.

     Once WQIs have been identified, a survey of testing methods is performed:

         6.	 Determine the sampling methods and equipment available to screen WQIs at appropriate
             concentrations to match the desired conditions. The Government of India has established
             the regulatory standards for drinking water in IS10500.

         7.	 Determine the requirements, cost per test, and feasibility of distribution of sampling
             equipment.

         8.	 Obtain and perform a trial of each type of sampling equipment to determine the
             appropriateness for the project. Specific emphasis should be placed on ease of use,
             accuracy, reliability, repeatability, and training requirements of the sampling method.
             Sampling methods subject to user interpretation will need additional training.

     Assumptions/limitations: This assumes the communities have been characterized and that the
     information is available outlining WQIs.

     Outcomes: List of relevant analytes and associated sampling methods to be employed in the
     project.


     Task 1.5. Cost Estimate
     Objectives: Develop a cost estimate for the Initiation and customization, implementation, and
     reporting phases of the crowdsourcing project.

     Activities: Conduct a financial evaluation for the pilot project to assess financial performance,
     as well as assess the project’s scalability and sustainability. Revenues include those coming from
     profits for commercial projects and funding from donors, government agencies, and corporate
     social responsibility funding for non-commercial projects. Expenses should be calculated based
     on those outlined in Table 7. Depending on the identified project needs and conditions, additional
     revenues and costs may need to be considered.

     Note, if proven useful for citizens and agencies, the pilot project could be continued past the
     one-year period. Therefore, the budget for the implementation and the evaluation and reporting
     phases should be written such that it is the annual expenditure to continue the water quality
     screening in subsequent years.

     Assumptions/limitations: Accurate and up to date costing data is available.

     Outcomes: A cost estimate for the four phases of the crowdsourcing project.

Task 1.6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plans
Objectives: Understand the potential risks and develop mitigation plans prior to project launch.

Activities: With the Local and Project Teams, conduct a SWOT analysis. Once risks have been
identified, develop mitigation plans to provide guidance during planning and implementation.

Assumptions/limitations: Local and Project Team members are willing and available to develop
the SWOT analysis and mitigation plan development.

Outcomes: Identification of the potential risks that may occur during the project and mitigation
plans should the risks come to fruition.

Task 1.7. Performance Indicator Selection
Objectives: Select performance indicators for measuring citizen adoption of technology, impact
on citizens and communities, technology performance, and financial performance of the project.
Activities: Methods for data collection include collecting numerical data (for example, number
of samples taken by farmers, number of visits to websites) as well as interviews of participants,
community members and leaders, agency personnel, and interested stakeholders. Numerical data
should be collected through time to illustrate trends in the use of the technology, who is adopting
it, in what regions, with what frequency. Interviews should be conducted to elicit perceptions on
the performance and relevance of the technology in the citizens’ daily lives, and to determine
what is working well and what needs to be changed to improve and incentivize participation in
screening water quality. Finally, results from the screening tests should be compared with state
and central government water quality monitoring network results to determine the effectiveness of
the screening techniques.

Using the performance indicator list in Annex 2 along with other resources, the Project Team will
develop a list of appropriate indicators. The list will be refined in consultation with the Local Team.
A document outlining the indicators; protocols, sources, and methods for obtaining information;
and format for reporting the results will be created. Survey questions should be outlined at this
time with the expectation that the survey will be given before, during, and after the project in order
to measure impacts. Generic survey questions are provided in Annex 1; however, these should be
refined to reflect context of the project.

Assumptions/limitations: Quality, quantity, and format of primary data are sufficient for
evaluation.

Outcomes: Document outlining the performance indicators, source of the data, how it will be
collected, and the reporting mechanism.

Task 1.8. Contracting
Objectives: Contracting with vendors for services and equipment.

Activities: Develop terms of reference for services and equipment to support the project. Contracting
services can include, but are not limited to:


  Pilot Considerations: Cost estimate.
  During the cost estimate, the long-term outlook for the sustainability of the project should
  be considered. Therefore, clear objectives should be determined as this will define the
  performance indicators that can be used to determine the value of the project during the
  Project Refinement and Improvement Task.


                                                                                                          37

and Testing
Objectives: Design, develop, and test the data dissemination applications for citizens, WMAs,
service providers, and other stakeholders.

Activities: Develop and customize the data dissemination applications for the WMAs, service
providers, and other stakeholders. The first step is an evaluation of the data needs and reporting
methods required to support the business processes from each group. In addition, the servers,
data protocol, and network connections from each user system will need to be evaluated and
connections mapped to the m-App server. For each data dissemination application interface to
be created, the development process will be iterative, employing HCD and rapid prototyping
methods.

Assumptions/limitations: Members of each group actively test the data dissemination and provide
information to the data dissemination application developers. The data dissemination application
developers can make changes and return an updated version to group members. Data protocols
from each organization are available to exchange data.

communities. Develop training materials and methods for water quality sampling and use of the
m-App and citizen version of the data dissemination application. For the WMAs, develop training
for use of the data dissemination application as well as it inclusion into their business practices.

Assumptions/limitations: The availability of participants to receive both equipment and training.
The availability of sampling equipment for distribution.

Outcomes: Participants trained in the use of the equipment now in their possession.


3. Implementation
Building on the information learned in the Investigation and Scoping Phase and solutions and
technology developed in the Initiation and Customization Phase, the Implementation Phase of the
full program is executed. The information discovered and the project formulated in the first two
phases will dictate how the third phase will be conducted. While specific factors and aspects of
the project will be determined in Phases I and II, the primary tasks required include water quality
screening by citizens and technical maintenance. Listed below are the general terms of elements
to consider for each task.

3.1. Water Quality Screening
Objectives: Facilitate water quality screening by citizens and incorporation of the data collection
into the WMA business.

Activities: Citizens are actively screening water quality using sampling methods and m-App.
This task involves supply and distribution of sampling equipment, determining that training is
maintained, and public outreach is continued. Data are collected by the m-App server and
performance indicator data are actively being collected. WMA have incorporated the data to
support decision-making and water resource management.


                                                                                                       39

     the tests. Data dissemination applications are maintained and kept current.

     Outcomes: Results during implementation include:

         1.	 Active citizen networks that are screening for water quality, reporting results, and
             receiving water quality reports beneficial to their needs.
         2.	 Data dissemination applications for citizens, WMAs, service providers, and other
             stakeholders.


     3.2. Technical Maintenance
     Objectives: Support the m-App server database and reporting websites, phone apps, and links
     to agency databases.

     Activities: Throughout the project, support will be required to ensure that the technology supporting
     the crowdsourcing remains functional. Activities include updating hardware and software,
     troubleshooting power outages and hardware failure, installing and using anti-viral software,
     developing and maintaining data transfer protocol between organizations, and periodically
     backing up databases.

     Assumptions/limitations: Technical staff will be allocated time and trained to support the m-App
     application, associated servers, and data dissemination applications in each user group. It is
     assumed that these staff will remain through the project.

     Outcomes: Maintained        infrastructure   supporting   the   m-App    and    data   dissemination
     applications.


     4. Reporting and Evaluation
     A primary component of the Theory of Change is to measure and evaluate the progress and
     effectiveness of the project. This is envisioned to occur at the six-month and one-year intervals
     for the project with annual reporting to occur, should the project be continued. Results will be
     used to illustrate the effectiveness of the program and identify aspects of the project that need
     improvement for its sustainability moving forward.

     4.1. Tracking and Data Collection
     Objectives: Gather information for use in evaluation and reporting (Task 1.7).

     Activities: Collect and process data for the performance indicators, as well as collect stories and
     testimonials from participants. The performance indicators selected will change depending on
     how the project is defined in Phases I and II.

     Assumptions/Limitations: Data collected will be processed and made available to participants.
     It is assumed that data collection and analysis will involve agency, scientists, and citizens involved
     in the Local Team.

     Outcomes: The database of the water quality data collected, valuation of performance indicators
     (defined in Task 1.7), and compilation of stories and anecdotal data for use in evaluation and
     reporting (Task 4.2).

4.2. Evaluation and Reporting
Objectives: Report the project performance to the various participating groups involved in the
project.

Activities: Using the data collected in Task 4.1, reports are generated for several audiences.
At a minimum, the reports generated include: a project overview for communities of the citizen
participants; technical report for the agencies, NGOs, and scientists involved in the project;
and effectiveness and financial reporting to funding agencies. Other audiences and reports may
be determined in the course of the project, but the data should be comprehensive enough to
customize the analysis for new audiences.

Assumptions/limitations: The report formats will likely change based on the intended audience.

Outcomes: Performance reports describing the water quality project tailored to the audiences
involved in the project.

4.3. Project Refinement and Improvement
Objectives: Understand areas for improvement that can be implemented during the next project
cycle.

Activities: Using the performance metrics and participant feedback regarding their experiences
with the project, define refinements and improvements to be implemented during the next phase
project.

Assumptions/limitations: Availability of data and participants to provide feedback.

Outcomes: Improvements to the project based on lessons learned.


 Pilot Considerations: Implementation Duration.
 Ideally the implementation phase of the pilot project would extend over a year. This allows the
 project to be evaluated through all phases of the hydrologic cycle, as well as in rural communi-
 ties, the Kharif, Rabi, and summer growing seasons.




                                                                                                     41

     Conclusion
     Presented are the Theory of Change, design considerations, and methodology for conducting
     a crowdsourced water quality pilot project. Testing water quality using mobile technology in a
     crowdsourced framework with citizens assisting in the process is an exciting, yet complex, propo-
     sition with potentially great reward. To be successful will require thoughtful and well considered
     planning and execution. This document incorporates research specific to this kind of work, and
     suggests a Theory of Change and methodology to guide the efforts of the pilot. Given the critical
     importance of citizens and agencies understanding the quality of water they use, conducting the
     pilot project and continuing to learn and improve on this innovative approach is essential and has
     the potential to bring about lasting change.

     Annex 2. Performance Indicators –
     Process and Outcome Measures
     Performance indicators are used to determine the effectiveness of the crowdsourcing effort to
     measure and effect change. From the Theory of Change, the desired outcomes have been defined
     as better understanding of water quality, improved community empowerment and knowledge
     concerning water quality, increased actionable data for water quality management, and reduced
     cost of water quality monitoring. The list of indicators in this annex offers process indicators to
     track if the technology and its implementation are performing well, as well as outcome indicators
     to determine if the crowdsourcing project is benefiting citizens and water management agencies
     (the outcomes in the Theory of Change). A combination of qualitative and quantitative indicators
     is presented as both provide effective means of characterizing the processes and outcomes of
     the project. The table below presents a generic list of indictors for consideration and due to
     overlapping objectives, there is duplication in the use of indicators amongst categories. For
     example, the m-App Use category within the Citizen Adoption group has a similar set of outcome
     indicators as the m-App category within the Technology Performance group because both are
     determining the effectiveness of the technology. The indicators suite selected for a project will
     need to be customized given the cultural, technological, political, and environmental conditions
     of the study.
