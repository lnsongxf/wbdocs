     I.    Introduction

    1. Improving the quality of education is one of the most important and urgent challenges for the
       future of the Arab world. A regional consensus on the state of the region’s education quality and a
       political mandate to address the issue were the outcomes of the Doha Ministerial Colloquium on
       Quality of Education of September 20-21, 2010, organized in partnership by ALECSO, Qatar
       Foundation and the World Bank. As a follow up to the Doha colloquium, an Arab Regional Agenda
       for Improving Education Quality (ARAIEQ) has been prepared by the three partners and endorsed, in
       December 2010, by the Region’s Ministers of Education to be the action plan for improving regional
       education quality. The Regional Agenda main goal is to enhance learning outcomes for all by
       improving the quality and relevance of education services. More specifically, it promotes a shift in
       education policy making in the Region from a focus on inputs to a focus on results, whereas
       improving the quality of educational services calls for institutional strengthening in relation to each
       and every school factor that has a determinant impact on education service delivery and, as a result,
       on learning outcomes.

    2. The World Bank launched, in 2010, the System Assessment and Benchmarking for Education
       Results (SABER) program to help countries systematically examine and strengthen the
       performance of their education systems. Recognizing the gap in the availability of policy data,
       information, and knowledge on what matters most to improve the quality of education, the SABER
       program is building a comprehensive toolkit of system diagnostics to examine education systems and
       their component policy domains against global standards, best practices, and in comparison with
       policies and practices of countries around the world. The program covers a wide range of policy
       domains related to education inputs such as Teachers and Education Technology, as well as to
       governance and institutions.

    3. The MENA regional study on teacher policies is part of the ARAIEQ initiative and builds on
       the methodology and tools developed by the SABER-Teachers work. Its objective is to produce a
       cross-regional review of relevant educational policies in Arab countries with a specific focus on
       incentives for improving quality of teaching and learning. The study aims at: (i) collecting essential
       data on various aspects of education systems, teacher policies, incentives and governance
       mechanisms in MENA countries; (ii) evaluating relevant policies and reforms through selected case
       studies in the region; and (iii) facilitating knowledge sharing and strengthening regional partnerships
       by holding regional dissemination and learning events.

    4. This report summarizes the main findings of the first phase of the regional study on teacher
       policies which draws heavily from the SABER-Teachers methodological papers and country
       reports. It presents the methodology of the SABER-Teachers benchmarking exercise; provides a
       preliminary analysis of the regional trends in teacher policies based on data collection and analytical
       tools developed by HDNED as well as the country reports produced by the SABER-Teachers team;
       and discusses the next steps for the regional work on teacher policies.

    II.    The SABER-Teachers Benchmarking for MENA Countries1
    5. While there is an increasing amount of evidence showing the key role of teachers in the quality
       of education, little is known about what policies are most effective to attract, retain, and
       motivate qualified teachers. A growing body of evidence indicates that teachers play a key role in
       delivering what, how, and how much students learn, including among disadvantaged students. Now
       that students are faced with challenges of globalization and the increasing emphasis on the knowledge
       economy, quality education offered by well-trained, educated teachers plays an even greater role in
       shaping the future of the fast-growing younger generation in MENA countries. While research has
       documented the important effects of teachers in students’ learning outcomes, there is less evidence on
       the specific characteristics of teachers that lead to better student learning outcomes. Moreover,
       although countries throughout the world, including in the MENA region, are continuously
       experimenting with a variety of policies to improve teacher performance, little is known about how
       the policies vary across countries and their actual effects on teacher quality or student outcomes.

    6. The main purpose of the SABER-Teachers work is to help inform decisions about teacher
       policies. In order to offer guidance to policy makers in client countries on how to raise teaching
       quality, the Education Unit at the World Bank’s Human Development Department has launched
       SABER - Teachers an initiative that seeks to collect information about teacher policies in developed
       and developing countries, analyze it to identify common challenges and promising solutions, and
       make it widely available to inform countries’ decisions on where and how to invest in order to
       improve teaching quality.

       2.1 The SABER-Teachers Methodology

    7. The SABER-Teachers program evaluates teacher policies with respect to eight core policy
       goals. These policy goals were selected based on three main criteria: (i) Relevance/Effectiveness
       (must be related to teacher effectiveness and/or student achievement—either through theory or
       empirical evidence); (ii) Priority for resource allocation (only goals that promise to produce
       considerable improvements in teaching and learning are considered); and (iii) actionable (can be
       directly influenced by policy decisions). Then, policy levers by which education systems can reach a
       specific goal and, for each lever, indicators to measure how well those systems are using the levers,
       have been defined (see Annex A for the full list of policy goals, levers and indicators). The eight core
       teacher policy goals identified by SABER are:

           •          Setting clear expectations for teachers: Expectations for student and teacher performance
                      influence how potential entrants perceive the profession, the way teachers organize their work
                      and how goals of different key aspects of the profession such as pre-service training,
                      professional development and teacher appraisals are aligned. The clearer and more
                      institutionalized these expectations are, the more likely an education system is to achieve its
                      performance objectives. Three policy levers are considered to reach this goal: Are there clear

 SABER stands for System Assessment and Benchmarking for Education Results. Members of the SABER-Teachers team who
authored the background papers and country reports include: Emiliana Vegas (Sr. Education Economist, HDNED, TTL),
Alejandro Ganimian (Consultant, HDNED), Nicole Goldstein (Consultant, HDNED), and Agustina Paglayan (Junior Professional
Associate, HDNED)


        expectations for what students should know and be able to do? Are there clear expectations
        for what teachers are supposed to do? Do teachers have enough time to fulfill their duties?
    •   Attracting the best into teaching: The better the quality of the teaching force, the more
        likely an education system is to have effective teachers. Four policy levers have been
        identified: Are entry requirements set up to attract talented candidates? Are pay and benefits
        appealing for talented candidates? Are working conditions appealing for talented candidates?
        Are there attractive career opportunities?
    •   Preparing teachers with useful training and experience: Equipping teachers with the skills
        they need to succeed in a classroom is crucial. Teachers need subject matter knowledge,
        classroom management skills and lots of practice in order to be successful in a classroom.
        The policy levers considered are: Are there minimum standards for pre-service teaching
        training programs? Are individuals required to have classroom experience to be allowed to
        teach? Do teachers have a smooth transition from pre-service training into their first job?
    •   Matching teachers’ skills with students’ needs: Ensuring that teachers work in schools
        where their skills are most needed is important for promoting equity and efficiency. Without
        purposeful incentives, teachers tend to gravitate towards schools with better working
        conditions, which often serve better off students. Policy levers considered are related to
        incentives offered to teachers to work at hard-to-staff schools and/or to teach critical shortage
        subjects.
    •   Leading teachers with strong principals: Having strong leaders is important not only to
        ensure acceptable levels of performance, particularly through facilitating teachers’ work and
        professional development, but also to drive improvements at the school level. Policy levers
        education systems can use to reach this goal are related to the requirements to become a
        principal, the incentives to perform well, and the room for principals to make key decisions to
        improve teaching.
    •   Monitoring teaching and learning: Teacher and student evaluations help identify good
        practices, which can then be shared among the teaching staff to improve school performance.
        Also, identifying low-performing teachers and students is necessary to support them in a
        timely manner. Policy levers critical to reach this goal are related to the availability and use
        of data on student achievement and teacher performance to inform teaching.
    •   Supporting teachers to improve instruction: Support mechanisms are necessary to help
        teachers reach their full potential and perform at their best. Changes in classroom
        assignments and/or student populations can pose new challenges to teachers who will need
        additional help to sustain their performance. Finally, support mechanisms can go a long way
        in preventing burnout and reducing turnover. Even motivated teachers may choose to leave if
        they are consistently ineffective, do not know how to improve and receive little support. Two
        policy levers are considered for this goal: Is teacher performance data used to improve
        teaching? Is there professional development to improve practice?
    •   Motivating teachers to perform: Teaching is a challenging job and incentives can let
        teachers know the results they have achieved are valued so that they continue working hard to
        sustain them. In addition, some types of incentives can influence the profile of the teaching
        profession and make it more competitive, dynamic and performance-driven. Three policy
        levers can be used to reach this goal: Are there minimum mechanisms to hold teachers

               accountable? Are there rewards for high-performing teachers? Are there sanctions for low-
               performing teachers?

    8. The SABER teacher policy benchmarking compares how policy levers are enacted in a specific
       country with the trends observed in top-performing education systems. The main idea is that,
       looking at what top-performing education systems are doing can add more specific guidance on
       policy priorities already identified through empirical evidence. This helps to understand whether these
       performing systems are reaching policy priorities in the same ways or if there are policies “good
       enough” to achieve strong learning results, even if they might not necessarily be “ideal” in every
       dimension. Results of international student achievement tests (TIMSS, PISA and PIRLS) for the last
       twelve years were used to identify two main groups of countries: (i) countries with the strongest
       record of high performance; and (ii) countries with the strongest record of improvement. Then, recent
       cross-national reports with data on teacher policies were used to review teacher policies in the top-
       performing countries, and to decide what indicators to use to assess education systems in each teacher
       policy goal and how to classify countries according to each indicator.

       2.2 Data Collection and classification criteria

    9. A specific survey was used to collect data on teacher policies. The SABER-Teachers team
       developed a set of twelve country-specific questionnaires requesting information on the general
       characteristics of the country’s education system as well as on laws, regulations and practices related
       to ten policy dimensions: (i) Requirements to enter and remain in teaching; (ii) Initial teacher
       preparation; (iii) Recruitment and employment; (iv)Teachers’ workload and autonomy; (v)
       Professional development; (vi) Compensation: Salary and non-salary benefits; (vii) Retirement rules
       and benefits; (viii) Monitoring and evaluation of teacher quality; (ix)Teacher representation and
       voice; and (x) School leadership.

    10. This survey was initially implemented in 7 MENA countries (Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan,
       Lebanon, Tunisia, West Bank/Gaza, and Yemen). In each country, a single researcher, recognized
       and endorsed by country officials, collected data by interviewing key informants in the Ministry of
       Education and by compiling the relevant, supporting legal documents. In a subsequent step, the
       SABER-Teacher’s team, reviewed and verified all data and, if necessary, contacted and re-contacted
       the in-country researchers in order to rectify any omission, elucidate any unclear answer, and
       straighten out any inconsistency.

    11. A scoring system was used to classify all possible answers to each policy lever’s indicator. The
       four-point scale, adopted after mapping out the ways in which an indicator could be answered,
       classifies each indicator into four levels of development:
           • Latent: Latent systems are those that do not have any of the elements in place referred to in
                an indicator
           • Emerging: emerging systems have insufficient elements in place
           • Established: established systems have all the necessary elements in place (i.e., the policies
                they have are “good enough”)



                                                                                                      Page | 5

           •   Mature: mature systems go beyond what is necessary and have even more than what is
               needed to succeed.

    12. This classification was used to assess policy levers indicators. The rating was then aggregated at the
       policy goal level for each country.




                                                                                                      Page | 6

 III.      Preliminary Findings

       3.1 General Overview

  13. Based on the SABER-Teacher rating, the seven MENA countries surveyed can be categorized
      into two groups. First, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan which seem to have the necessary elements in
      place to help achieving most of the eight policy goals. The second group of countries (Lebanon,
      WBG, Yemen and Djibouti) is at the “emerging” stage, meaning that although they have some
      elements in place to achieve the policy goals for effective teaching and learning, these elements are
      seen as insufficient for most of the eight policy goals considered in the survey.

  14. The policy goal 1 (setting clear expectations for teachers) is the one where the sample countries
      are better off, while policy goal 4 (matching teacher’s skills with students need) is the weakest.
      Six out of the seven countries have systems in place that set clear expectations for teachers through
      establishing national curricula, defining teacher duties and setting performance goals. On the other
      hand, five out of the seven countries have not established sufficient incentives to encourage teachers
      to serve the most disadvantaged students.

3.2 Analysis by Policy Goals


        ¾ Policy Goal 1: Setting Clear Expectations for teachers

15. Expectations for what students should know and be able to do are clear. Most countries have a
    national curriculum, which sets out the content in detail. With the exception of WBG, standards, set
    by the Ministry of Education (MoE) at the national level, prescribe what students should know and be
    able to do at each grade level. However, schooling hours at both the primary level and at the
    secondary level fall generally short of schooling hours in high-performing systems (1200 hours). This
    means that students may not have sufficient interaction time with the teachers to achieve the learning
    objectives set out by the curricula.

16. Teachers are guided by clear expectations and performance goals. The MoE or a national
    authority under the umbrella of the MoE is responsible for defining teacher duties which commonly
    include: teaching, lesson-planning and assignment grading. Other tasks explicitly mentioned in some
    countries include: integrating difficult students, mentoring fellow staff members, standing in for
    absent teachers, providing extra-curricular activities, carrying out administrative functions and
    collaborating on the school plan. To confirm whether such expectations and performance goals are
    satisfactorily met, is not the primary scope of this survey as the tool is designed to only examine
    availability of certain policies and regulations.

17. While the number of teaching hours required from teachers (either per week or per year) is
    well defined, in most countries time requirements for the amount of hours that teachers are
    expected to devote to non-teaching tasks such as lesson-planning and grading are either not
    appropriately defined or ignored. In Tunisia, total working time refers to general civil service
    requirements which do not reflect the reality of teachers practice. In Egypt, the total number of hours

                                                                                                    Page | 8

    required (46h/week for primary school teachers) looks unrealistic. In Yemen and Djibouti, only
    teaching time is specified.

ϭϴ͘ As for teachers’ required working hours, only half of the surveyed countries are comparable to
    what is observed in top-performing countries (1245 to 1960 hours/year). Only Egypt and Tunisia
    are up to the international standards, and annual working time requirements in Lebanon, Yemen and
    West Bank and Gaza are remarkably low. For instance, in Lebanon, the data for primary school (864
    hours) and secondary school (640 hours) teachers is significantly lower than their counterparts in high
    performing countries. Based on the available data, the share of total working time devoted to teaching
    falls within the range of top-performing countries (less than 60%) for Tunisia, Egypt and WBG and
    slightly above for Jordan (67%) and Lebanon (66%). Also, West Bank and Gaza claims that all
    working hours are supposed to be 100% dedicated to teaching therefore teachers do not assume any
    other tasks but teaching. It should be noted however, that actual net working hours of teachers cannot
    be captured by the survey as this is the statutory working hours of teachers. 

        ¾ Policy Goal 2: Attracting the best into teaching

19. Most countries have adequate requirements for recruiting teachers but large numbers of
    teachers do not meet those requirements. With the exception of Djibouti, all systems require an
    ISCED 5A degree level to be recruited as a teacher, and five out of the seven surveyed countries
    request passing a written test. The percentage of teachers not meeting the requirements varies from
    2.2% in Egypt to 52.6 % in WBG. In Yemen, while a Bachelor’s degree in Education is required for
    both primary and secondary school teachers, around 13% of teachers hold neither a university degree


                                                                                                                                              Page | 9

    nor a diploma from the Teachers Institutes, and are considered under-qualified by the MoE. Yet, in
    reality, it is presumed that these countries would not be able to accommodate and serve all students if
    the requirements are rigorously enforced. With the fast-growing demand for Universal Primary
    Education, facing the “youth bulge” in the region, having all teachers fully qualified would take time
    and ceaseless efforts to achieve. (See Annex B.)

20. In general, screening processes to enter pre-service teacher training, which are based on test
    scores in the secondary school leaving examination and, in most cases, compulsory entrance
    examination, are not very selective. This is the case in Jordan, WBG, Egypt and Yemen. However,
    in Tunisia and Djibouti, entry into teacher education programs is highly competitive: for entry into
    education programs the ratio seats/applicants is 1-2.5% in Tunisia and 4.3% in Djibouti. It is also
    commonly observed in these countries that in addition to the non-competitive selection to enter pre-
    service training, any graduate from the teacher education can join the civil service roster (waiting list)
    and wait long enough until a position opens up in the teaching profession. Teacher selection thus
    depends largely on the roster process, which means the system is not selective enough to attract the
    “best’ into teaching.

21. In all seven countries, teachers are offered competitive starting packages, but the evolution of
    their salaries overtime is relatively moderate. When considered in relation to GDP per capita, entry
    salaries vary between 150% (Lebanon) to 758% (Djibouti) while top-performing and rapidly-
    improving education systems pay their teachers 82-135% of their GDP per capita. After 15 years,
    teachers can expect to earn between 1.19 (Tunisia) and 1.5 times their salaries compared with the
    range of 1.26-1.77 observed in top performing countries. In WB&G, currently it takes a new teacher
    with Bachelors’ degree 25 years to reach the top of the salary schedule. This slow raise may
    deteriorate teachers’ motivation for quality service delivery.

22. Most countries offer attractive career opportunities, typically based on performance evaluation
    and seniority, however, these promotions do not necessarily come with additional salary
    benefits. Teachers can apply to become principals and assume other leadership posts, such as lead
    teachers, based on performance evaluation and other measures. Regarding teachers working
    conditions, data is relatively limited. Standards for school infrastructure are generally in place but not
    systematically monitored. With the exception of Djibouti, average Students/Teacher ratios are
    reasonable by international standards. However these averages could mask serious disparities by
    region, such as overcrowding in many urban schools and severe shortage in rural areas.

        ¾ Policy Goal 3: Preparing teachers with useful training and experience

23. Most countries (five out of seven) do not have sufficient teacher policy elements to ensure a
    quality of pre-service teacher training programs comparable to what is observed in top-
    performing countries. These elements include: Accreditation mechanisms for academic teacher
    training programs, minimum standards for pre-service teacher trainings, in-class professional teaching
    experiences for all teachers and a smooth transition process from training to practice.

24. Egypt and, to a lesser extent, Tunisia, have well established policies for pre-service teacher
    training. The recently reformed Egyptian pre-service teacher training system could be seen as a
    “good practice” for the region. In Egypt, the Professional Academy of Teachers (PAT), established
    in 2008 to enhance professionalism of the teaching profession, is responsible for: (i) setting the
    national curriculum for teacher training, including pre-service induction training programs; (ii)
    ensuring sustainable professional development of teachers; and (iii) licensing teachers according to
    national standards while linking promotions to the license requirements. Although Tunisia has a
    relatively well established pre-service teacher training system, there is room for improvement: The
    balance between subject matter and pedagogy during training for secondary school teachers needs to
    be reviewed; and required time allocations for classroom experience during training are below those
    of high-performing systems.

25. With exception of Djibouti and Yemen, all countries have accreditation systems in place.
    Tunisia requires accreditation under the same accreditation rules that apply to all academic programs,
    and other countries have accreditation rules specific to teacher education programs.

26. Standards for pre-service training vary widely from one country to the other, but are generally
    poorer than international standards. Egypt and Tunisia have established clear requirements and
    corresponding specified time allocations for pedagogic theory, teaching methods and subject matter
    knowledge. Lebanon and WBG do not have statutory course requirements or official
    recommendations for the amount of time that primary and secondary teacher education programs
    devote to specific subjects (pedagogy, theory, methods, language, mathematics, and science). Jordan
    lacks a pre-service teacher training system; there are no mandatory training programs at universities
    that a candidate must undertake. In Djibouti and Yemen, pre-service teacher training programs have a
    strong focus on subject matter. Overall, the structure, length and contents of the mandatory pre-
    service are much weaker than most high performing systems, which offer at least one to two years of
    structured programs.


                                                                                                    Page | 11

27. While all countries set certain periods of classroom experience as part of teacher training
    programs, for most of them (five out of seven) the required periods are below what is observed
    in best performing countries (12 to 24 months). In most cases, a period of 3 to 6 month classroom
    experience is required. Egypt and Lebanon are in line with best practices with more than two years
    requirements.

28. Most countries offer induction and/or mentoring programs to ensure a smooth transition from
    pre-service training to their first job for periods varying from 3 to 24 months. Yemen does not
    require for teachers to participate in any induction programs neither in primary education nor in
    secondary education. Induction programs of up to a maximum of 6 months are only to secondary
    school teachers only in Djibouti and to primary school teachers in Lebanon. This is far below
    international standards, as most of high performing countries require official structured induction
    program for at least one year. Only a few countries follow this standard in MENA; Tunisia sets the
    longest length both for primary and secondary educations (more than 24 months), followed by Egypt
    (12 to 24 months both in primary and secondary levels).

         ¾ Policy Goal 4: Matching teacher’s skills with students need

29. There are limited incentives in place for teachers to work in hard-to staff schools areas. In many
    countries a lack of incentives for teachers to work in hard-to staff schools results in having the least
    qualified teachers serving the most disadvantaged students further contributing to inequality in
    teaching and learning outcomes. Currently Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Yemen provide monetary
    incentives for teachers to teach in hard-to-staff schools. This is in line with high-performing education
    systems, which offer monetary incentives for teachers to take up posts in hard-to-staff areas. Egypt is
    leading in the region in that it provides monetary and compensatory packages to teachers to work in
    hard-to staff schools. In addition to monetary incentives, better chances of promotion, travel benefits,
    and scholarships and loan assumption are provided to teachers who take up posts in these areas.
    Jordan also provides similar incentives as well as food stipends whilst Tunisia and Yemen do not
    offer any incentives besides the basic monetary incentive.

30. The main selection criterion used in deciding transfer requests is teaching experience. With the
    exception of Egypt which also uses teacher experience, teacher evaluation and inputs from
    community, all other countries use teacher experience as the sole criteria for approving transfers.
    Using the criterion of teacher’s years of experience in the profession as a basis for approving transfer
    requests can lead to inequitable effects, exacerbating hard-to-staff schools recruitment problems.

31. To address this issue, most of the MENA countries have not established fully functional system
    monitoring connected with policy interventions. In contrast to high performing system where they
    monitor and detect early on potential skilled teacher shortages/oversupply in specific areas and put in
    place coping strategies, most of MENA countries lag behind in this area.

32. While ensuring that there are skilled teachers in every subject area is a challenge faced by most
    education systems, only three countries have identified critical shortages for some regions and

                                                                                                   Page | 13

            specific subject areas. Jordan has taken steps to identify a set of critical shortage subjects
            (Mathematics, Science and Technology), which facilitates planning for increased recruitment in these
            disciplines. Yemen has also identified its critical shortage subjects (Mathematics, English language
            and Physics) and WBG identifying its set of critical shortage subjects (Physics, Biology, English, and
            Mathematics in all-boys’ schools) Whilst Lebanon, Egypt and Djibouti are yet to identify its critical
            shortage subjects. However more importantly even for those countries that have identified critical
            subjects there are no monetary or compensatory incentives set up for teachers to teach these subjects.

                   ¾ Policy Goal 5: Leading teachers with strong principals

     33. With the exception of Djibouti, all countries have established clear requirements to become a
         principal. These requirements are mostly based on previous teaching experience and academic
         background. In Egypt and Lebanon, candidates are required to pass a written test and to perform
         satisfactorily in a mandatory internship. (see table 5) However, in WBG, the written test was phased
         out because there was no solid correlation found between the teachers’ performance in the exam and
         his/her actual performance as a school principal. Therefore, it is important to ensure all requirements
         are relevant to measure the capacity and leadership of the teacher to become effective school
         principal.

     34. Principals are offered competitive pay but, in most cases, not provided with strong incentives to
         perform well. All seven countries provide competitive pay to principals, above that in top-
         performing systems (about 100% of GDP per capita). Djibouti offers highly competitive packages to
         principals at about 1,579% of GDP per capita. Similarly, principals’ pay is relatively high in Tunisia
         (633%) and in Yemen (234%). With the exception of Egypt, there are no performance-based
         incentives in place for principals. Monetary incentive mechanisms, based on principals’ performance,
         have not been well developed in most countries. The Queen Rania Award for Excellent Principals,
         introduced in 2005, offers financial awards to small number of winning, successful principals Jordan.

35. Although principals play generally a role in teacher’s evaluation, they have little room to make
    decisions to improve teaching at the school level. In all seven countries, principals do not have any
    say in determining the selection of the teachers in their schools and their role in removing ineffective
    teachers is usually consultative. Similarly, principals do not have any significant decision-making
    authority in determining the salaries of their teachers and rewarding strong performance, overtime
    distribution and payment. Among several OECD countries, such as Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands,
    New Zealand, Solvenia, Switzerland, UK, and US, grant principal a fully responsibility on hiring and
    firing decision of teachers. A growing body of evidence shows that principals, when allowed to carry
    out these functions, apply sound judgment and may help improve the quality of service delivery at
    school level. However it should be cautioned that such stronger autonomy must be exercised based on
    a solid foundation of good governance and accountability.

        ¾ Policy Goal 6: Monitoring teaching and learning

36. All the countries have student achievement data at the national level, though the quality varies
    somewhat and, in most cases, assessment data do not allow to match student scores with
    individual teachers. Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan have developed relatively good national assessment
    systems that evaluate many different grade levels, both primary and secondary. Yemen has no
    assessment at the primary level and Lebanon undertakes student assessment on a bi-annual basis. All
    the countries are participants of the TIMSS assessment, with Djibouti and Yemen participation only
    limited to the G4 of TIMSS 2007. However all the countries, with the exception of Djibouti, are
    expected to participate in the TIMSS 2011.

37. Egypt has the most comprehensive student assessment data as they assess at least 5 different
    grades being assessed with Yemen and Djibouti at the lower end with less than 3 grade levels. In
    terms of matching student assessment to individual teachers, in principle all countries with the
    exception of Tunisia and Yemen should be able to match students. However, more importantly, most
    of countries have not fully utilized those data to strategically inform policy making. It has to do with
    insufficient capacity in systematic data collection and data analysis that meet international standards.

38. Although teacher evaluations are done at least on an annual basis, including both internal and
    external evaluations, there is little evidence on follow up actions. The exception to this is Djibouti
    which does not have regulation on teacher assessment at the school level; rather its national education
    office undertakes evaluations every 2-3 years. Yemen is similar in the latency of its teacher
    evaluations in that evaluations do not require mandatory participation by all teachers. For countries
    where there is data on how many teachers fail evaluations, very few teachers are reported to fail, for
    instance in WBG and Egypt only 1.5% are reported to have failed and Jordan reporting no single
    teacher having failed, suggesting that the evaluations are process-driven. Whilst in Yemen, Djibouti
    and Tunisia there is no data available to provide an indication on how many teachers fail their
    evaluations.

        ¾ Policy Goal 7: Supporting teachers to improve instruction

39. Although teacher performance evaluations are generally used to inform classroom practice,
    there is disconnect with follow up actions. Teacher performance data are mostly used to inform
    areas of improvement, or to only provide feedback, but recommendations are not systematically put
    into practice. Likewise, there is no direct linkage between the evaluation results and decisions for
    “recognition, rewards and sanctions” such as promotions, salary raise or dismissal of teachers. Egypt,
    WBG and Tunisia adopt policies that state linkage between the evaluation and teacher dismissal,
    however, it is unclear if this is thoroughly enforced nationwide.

40. There is a lack of incentives, with significant opportunity cost, for teachers to participate in
    professional development. In most of the countries, teachers do not need to fund professional
    development from their own finances. In that sense, there is no direct financial burden on teachers by
    receiving professional development. However, since the participation to such courses is not
    mandatory or no clear guidelines for professional requirements are provided, teachers may become
    reluctant to spare their time on “voluntary” participation to professional development activities.

41. In general, there is no clear linkage between the inputs (professional development) and
    outcomes (impact on performance, or performance appraisal). Although several countries have
    established mechanisms to provide regular professional development opportunities, with reasonable
    degree of varieties, there is no systematic evaluation on how such interventions are affecting teacher
    performance. Without establishing a clear investment-return formula, it would be difficult to motivate
    teachers to attend professional development courses.

42. Number of required days of professional development is far below international standards.
    Many MENA countries either do not specify such required number of days, and for those countries
    which do have such requirement, the number of required days is very low compared to international
    standards. Most of high-performing system requires up to the maximum of 28 days per year as
    opposed to the highest requirement in the region (Egypt, 6.25 days).

        ¾ Policy Goal 8: Motivating teachers to perform

43. There is a relative absence of a performance standards framework to guide teachers to
    constantly improve their skills. Except for Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, many countries in MENA do
    not have a clear framework for quality assurance of teachers. Djibouti, Lebanon, WBG and Yemen do
    not have requirements for teachers to regularly fulfill, to remain in profession. High performing
    countries mandate teachers to participate in such assessment on a regular basis with a clear and
    transparent guideline.

44. Insufficient mechanism and weak implementation of performance-based incentives. Only Egypt
    and Tunisia offer monetary bonuses to high-performing teachers whereas it is largely absent in other
    countries. Although most of the countries do have some sanction mechanism for teacher absenteeism,
    in practice dismissals are extremely rare.



                                                                                                Page | 18

      45. Ineffective teachers are rarely sanctioned or dismissed. Tunisia and Egypt have clear set of criteria
          for performance among new teachers before awarding tenure, however, the data on actual under
          performers and dismissals are non-existent. Such data is generally not available, thus it is extremely
          difficult to confirm if ineffective teachers are actually removed in practice. Similarly in Jordan, it is
          mandatory to have probationary period prior to awarding tenure, however, after probation, it becomes
          extremely challenging to terminate employment. Once tenure is offered, performance evaluation
          results are not used to sanction low performing teachers. As public school teachers are civil servant
          position, generally it is nearly impossible to dismiss teachers in reality. High performing systems are
          also divided in this area: Singapore and New Zealand have regulations to dismiss under-performing
          teachers whereas it is absent in Japan and South Korea.

      46. The case of Egypt may serve as a good practice among MENA countries. It has relatively clear
          and coherent professional standard applied in internal and external performance evaluation. The
          results are recorded in a personalized portfolio to track the progress and provide follow up support.
          Also results are linked with rewards and sanctions, such as monetary bonus and promotion for high
          performers, and dismissal for low performers. Although actual cases of dismissal are rare, the country
          appears to have a clear set of criteria for overall personnel performance management, such as the
          procedures and requirement for new teachers in their path to become tenure, coupled with various
          mentoring programs for the new teachers.

      IV.       Recommendations – Implications to Education Reform Agenda
      
      47. The survey revealed weak policy areas that need prioritized and concerted reform efforts.
          Based on the preliminary findings, this section provides several key recommendations to be
          considered in the current and future reforms. It focuses on weaker policy areas, such as policy goal 3,
          4, 5, 7, and 8.

          Note: scores are calculated based on the simple average of 7 countries scores in each policy goal (4:
          mature, 3: established, 2: emerging, 1: latent).

      48. MENA countries need to give top priorities to achieve equitable distribution of teachers. Overall
          achievement level of eight policy goals stands at moderately unsatisfactory level, with notably low
          performance in policy goal 4 that addresses “equitable distribution of teachers”. While high
          performing countries have regulations and system put in place to identify and monitor shortage of
          teachers in certain subjects and geographical areas, and provide tangible incentives (e.g. monetary

                                                                                                             Page | 20
      
    bonus) to work in these under-served areas, MENA countries do not have adequate policies or coping
    strategies in place to effectively improve the situation. This has contributed to widen the gap between
    urban-rural education service delivery in many countries.

49. Most MENA countries do not attract the best into teaching. Although the scoring in Policy Goal 2
    states MENA countries are mostly “established” in attracting the best talent into teaching, it is in
    practice by far from a competitive selection mechanism. The entry to teaching is not designed to
    rigorously screen candidates based on relevant criteria. In contrast, top performing countries
    (Singapore, South Korea and Finland) recruit 100% of their new teachers from the top third of
    academic cohort, and then screen for other important qualities as well, such as perseverance, ability to
    motivate others, passion for children, and organizational and communications skills, which are
    believed to be predictors of teaching success. Further, top performing countries bestow enormous
    prestige and respect on the teaching profession whereas common perception and social status of
    teachers are not so high. In Finland, teaching is the most popular career choice and the most admired
    profession among top students, outpolling law and medicine (McKinsey & Company, 2010).

50. MENA countries lag behind in both pre-service and in-service training by not having clear
    standards and regulations for effective and efficient professional development. Far below
    international standards, teachers in most of MENA countries are not obliged to fulfill certain
    requirements on a regular basis. Also entry to pre-service teacher education is generally not
    competitive. Top performing countries (Singapore and Finland) in contrast, makes it extremely
    competitive and prestigious, by selecting top 10-20% of high school graduates by having numerous
    exams, interviews and screening processes. Also at such prestigious teacher education colleges,
    tuition and fees are fully covered and students also earn a salary while on training. Quality assurance
    throughout the process (pre-entry, entry, and on-the-job), is paramount to provide quality education
    for all.

51. Autonomy of principals is limited and provision of support to strengthen their leadership is not
    sufficient to improve service delivery at school. Empowerment of school principals would be
    necessary to improve quality of learning at school level as principal is the person, who understands
    specific needs of students and parents in a particular locality of the school. Capacity and required
    skills of desired teachers could be clearly defined by principals in order to deliver “relevant”
    education to students. Currently most of MENA countries do not grant school principal authorities
    although several high performing countries and OECD countries do have higher autonomy for
    principals. For instance, Finland grants a wide range of decision making authority to principals and
    teachers. Teachers have a say in school policy management, textbooks, course content, student
    assessment policies, course offerings, and budget allocations within the school (Mckensie &
    Company, 2010). Teachers can work autonomously and are deeply entrusted. This greater autonomy
    at school level is proven to impact teacher motivation and performance. Coupled with systematic
    provision of capacity building training for school principals, both basic accountability and autonomy
    at school level need to be strengthened. Having a strong leadership at school level with good school
    management skills are proven to be highly effective in improving quality of teaching and learning.


52. Incentive mechanism for teachers to perform better is weak and performance evaluations are
    not used effectively to reward/sanction teacher performance. In general, there is no clear rewards
    and sanctions for high/low performing teachers. Even countries that have such policies rarely dismiss
    ineffective teachers. The public status of teachers as civil servant makes it extremely difficult to
    remove poor performing teachers and it is not widely practiced to use performance evaluation results
    or other measures to take such action. In contrast, top performing country (Singapore) has all means
    of recognizing high performing teachers and such teachers even receive highly publicized awards
    directly from the President. Singapore also uses bonuses and retention incentives strategically to
    retain the top talent in teaching profession.

53. Continued support system, clear career path and strong recognition that “teaching as career”
    are not established. Top performing countries (Singapore, South Korea and Finland) put in place a
    long-term, life-long professional development for teachers to support them constantly improve their
    skills and motivation for teaching.

54. Overall, lack of a clear and coherent policy framework and its enforcement is the challenge for
    MENA. Even if certain policies and regulations are in place on the paper, it is still challenging to
    validate if such policy is actually implemented thoroughly in the nation. This is due to lack of data
    and general reluctance to reveal certain gaps between policy and practice, such as tutoring that are
    mostly officially prohibited but widely practiced on a daily basis. Enforcement of policies and
    constant monitoring and evaluation is also indispensable to enhance the quality of teachers and
    strengthening of overall education system in MENA.


    V.   Next steps

55. More countries participation to the survey is planned to have a holistic picture on MENA
    region. Based on the successful implementation of TPAW survey in seven countries, other countries
    including Gulf States are expected to participate in the second round. This may allow creating a
    holistic picture of MENA teacher policy status with different geographical and economical country
    samples. The entire MENA survey results would be also incorporated into a global TPAW online
    database that enables users to select and compare countries of interest.

56. Closer look at “implementation” status would be needed, to better inform education reform
    directions. As clearly stated from the onset, this survey tool is designed to check the existence of
    certain policies and regulations affecting teachers. However, experiences show some of critical
    policies are not thoroughly implemented or severely obscured in practice. Closer look at
    implementation of policies are needed to accurately grasp the actual status of teacher policy
    development and to generate tangible policy recommendations for each country. Several tools such as
    PETS and QSDS would be useful to conduct practice-oriented data collection

57. Dissemination and knowledge sharing to provide global perspectives To provide adequate and
    relevant benchmark that serves as “role model” for MENA countries, in-depth discussion on the
    results from global comparison would be highly useful. Such first dissemination conference is being
    planned for early July in partnership with Queen Rania Teacher Academy in Jordan.

                                                                                                Page | 22

58. Wider audience and stakeholders to be included in discussing and determining the direction for
    the future education reforms. Recent political and social movements strongly suggest that
    transparency, information sharing need to be further promoted to achieve good governance and
    accountability in the region. Education policy making should not be an exception from such, and a
    diverse audience and stakeholders need to be involved in the discussion. The QRTA attempts to first
    embark on such inclusive and dynamic conference to discuss teacher policies that may have
    implications to other aspects of education reform.

59. In summary, the next phase will include (1) data collection in the rest of MENA countries, (2)
    dissemination of findings in collaboration with regional partners, (3) in-depth analysis focusing
    on improving quality of education in MENA
