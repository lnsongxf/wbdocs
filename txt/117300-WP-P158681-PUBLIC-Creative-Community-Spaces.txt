Summary
Communities of entrepreneurs are creating positive impacts on local economies. When
they establish new businesses and innovate across industries, they bring about econo-
mic growth and employment. Entrepreneurs are generally drawn to cities because of their
available resources and networks, specifically access to knowledge and sector-specific
needs, and the exchange of information that occurs when an entrepreneurial community is
brought together. Central to these ecosystems are creative community spaces (CCSs)—a
range of physical spaces that enable innovation by creating a convening point for a commu-
nity of entrepreneurs and start-ups. CCSs serve to anchor entrepreneurial communities and
influence the urban economic and physical landscape.

This report showcases a selection of 13 CCSs around the world that contribute to building a community that
is sustainable and entrepreneurial and/or is helping advance an industry-specific or sectoral community. The
represented spaces include coworking spaces, accelerators, maker spaces, community spaces, incubators, fab
labs, and hacker spaces (see the glossary for descriptions of each). This presentation is not an exhaustive
analysis. In fact, the featured spaces are a few among many that stand out for their unique impact on the
ecosystem based on the services they offer, their networking assets, type of space, and business model,
among other variables. These spaces were part of the World Bank Group’s fieldwork or were otherwise learned
of through knowledge shared by city innovation practitioners and researchers. This analysis also builds on
previous research and programs of the Bank and infoDev on accelerator and community spaces1 and takes
into account global research on this topic.2 Together the 13 spaces represent a cross-section of inspirational
examples spanning cities across the globe, ranging from leading metropolises such as New York to growing
cities such as Nairobi; each caters to either a general entrepreneurial community or a more industry-specific or
sectoral one. This report’s only intent is to showcase inspiring examples and models being implemented in di-
verse environments across the world. We hope this will help catalyze a conversation about the role of creative
spaces in urban ecosystem development and provide policy makers as well as city innovation practitioners and
private investors a better understanding of these spaces and how to leverage them effectively.

Each profiled space has been chosen because it represents an inspiring example of a way to support the
growth of entrepreneurial communities and boost innovation. To deepen understanding of the mechanisms
and models followed to create such impact, this report describes each space’s impact, financial model (funding
and revenue sources), and operational model (services and interactive environments). These defining features
are contextualized in the background and forming history of each space as well as in its operational function
and objectives.

Their impacts are measured across four categories: 1. entrepreneurial communities buil-
ding, 2. business acceleration, 3. urban regeneration, and 4. industry innovation. Each space
fulfills at least one of these dimensions.

Each profile elaborates on the effect of the space, giving specific examples of ongoing programs with demon-
strable impact on the community and/or the surrounding urban landscape, often built through collaborations
with industry-specific partners, city government, and educational institutes, among other influential entities.
In some instances, spaces have revitalized their neighborhoods by refurnishing and/or reusing old buildings
and creating a new entrepreneurial community in previously economically depressed areas. In other instances,


4                                                                               CREATIVE COMMUNITIY SPACES
city governments have specifically created CCSs to revitalize the social fabric and a specific neighborhood. For
instance, in Lisbon the municipality used a fab lab to revive an old downtown neighborhood; and in Málaga,
the municipality has been kick-starting the social tissue of new developed areas through these spaces. More-
over, these selected spaces have given rise to a diversity of businesses and ideas: digital educational outreach
programs, a revolutionary bone reconstruction company, a self-driving car company, submersible remotely
operated vehicles to be used in partnership with local schools and science foundations, new fashion lines, food
businesses, and much more.

These spaces are building stronger bridges between industries and start-ups and are con-
tributing to local economies by offering platforms for new ideas to be tested, leading to
innovation within long-standing sectors of the economy and gradual job generation.

In many instances, these spaces bring together grassroots innovative communities, entrepreneurs, and estab-
lished companies in the same building, creating mixing spaces that result in natural collisions and an exchange
of ideas that boosts innovation. Through closer analysis of the different characteristics of each of the spaces—
impact, funding model, interactive spaces, and services (revenue model)—relevant and informative trends
become apparent: (a) Subsidies are the most frequently used form of funding, followed by private owner-
ship; (b) spaces that contribute to entrepreneurial communities building are partly or completely privately
owned, while the spaces that have an impact on business acceleration are often subsidized; and (c) the pure
subscription model is the most common model among thematic spaces, while hybrid models are more co-
mmon among general spaces. These trends—just some of the ones highlighted in this report—lend insight
into how these spaces operate and help decipher ways they can grow local economies through job generation
and urban revitalization.

GLOSSARY
Accelerator: A space that provides later-stage start-ups with access to mentorship and a larger network to
further develop their business ideas over an intensive and limited time frame of a few weeks to months. Often
times the start-ups give equity in return for mentorship and small seed investment.

Angel investor: A person who supplies starting or growth capital for seed-stage and early stage companies in
exchange for convertible debt or ownership equity.

Bootcamp: An immersive and technical training program focused on up-to-date trends in technology, entre-
preneurship, coding and design, and professional skills development.

Community space: A space that is designed to be inclusive of all members of a community, often providing
learning activities and a space to recreate and exchange ideas.

Coworking space: A membership-based work space that allows diverse groups of independent creative pro-
fessionals and individuals that work remotely to work in a shared setting. Coworking spaces aim to help those
with common values develop potential synergies.

Incubator: A space designed for early stage start-ups that provides a shared space as well as access to men-
tors and a variety of services (for example, business literacy programs, market research, marketing assistance,
business coaching, and so on).

Innovation hub: A space that as community managers that integrate many of the other functions of crea-
tive community spaces. Innovation hubs’ main function is to coordinate all actors of the ecosystem and help
manage the community of tech-innovators and entrepreneurs to grow sustainably. Many of these innovation
hubs enjoy the participation of the most relevant actors of the technology innovation ecosystem, including
entrepreneurs, universities, private sector, creative community spaces, and government — particularly city
government.

Fab lab: A space that specializes in digital fabrication (a type of manufacturing that uses computer-controlled
machines), which includes a range of additive manufacturing technologies, with 3-D printing being the most
common.

Hacker space: A space that is operated by a community of like-minded individuals, often with a strong interest
in technology, science, and digital fabrication, with an aim to provide a ground for collaboration and socializa-
tion for the members of the community.

Hub: An effective focal point and generator of activity for a given sector. It applies to spaces, regions, and net-
works.

Maker space: A space for creative production in art, science, and engineering where people of all ages and ca-
reer paths integrate digital and physical technologies to learn technical skills and create new products.

Venture capital: Capital that is provided to seed-stage and early stage companies by professional investors if
these companies are seen as potential high-growth ventures.

Start-up ecosystems are emerging across the world in what is primarily an urban phenomenon. Fueled by
technology-led cost reductions and increased access to resources, entrepreneurs are establishing start-up
hubs in cities, developing new industries and jobs, disrupting traditional businesses, creating new communi-
ties, and impacting the urban economic and physical landscape.1

The drive of start-up entrepreneurs provides an opportunity for positive impact on both the local economy and
the urban landscape. Policy makers are increasingly focusing on these communities of entrepreneurs to leve-
rage their drive and funnel it toward local industry and job creation as well as urban regeneration.2 What are
the internal dynamics of these ecosystems and how can they be leveraged to increase their positive impact?

Previous research by the World Bank shows that tech start-up ecosystem components can be summarized
in five categories: 1. human capital, 2. infrastructure, 3. economic assets, 4. enabling environment, and 5.
networking assets.3 The latter function as the connectors of all the other elements and holds the ecosystem
together by creating communities of entrepreneurs and like-minded individuals.

There are multiple categories of networking assets, from events and meetups to networks of mentors and
rapid skills training programs (Table 1.1). Some of these networking assets (for example, coworking spaces, fab
labs, accelerators, and so on) are integrated into physical spaces that also serve as platforms for other net-
working assets, such as events, meetups, competitions, and trainings. These spaces provide an anchor for the
entrepreneurs and support people to connect and form communities. In this report, these spaces are referred
to as creative community spaces, physical spaces that enable innovation by creating a convening point for a
community of entrepreneurs, start-ups, and otherwise like-minded people. Prime CCS examples include hubs,
accelerators, coworking spaces, maker spaces, and fab labs. As the core of a networking asset, a CCS serves as
one of the main influencers of the start-up ecosystem and enables various elements that cause the ecosystem
to come together.4

This publication showcases a variety of creative and innovative spaces that contribute to
building a community that is sustainable and entrepreneurial and/or are helping advance an
industry-specific or sectoral community.

This account provides lessons and inspirations regarding the diversity and distinguishing factors that can be
found among the plethora of creative spaces worldwide. Its purpose is to offer inspirational examples for policy
makers whose goals are to support start-up ecosystems and, more generally, for those looking to similarly
contribute to such a community by delineating the spectrum of services offered, the industry-specific connec-
tions that are bridged, and the skills that can be generated.

These anecdotes do not capture long-term impacts but instead reflect on spaces that have provided direct or
indirect value to their communities. These spaces function across the spectrum of creativity and innovation—
from focusing on incremental business process improvements to aiming for fundamental transformations of
entrepreneurial communities in their cities. This cross-section of CCSs also speaks to different revenue and
funding models, caters to various interests and industries, and upholds various networking assets and part-
nerships.

The CCSs showcased were each chosen for their role in either creating a new urban ecosystem or contributing
to the existing ecosystem in a valuable way. They come from developed and emerging economies and cities
of varying sizes, so the sample is not limited to a given region or economic performance index. They represent
a variety of funding and revenue models and a diversity of services, which can be cross-analyzed to better
understand how these factors enable the spaces to sustain themselves and be effective and impactful in spite
of their settings. This sampling captures a selection of growing industries—from fashion to fishing, from food
to robotics—and it highlights ways in which these spaces influence their given sector. Together, this catalog of
spaces is intended to present insights to practitioners and policy makers and to reflect on the different models
available for implementation around the world (World Map - Page 4).

While the spaces featured in this report use different business models, they all are part of a movement that is
bringing practical knowledge across and within industries. By drawing on the disciplines of open innovation and
cross-sector collaboration, these CCSs are reducing the barriers to access of resources and markets for start-
ups and enabling faster realization. Sector-specific CCSs have situated themselves in cities, and often in a par-
ticular area of a city that is well connected to other active spaces and entities that have a long history in driving
traditional industry. For instance, New York has been a long-standing hub for medical research and life science
companies as well as venture capital (VC) firms geared specifically toward biotech companies. Incubator spaces
in this industry have been incentivized to establish themselves in this ecosystem given the connections the
space could build and the innovations for which it could obtain support.

In other instances, spaces have located themselves in new urban areas, ones that are un-
dergoing industrial shifts; through their presence, these CCSs are creating new anchors for
industries, such as the secondary anchor for the fashion industry of New York City growing
in Brooklyn. These spaces are constantly restructuring in manufacturing, marketing, and
new methods of tech innovation to respond to the rapidly evolving demands of the industry.

Sector-specific CCSs also often emerge in areas where there is a preexisting network established within a pre-
dominant sector. In Boston, for example, creative spaces specifically driving robotics have an advantage given
the natural leadership and strengths Massachusetts has in this field overall. And by having sector-specific
CCSs in rapidly evolving sectors such as robotics, Boston ensures that the city and surrounding area maintains
this lead in the field, with start-ups building off of and benefiting from the presence of other institutions and
large companies working on similar ideas.

Exclusion of any CCS from this report is not intended as a comment on the quality of their work or the impact
they are achieving. This report’s intent is to showcase inspiring examples and models being implemented in
diverse environments across the world. The research has involved interviews with the founders of the spaces,
survey sampling, site visits, and revision of their published material (Appendix A).

This publication aims to catalyze a conversation about the role of creative spaces in urban
ecosystem development.

METHODOLOGY
The analysis of the CCSs represented in this catalog focuses on three areas:

1. the impact the spaces have on the socio-economic urban landscape of cities
2. their financial models
3. their operational models

To analyze the impact that the spaces have had on the socioeconomic urban landscape, a scope-by-impact
matrix was introduced (see Matrix 2.1). The paper investigates financial models applied by CCSs through two
elements: capital expenditure (initial funding) and operating expenditure (revenue) of the spaces. A similar ap-
proach was used to examine the spaces’ operational models, with interactive environments (that is, the es-
sence of the spaces) and services offered being the elements for analysis.

In this publication, two approaches were used to effectively identify insights. The scope and impact of spac-
es were cross-referenced with each element of the financial and operational models individually to examine
the characteristics of CCSs. The spaces were categorized using Matrix 2.1, which helped to identify emerging
trends across different financial and operations models. Combined, this analysis creates a comprehensive rep-
resentation of the nature and specifics of these CCSs.


2.2
OVERVIEW
The majority of the spaces featured in this study fall under more than one impact category. The most common
impact category represented in this study is entrepreneurial communities building, followed by business acce-
leration and urban regeneration, with industry innovation the smallest impact category. This does not imply
that the smaller represented impact categories are less common, but most likely that their impact is only
starting to emerge now.

This study features spaces that differ in their scope: general and thematic, with a slightly higher number of
general spaces in the sample. The general spaces have more impact on entrepreneurial communities building
and urban regeneration, while the thematic spaces contribute to business acceleration and industry inno-
vation. In the majority of the cases, the featured creative spaces that contribute to urban regeneration also
contribute to entrepreneurial communities building; only in a quarter of the cases do the spaces that contribute
to industry innovation also have an impact on entrepreneurial communities.

We analyze the CCS financial models from a twofold perspective: 1. fixed funding, and 2. variable revenue.
These two different types of funding have implication on the operational models of the spaces. Fixed funding
serves as base funding to cover fixed costs, while variable revenue serves to conduct additional activities and
other variable costs. From the fixed funding perspective, the spaces featured in this study used three forms of
funding: 1. private ownership, 2. private donations, and 3. subsidies; with two types of funding models: pure
(only one source of funding used) and hybrid (more than one source of funding used). Pure funding models are
being used slightly more often than hybrid. Analysis of the forms of funding shows that subsidies are the most
frequently used form of funding, followed by private ownership. The spaces that contribute to entrepreneurial
communities building are partly or completely privately owned, while the spaces that have an impact on busi-
ness acceleration are often subsidized. We observe that all spaces that have attracted private donations fall
under the business acceleration impact category.

From the variable revenue, the featured spaces use pure and hybrid revenue models. The pure subscription
model is the most common among thematic spaces; hybrid models are more common among general spa-
ces. The subscription revenue model is the most common among the spaces featured in this study, while the
consulting, rental/events, and acceleration revenue models are usually used to complement the subscription
model and are less common. Consulting and rental/events revenue models are used only by general spaces
with a strong entrepreneurial communities building impact—that is, the spaces that are more mature and



CREATIVE COMMUNITIY SPACES                                                                                   11
have well-established networks. Spaces funded solely through subsidies more often use the pure subscription
revenue model, while spaces that are privately owned tend to use a hybrid model—a mix of subscription,
consulting, and rental/events revenue models.

The CCSs presented seven different types of interactive environments for their communities:
1. coworking space 2. accelerator 3. maker space 4. community space 5. incubator 6. fab lab 7. hacker space
(see the glossary for definitions of these terms).

Typically, these interactive environments are not mutually exclusive. The most common type of interactive
environment among the featured spaces is coworking space, followed by community space, incubator, maker
space, accelerator, and fab lab; the rarest type presented in this study is hacker space. Spaces that consider
themselves a hacker space identify with a community space and a maker space more often than with other
types of spaces. In the group of featured CCSs, the number of incubator spaces is higher than that of accele-
rators, highlighting that more flexible business development programs are more common among the creative
spaces featured in this study. While maker spaces, community spaces, accelerators, and incubators are equally
common types of spaces among general and thematic spaces, coworking spaces, fab labs, and hacker spaces
are more common among thematic spaces featured in the study. The featured CCSs that identify themselves
as community spaces contribute to urban regeneration and entrepreneurial communities building, as do the
majority of hacker spaces. All accelerators analyzed in this study are privately owned, and half of them receive
private donations as part of their funding; a funding model based on “pure” subsidies is only used for incuba-
tors and fab labs. Hybrid revenue models are more typical for places marked as accelerators and incubators.

Creative spaces are able to contribute to their sustainability through the range of services they provide, which
also serve as additional networking assets for their ecosystems. In all cases, the listed services are comple-
mentary; however, the priority and combinations of the services used vary.


2.3
IMPACT
The CCSs featured here broadly fall into one of two categories: general or thematic. Creative spaces in the
general category welcome start-ups with a diversity of objectives and across sectors; the spaces in the the-
matic category tend to focus on specifically unifying start-ups within a combined space and lending indus-
try-specific services. This report aims to present a balanced selection of spaces, though there are more general
spaces featured.

The majority of these featured spaces fall under more than one impact category (see Exhibit 2.1 for definitions
of the four categories). Typically, each space combines two or three impact categories. The most common ca-
tegory is entrepreneurial communities building, followed by business acceleration and urban regeneration,
with industry innovation the rarest impact category represented in this study.

Exhibit 2.1. Impact Categories
                  This impact category is characterized by the space contributing to catalyzing the entrepreneurial
                  community where there was none or where the existing community was weak. Spaces that have
                  this type of impact provide access to tools, knowledge, and the best talent of a broader population,
                  thus giving entrepreneurs and corporations an opportunity to benefit from collaborative innovation
                  programs and innovative tools, as well as connecting people, ideas, and resources to actualize ideas
                  across industries. Many of the spaces use membership structure as a means of building a sense of
                  community and accountability. These spaces are proactive in using various educational platforms to
                  ensure the quality of the talent and to attract more attention from the private sector. Workshops,
Entrepreneurial   courses, office hours with industry leaders, and competitive initial selection are some of the attri-
 Communities      butes of the spaces put in this category. Spaces that have this impact often also offer elaborate trai-
   Building       ning programs for the private sector, aiming to enrich the community by bringing in different business
                  perspectives. Many of the spaces included in this category might be characterized as the pioneers of
                  the innovative spaces field: Whether they are well-established centers of ecosystems in European
                  cities or recently launched trailblazers all around the world, they showcase the business models, the
                  tools, and the strategies that help make the first step in building entrepreneurial communities.


                  CCSs with this impact category are best characterized by their contribution to revitalizing areas
                  through their presence. The majority of featured spaces that have had an impact on urban regene-
                  ration have started by catalyzing ecosystems in the city, thus serving as triggers for a neighborhood’s
                  transformation. In other cases, the spaces were launched with a goal to start this urban revitalization.
                  A neighborhood’s transformation might take form by the space kick-starting the commercial activi-
                  ties and creating new work opportunities in an area that otherwise was lacking it; it also might include
    Urban         the development of new or the expansion of existing high-quality business infrastructure to support
 Regeneration     local talent. Put on a municipality’s map by the evidence of a growing community and positive chan-
                  ges in a neighborhood’s demographics, these spaces often get the support of the city government,
                  whether in the form of subsidies or public-private partnerships.


                  This impact category includes spaces that have an industry focus and demonstrate new ways to
                  innovate within that industry. The creative spaces within the industry innovation category optimize
                  the costs of doing business in a specific industry by providing entrepreneurs with access to the tools,
                  space, and human capital (coaching sessions, workshops, consulting) otherwise too expensive for an
                  individual start-up. The spaces often complement industry-specific services with general trainings.
                  The focus of trainings varies from digital literacy to graphic design. Some of the spaces in this study
                  have successfully capitalized on regional- or city-level advantages by tapping into their area’s leading
   Industry       industries. This category tends to emerge in areas with well-developed and distinct ecosystems with
  Innovation      multiple stakeholders. The spaces featured under this category usually have strong connections with
                  the private sector and academic institutions, which lead to strengthening intra-industry collabora-
                  tions and reveal a potential for highly targeted disruption.


                  Creative spaces that fall into the business accelerator category compress the timescale for star-
                  ting up a new business by operating as a type of bootcamp and a “one-stop shop” for a specific
                  type of business. These spaces reduce the time needed for a company to launch, lower the barriers
                  to entry, and accelerate growth for businesses by providing entrepreneurs with tailored consulting
                  services and educational programs; they also create strategic shortcuts for the general entrepre-
                  neurial community. The latter solution is easier to achieve for spaces that work with accelerating
  Business        business in a specific industry. One important characteristic of the spaces with this impact is their
 Acceleration     focus on helping entrepreneurs to scale their businesses. In this scenario, educational programs and
                  consulting services tend to be complemented with connection to funding and an extensive network
                  of investors. This category of spaces rarely has a range of public partners; in some instances, they
                  are affiliated with academic institutions; and in either case, they are well connected with the business
                  communities.

The general and thematic spaces are impactful in different categories. The general spaces have more im-

business acceleration and industry innovation (Matrix 2.1).

In almost three-quarters of the cases, the creative spaces that contribute to urban regeneration also con-
tribute to entrepreneurial communities building, while only a quarter of the spaces that contribute to industry
innovation also have an impact on entrepreneurial communities. This implies a connection between develo-
ping entrepreneurial communities and urban cohesion in line with experience shown in New York, Barcelona,
Nairobi, Berlin, and Paris. The lesser impact of industry innovation-focused spaces on entrepreneurial co-
mmunities may be because of the industry focus and the acceleration of thematically focused start-ups rather
than on generic community building.

This suggests that there are two groups of impact areas:
1. entrepreneurial community building and urban regeneration, and
2. industry innovation, with the later focused on creation and absorption of innovation by the local industry.

The creative spaces mix models and impact focus depending on their local environment and objective
(Matrix 2.1). This suggests that CCSs are a flexible tool that can be adapted to local circumstances as needed to
address the desired impact among the categories identified.

Box 2.1. How CCS Are Transforming and Revitalizing Neighborhoods in Practice
Creative community spaces have a diverse impact on neighborhoods, resulting in urban regeneration through
the repurposing of abandoned buildings, the development of new economic activities, and the strengthening of
social cohesion. Here are some examples of where and how CCSs have impacted urban regeneration.

Both the Factory in Berlin and iF in Santiago revitalized their neighborhoods by repurposing old industrial buil-
dings and creating a new entrepreneurial community in previously economically depressed areas. The Factory
was a catalyst for the regeneration of the Mitte district—the central district of former East Berlin where the
wall was once placed—and its conversion into the heart of Berlin’s start-up ecosystem. The Factory repur-
posed an old factory (the Oswald Brauerei), revitalizing the area by attracting and creating a community of
entrepreneurs through events, coworking space, and an accelerator. Similarly, iF refurbished an old hat factory
and created (starting with a grassroots maker space) a community of entrepreneurs and business links that re-
vitalized Santiago’s Barrio Italia and attracted more innovation and creative stakeholders to the area, including
a fab lab. Both Mitte and Barrio Italia had a base of creative communities that these two spaces leveraged in
attracting and developing their entrepreneurial communities. iHub in Nairobi had a similar effect in the Bishop
Magua Center, revitalizing the neighborhood and transforming it into the epicenter of tech community in the
city. Interestingly, these three CCSs are private-led initiatives.

Fab Lab Lisbon and Promálaga Urban Incubators, on the other hand, were specifically created by their city
governments to revitalize the social fabric and economy of specific neighborhoods. Fab Lab Lisbon refurbished
the abandoned slaughterhouse of a municipal market in a decaying inner-city neighborhood that is home to
a large number of old-aged and low-income migrant people. Fab Lab Lisbon initially focused on revitalizing
the occupations of the neighborhood population, most of which are related to arts and crafts. By providing
training on digital fabrication and building a community of creative artisans and entrepreneurs, Fab Lab Lisbon
expanded the opportunities of the neighborhood population. Moreover, Fab Lab Lisbon resulted in a new hub of
innovation, attracting a creative community to a previously decaying neighborhood. Promálaga Urban Incuba-
tors, in contrast, is designed for newly created neighborhoods, where the social and economic fabric does not
exist yet. By accelerating the deployment and operation of basic neighborhood retail businesses, Promálaga
Urban Incubators rapidly create anchors for local social activity, connecting the population to the neighbor-
hood through active street life. This results in a higher social cohesion and local economic activity than would
otherwise naturally occur.

FINANCIAL MODELS
Understanding the different financial models allows us to see what is needed to launch a CCS and what makes
a CCS financially sustainable in the longer term. We analyze the CCS financial models from a twofold perspec-
tive: fixed funding and variable revenue. These two different types of funding have implication on the opera-
tional models of the spaces. Fixed funding serves as base funding to cover fixed costs, while variable revenue
serves to conduct additional activities and other variable costs.


Fixed Funding
The spaces featured in this study use three forms of funding:
1. private ownership, 2. private donations, and 3. subsidies (Exhibit 2.2).

These forms of funding are not unique, and they can be used together as well as separately in pure or hybrid
models. A pure funding model relies on a single form of funding, while a hybrid model uses two or more forms
in various proportions.

There are two pure models used in the spaces featured in this study: 1. the space is funded solely through sub-
sidies, and 2. the space is privately owned (each pure model is used by almost a third of the CCSs featured). The
rest of the featured CCSs use one of two hybrid models: private ownership + subsidies, and private ownership
+ private donations + subsidies.


CREATIVE COMMUNITIY SPACES                                                                                    15
Exhibit 2.2. Forms of Fixed Funding

1. Private Ownership: The space is owned by managing partners/was funded by its founders without any help
from the government or any private companies.
2. Private Donations: A large portion of funding comes from private corporations in the form of donations or
advanced partnerships that include material support. Donors are interested in innovation development; they
might be interested in the space’s consulting services (goes to revenue models).
3. Subsidies: The space receives financial support from any government agency/municipality and/or support
in the form of international aid. Usually spaces are supported at the city level, sometimes at the state/national
level.



Subsidies are the most common source of funding (in the majority of cases, the funding was provided by
city-level government organizations), either alone or in combination with other funding sources, suggesting
a direct or indirect policy intervention. Interestingly, some of the CCSs are funded through private ownership
only, with the sole purpose of commercialization of space or services. Private donations act as a complement
to other sources of funding and never appear as a pure source of funding (Table 2.1).

For those CCSs using subsidies, the source of subsidization varies. Often, direct government subsidies are
offered through programs—designed to boost employment and innovation—which can be offered indefinitely
or otherwise over a specific duration of time through grants. In other instances, subsidies are extended through
university affiliations, often having established the space directly through this affiliation and cross-bridging
resources. Of the spaces that receive subsidies, two-thirds receive direct government subsidies (mainly on a
municipal level) and one-third get funding through university-affiliated subsidies.


Variable Revenue
From the variable revenue perspective, the featured CCSs use both pure and hybrid revenue models almost
equally. The only model applied by the CCSs in its pure form is subscription. This revenue model is most co-
mmon among thematic spaces, which tend to have a more focused audience.

Hybrid models, on the other hand, are more common among general spaces, which have a broader audience
and an array of services.

The subscription revenue model is the most common among the spaces featured in this study. Consulting,
rental/events, and acceleration revenue models are usually used to complement the subscription model. Inte-
restingly, consulting and rental/events revenue models are used only by general spaces with a strong entre-
preneurial communities building impact, which tend to be spaces that are more mature and have well-esta-
blished networks. (See Exhibit 2.4 for definitions of the types of variable revenue.)



Exhibit 2.4. Types of Variable Revenue

1. Subscription: A revenue model where a customer must pay a membership fee to have access to the services
offered by the space. It might include the following services: mentorship, access to tools.
2. Acceleration: A model where start-ups working with a space agree to give the space an equity stake in their
start-up. It might include the following services: mentorship, connections to funding, acceleration.
3. Consulting: A model where other private or public organizations make a one-time payment to a space to
create and deliver courses/seminars/workshops on the topic of open innovation or to provide industry-specific
services. It might include the following services: training, access to tools.
4. Rental/Events: A model where private or public organizations make a one-time payment to a space to rent
its facilities and to get other forms of physical and informational support for an event (hackathons, lectures,
knowledge exchanges, and meetings with experts). It might include the following services: event space, access to
tools.

The spaces funded solely through subsidies more often use a pure subscription revenue model, while the
spaces that are privately owned tend to use a hybrid model that is a mix of subscription, consulting, and rental/
events revenue models.

OPERATIONAL MODELS
CCS operational models have two main categories: interactive environments (the essence of the space where
the community is formed), and services.


Interactive Environments
This study identified seven types of interactive environments: 1. coworking space, 2. accelerator, 3. maker
space, 4. community space, 5. incubator, 6. fab lab, and 7. hacker space (Exhibit 2.5).

Typically, these types of interactive environments are not mutually exclusive: The majority of the CCSs fea-
tured here represent more than one type. The most common interactive environment is the coworking space,
followed by community space, incubator, maker space, accelerator, and fab lab. The rarest type represented is
the hacker space.

In this study, maker spaces, community spaces, and incubators are equally common interactive environments
in both general and thematic spaces, as are accelerators; however, coworking spaces, fab labs, and hacker
spaces are more common among thematic spaces. CCSs that identify themselves as community spaces con-
tribute to urban regeneration and entrepreneurial communities building, as do the majority of hacker spaces.

All of the accelerators analyzed in this study are privately owned, and half of them receive private donations as
part of their funding; only incubators and fab labs use a funding model based on “pure” subsidies. And hybrid
revenue models are more typical for places designated as accelerators and incubators.




CREATIVE COMMUNITIY SPACES                                                                                                            17
Box 2.2. How CCSs Connect Industry and Start-ups and Allow Absorption of Innovation
by the Local Economy

Creative community spaces connect industry and start-ups through different services and mechanism. These
connections vary, ranging from designing the space to naturally allow collisionsa among industry staff and
start-ups to developing events for cross-collaboration (for example, hackathons or open innovation compe-
titions) to more hands-on approaches, such as mentoring and acceleration programs for start-ups by local
industry, which can lead to acquisition or recruitment of talent.

CCSs have developed creative services for these industry-entrepreneur links. iF in Santiago hosts grassroots
innovative community, entrepreneurs, and established companies in the same building, mixing spaces that
result in natural mingling and collisions.b

The Factory in Berlin designed its space so that established companies, such as Lufthansa, could host their in-
novation teams in the same space as the start-ups supported by the accelerator program. Company staff and
entrepreneurs must share the same common spaces, such as the kitchen, resulting in natural fraternization
and cross-fertilization of culture and ideas. NUMA in Paris offers an intrapreneur support program for compa-
nies that want to develop internal innovation capabilities.

Steel House in Rockland connects entrepreneurs and local industries (particularly the fishing industry) to co-
design and test solutions to industry challenges, prototyping and testing new products jointly. Harlem
Biospace provides a similar connection with New York’s health industry, including tailored mentorship pro-
grams for the program’s entrepreneurs from industry. MassRobotics in Boston also acts as an active link
between the program’s entrepreneurs and industry to design demand-based solutions by start-ups.

a. Collisions are random encounters with people one would normally not meet. The theory of collisions argues that these encounters
bring new ideas, perspectives, and value for creating opportunities and innovation. The more collisions individuals have with people with
different ideas, the more creative and innovative these individuals may become. Hence, the potential for collisions stimulates innovation
and entrepreneurial opportunities (Mulas, Minges, and Applebaum 2015; Kaplan 2012). b. Kaplan (2012).




Exhibit 2.5. Types of Interactive Environments

• Coworking Space: A membership-based work space that allows diverse groups of freelancers, remote wor-
kers, and other independent professionals to work together in a shared setting. Coworking spaces aim to help
those with common values develop potential synergies.
• Accelerator: A space that provides later-stage start-ups with access to mentorship and a larger network to
further develop their business ideas over an intensive and limited time frame of a few weeks to months. Often
times the start-ups give equity in return for mentorship and small seed investment.
• Maker Space: A space for creative production in art, science, and engineering where people of all ages and
career paths integrate digital and physical technologies to learn technical skills and create new products.
• Community Space: A space that is designed to be inclusive of all members of a community, often providing
learning activities and a space to recreate and exchange ideas.
• Incubator: A space designed for early stage start-ups that provides a shared space as well as access to
mentors and a variety of services (e.g., business literacy programs, market research, marketing assistance,
business coaching, etc.).
• Fab Lab: A space that specializes in digital fabrication (a type of manufacturing that uses computer-controlled
machines), which includes a range of additive manufacturing technologies, with 3-D printing being the most
common.
• Hacker Space: A space that is operated by a community of like-minded individuals, often with a strong inter-
est in technology, science, and digital fabrication, with an aim to provide a ground for collaboration and sociali-
zation for the members of the community.

Services
Creative community spaces provide a wide range of services that complement the initial interactive environ-
ment, allowing for financially sustainable development (Exhibit 2.6). Not every space offers the same services,
with some more common in—and suited to—certain environments than others. The most common type of
service revolves around providing event space for external actors, followed by training and mentorship offe-
rings, with acceleration being the least common type in the sample—only half of the CCSs offer this type of
service. Table 2.2 illustrates the operational models of the 13 featured CCSs.



Exhibit 2.6. Types of Services

1. Mentorship: Offering access and pairing with professional counseling and advisory to individuals and busi-
ness that correspond with specific needs, including either industry-specific or general advisory
2. Connections to Funding: Offering access to a network of potential financial providers and support in various
forms of grants, loans, and/or seed money
3. Event Space: Extending a space in which thematic and business events are held for the space’s community
and in some instances the larger community. A space for individuals and business to host their own events and
gatherings
4. Training: Customized and general access to learning opportunities pertaining to business development and
specific technical skills adhering to given industries
5. Acceleration: Intensive access to mentorship and resources (capital, technology, hardware) to boost start-
up business growth within limited periods of time
6. Access to Tools: Access to hardware, software, or techniques, such as industry-specific equipment

BACKGROUND
Fab Lab Barcelona, part of the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia, supports a variety of educa-
tional and research programs at various scales of human habitat and needs. It is one of the more than 1,000
fab labs found in approximately 60 countries. This global network was created with the extensive support of
academia as an outreach project of MIT’s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA) and further supported by the Fab
Foundation—affiliated with CBA—which facilitates the development of regional capacity-building organiza-
tions and the accessibility of technology and digital fabrication tools to all. The fab lab defines itself as a per-
sonal digital fabrication workshop for artists, scientists, engineers, educators, students, amateurs, and other
professionals of all ages, primarily serving community organizations, educational institutions, and nonprofit
concerns. It has strong partnerships with public and private entities.


IN ESSENSE
Fab Lab Barcelona is a general fabrication lab (please refer to glossary for definition) that serves as a center for
research, production, and education. As a fab lab, it provides at low barriers to entry a wide range of fabrication
tools that are needed both for prototyping and for testing new technologies or arts and crafts products. This
space does not influence the sort of products fabricated on-site; it just makes it and its tools accessible so that
members of the community can develop products at different scales, and it charges a service fee rather than
a membership fee. In addition, Fab Lab Barcelona provides access to mentorship, acceleration, and training
services. It invites the creation and fabrication of ideas and products that have a positive impact on society
and improve livelihoods. It takes part in developing projects and products at various scales, ranging from smart
devices for improved data collection to new labs testing systems and models of self-sufficiency.



IMPACT
Fab Lab Barcelona extends the tools, the knowledge, and the financial means to educate, innovate, and invent
using technology and digital fabrication. It seeks to catalyze the entrepreneurial community by supplying the
broader community with the resources to advance ideas and products that can have positive implications for
the greater interest of the future of society and the environment. It does not specify the range of the products
to be created but rather provides its users with access to advanced tools, knowledge, and talents, thereby
creating indefinite opportunities for collaborations and innovative projects to be developed. It reduces barriers
to entry by having no membership fee, sustaining itself instead through service fees.
Fab Lab Barcelona stands out for the various educational platforms it generates and helps maintain. These
help sustain a quality of talent while also enriching the broader community and developing a way to intro-
duce to them entrepreneurial ideas. Fab Lab Barcelona also serves as the headquarters of the Fab Academy,
a platform of education and research that turns every fab lab into a classroom, creating further opportunities
to reach out to the larger community and teach new generations about the principles, application, and impli-
cations of digital manufacturing technology. Furthermore, it works toward scaling up the impact of fab labs
in the urban environment through the Fab City project, which was started in 2011 and aims to shift activities
toward dynamic and applied research in collaboration with companies, other universities (through EU-funded
programs), and the city council.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
Smart Citizen (https:/ /smartcitizen.me) is a platform to generate participatory processes of people in cities. Its
objective is to connect data, people, and knowledge, thereby serving as a node for building productive and open
indicators and distributed tools to enable inhabitants to better communicate about their own cities. The project
was co-founded by the director of Fab Lab Barcelona and further grew within the space. The fab lab provided
the space, knowledge, contacts, and materials needed for Smart Citizen to form. Today, Smart Citizen is su-
pported by the European Union through Horizon 2020 programs (that is, EU-wide competitively awarded public
funds); it has also received innovative project awards in the Smart City Expo and World Congress in Barcelona.

BACKGROUND
Founded in 2012 when the real estate market in Berlin was depressed, Factory introduced a unique business
model based on organic acceleration. It began when a group of real estate developers purchased an old factory
and started to rent out its facilities to tech start-ups and to actively promote the space as a venue for inno-
vation-related events, soon bringing on board teams working for major tech companies. Now Factory con-
centrates on bringing together in one place the best of technology and their programs to nurture innovation,
supporting the ecosystem. The space relies on the intrinsic motivation of the start-up culture to support one
another in order to improve the chances of entrepreneurs to succeed.


IN ESSENSE
Factory is a coworking space that creates a worldwide ecosystem for start-ups and tech companies. To posi-
tively impact the change that is happening in society through technology and entrepreneurship, the space fos-
ters and accelerates innovation around the globe. The space serves as a platform for a large number of events
and offers its members unique access to the latest trends. While some events, such as fireside chats or hack-
athons, are open to the public, others are reserved for the member entrepreneurial community—for example,
knowledge exchanges and VC office hours. Factory often invites leading business figures to the members-only
events. It also offers its members access to mentors and an array of workshops; these services are designed
to help founders navigate challenges typically faced by start-ups. With its objective of flexible use, Factory
continuously expands and adapts its space by adding communal spaces and large event spaces to boost the
ecosystem. It has also incorporated “Factory coworking,” which provides high-quality office space for free-
lancers and start-ups as well as project teams and employees from corporations. Other Factory assets are its
sponsored residency program, which helps entrepreneurs entering the Berlin ecosystems, and its supporting
amenities and recreational facilities for the purpose of its community.


IMPACT
Factory is a general space that helped catalyze an urban tech ecosystem in Berlin. The space contributes to
urban regeneration and entrepreneurial communities building in the city. Factory continues to play a central
role in the latter by virtue of its extensive partnerships with private companies, unique high-quality events
organized for Factory’s members, and successful strategy of corporate-start-up relationship building. Factory
presents one of the best examples of a space that started as an ecosystem catalyzer and then embraced an
element of urban regeneration. Because of its economically sustainable rental model and strategic relationship
management, the space successfully attracted many corporate innovation teams that now are members of
the community and are based at Factory.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
Factory supported the creation of the Lufthansa Innovation Hub (http:/    /hub.lh.com/). After exploring the idea
of identifying new business potentials through start-ups, Lufthansa decided to launch its own Innovation Hub
and placed the team at the Factory, which resulted in the launch of several innovative services. Factory greatly
contributed to the project’s development by being able to nurture the wider network to support the develop-
ment of the service. With the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, Factory demonstrated its business model’s sustain-
ability and its potential to attract large firms as clients and partners.

BACKGROUND
Santiago’s iF, launched in 2014, was born out of entrepreneurs’ need for a one-stop shop where they could
give shape to their ideas, look for funding, carry out tests and experiments, share knowledge, and get profe-
ssional advice. At iF, individuals, collaborators, social organizations, innovation organizations, thematic incuba-
tors, businesses, start-ups, entrepreneurs, investment funds, and universities all work together to make this
business model a reality—and one that benefits the country’s development.


IN ESSENSE
iF positions itself as an ideas factory for innovation and entrepreneurship where collaboration inspires entre-
preneurs to focus on what they know best how to do while the community provides the means to make their
ideas happen. The space works with private companies, academic institutions, and the government. iF offers
its members a customized innovation approach, providing them with a space to collaborate, exchange ideas,
and look for new solutions among people from different organizations, backgrounds, and aspirations on a day-
to-day basis. The space highlights that this approach is transforming the traditional way of working in Chile. To
expand its community reach, iF also partners with private companies and universities that support innovation
and entrepreneurship.


IMPACT
iF is an example of a general space that has been actively investing its resources into promoting urban regene-
ration and building entrepreneurial community around it. iF uses both subscription and rental/events business
models and, as is evident from usership rates, it successfully uses its space to fuel the project’s growth. It also
implements diverse educational mechanisms to harvest local talent and develops partnerships with private
companies and academic institutions to create a stronger ecosystem around the space’s activities.

The space’s urban regeneration impact is evident through iF’s role in reshaping Barrio Italia, a previously resi-
dential neighborhood now transformed into a center for art, design, and gastronomy for the local community.
iF is located in a former hat factory that is a rare extant example of Santiago’s early 20th-century industrial ar-
chitecture. Closed for a long time, the building later became associated with the city’s nightlife. iF successfully
repurposed the building, opening it to a wider community and providing citizens with a public space while also
conserving the historical value of the space.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
The iF-backed Academia de la Felicidad (http:/ /www.academiafelicidad.org/) uses new forms of student-
teacher relationships and new ways of delivering knowledge in its programs. First tested in a workshop in
2014, the Academia now functions as an independent educational facility. It offers workshops, courses, and
coaching sessions focused on providing Chileans with new business skills and help in unlocking their entrepre-
neurial potential.

BACKGROUND
iHub is a coworking space whose objective is to catalyze the growth of Kenya’s tech community. The idea
of developing an urban tech ecosystem in Africa inspired many people, and many public and private grants
supported the space’s launch. Shortly after it opened, iHub started renting the space for events and offering
design and engineering consulting services. Seventy percent of iHub’s budget comes from internally genera-
ted revenue. Currently, the space is reinventing itself. iHub’s team is moving to a new building and will launch
three product lines that focus on locally relevant technical training, corporate co-location, and investments in
entrepreneurs.


IN ESSENSE
iHub praises its engineers’ serendipity and builds upon its space expertise. The space has corporate partners,
grant funding, and its own revenue generation models through consulting services offered via the iHub UX
Lab, iHub Research, and iHub Consulting initiatives. The iHub UX Lab’s mission is to develop a design-thinking
culture and a user-centered approach in solving problems. The UX Lab helps start-ups, social entrepreneurs,
not-for-profits, and business corporations put people at the center of all products and processes. Its services
include user research, ideation sessions, graphic design, usability testing, user experience and/or design-think-
ing training, wireframing, prototyping, interaction design, and more. iHub Research conducts qualitative stu-
dies on technology innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as on the intersection between governance and
technology in Africa.


IMPACT
iHub is a general space that aims to catalyze a tech innovation ecosystem and contributes to entrepreneurial
communities building and urban regeneration. The space’s investments in identifying and harvesting local tech
talent have created a diverse and skilled community. iHub fosters a number of start-ups and organizes vibrant
networking activities through meetings, events, and presentations to connect start-ups with each other as
well as with investors. iHub’s urban regeneration impact is evident in the transformation of the Bishop Magua
Center into the new heart of Nairobi’s tech ecosystem. When iHub was launched in 2010, the center consisted
predominantly of retail shops, but within a few years the building became a desirable location for techies. The
presence of iHub has attracted other tech spaces to the Bishop Magua Center (m:lab, Savannah Fund, the GSM
Association’s regional headquarters for East Africa, and more), catalyzing synergies and filling the building with
the elements essential to the tech ecosystem: collaboration spaces, start-ups, labs, incubators, accelerators,
tech firms, industry associations, and venture capitalists.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
iHub supported the Kids Comp Camp (http:/   /www.kidscompcamp.com), a project that helps young learners in
marginalized communities gain a competitive edge in today’s digital driven society. Enrollment in the project is
500 students; it covers 12 counties at the moment and the numbers keep growing. iHub gave Kids Comp Camp
the opportunity to collaborate with other start-ups based in the space and to benefit from those associations.
For example, LiveLuvo and Y-Kusudi have helped Kids Comp Camp grow their volunteer numbers and build
their profile.

30                                                           CREATIVE COMMUNITIY SPACES
BACKGROUND
NUMA, which started as the Silicon Sentier association, has constantly evolved over its lifetime. Silicon Sentier,
named after the Sentier neighborhood of Paris’ 2nd arrondissement, was launched in 2000 with subsidies from
the city of Paris and the surrounding region and with private donations from interested corporations. The asso-
ciation started transforming the existing garment district into a tech hub by renovating an old factory building
and turning it into one of the first coworking spaces in Europe. NUMA grew from a coworking space with a
living lab into a full-service creative community space. It added services and offerings when there was grass-
roots demand and then discontinued them when they were no longer needed or there were sufficient offe-
rings from third parties. NUMA has expanded to seven cities around the world (Barcelona, Bengaluru, Berlin,
Casablanca, Mexico City, Moscow, and New York). NUMA is an example of the organic development of a CCS
together with its community/ecosystem, which later moved beyond its natural ecosystem in Paris.


IN ESSENSE
NUMA promotes the idea that start-ups, corporate teams, small and medium enterprises, communities, and
public institutions can grow together and become mutually beneficial. NUMA offers assistance in organizing
conferences, roundtables, hackathons, and barcamps (open, participatory workshop events, primarily focused
on technology, where the content is provided by the participants). It also stages two- to five-day workshops
to help entrepreneurs learn about new working methods inspired by lean start-up, user-focused design and
design thinking to develop new services or improve existing ones through user research, rapid prototyping, and
testing. NUMA also provides a range of unique corporation-facing innovation services. Its “intrapreneur” su-
pport program stretches over several months to accelerate the development of new products. Currently, more
than half of NUMA’s budget is paid for by private sponsors, with the rest covered by revenue from projects and
innovation programs offered to corporations, events management, and a 5 percent equity in each start-up
accelerated.


IMPACT
In Paris, NUMA functions as a general space: It provides an array of services for entrepreneurs, start-ups, and
corporations and is open to participants from any industry. The space is characterized by its evident success
in building entrepreneurial communities. NUMA pioneered many of the innovation services available in Europe
and now has expanded to offering activities for big corporations. Being a catalyzer of a tech urban ecosystem,
NUMA has also influenced urban regeneration in Paris by transforming the declining garment district into the
city’s tech center. Created by entrepreneurs in 2000 as a digital cluster, NUMA (then the Silicon Sentier associa-
tion) jump-started the “digitalization” of the neighborhood by vocalizing and promoting the space’s activities.
By 2008, the space was actively building a wider community around it and opened the community space La
Cantine; three years later, NUMA began experimenting with new business models by launching one of the first
start-up accelerators. In 2013, NUMA changed location, moving its newly formed lab closer to the city center,
but the impact the space has had on the Sentier neighborhood is lasting: The neighborhood, full of start-ups,
VCs, and corporate tech labs, is already functioning as an independent urban tech ecosystem.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
NUMA offers its visitors access to the Open Innovation Studio, where companies have the opportunity to work
with NUMA’s entrepreneurs to identify new business opportunities and create a start-up to test innovative
products or services. Assisted by a product owner, a dream team of entrepreneurs (business, technical, and
design) will develop and test the solution until a product/market fit is found. Corporate teams are offered
the same benefits as start-ups accelerated by NUMA: work spaces, meeting experts, mentoring, and method
coaching sessions. NUMA’s team suggests that by departing from the usual working environment and thinking
outside of the box, teams work together more effectively on a new product launch.

BACKGROUND
Promálaga I+D is managed by Promálaga, the innovation agency of the city of Málaga. Promálaga focuses on
local economic development and innovation as well as social inclusion. Promálaga contributes to the research
and development of all areas of the technology business and industrial sector by providing office and lab space
for research and innovation. Promálaga specifically services the needs of entrepreneurs in new city develop-
ments with low-income populations. Such incubators are designed to enable business opportunities for the lo-
cal population while boosting the development and increasing the livelihoods of the neighborhood. Promálaga
has established a series of private and public partnerships across sectors to help advance its mission.


IN ESSENSE
Promálaga I+D is an incubator for industry start-ups, catering to digital manufacturing techniques, biosciences,
and other industrial sectors. Unlike traditional incubators and accelerators that provide office space for tech or
other white-collar-related office environments, Promálaga I+D offers industrial space. Located in an industry
park in the city outskirts, Promálaga I+D extends a combination of industrial and lab space with dock access to
start-up companies with various industrial needs. Promálaga I+D incorporates the business/industry license
for most industry activities (for instance, basic biotech can be conducted under Promálaga’s license, but more
hazardous activities, such as biohazard, are not included), as well as the utilities requirements of industrial
activities. Promálaga I+D offers common spaces and meeting rooms as well as shared facilities, including a
cafeteria and a gym, where entrepreneurs can meet frequently and out of which build a community.


IMPACT
Promálaga I+D contributes to entrepreneurial communities building while also, by virtue of its location in a ma-
jor industrial zone, connecting innovative entrepreneurs with the city’s industrial fabric. Promálaga I+D bolsters
the entrepreneurial community both by providing the needed services and advice to facilitate initiation and
implementation, and by hosting events aimed at promoting and developing activities leading to job creation
in the city’s socioeconomic environment. Collaboration and close transfer of knowledge is facilitated among
entrepreneurial community and traditional industry.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
Promálaga I+D hosts a broad range of companies operating in multiple sectors, including food production, deve-
lopment of technology for industry needs (for example, recycling batteries, lighting technologies), manufactu-
ring of goods and machinery (for example, surfboards, smart bicycles), and biosciences and labs (for example,
vet genetic lab). Begun in 2009, the start-up Badennova (http:/ /www.badennova.com) grew out of Promálaga
I+D. Badennova has developed a dynamic and smart speed bump that will only affect vehicles traveling above
a designated speed limit. The company patented the invention and produced its minimum viable prototype and
its more advanced prototype on the Promálaga I+D premises. Supported by Promálaga I+D, the start-up part-
nered with local universities and the national Center for the Development of Industrial Technology to continue
investigating and developing new systems of road safety.

BACKGROUND
Promálaga Urban Incubators are managed by Promálaga, the innovation agency of the city of Málaga. Promála-
ga’s goals are to generate local economic development and innovation as well as social inclusion. As part
of these goals, Promálaga designed an incubator to cater to the subsistence entrepreneurs (as opposed to
high-innovative or tech entrepreneurs, who tend to be opportunistic) in new city developments with low-in-
come populations. The goal of this new incubator concept was to develop business opportunities for the local
population while developing the social tissue of the new developments, reducing criminality, and increasing the
livelihoods of the neighborhoods.

IN ESSENSE
Promálaga Urban Incubators are placed in newly created neighborhoods specifically to speed up the opening of
the type of small retail businesses that help develop the social fabric of a neighborhood and the development
of organic communities (for example, grocery stores, bakeries, cleaners, neighborhood bars or cafés, hardware
stores, and so on). Promálaga Urban Incubators provide entrepreneurs with ready-to-use, street-level co-
mmercial spaces, varying in size from 15 to 25 square meters; each space includes the business license and
utilities. The incubators also provide mentoring and advice to the business founders. Promálaga Urban Incu-
bators are based in three locations.


IMPACT
Promálaga Urban Incubators have a clear urban impact: They catalyze the creation of the social tissue of new
development neighborhoods. These spaces accelerate the development of basic-needs retail businesses in
new development areas, compared to the organic creation of the business retail fabric. The incubator fosters
entrepreneurship in low-income populations; it provides mentorship and training to new business owners
while their business is in operation and offers social inclusion and business opportunities. Promálaga Urban
Incubators result in the faster creation of social tissue in new development areas, increasing the livability of
new areas and anchoring them as neighborhoods.

BACKGROUND
Steel House is a coworking space that aims to build a community of students, artists, and designers connecting
with and adapting to Rockland’s oldest commercial enterprise, fishing. The space’s coastal location has allowed
Steel House to prototype projects such as submersible ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). The space also per-
mits light industrial applications and flexible programming. The space derives revenue from a range of models:
The team offers individual memberships as well as consulting services and events assistance.


IN ESSENSE
Steel House positions itself as a collaborative work space, a design and prototyping studio, and an interdisci-
plinary cultural and educational environment. It has three major areas of focus: educational programs related to
design and technology, a collaborative maker space for members, and individual work spaces for start-ups and
small businesses. Steel House offers a residency program for artists, designers, technologists, and scientists.
The space invites young professionals to spend one to three months in their studio developing a self-initiated
project. The residents are invited to collaborate with other members and to use the equipment, and they are
asked to devote four hours per week to Steel House projects. Many activities at Steel House engage the city’s
younger population. For example, its internship program (open to local high school students and recent college
graduates) introduces young people to a range of disciplines, from industrial design to letterpress printmaking
and computer programming. The interns work side by side with Steel House members, gaining insights into
creative and professional practices. Another program, “Multimedia Storytelling,” is an after-school, hands-on
workshop that introduces students to multimedia production, script writing, camera operation, audio engi-
neering, and video editing, among other things.


IMPACT
Steel House is a general space that has an impact in the areas of entrepreneurial communities building and in-
dustry innovation. The space provides a wide range of services in design and engineering, but it also capitalizes
on Maine’s regional expertise by providing fishery-related trainings. The space’s regional focus and attention to
youth development have resulted in successful partnerships with the city’s public schools. Steel House’s model
of industry-specific services combined with training in other disciplines is what makes this business model
unique and more financially sustainable.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
The space interacts with both industry (fishing, in particular) and students to gain and impart digital skills.
Two projects showcase Steel House’s impact in these two communities:
Local Industry: The space is currently developing a series of submersible ROVs to be used in partnership with
local schools and science foundations. While there are many commercially available submersibles, Steel House
is interested in inspiring students to design, tinker, and build their own variations based on the space’s plat-
form. The student-designed ROVs will be used to explore the marine scene, ecology, and aquaculture in local
communities.
Local Students: Tech Club is a weekly gathering of students and adult mentors to explore topics in technology
and create technological solutions (both hardware and software) for a wide range of problems and challenges.
Past projects have included a machine to convert plastic pellets into 3-D printer filament, a device to alert a
homeowner when someone enters their driveway, and an algorithmic generator for mazes in a video game.

BACKGROUND
Fab Lab Lisbon belongs to the global network of more than 1,000 fab labs that spans close to 60 countries.
The network was created with the extensive support of academia as an outreach project of MIT’s Center for
Bits and Atoms. This space defines itself as a personal digital fabrication workshop for artists, scientists, en-
gineers, educators, students, amateurs, and other professionals of all ages. This CCS is managed entirely by
Lisbon’s City Hall Department of Economy and Innovation. The space uses a pure funding model: The team and
resources are subsidized from the municipality’s budget, which goes toward supplying equipment and mate-
rials and supporting other services. The municipality subsidizes Fab Lab Lisbon because it aims to empower
Lisbon’s creative economy by democratizing access to innovative fabrication tools and collaborative communi-
ty programs, connecting people, ideas, and resources to actualize ideas across industries. The idea of working
across industries has appealed to a number of private partners, who are extending their support and industrial
expertise in the form of equipment and mentorship.


IN ESSENSE
Fab Lab Lisbon is a coworking and community space that seeks to ally digital fabrication resources and crea-
tivity under one roof, serving as an open hub for experimentation and collaborative processes. It is a fab lab, a
hacker space, and a maker space; thus, it supports a large body of prototyping and designing across industries.
As a coworking and community space, it serves to connect people and ideas and democratize access to these
innovative fabrication tools. Fab Lab Lisbon offers a range of workshops; some of the most recurring ones are
on laser cutting, 3-D printing, and precision milling.



IMPACT
Fab Lab Lisbon has impacted the urban regeneration of the neighborhood in which it is located. It transformed
an abandoned rabbit slaughterhouse into an inspiring community design environment with free access to in-
novative and artisanal fabrication tools. Aside from the main fab lab, there is space designed for local carpen-
ters, furniture makers, and artisans to craft, produce, showcase, and promote their products. Through such
activities and its communal space, Fab Lab Lisbon serves as an anchor in urban regeneration, boosting the local
community and more specifically building an entrepreneurial community.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
Lisbão Sabão, a soap bar company, is one of the start-ups developed at Fab Lab Lisbon. Access to Lab Fab
Lisbon’s free-of-charge digital fabrication tools allowed Lisbão Sabão to experiment and prototype rapidly.
The space-sharing community provided continuous feedback, which led to quick and different iterations in
prototype development. The rented studio space was used to produce a small-scale production mold, with
Lisbão Sabão having the use of digital fabrication equipment that would have been otherwise inaccessible.
The product was pre-incubated and showcased at Fab Lab Lisbon’s community-based events, which enabled
feedback, media attention, and networking opportunities. In addition, Fab Lab Lisbon developed partnerships
with external entities to provide dedicated workshops and mentoring sessions to Lisbão Sabão, focused on
requested fields of interest such as branding and business model.

BACKGROUND
Harlem Biospace is a coworking space and incubator within the health and biotech sector that searches for
ways to reduce the barrier for turning biotech ideas into products. By offering access to a shared work space
and an equipped bio lab, Harlem Biospace helps innovators overcome the financial strain of expensive equip-
ment and New York City’s high rents. It is one of 25 incubators that have received funding from the New York
City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC).


IN ESSENSE
Harlem Biospace provides competitively selected, early stage life science companies (including those from lo-
cal research universities) access to industry-specific facilities and equipment. Unlike software research, biotech
research needs a wet lab (a lab where chemicals are handled in liquid or volatile states with direct ventilation
and special piped utilities), microbench space, and expensive specialized laboratory equipment. Harlem Bio-
space offers access to top-of-the-line equipment, including turnkey access to a cell-culture hood, incubators,
benchtop centrifuge, autoclave, chemical fume hood, microscopy, freezers, and fridge space. Harlem Biospace
members have unlimited 24/7 access to the physical space. As part of its role as an incubator space, Harlem
Biospace provides mentorship, business support, and programming expertise. It offers one-on-one mentor-
ship guidance with leading scientific mentors, investors, and practitioners. In its role as a coworking space,
Harlem Biospace creates opportunity for like-minded biotech entrepreneurs to share ideas and experiences.
Harlem Biospace tenders and hosts a series of events and classes on the business of biotech and launching a
small business, covering such topics as the utilization of technology, legal issues, and business pitching. This
CCS also hosts open events for the broader community on the future of biotech and other related issues.


IMPACT
Harlem Biospace is creating opportunities for innovation within the biotech sector. It helps in part by optimi-
zing the cost of testing ideas, providing start-ups with a scientific lab and its equipment at an affordable price.
In addition to having a space catered to industry-specific needs, Harlem Biospace offers general training and
business development ideas through access to biotech experts with strong business acumen. Harlem Bio-
space leverages the city-level ecosystem of medical and health institutions and affiliated universities. Mentor-
ship expertise from such institutions leads to an alignment of product development with local demand. These
different forms of engagement and alignments allow Harlem Biospace to contribute to the local health sector
innovation and be an active participant in the larger city-level biotech ecosystem. Harlem Biospace is located in
a rejuvenated building in an old industrial area in Harlem now undergoing a dramatic revitalization. It is serving
as a trigger for neighborhood transformation by providing a high-quality business infrastructure and creating a
new node for the city-level biotech ecosystem. The NYCEDC strongly supported and subsidized this incubator
on its launch precisely because it anticipated this impact on urban regeneration.


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
EpiBone (http://www.epibone.com) is a bone reconstruction venture that allows patients to “grow their own
bone.” EpiBone started at Harlem Biospace; eventually it received more than $5 million in funding and was
able to expand its team to 15. Harlem Biospace enabled the company to get started with just a small team
and without a need to invest in lab infrastructure. The company’s pioneering technology uses a scan of the
patient’s bone defect and the patient’s own stem cells to construct and cultivate a defect-specific autolo-
gous-like bone graft. EpiBone is strategically positioned to provide a superior bone graft that will provide an
exact defect repair, a simplified surgical procedure, improved bone formation and regeneration, and shorter
recovery times, without the complications of foreign body implantation, to the more than 900,000 patients
who undergo bone-related surgeries each year.

BACKGROUND
Union Kitchen is a DC-based large commercial kitchen and incubator space for food and beverage businesses
at all stages of growth. The founders established the kitchen after facing difficulties themselves in expand-
ing their own food business, given the high expenses of a commercial kitchen. Union Kitchen offers a shared
commercial kitchen at affordable rates for start-up companies while also providing a shared space for ideas to
be exchanged. Union Kitchen first opened a commercial kitchen facility in the NoMa neighborhood with 7,300
square feet of production space. It then opened a second facility in the Ivy City neighborhood (16,000 square
feet of production space) and broadened the model to include grocery outlets and a warehouse for distribution.


IN ESSENSE
As a food and beverage business incubator, Union Kitchen specifically aims to lower the barriers to entry and
growth for food businesses through its integrated model. In addition to offering subscription-based access to
kitchen space and utilities, they provide a full-time cleaning team, catering opportunities, distribution services,
and access to their own Union Kitchen Grocery retail outlets. These services allow food businesses to develop
the operations and distribution needed for them to grow, with all these services priced at a rate that allows
the businesses to attain financial stability and growth. Union Kitchen is very adaptive to the requirements of
incoming businesses: a large open space can be rearranged and set up to meet hosted businesses needs as
necessary. Union Kitchen provides its members with access to capital, employee resources, and discounted
production materials required for a food business to grow, in addition to a wide range of services vital for pro-
duction and distribution. Its members include businesses specializing in bakery and pastry, bar and cocktail,
bottled beverages, packaged goods, ready-to-eat, and health and dietary, among others.


IMPACT
Union Kitchen is distinguished by its membership structure, which builds a sense of community and account-
ability. Unlike commercial kitchens that charge by the hour, the membership model aims at fostering a strong
network of industry peers that can support one another. It builds an entrepreneurial community by allowing
food and beverage business members to gain a sense of familiarity and exchange ideas and inspirations with
one another within this shared space.

This CCS is able to help food-based businesses accelerate by providing access to capital, employee resources,
and other services, such as affordable kitchen space, supplies, and discounted production material. In addition,
Union Kitchen provides businesses hosted in this space access to its groceries stores and to an integrated
distribution system serving the metropolitan area. So far, its alumni have generated more than 400 jobs and
opened more than 70 storefronts (Union Kitchen press release).


IN PRACTICE
PROJECT IN FOCUS
Broodjes & Bier (http:/ /www.broodjesandbier.com) is a Dutch-inspired sandwich company. It started in a DC
bakery, but it proved extremely difficult for it to scale up there. Relocating to Union Kitchen allowed the compa-
ny to take advantage of the incubator’s commercial kitchen space and value add-ons. Union Kitchen’s handling
of a load of services—such as food safety management, cleaning services, and preventative maintenance—
and its provision of office space and business consultation, allowed the Broodjes & Bier team to focus on what
is most important to their business: their customers, their employees, and their product. Through Union Kitch-
en’s distribution and catering services, the growth of Broodjes & Bier quickly took off, quadrupling production.
