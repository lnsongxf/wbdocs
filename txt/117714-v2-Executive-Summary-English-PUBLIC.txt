                     Intermediate Cities in Bolivia: A priority agenda
Why are intermediate cities in Bolivia important?                  urbanization levels seen in other Latin American
                                                                   countries. Between 1950 and 2012, the urban population
Bolivia faces a unique opportunity to harness the                  grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent; today, nearly two
benefits of urbanization and avoid the pitfalls that               thirds of the Bolivians live in urban areas1. According

limited financial resources and capacity, they still have          to the national agenda of poverty reduction and
a manageable size. Their population sizes provide a                sustained growth in Bolivia. Due to the rapid pace of

national development goals, such as reducing the gap in
the provision of basic services or contributing to better
living conditions and avoiding possible negative effects
of unplanned urbanization.
This note analyzes the urbanization process in Bolivia,
proposes a new definition of intermediate cities,
evaluates challenges and opportunities common to
intermediate cities, and provides recommendations for
action.

  more than 10,000 inhabitants, sorted by size categories as described
  in Table 1.
