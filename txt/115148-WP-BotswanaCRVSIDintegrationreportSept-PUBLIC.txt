Executive Summary


T
       he initiative of a case study on Botswana’s successful integration of civil and
        identification registers comes against a backdrop of major continental and
        global efforts to accelerate improvement in the area of civil registration.
        In 2003, the Government of Botswana established an organic link between
birth registration, national registration, and death registration through a unique
identifier to ensure that birth registration becomes a credible foundation for iden-
tity management beyond just serving as a source of vital statistics and conferring
rights on individuals. The organic link extends to death registration that marks the
end of an identity. The National Identification System (NIS) is linked with other
government systems such as the elections system, the Social Benefits Registration
System (SOBERS), the government payroll, the transport system, and others to
facilitate service delivery because a person’s identity serves as a gateway for access-
ing services. In addition, through this link the National Identification System is
updated in real-time when a death occurs and the status of the registered citizen is
automatically changed from “live” to “deceased”, and this update is imported to all
other interfaced government systems in real-time.
        Civil registration is a credible source from which vital statistics in Botswana
can be generated and was used previously to generate population reports. These
reports have highlighted key policy issues and trends which go a long way in in-
forming evidence-based decision making. The progress made in ensuring that civil
registration is used to generate a vital statistics report, and is used along with house-
hold surveys and census reports, is a great achievement for the country.
        On the supply side, the capacity to effectively deliver registration services to
the population was improved. This extended to the development and maintenance
of the following: a sound registration infrastructure, such as the legal framework;
human infrastructure; an institutional frame work; effective management of the
identity life-cycle; and establishment of partnerships with internal government
stakeholders, development partners, and non-state actors for resource mobilization
and technical advice.
        Demand was stimulated through the National Universal Registration Cam-
paign in which a robust Information, Education, and Communication Strategy was
developed and implemented. It was delivered through the print media (newspaper

Background on Botswana – Social and Economic Context

Botswana is a landlocked country situated in Southern Africa. It shares borders with
South Africa in the south and southeast, Namibia in the northwest, and Zambia
and Zimbabwe in the northeast. Botswana has a surface area of 582,000 km2 with
the Kalahari Desert comprising more than two-thirds of the total area. About 87
percent of the population lives in the eastern part of Botswana where rainfall is more
regular, ground water is available, and the soil is relatively fertile. When it gained
independence in 1966, Botswana was one of the poorest countries in the world
with a per capita income estimated at less than US$100 per annum and a largely
rural economy that was dependent on agriculture. However, with the discovery of
minerals, especially diamonds, soon after independence, Botswana quickly became
the fastest growing economy in the world. Yet, while diamond mining contributes a
relatively large proportion to growth, gross domestic product (GDP), export shares,
and government revenues, its direct impact in terms of employment is quite small
because it is capital intensive by nature. Botswana’s stable democracy and prudent
economic management has facilitated strong investment in infrastructure, health,
and education, which has resulted in improvements in social indicators such as
literacy, health, life expectancy, and overall quality of health.



The Department of Civil and National Registration

The Department of Civil and National Registration (DCNR) is a government insti-
tution within the Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs (MLHA) in the Republic
of Botswana. It is statutorily headed by a National Registrar who is also the Admin-
istrative Director. The core mandate of the Department is the delivery of registra-
tion services for civil registration (CR) and identity management (ID-M) as well
as the registration and monitoring of societies. The DCNR has a staff complement
of four hundred and fifty-two (452) and has established registration offices outside

in various districts and sub-districts across the entire
country. To date there are a total of 37 stations and 13
electronic on-site registration offices at various health      Definitions and Importance of Civil
facilities across the country. The electronic on-site reg-     Registration, Vital Statistics, and Identity
istration initiative is planned for expansion to other         Management
health facilities over a period of time, if funds permit.
Therefore, decentralization is taken very seriously as         Civil registration is an administrative system that
services are brought very close to citizens.                   involves the continuous gathering of information on all

2          The Births and
           Deaths Registration
           Processes


T
       here are two processes to follow depending on whether the registration is
        on time (within 60 days of birth or 30 days of death) or is a late registration
        (60 days or more after birth).
        On time registration: Registration can be done either at the health facil-
ity where the event occurred or at the nearest DCNR office. For registration at
the health facility, health personnel record the birth by completing a birth/death
notification form immediately after the event occurs and then forwarding the
completed form to the relevant DCNR office for processing, either on-site at the
hospital within an hour of occurrence, or at a district or sub-district office within
a week. Once the forms are received at the DCNR office, they are entered into
the Births and Deaths Registration System, where registration is quality-checked
and authorized. At this point event registration is complete. The certificate is
delivered to the mother before she leaves the hospital, or in case of death, to the
next of kin or to private undertakers before the body leaves a hospital mortuary.
In cases where the form was submitted to offices outside the hospital, the regis-
tration is processed and authorized, and the death certificate is ready for print-
ing. In order to be able to pick up the death certificate, the next of kin is required
to produce a tear–off piece from the birth notification form that was acquired
at the time of the deceased’s birth, and also the next of kin’s own identity card
for identity confirmation, authentication and linkage to the national registration
database. In addition, the DCNR operates through each district and sub-district
monthly mobile registration services to remote and difficult to reach areas, and
other centers to conduct registrations of any non-institutional birth and death
events and to distribute certificates without the respective individuals having to
visit civil registry offices. Civil registration is undertaken free of charge. A late
registration fee of BWP 5 (US$0.50) is charged for every month of not registering
8           The Case Study of Botswana



up to a maximum of BWP 100 (US$ 10). For a du-
plicate certificate, BWP20 (US$2) is charged, while
for alterations the fee is BWP 10 (US$1). However,
in order to further improve access to the registration
service and to facilitate the registration of vulnerable
children, the Government made a decision in 2014 to
suspend all late registration fees from April 2014 to
March 2015, and to continue the suspension of fees
for the vulnerable population (destitute persons, or-
phans and vulnerable children) beyond March 2015.
In addition, another decision was made to relax re-
quirements for supporting documentation for regis-
tration of remote area dwellers. Instead, a local assess-
ment committee comprising of local leadership and
officials meets to orally hear such evidence and on the
basis of the minutes produced, an application for reg-
istration is completed and forwarded to the Registrar
for authorization and processing. As of June 2015,
laminating machines were acquired to specifically
laminate the births and deaths certificates issued to
those residing in remote and difficult to reach areas.
This was done for preservation purposes to assist peo-
ple living a more nomadic lifestyle.                        Sample birth certificate

Integration of Civil Registration and Identity Management

In 2003, the Government of Botswana established an organic link between birth
registration, national registration, and death registration through a unique iden-
tifier to ensure that birth registration becomes a credible foundation for identity
management beyond just serving as a source of vital statistics and to confer rights
on individuals. The organic link extends to death registration, which marks the end
of identity. In 2011, the birth certificate was made a compulsory requirement for
national registration and for acquisition at the age of 16 of a national identity card,
which is the same as the unique identification number (UID) issued at the time of
birth registration. This integration ensures effective management of a person’s iden-
tity life cycle from birth—“Identity Establishment”—throughout life, to death,
and then to “End of Identity.” “Establishment of identity” is thus done on the basis
of evidence of identity, such as timely birth registration or social footprints (school
certificates) when there have been late registrations in cases where births occurred
outside a health facility, while “end of identity” is carried out through death regis-
tration or emigration.
        The National Identification System is linked with other government systems
such as the electoral system, the Social Benefits Registration System (SOBERS), gov-
ernment payroll, the transport system, and others to facilitate service delivery because
an identity serves as a gateway for accessing services. Similarly, through this link, the
National Identification System is updated in real time whenever a death occurs and
the status of the registered citizen is automatically changed from “live” to “deceased”

4  Strategic
   Initiatives
Driving Accelerated
Improvement


I
  n order to accelerate the improvement of civil registration and vital statistics
   (CRVS) and identity management and to achieve their integration, a dou-
   ble-pronged strategy was implemented for the functions—development on the
supply side and motivation of the demand side.
        On the supply side, the capacity to effectively deliver registration services to
the clientele was improved. This extended to the development and maintenance
of the following: a sound registration infrastructure, such as the legal framework;
the human infrastructure; an institutional framework; effective management of the
identity life cycle; and the establishment of partnerships with internal government
stakeholders, development partners, and non-state actors for resource mobilization
and technical advice.
        Demand was stimulated through the National Universal Registration Cam-
paign in which a robust Information, Education, and Communication Strategy
was developed and implemented. It was delivered through print media (newspa-
per advertisements, flyers, posters, and so forth) and electronic media (radio and
television) as well as through targeted meetings with various leadership forums at
both the national and local levels. Members of the public were further targeted
through open Kgotla meetings at the village level and through “edutainment” ma-
terials packaged with key messages which were used in schools to target students.
The campaign informed the population on the value and importance of civil reg-
istration, vital statistics, and identity management. Both these supply and demand
initiatives are discussed below.

F
      or Botswana, civil registration and vital statistics and identity management
      benefits can be summarized as follows:

       Facilitation of individuals’ enjoyment of their rights to birth registration and
       other associated rights such as the right to a name, nationality, and the right
       to identity.
       A robust, safe, secure, and reliable identity management system and individ-
       ual identities
       The improved capacity to generate timely and accurate vital statistics data
       from a civil registration system for evidence-based decision making.



The Benefit of Protection of The Rights of Individuals

Civil registration provides documentary evidence, such as birth certificates, which
ultimately leads to the protection of individuals’ human and civil rights. The cur-
rent legal framework and its operation facilitates individuals being able to exercise
their right to timely birth registration under the Children’s Act, 2009, Chapter
28:01 section 12(2), which states that in order to ensure the enjoyment of nation-
ality, the parent or other person specified in the Births and Deaths Registration Act
shall give notice of the child’s birth to the Registrar of Births in such a manner as is
prescribed under that Act. Furthermore, the act is read in conjunction with other
laws and international instruments, such as the Births and Deaths Registration
Act, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Universal
Human Rights Declaration, which declares birth registration to be a human right,
and makes it compulsory. Therefore, although some percentage of people are still
not registered, the current 76.9 percent birth registration level underscores the fact
that by and large, individuals in the country have been able to exercise their right
to establish an identity.

Factors


T
       he nature of CRVS is that it requires long-range and sustained plans of ac-
         tion, requiring a legal and legislative framework that facilitates the growth
         and maintenance of the system. However, in many contexts, the efficiency
and effectiveness of CRVS is compromised by challenges relating to the adequacy
of legislation, the nature of the civil registration organization, the methods of co-
ordinating the different elements of the system, and the levels of priority given to
the entire enterprise by the government. Also, because CRVS requires long term
planning, there is usually a reluctance to invest in a long-range plan for the future
in favor of short-term action programs aimed at securing immediate results and sta-
tistical data. Thus, where adequate legal, administrative, and legislative frameworks
are not in place, conflicting legal interests, questions of competing jurisdictional
control, and other governmental programs claiming higher priority status have the
potential to limit the success and ability of CRVS systems to provide accurate and
timely information for development and administrative purposes.
        Problems relating to adequacy of legislation, the nature of the civil registra-
tion organization, methods of coordinating the different elements of the system,
and the priority given to CRVS are solvable without necessarily requiring signifi-
cant investment of resources. However, they are not necessarily easy to solve where
there are conflicting interests and inadequate legal and administrative frameworks
in place for implementation. In recognition of the importance of having a system
through which meaningful data could be collected at a national level and on a
continuous basis, Botswana passed legislation in 2003 mandating the registration
of all births and deaths, and making it mandatory for all citizens 16 years old and
above to obtain a national identity card. As a result, the increase in registration
has been almost universal, making Botswana a country that can be used as a good
benchmark on issues of civil and national registration and vital statistics systems.

7          Challenges


T
       he major drawback of the CR system is that since registration gathers a lot of
       data, there is always a concern that such information gives too much power
       to the state, and can be abused or used for purposes other than what it was
intended for, leading to violations of privacy and individual rights. Thus, despite
the utility and usefulness of the CR system, concerns about its abuse could make
it unacceptable.



Data Protection and Privacy Legislation

One key challenge is that identity management and CRVS are managed in the
absence of data protection and privacy legislation, yet the institutions involved are
primary processors of a person’s data. In the absence of such legislation, the proper
controlling of the keeping and the releasing of a person’s data can be a challenge.
While there are some secrecy and confidentiality sections in the current registration
legal framework, they are limited in scope. Privacy concerns can also appear as a
result of the linking of different systems.



The Department Is Not Mandated by Law to Register
Divorces, Resulting in a Gap in Vital Events Registration

The lack of laws that govern registration of divorces is a gap in the registration
of vital events. Divorces are registered by court offices under the High Court of
Botswana, and divorce registration records are not provided to the Department of
Civil and National Registration. Therefore no statistics are generated on the regis-
tered divorces in the country (UN, 2010).

8          Lessons Learned

Registration of vital events should be mandatory
The Registration of Birth and Death Act and the National Registration Act mandate
that the registration of births and deaths in Botswana be universal and compulsory
for all citizens. It is evident from the case study that to run and strengthen CRVS
under registration principles sanctioned by law, as outlined in United Nations Sta-
tistics Division (UNSD) recommendations, registration should be mandatory with
the goal of achieving full coverage. It should also be timely, continuous, and of a
permanent nature. It must ensure confidentiality if it is to be trusted by the populace.

Robust and comprehensive legal framework is critical
It is essential that there be robust and efficient legal frameworks for CRVS. In
the case of Botswana, the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Chapter 30:01),
the Children’s Act, the National Registration Act (Chapter 01:02), the Change of
Name Act, the Marriage Act, and the Married Persons Property Act provide some
of the legal framework enhancing registration of CRVS.

Having Civil Registration and Identity Management in the same agency or
ministry ensures integration and enhances the provision of public services
The issuance of the identity cards (Omang) and registration of vital events are done
by one Department, DCNR, thereby emphasizing the importance of one depart-
ment carrying out the registration mandate. As a consequence, this results in the
DCNR being a well-recognized and reputable institution with the mandate to reg-
ister all vital events, even if there are other institutions administering services asso-
ciated with the events. The Omang is a trusted tool used by citizens of Botswana
and is accepted widely to facilitate transactions across government and private insti-
tutions. Individuals use their Omang to access various public services their entitled
to such as health care, agricultural subsidy and other social safety net programs and
services. Further, the Omang is used by the Independent Electoral Commission to
validate the voters roll thereby curtailing the expensive ad hoc issuance of one-time
voter identity cards which is prevalent in other African countries.

      his impressive history of determined and consistent development of the sys-
      tem has built up a combination of strengths on which the next century of
      the system’s existence can operate and build.

      Botswana has a functioning civil registration system but the system does
      not translate into sufficient and reliable vital statistics. Statistics Botswana
      should work closely with the Department of Civil and National Registra-
      tion. The publication of Vital Statistics 2011 and 2012 is a welcome devel-
      opment even though they are not published until three years later. Another
      example of limited coordination is that the civil registration districts and the
      census districts are defined differently, which makes it difficult to compile
      and compare vital rates when the numerator is derived from civil registration
      but the denominator is population obtained from population censuses.
      The legal framework needs to be revisited, improved, and harmonized.
      The revised legal framework should do the following: (a) specify clearly the
      responsibilities of different agencies at different levels involved in the civil
      registration; (b) include the statistical function of the civil registration sys-
      tem; (c) state clearly what coordination mechanisms are needed for a smooth
      and efficient civil registration system; and (d) cover all vital events recom-
      mended by the United Nations, especially the ones omitted by many coun-
      tries such as fetal deaths and divorces.
      The issue of controlled data sharing and authentication, such as Data Protec-
      tion and Electronic Signature, should be enacted in legislation. Currently they
      are still at Bill Stages. The on-going project of People Hub, which would be a
      central data repository for authentication and validation of personal data going
      beyond government records to include the private sector, should be enhanced
      and sustained. Furthermore, this project is anticipated to enhance validation
      of identity using source data to reduce exposure to counterfeit documents.

       In summary, this case study shows that while there is still much work to be
done, the CRVS and ID-M systems in Botswana are robust and are providing sig-
nificant services to the people.
