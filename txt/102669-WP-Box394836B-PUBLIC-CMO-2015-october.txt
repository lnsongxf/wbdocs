     below the -0.5 anomaly for La Niña events. The threshold is further broken down into Weak (with a 0.5 to 0.9 SST anomaly), Moderate (1.0 to 1.4), Strong (1.5 to 1.9) and
     Very Strong (≥ 2.0) events. An event to be categorized in any of the above categories it must have equaled or exceeded the threshold for at least three consecutive 3-month

         will rebalance, and will depend on the pace of both

         slightly in 2016, averaging $51/bbl, assuming a steady

     Notes: n/a implies data not available. Industrial roundwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume underbark (i.e. exclusing bark), is an aggregate comprising sawlogs and
     veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood except wood fuel. Sawnwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume, includes wood that has been
     produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds 6mm in thickness.

T  he ﬁve-year decline in most commodity prices continued
in the third quarter of 2015 due to ample supplies and weak
demand. The decline was led by energy prices, which dropped
17 percent, partly on expectations of increased future exports
by Iran. A Special Focus section concludes that the impact
of an unusually strong El Niño weather episode this year is
unlikely to cause a spike in global agricultural commodity
prices, although local disruptions are possible. Separately,
this edition documents that Iran could ramp up oil production
following the lifting of sanctions and, over the long-term,
export a signiﬁcant volume of oil and natural gas if the
country attracts the necessary investment and technology to
leverage its substantial reserves.
