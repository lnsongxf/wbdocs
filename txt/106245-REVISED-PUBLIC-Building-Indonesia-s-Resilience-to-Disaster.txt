I.3. HISTORY OF FLOOD OCCURRENCE

Flood issue in Jakarta has been recognized since the city was first
developed by the Dutch Colony government in the 1619. During that
period, the Dutch government had designed network of canals to
reduce the risk of flood. Nevertheless, the worst flood recorded in
history still occurred during colonial period in 1621, 1654, 1976, and
1918 as described by the following figure.

                                                    There are multiple challenges on
                                                    managing this breadth of information

                                                    technical challenges such as data format,
                                                    accuracy, human resources, and policy.
                                                    A robust information system is the
                                                    core of a disaster management agency,
                                                    including the one in BPBD DKI Jakarta.
                                                    The information system is particularly
                                                    necessary for the decision maker to
                                                    make better decisions. There are two big
                                                    challenges that they often have; how to
                                                    collect the data and how to turn them
                                                    into useful information. These data are
                                                    normally located at different offices,
                                                    using different formats and need higher
                                                    authorization to retrieve them. Thus, it
                                                    would require a considerable amount of
                                                    time to collect them. Another potential
                                                    source of data comes from mass media
                                                    and social media channel, yet it still
                                                    requires additional steps to validate and
                                                    verify the accuracy of the information.
                                                    The second big challenge faced by Jakarta
                                                    is the availability of manpower to manage
                                                    the information. The effort to recruit
                                                    skilled information management person
                                                    often constrained by the availability of
                                                    the budget and the lengthy time required
                                                    for the whole process of civil servant’s
                                                    recruitment.

       10        Risk Information For Managing Urban Flood In Jakarta
University of Indonesia (UI) pioneered an
effort to map all of the RW (sub-village)
boundaries, critical infrastructures and
assets in 267 villages in DKI Jakarta
province.
The above activities (Figure 5: Jakarta
2012 RW Mapping Series of Events
(Chapman, 2012)) were conducted in
March-April 2012. It was a successful
event, where more than 500
representatives of Jakarta’s 267 villages
participated in the workshop and
managed to map around 6,000 buildings

and 2,688 RW boundaries (Chapman,                Mapping (OSM Indonesia)
2012). All of these data are inputted in
OpenStreetMap (OSM), a free and open
mapping platform. This choice of platform
enables future updates of the data by the
community as well as wider utilization
of the data in sectors beyond disaster
management.
There are multiple ways on how
these data can be used in disaster
management. Oneexample is how
the data is used to develop a detailed
scenario on estimation of future
flood impact. The scenario will assist
government and other stakeholders

The quest to produce more detailed
data, in this case RT level, continued in
2014-2015 through a series of event
namely Jakarta RT Mapping. The event
was led by BPBD DKI Jakarta with the
support from AIFDR, HOT and The World
Bank. 35 flood prone villages in Jakarta
were selected to be mapped down to RT
level. This project attempted to map RT
boundaries (sub-sub village), roads, and
critical infrastructures. RT level mapping
has also made capturing proposed
evacuation route and evacuation camp
that will be used during emergencies

V.3. USE OF THE SYSTEM FOR
OPERATIONS
The availability of accurate spatial data on
boundaries, contour delineation, flood
response assets and system for DaLA
calculator provides a comprehensive
basis to utilize the entire risk information
tools for operational purposes. Different
applications can take advantage of the
data and system already built to respond
to specific operational needs such as
functional analysis of the existing flood
control and mitigation system, or linking
flood event monitoring and reporting to
the citizen reporting application of the
Jakarta Smart City.
As an illustration of the application for
functional review of the flood mitigation
system, the city of Jakarta recently
completed a series of measures to
increase the capacity of the Ciliwung-
Gunung Sahari canal through dredging
and heightening of the embankment (see
Figure 15A). While essential construction
works have been completed, the canal
system still has gaps in several locations
due to the existence of permanent
infrastructure crisscrossing the canal such
as railroad and major roads that cannot
be easily modified (see Figure 15B).
Using a combination of various geospatial
data including: field survey of the gap

The purpose of this technical note on collaborative mapping is to serve as a reference and
guidance in applying collaborative mapping approach to support the land governance and
detailed spatial planning. Surveying and mapping activities are indispensable activities to
provide detailed geospatial information as a good foundation to develop diagnostics and
problem solving alternatives in multi-faceted urban development that deals with disaster
management, slum and poverty eradication. The strategies and techniques for coordinated
data compilation, validation and improvements involving government officers and community
representatives through collaborative mapping are presented in three different case studies in
post Merapi eruption rehabilitation, Winongo and Ampal river area redevelopment. Those three
case studies represent their own environmental problems due to either natural disaster (e.g.,
in case of Merapi) or climate driven flood inundation. The maps and geospatial information
produced are seen as unified base canvases for supporting detailed spatial planning.
The provision and quality evaluation of base maps in collaborative mapping process are
fundamental for accelerating geospatial data compilation and validation through participatory
interaction. The information derived can contribute towards integrated and comprehensive
spatial planning, disaster management, urban and rural land governance and development at
site and local level.
We hope that this technical note can be used as technical reference to many on-going national
initiatives toward one map policy implementation.
We would like to thank our local and national partners in Merapi area, Winongo and Ampal
Riverbank during the implementation of pilot projects, the showcases reported in this technical
note.

For that reason, in order to produce validated maps
and information, government maps and community-
based mapping needs to be integrated. This is
where collaborative mapping offers a solution to
fulfil the gap, as illustrated in Figure 2.

What is collaborative mapping activity?
Collaboration is a joint activity that involves multi parties in a mutual working group
that involves task sharing and synchronization that aims to achieve an ultimate goal. In
participation ladder perspective, collaboration is an activity that is one step ahead from
coordination and two steps ahead from cooperation. Collaborative mapping in this case
study is a kind of mash up that combine various resources into one final product which
is agreed map on disaster zone, sub village boundary, and buildings for spatial planning
purposes.

           One Map Policy at a Glance
           The One Map Policy term has been known since 2011 but the action has been slow. There
           is a new momentum following the July 2014 election of President Joko Widodo. One Map
           was first introduced under the President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono Administration and was
           included in the Law on Geospatial Information (Law No. 4/2011). President Joko Widodo
           identified One Map Policy as a priority after taking office and re-confirmed his commitment as
           part of his CoP21 speech. In February 2016, the President issued a Presidential Regulation
           (9/2016) mandating acceleration of the implementation of One Map Policy at 1:50,000
           of scale. Although not directly usable for collaborative mapping and detailed mapping at
           local level, this policy has been very positive to accelerate to the notion of one data for one
           development purpose. A working group lead by the Coordinating Ministry of Economics
           has been defining the scope of work for accelerating One Map Policy implementation that
           includes:


              •	 Compilation of thematic data collected from agencies and local
                 governments,
              •	 Verification of data for data integration
              •	 Synchronization within integrated data


           The Geospatial Information Agency (BIG) chairs the Implementation Team, facilitating
           reconciliation upon conflicting data that requires cross-agency coordination. Coordination
           means collecting base maps and networks of survey control point and integrating thematic
           land information from various sources. Currently the Ministries of Energy and Mineral
           Resources, Environment and Forestry, Agriculture, Marine and Fisheries, Public Works and
           Housing, and Transportation, as well as the National Land Agencies all have authority to make
           sectoral maps. Under One Map, these agencies will continue to produce, maintain and update
           their respective datasets, but will make them accessible through a geoportal managed by BIG.

II. Method
The chapter presents required survey and mapping activities including participatory mapping activities for
producing collaborative maps. One of essential items to be assessed is the availability of aerial imageries
to be used as a base imagery to plot and combine multi theme geospatial data matches with community
participatory data.

4. Spatial Analysis. The spatial analysis also
constitutes as an important work and also as
tool to engage stakeholders in building common
understanding about hazards, risk and risk
mitigation options. Several simple analyses to
assess the overlap between space occupation and
river buffer zone (as proxy to hazard boundary),
population density of neighborhood blocks,
evacuation route options, are among the examples
of outputs produced by the analysisoverlap

analysis.
The thematic maps produced in this project have
spatial accuracy that meets the Government’s
standard on provision of base map and the
indicators as stipulated by the National Mapping
Accuracy for the scale of 1:2,500.

     IV. 3. Risk-Sensitive Urban
     Planning of Ampal River,
     Balikpapan

     context
     Ampal River is one of the main rivers that flows
     through Balikpapan City, East Kalimantan.
     Areas surrounding the river is prone to floods
     and landslide due to excessive development in
     its upstream areas. A number of studies have
     demonstrated that changes in land use in the upper
     watershed areas of the river, from agricultural areas
     to settlement areas, have significantly reduced the
     water storage capacity of the land, thus increased
     the flooding intensity. A massive increase in the
     volume of surface runoff cannot be accommodated
     in Ampal River, which has already experienced
     severe siltation due to erosion at the upper stream.
     Increased concentration of suspended sediments
     has intensified from year to year and led to clogging
     in several points in Ampal River (Figure 20).
     Balikpapan City Government was committed to                                                                                                Figure 20

V. 2. 1. Calculating Building density

Building density in a segment can be calculated by comparing the total
area of built environments against the total area of a segment, seen as
follow:
                    total area of built environment
Buidling density=                                     x 100%
                         total segment area


Steps used to calculate building density are :
  a.	To select building using spatial query (Within)
     of QGIS spatial query.
  b.	To calculate building area.
  c.	To calculate segment/block area.
  d.	To calculate building density.

Density building is then visualized using heatmap
method with radius of determined circle is using
the value of individual building area. The results of
heatmap visualization of building density for each

V. 2. 3. Identifying the location
of waste water treatment
infrastructures
The main concern in all segments is that the use
of rain drainages is combined with waste water
networks. In addition to that, there are some Waste
Water Treatment Installation known as IPAL have
been built and installed in the field but failed to
beused. For this reason, waste water treatment
seem essential to be provided in each community
area. In this study, the location of IPAL is designed

     V. 2. 4. Identifying where to put hydrant
     Optimal hydrants are proposed based upon community inputs and
     geospatial analysis considering the density of the buildings and
     accessibility of the local roads in the study area. Optimum hydrant
     locations were assumed to have a location that no later than 30
     meters from the street. The hydrants should be able to reach all
     settlement blocks. The resulted analysis is shown in Figure 34.

     VI. Lesson Learned
     From the showcases on the development of collaborative maps (Chapter IV) and their usefulness the
     lessons learned on advantages and challenges of collaborative mapping projects can be identified. These
     lessons learnt are expected to create awareness and comprehension to assess opportunities in applying
     collaborative mapping projects for supporting detailed spatial planning and risk zonation for disaster
     management.

     A significant advantage of this approach is                                outcome of the collaborative mapping creates a
     that it offers lower budget and shorter time of                            better ownership to stakeholders involved in the
     actions than conventional mapping approaches.                              process. Through participatory mapping activities
     Government and local government mapping                                    at the community level and stakeholders meeting

                                  Community-driven development is an approach “… that gives control over planning
                                  decisions and investment resources to community groups and local governments.”
                                  Historically, programs using a CDD approach grew out of situations of crisis (financial
                                  shock, conflict, and even natural disasters) and were meant as transitional instruments for
                                  service delivery where governments (particularly newly installed administrations) lacked
                                  capacity to deliver services (Wong 2012). By optimizing the use of community actors, a
                                  CDD approach places less stress on government line agencies and at the same time is
                                  able to reach very large numbers of poor people. A CDD approach has traditionally been
                                  used by Social Funds, which are government agencies or programs that channel grants to
                                  communities for small-scale development projects. Social Funds typically finance a mixture
                                  of socioeconomic infrastructure (e.g., building or rehabilitating schools, water supply
                                  systems, and roads), productive investments (e.g., microfinance and income-generating
                                  projects), social services (e.g., supporting nutrition campaigns, literacy programs, youth
                                  training, and support to the elderly and disabled), or capacity-building programs (e.g.,
                                  training for civil and local governments) (World Bank 2009).

   PNPM Urban has evolved from poverty reduction-focused to improvement of basic infrastructure and services.
It is one of the largest CDD projects in the world, as stated in the “Indonesia: Evaluation of the Community Driven
Development Program”, 2013

  PNPM Urban itself was effective in 2007, scaling up from UPP. In the beginning, UPP covered only 5 provinces,
focusing in Java Island. PNPM Urban expanded the coverage of the program to 33 provinces.

    FOREWORD
    Indonesia is a disaster-prone country, especially
    to disasters linked to climate change. Cities in
    Indonesia are particularly vulnerable due to the
    complexity of the system, population density,
    utilities and infrastructure system. Consequently,
    there has been an attempt by the Government
    of Indonesia (GoI) to reduce disaster risk and
    to mainstream it into the national development
    planning.

    This publication is developed for urban spatial
    planners, policy makers and practitioners of
    urban disaster management in order to provide
    a basic understanding of the concepts and
    systematic steps that should be done to build a
    resilient city. Examples of relevant practices are
    provided on how the implementation of resilient
    cities takes place in Indonesia.

    The proposed concepts and actions are
    summarized from various sources of literature
    and experiences in Indonesia. This publication
    is not meant as a standard or a guideline for
    urban resilience planning, but it will give initial
    understanding to combine the concept of urban
    resilience into urban planning. On the other hand,
    the technical procedure of the implementation
    will require further exploration.

    In the first part, this work will discuss about
    the urbanization trend and its impact to urban
    vulnerability. It is followed with basic concept of
    urban resilience, the policy framework of urban
    resilience in Indonesia and indicative measures
    needed to strengthen the resilience of the city.
    It follows up with key phases to making cities
    resilient. The final section provides examples of
    related urban resilient practices.

1.1 Rapid Urbanization

       U     rbanization gains its momentum as
             early as the industrial revolution by
 the end of the eighteenth century, where real
 “urbanized societies” were developed. With
 technological invention that replaced hand tools
 with power-driven machines, agricultural societies
 gradually evolved into industrial societies, and
 a high proportion of the population began to
 inhabit the cities. The concentration of industry
 in large led to socio-economic transformation,
 where societies started to develop and segregated
 with specializations and skills. Along with this,
 institution of governments was formed to manage
 people and societies. This period was also defined
 by mass production, the rise of nation state, and
 modern medicine that increased dramatically the
 quality of human life.

 Ever since the industrial revolution, several
 categories of cities, such as small cities and
 medium sized cities have emerged. Now, the
 categories expand from small, medium, big,
 metropolitan and megacities. As cities grow, they
 offered more and bigger services, infrastructures,
 and opportunities for their inhabitants. However,
 along with the population increase, the population
 density also increases which often accompanied by
 a variety of risks such as fires, diseases, crimes,
 social conflicts and declining environment. Rapid
 urban development in hazard-prone areas also
 contributed to the creation of risks. This occurred
 due to partial development that is characterized
 by unequal access to infrastructures or public
 services and unavailability of urban space for the
 poor. Consequently, due to lack of option, poor
 households inhabit flood-prone river banks, steep
 slopes or areas with a high level of environmental
 degradation. In addition to the risk faced, these
 areas have little access to public infrastructure.
 Moreover, the vulnerability of poor households
 could be intensified by lack of access to social

     protection. This phenomenon is recognized in
     Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk
     Reduction 2015 which stated that “in many low and
     middle-income countries, urban development is
     characterized by highly unequal access to urban
     space, infrastructure, services and security”
     (UNISDR 2015).

     Economic growth, rapid technological advancement,
     the promise of prosperity and the current drive of
     globalization have further fostered the process of
     urbanization. In some countries, this process has
     given rise to megacities. Megacities have their own
     advantages and challenges. Mega-urban life offers
     various advantages such as improved economic
     opportunities, better quality of life, easier access
     to basic services, and a rich cultural life. However,
     with increasing social polarization induced by
     globalization, the proportion of marginalized
     population that is excluded from these benefits
     is growing within megacities. These poor people
     are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects
     of economic, social and political insecurity,
     exploitation, environmental pollution, natural
     hazards, health crises, and food insecurity.

            Indonesian cities are thriving rapidly during
             the past 15 years, with the development
     of 34 new cities as a result of district or town
     expansion, which in parthas been driven by the
     decentralization andregional autonomy policy. Data
     from the Ministry of Home Affairs suggest that in
     1999-2015, 529 new regions have been established,
     including 34 provinces, 402 districts and 93 cities .
     Concentration of urban population in Indonesia are
     mostly found in Java and Sumatra (Figure 1.4).

              IDEAS FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.
  According to UNISDR (2012), there are several
  significant drivers of urban resilience:

        Growing urban populations and increased
        density, which put pressure on land and
        services, increasing settlements in coastal
        lowlands, along unstable slopes and in
        hazard-prone areas.
        Concentration of resources and capacities
        at national level, with a lack of fiscal and
        human resources and capacities in local
        government, including unclear mandates
        for disaster risk reduction and response.
        Weak local governance and insufficient
        participation by local stakeholders in
        planning and urban management.
        Inadequate water resource management,
        drainage systems and solid waste
        management, causing health emergencies,
        floods and landslides.
        The decline of ecosystems, due to human
        activities such as road construction,
        pollution, wetland reclamation
        and unsustainable resource extraction, that
        threatens the ability to provide essential
        services such as flood regulation and
        protection.
        Decaying infrastructure and unsafe building
        stocks, this may lead to collapsed structures.

        Uncoordinated emergency services, which
        decreases the capacity for swift response
        and preparedness.

            Adverse effects of climate change that
            will likely increase or decrease extreme
            temperatures and precipitation, depending
            on localized conditions, with an impact
            on the frequency, intensity and location of
            floods and other climate-related disasters.

     Therefore, development should also be based
     on plans that meet the specific socioeconomic
     and geographic conditions of a place. The low
     income community in urban and rural area has
     different scales and types of vulnerability as well
     as poverty characteristic.The most significant
     challenges faced by the poor in urban areas
     relate to employment, housing and social welfare
     (Wisnetr et al 2004). In principle, local governments
     are responsible for providing basic services (i.e
     public housing, education, healthcare and social
     insurance) to reduce the vulnerabilities of low-
     income people. The quality of these services
     correlates closely with the level of vulnerability of
     the beneficiaries. The better the quality of public
     service, the beneficiaries become less vulnerable
     and will have higher probability to get out of the
     poverty.

     One of the underlying causes of urbanization is
     the motivation to seek a better livelihood and
     economic benefits in cities. In order to achieve this,
     people from rural areas migrate to the cities where
     economic opportunity is deemed to be better. In
     most cases, these job seekers migrate with limited
     financial ability and thus the migrants account for
     a large share of the urban poor in many cities.
     Due to their many limitations, their status can be
     translated as high vulnerability. Nonetheless, as
     migrants contribute significantly to the economic
     development of recipient cities, they are entitled to
     earn social protection from the government.In order
     to manage the negative impacts of urbanization, city
     governments have to work collaboratively with civil
     society and private sectors. Effective cooperation
     needs to be built with all stakeholders to make the
     city more resilient and robust in every aspect.

2.2 Basic Concepts of
Urban Resilience


      R    esilience is rooted in many disciplines,
           such as psychology, ecology and
engineering. It is used in many policy studies related
                                                         could be further augmented by the unpredictable
                                                         impacts of climate change. Consequently, a city
                                                         needs a resilience concept that goes beyond

on disaster and climate risks (e.g. their general
spatial distribution, and their potential relations
to the city’s growth pattern and trends). The rapid
risk diagnostics can utilize available tools to be
pin pointed such as: low resolution data or atlas,
records of event occurrences as remembered by the
residents or captured in the news, and information
on the city’s on-going and planned development
investment, specific geographic areas around
natural hazards and investment locations. It should
be follow by a more detailed and thorough risk
assessment in much smaller geographic areas.
Only at this stage, generating new and higher
resolution data will be more manageable and less
costly.

                      towards resilient city. The initial attention was
                      on environmental related issues (sanitation and
                      cleanliness), followed by health issues. Later, the

                      Since the 1980s Indonesia has implemented
                      programs that address various aspects of city
                      problems and challenges. In 1986 the Ministry
                      of Environment launched the Adipura Program,
                      which provides awards to cities and districts that
                      have been successful in maintaining cleanliness
                      and good environmental management. Aspects
                      that are assessed through this program include
                      waste management, tree cover, green open space,
                      and water and air pollution control. The program
                      evaluates both the physical and institutional-
                      management aspects of cities and districts. Since
                      2015 Adipura Program has also been geared
                      towards achieving sustainable city goals (Permen

     As an archipelagic country with more than 17,000
     islands and a coastline of more than 95,000 km,
     coastal cities in Indonesia faces the growing risks
     of sea level rise, salt-water intrusion of aquifers
     through storm surge and high land subsidence.
     The sea-level rise was projected to increase 35-40
     cm of sea surface relative to year 2000 (ACCRN,
     2016). Coastal inundation due to sea level rise
     has caused significant problems along coastal
     zones where about 50-60% of total population
     resides, which may cause displacement and
     internal migration. The inundation could impact           some cities have even been submerged completely.

3.1 Roadmap for Resilient
    Cities 2015-2025

      U     rban resilience helix (URH) is a concept for
            achieving urban resilience (Figure 4.1). It
consists of four phases of Urban Resilience Approachthat
offers key elements and steps that may be needed to build
resilience.Such a helix illustrates the sequential phases
to be followed up systematically and practiced to obtain
the sustainable city resilience through It provides options
for urban planners and city managers from hard (and
“shallow”) resilience intervention to soft (and “deep”)
intervention to build resilience. 	




  URH starts with risk assessment (Phase 1),Critical enabling
  capacity (Phase 2) , developingresilience measures (Phase
  3) and sustaining resilience infusion (Phase 4). Each of
  these phases is ellaborated into several steps as shown
  in Figure 4.1. An alternative of the comprehensive phases
  suggested above, a short cut (black arrow) from phase 1
  to phase 3 is possible considering the urgent needs of the
  community and areas to counteract imminent risks. This
  short cut can be done through rapid risk diagnostic tools

                                               KEY PHASES TO MAKE CITIES RESILIENT




Through governance, regulation and
institutions, any efforts on reducing
risk and such can actually have legal
power and authority. Under this
condition, disaster risk reduction can be
mainstreamed into planning procedures
for infrastructures projects as discussed
in Step 10 above.
        In addition, urban planning can
act as a tool for risk reduction given
that the basic philosophy is geared
into DRR by incorporating several
measures as follows: environmental
planning, defensible city, responsible
architecture     and    urban     disaster
governance (Wamsler, 2006). Urban
environmental planning in this case
means to inter-connect urban planning
and broader environmental aspects.
Defensible city means integrating
the concept of community protection
against natural disasters as a key
aspect of urban planning. Responsible
architecture aims to target informal
settlements and to combine large-
scale structural improvements with
participatory small-scale measures.
Urban disaster governance means
combining knowledge and management
of disasters and urban planning to create
joint governance practices.
        In general, the GoI have designed
the action plans for the National DRR
and CCA (known as RAN-API-PRB),
which acts as the guidelines for the local
governments to developed the local DRR
and CCA action plans (known as RAD-
API-PRB). For instance, the Kupang
municipality managed to develop the
RAD-API-PRB in 2015.

The following chapter elaborates some urban resilience
practices that have taken place in Indonesia. Some of these
case studies are initiated by previous World Bank projects.
The case studies are examples of how urban resilience have
occurred in Indonesia.

    Practices: Strengthening
    J akarta Risk Information to
    Flood




           A    s the capital of one of the world’s
                fastest growing economy, Jakarta
    holds a strategic role in Indonesia urban system.
    However, the city has been constantly dealing with
    flood since the colonial era. The underlying factors
    of Jakarta’s vulnerability to flood can be attributed
    to geographical conditions, infrastructure quality,
    environmental damage and partly to lack of people
    awareness to disaster. Around 40% or 24,000 ha of
    Jakarta area were located under the sea surface
    and they have been constantly pressured by the
    uncontrolled urban growth and lack of enforcement
    of groundwater extraction. In February 2007, floods
    accounted for over than IDR 5.16 Trillion of lost and
    damage and projected to increase to IDR 6.3 Trillion
    in 2013 (BPBD Provinsi DKI Jakarta, 2012).
    The World Bank/GFDRR with AIFDR, HOT and BNPB
    worked to support BPBD Jakarta in strengthening
    risk information urban flood management. The
    initiative was triggered by the launch of InaSAFE -

The data of detailed boundaries and assets exposure allows Jakarta to model damage and loss calculation

estimate financial damage and losses due to flood in no time. In the late 2015, the JakSAFE becomes part of

be considered as disaster mitigation strategy, which
should be internalized into decision-making system

     human waste into the river. Due to its condition,
     the neighborhood was targeted as one of urban
     development priority program in 2009.

     The program was known as Neighborhood
     Development (ND) program and aimed to alleviate
     poverty under the PNPM program for Human
     Settlement which led by Ministry of Public Work
     Directorate. The specific challenge of the program
     was to minimize the possible social conflict that
     might have arisen from rearranging of settlement
     in the riverside. The slum rearrangement aimed
     to reduce flood risk, which was achieved through
     river revitalization, waterfront neighborhood,
     infrastructure      enhancement      (wall     river
     strengthening), forestation, fencing and river walk
     built at both river sides.

In 2013, to overcome the problem volunteers
provided a technical assistance for upgrading the
neighborhood, which known as the Riverfront
Redevelopment Design Plan. The program aimed
at integrating economy-based environmental
program with the development of riverbank areas
that promote the public welfare and social equity,
while significantly reducing disaster and climate
risks.
The first stage of the program was facilitating
the communities to identify the potential local
resources and make the economic-environmental-
based riverbank development plan in the study
areas. Primary and secondary data were collected
from a variety of relevant sources. The next stage
was facilitating coordination among various
stakeholders such as governments, universities,
and private sector in the study areas in to be
involved in the development plan process.

The coordination of development plan resulted in
recommendations such as: (1) to utilize existing
well as water source, (2) training and shaping of
waste management groups, and (3) building a
temporary dumpster. From the local community
perspective, several inputs were added, which
were renovation of uninhabitable houses, making
of water hydrant and fire extinguishers, and fixing

     activities in water-based ecosystem and traditional
     Javanese children games. The initiative then
     followed up with hazard microzoning and pre-
     feasibility study (Fig. 5.4). The hazard microzoning
     included three key features of the areas, namely
     (i) geographical, socio-economical and structural
     profiles of the area such as land use parcels
     and static (ie. settlements, commerce, public
     utilities, open space, etc); (ii) key assets and basic
     infrastructures, and (iii) natural features (i.e. river,
     swamp, bushes, etc). This process was done to
     find local solutions to reduce disaster and climate
     risk. One output of the hazard microzoning was
     identifying structures that located within hazard
     zones, and also available land parcels for in situ
     location.
     The hazard microzoning and the pre-feasibility
     study identified several structural measures and
     environment revitalization that will help increase
     the sub-district resiliency. This multi-discipline
     analysis, involving a diverse group of experts
     from economists, environmentalist, hydrologists,
     and community development specialists, legal
     advocated as well as community representatives.

     and the government can manifest their vision of
     the river walk development.

            T   he government of Indonesia has been
                working on improving the quality of
     national development by creating a guideline of
                                                              high resolution of GIS map of the respective slum
                                                              areas. It is expected that through this program the
                                                              municipalities are able to develop the necessary
     DRR policy that put emphasis particularly for urban      measures of urban upgrading program that is
     areas. In a study of Indonesian Disaster Risk Index      based on the principles of DRR in slum areas.
     (IRBI) in 2013, the National Disaster Management
     Agency (BNPB) identified and mapped all the cities       From the above examples, it is obvious that
     and districts with high disaster risk. The results of    collaboration among institutions, that translated
     the mapping formalized into the National Medium          into implementation across sectoral, is a key factor
                                                              in achieving the GoI’s target to reduce disaster risk

     policies and action strategy of BNPB. The GoI
     targets to reduce the disaster risk index by 30% in
     136 cities and districts identified as having priority
     or high risk by 2019.

     This effort requires BNPB to collaborate closely
     with related institutions in charge. For example,
     the program Safe School that required facilitation
     of of the World Bank and active collaboration
     between BNPB and the Ministry of Education and
     Culture. One of the outputs of this collaboration is
     a guideline for structural reinforcement of school
     buildings in landslide prone areas, which has been
     implemented in several elementary schools in
     West Java.

     Another program is the National Slum Upgrading
     Program which was done under collaboration
     between BNPB and the Ministry of Public Works
     and Housing which targets to organize the slum
     areas in 20 cities in Indonesia. The program was
     designed to improve the city resilience through
     reducing the vulnerability of the poor people.
     Until this paper is written, the World Bank is
     assisting the municipalities to redesign the slum
     area with DRR based approach by providing a

follows:
           inally the some of the highlights from
           key lessons to urban resilience are as



	        Mainstreaming resilience concept into
urban development should be first done towards
the policies and regulation that would govern
the subsequent steps, be it action plan, financial
budgeting, spatial planning or implementation
programs. Once resilience principles have been
embedded into the law and regulations, resilience
principles can be enforced or at least encouraged
in the urban development programs.
	        To      increase    resilience,    urban
development should aim its priority towards the
most vulnerable group that could be easily found
in slum area. For example is the slum upgrading
program in Yogyakarta, which aimed to construct
embankments along the river in Karang Waru that
is mainly inhabited by poor people. Through this
program, the local community had healthier living
environment and was protected from flood risk.
	        Coastal cities should put extra effort
in increasing the urban resilience, particularly
due to their vulnerability towards sea level rise,
in addition to other disasters such as flood and
tsunami.
	        Community participation is crucial is
assuring not only the success of any program
but also the sustainability of the program; in
addition, community participation put the involved
stakeholders in the same perspective and increase
the community capacity and preparedness (e.g
Kampung Siaga Bencana program)
	        Integrating risk financing in order to
achieve more robust DRR and CCA program
and efficient budgeting; this could be done by
coordinating program across institutional agencies
in the government or even involving the potential
private sectors.

a Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK)         responsibility of the sub-national

issuing this PMK was the Government            of provincial and local governments,
Regulation 2/2012 on Regional Grants,          in practice local budgets are still not
and the State Budget Law Year 2015             made available. As Law No. 24 of 2007,

 Box 1. Multi-Year Funding Challenge
       Problems related to multi years occur during the usage of the fund for rehabilitation and
 reconstruction as the usage cannot extend the relevant fiscal year so that its execution must
 be halted. Even if it can be extended by 2 years as set in BPNB Regulation No. 14 year 2011 on
 Technical Guidance on the procedure for filing and managing Social Aid Fund in form of grant
 for Post-Disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction year 2011 and the Regulation of Director
 General of Treasury, Ministry of Finance No. Per-63/Pb/2011 dated on 29 September 2011
 on the Procedure of Post-Disaster Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Fund Disbursement year
 2011. Nonetheless, the implementation still experienced a delay in its completion, as was the
 case with the rehabilitation and reconstruction after the 2010 earthquake in Mentawai Islands
 which had to refund as much as Rp. 383 billion to the State Treasury in 2013 of the total
 received fund amounted to Rp 486.4 billion.
      This also happened to the eruption of Merapi in 2010, Yogyakarta Province and Sleman
 Regency respectively had to refund Rp 15 billion of the total fund received amounting to Rp
 110 billion and Rp 72.67 billion of total received fund amounted to Rp 189 billion, and the
 Flood in Wasior had to refund as much as Rp 42 billion of Rp 83 billion received fund.

    Currently, the disaster financing in           International experiences from the
    Indonesia is still handled case by case        countries that have high levels of economic
    and not as a Portfolio and has yet to be       development and disaster risk profiles

                                                   budget allocation is no longer sufficient.

                                                   by itself will increase and create new risks.
                                                   Therefore, it is the time for Indonesia to
                                                   implement Risk Layering concept as part of

Typology of Disaster Impacts in Yogyakarta and Central Java


Overview
Indonesia is one of the most disaster-prone
countries in the world. The Indonesian
archipelago - recognized to be one of the
largest in the world - has more than 13,000
islands out of which 6,000 are inhabited.
Situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire and at the
meeting of the active Indo-Australian plate
in the South, the Eurasian plate in the North
and the Pacific plate in the East, the country is
highly exposed to numerous different hazards
and vulnerabilities and have differing levels
of disaster response capacity and ability to
manage the consequences of crises1.

Kopeng       8.9 ha   Thai Papaya and Jeunjing/sea sengon were planted using alternate rows system
                      with a spacing of 3x3 m. Under the Sea Sengon and Papaya, seasonal crops such
                      as beans, chili or grass to feed livestock were planted. Those plants also had a
                      function to strengthen the terraces. Terraces were also interspersed with fruit
                      trees such as banana, jackfruit, avocado and durian. Selection of vegetation was
                      done by discussion. Sea Sengon was chosen because the farmers knew these
                      plants well. As for papaya, it was because the market was wide open and this plant
                      might grow well in this environment.
Petung       1.3 ha   Mixed garden was designed to become a stand with a storied header of forestry
                      vegeations at the top of the canopy and plantation crops and vegetables at the
                      top of the canopy. The plants were jackfruit, mango, banana, papaya, avocado and
                      nutmeg. Sweet potatoes and cassava were also planted.
Batur        1.4 ha   Being a land in ATL I, restoration of soil structure was the first action to perform in
                      restoring an ecosystem, namely by strengthening the terraces and creating land
                      boundaries using Lamtoro plant, then providing input in forms of soil and organic
                      materials which allowed plants to grow optimally. Riverbanks and inter-land ter-
                      races were planted with Lamtoro and Gamal to strengthen the slopes and terraces
                      by utilizing the roots ability to bind the soil. Planting vegetation also aimed to
                      restore humus through fallen leaves to improve availability of nutrients in the soil
Jambu        1.7 ha   Rehabilitation of soil condition by stabilizing soil which was exposed to rain or its
                      flow and increasing organic material from the fallen leaves. Lamtoro and Gamal
                      were planted on the inter-field boundaries. Papaya plants were combined with
                      Jeunjing (Seas Sengon) and coconut trees with a spacing of 3x3m and 2x3m.
                      Water tank was made to anticipate dry season.
Palemsari    2.5 ha   The program was conducted also to support the tourism village program and to
                      provide an example of land optimization for community economic empower-
                      ment. The implemented pattern was enrichment with new plants to enrich the
                      composition of existing plants. The implemented pattern was along-the-boundary
                      vegetation and enrichment plants with a space of 3x3 m and adapted to the land.
                      Terrace-strengthening plants other than grass as well as acacia, were used as fuel
                      and also batik Soga dye.

Key Messages to Successful
Resettlement
Community revitalization with a community-
based approach can be done successfully
without significant social upheaval and the
high occupancy rate could be achieved due to
some important factors. The key factors were
as follows:

•	 The certainty of land availability for relocation
   to the people and the status of the land -
   including the status of the abandoned land,
   and access to livelihoods in the new area.
•	 The capacity of the government to
   implement the relocation program including
   coordinating the existing supporting
   resources.
•	 The availability of the supporting systems,
   the qualification of the facilitators, and a
   system that could develop the capacity of the
   direct assistance.
•	 The availability of stimulus funding from
   the government as core funding for the
   relocation activities.

         54% of the province’s GDP. Likewise, the to significant and consistent ranking in
