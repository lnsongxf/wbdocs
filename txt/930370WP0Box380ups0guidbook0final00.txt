    Introduction
    In little more than a decade, formal angel investing organizations have shifted
    from being mostly a U.S. and European phenomenon to being active and visible
    around the world. From Colombia to Cambodia, Serbia to South Africa, angel
    investors build networks from scratch and put their own local spin on how these
    networks are founded, structured, and operated. Most impressively, these angel
    groups enjoy successes in very challenging environments; many do so with little
    or no guidance or best practices to follow. However, for every successful angel
    group founder there are many more potential founders looking for a place to start.
    This guidebook aims to support such individuals and newly formed angel groups
    by presenting global best practices and tools and templates for facilitating group
    operations.

    Launching an angel network is challenging in any environment. Doing so in a country
    with limited deal ﬂow, weak institutions, and limited investor protection can seem nearly
    impossible. To confuse matters even more, there is no one-size-ﬁts-all solution to set up
    and operate an angel organization. A diversity of models and structures has been successful
    worldwide. Given this context, this guidebook cannot prescribe a simple formula to set
    up and run your angel network. Instead, it will help you navigate the decision-making
    process at various stages, and give you real-world examples of how other networks have
    worked through difﬁcult problems. Additionally, for those of you in countries where angel
    organizations do not yet exist, this guide will offer words of wisdom and encouragement from
    those who have blazed a trail in their own countries.

    This manual is built from the Kauffman Foundation’s 2004 publication, A Guidebook to
    Developing the Right Angel Organization for Your Community, which was crafted for a U.S.
    audience. Many of the decision steps to create an angel network are the same, no matter
    if you are in the U.S., South East Asia, or Sub-Saharan Africa. Much of the guidance holds
    true in 2014 as it did in 2004. However, this international edition recognizes the additional
    challenges that angels face outside the U.S., particularly in emerging economies, and teases
    out those problems and offers potential solutions. Also, globalization and the fast pace of
    technology have resulted in important new trends in angel investing since 2004. This edition
    will explore how the internet and networking platforms have helped international angels
    connect in new ways and overcome a host of obstacles. It will also touch upon topics such as
    crowdfunding and diaspora investing.

    After you have gone through the community assessment, questions, and options outlined in
    this guidebook and have decided how your organization will look and operate, you may arrive
    at a completely new model that is not presented in this manual. What is most important
    is that your membership is comfortable with the result, and that the group is willing to
    adjust the model, goals, and orientation as it grows and gains experience. Given its broad
    geographic scope, this guidebook cannot provide speciﬁc guidance for every region and
    country. Be sure to consult your local legal experts, accountants, and other relevant actors to
    identify regulations that may inﬂuence your group’s structure and day-to-day operations.

             Background




                                                                                             BACKGROUND
             What is angel investing?
             There is no universal deﬁnition of angel investing, but it is
             generally understood as the practice of high-net worth individuals
             investing their own time and money in new businesses with the
             goal of proﬁting from their long-term growth. Such investments
             are characterized by very high levels of risk as most companies
             are in the earliest stages and will likely fail. Angel investors are
             different from venture capitalists (VCs) in that VCs invest other
             people’s money. Motivations are another important distinction
             between the two; angels are typically interested in more than
             just receiving a ﬁnancial return. Personal interest, the desire
             to give back, and the thrill of being involved with an innovative
             company are just a few of the reasons why people decide to
             become angel investors.

             The practice of wealthy individuals and groups investing in entrepreneurs
             has existed for centuries and across many cultures. In some traditions,
             wealthy family members, friends, and/or community members provide
             ﬁnancial support for business ventures, some with expectations of a
             return on investment or sharing of proﬁts. This is different from most
             western deﬁnitions of angel investing, today, which describe angels
             as having no meaningful relationship to the entrepreneur prior to
             investment. Friends and family generally provide the ﬁrst round of
             funding to help an entrepreneur get started, and angels step in when the
             business needs another injection of capital to develop and grow. That is
             why angels are often associated with high-growth companies.



             Who are angel investors?
             Typically, angels are high-net worth individuals with considerable
             business experience. Of course, “high-net worth” is a relative term that
             varies from country to country. In the United States, Canada, and the UK
             most angels have “accredited investor” status as deﬁned by law (see text
             box on page 8 for details), although this is usually self-certiﬁed. Most
             countries, however, do not have such criteria for angel investors. The
             majority of high-net worth individuals in developing countries tend to
             invest locally, most commonly in real estate, agriculture, minerals or
             other natural resource extraction, and they tend to ﬁnd opportunities

    United Kingdom6
    The United Kingdom has a slightly
    different system in which investors in
    unlisted companies are classified as “High
    Net Worth Individuals” or “Sophisticated
    Investors.” A High Net Worth Individual
    is defined as a person who has “£100,000
    a year or more in income or £250,000
    or more in relevant net assets.” There
    are no stated income requirements for
    Sophisticated Investors, but individuals
    must be “a member of a network or
    syndicate of business angels” or “have
    made more than one investment in an
    unlisted company” in the past two years.

     How much do angel groups invest, and in how many companies?
     This is difficult to track, although some angel networks attempt to do so by polling members.
     Research from Australia, Europe, New Zealand, and the U.S. shows that in 2009, each angel
     group invested in 5 to 20 companies per year.7 Established angel groups in the U.S. make,
     on average, 7.3 investments annually.8 Newer groups may do fewer deals or none at all,
     until they establish reliable deal-sourcing networks. Information on deal size is even more
     limited, although data on the U.S. market is available through the Angel Resource Institute
     and the Center for Venture Research. In 2012, most deals (67 percent) ranged from $150,000
     to $500,000,9 with an average deal size of $341,800.10 Keep in mind that deal sizes vary from
     country to country based on start-up needs and local costs.


     In what industries do they invest?
     Angels typically invest in a wider range of sectors than VCs, not necessarily limited
     to technology intensive companies.11 Research from Australia, Canada, Europe, New
     Zealand, and the United States highlights the popularity of investments in information and
     communication technology (ICT) start-ups, which account for anywhere between 20 to 50
     percent of all deals.12 This is due to the attractiveness of such deals: relatively low capital
     investments and high profit margins, which result in higher potential returns on equity.
     Investments in biotech and health companies are also common (roughly 20 to 30 percent
     of deals), as well as investments in clean tech, manufacturing, and finance.13 The angels
     interviewed for this manual invest in similar industries, but also diversify into other areas
     such as tourism, agriculture, and social marketing. Many cashed-out entrepreneurs who
     became angels expressed enthusiasm to invest in industries such as ICT and clean tech,
     but commented on the low number of good deals in developing markets, leading them to
     explore other options.


     What follow-on funding options exist?
     In developed markets, venture capital firms (VCs) provide subsequent rounds of funding to
     certain companies so that they can continue to grow and eventually be acquired. A lack of
     VCs in a country should not stop an angel group from kick starting operations, as there is
     evidence that companies can be quite successful without them. A recent report showed that
     of the tech companies acquired in 2012, 76 percent had bootstrapped or only used angel
     financing.14 If it is likely that your group will be responsible for additional rounds, prepare
     for this scenario by setting aside funds in advance. If this is not possible, there might be
     chances of cross-border investments from internationally based VCs or angel groups.

     What are the common problems facing angel investors?
     Angel investing is a high-risk endeavor no matter where you are in the world. However,
     certain risks are more prevalent in some countries than in others. According to recent
     research on angel investing in four Asian emerging markets, angels “face relatively more
     challenges compared to business angels investing within developing economies.”19 Angels
     interviewed for this manual agreed, and highlighted the following specific environmental
     factors:

      mm   Lack of awareness among angels and entrepreneurs of angel investing and that it is a
           hands-on process
      mm   Weak entrepreneurial ecosystems that fail to produce and support innovative start-ups
      mm   Lack of successful and visible angel investing models to follow in most countries
      mm   Lack of trust among angels and/or between angels and entrepreneurs
      mm   Lack of industry expertise/mentors to help start-ups improve business models, connect
           with markets and grow
      mm   Weak regulatory frameworks that may discourage, or at least fail to encourage, angel
           investment and/or the creation of start-ups
      mm   Lack of educational resources for new angels to learn best practices and technical
           aspects of investing in high-growth companies
      mm   Fear of loss of capital and “face” in this risky asset class.

     Getting started:
     community assessment
     The ﬁrst step in laying the groundwork for your angel group is to understand your
     local entrepreneurial ecosystem. This section walks you through a community
     assessment to help you understand the nature of your investment community,
     potential group members, and the particular risks that could threaten group
     sustainability. Try to be as objective as possible when conducting the assessment
     as it will help you understand the community limitations or market factors that
     could hamper your attempts to establish a vibrant angel group. The following
     diagram illustrates the categories included in this assessment. Keep in mind that
     no single community will have all attributes that support an angel organization.
     The most valuable part of this exercise is to identify community strengths and
     weaknesses when considering the viability of a potential angel group. You may
     ﬁnd that although important attributes are missing, your community is strong in
     other areas or has the means to develop those missing aspects.

A great way to start your community assessment is by looking at the human talent and
potential investment capacity of the individuals in your ecosystem. Here are a few questions
to ask:

 m   Is there a champion to lead the foundation of the group?
 m   Does your community have several wealthy individuals,                    Champion/s: A key factor in the

 m   Personal networks: The overwhelming majority of angels
                                                                              community to attract other investors

     networks to ﬁnd and assess potential new members. Most
     champions were highly connected in their local communities,
     leveraged networks with business schools and universities,
     or made signiﬁcant efforts to expand ties among local
     businesses and in organizations such as chambers of commerce.
 m   Entrepreneurial organizations: The organizations in your community dedicated to
     cultivating entrepreneurs, such as incubators, accelerators, and entrepreneurial
     education centers, will likely have contacts with investors. Staff from these
     organizations can direct you to individual angel investors who may be interested in
     joining an angel group.
 m   Review census reports, home values, and number of successful industries: While this
     data may not be available in every country or city, it can be tremendously useful where it
     is available. This data can help you estimate the number of high-net worth individuals in
     your community and compare your community to neighboring cities and regions. It can
     also reveal trends and the stability in your region’s wealthy population.

Some problems you may encounter
Many angel group founders said that identifying wealthy individuals is usually less
challenging than ﬁnding investors who understand the angel investing process. This is to
be expected. As mentioned before, most investors are not used to such a risky asset class.
Here are some common problems that you may discover as you conduct your assessment of
potential angels in your community:

 m   Lack of awareness that angel investing is an active process: When recruiting new
     angels to a group, experienced angels have found that newcomers expect to be passive




Getting started: community assessment                                                                                15
           in the angel process, while the best practice is to be active. They are not used to
           participating in deal screening, undertaking due diligence and direct mentoring with
           investees, as they are more familiar with traditional investment approaches.
      mm   Low risk tolerance: Angel investing is a high-risk practice, especially when the
           potential investee is only at the idea stage, but risk tolerance is low among angels
           in many parts of the world. When there is no precedent in a country and no success
           stories to point to, it can be difficult for investors to envisage success. New members
           can be scared off by early failures.
      mm   Expectations for fast returns: Investors used to less risky investments that produce
           quick returns, such as land or real estate, will have to recalibrate expectations when
           becoming angel investors. Most angels in developed countries do not see returns for six
           to eight years, and in some markets it could take up to ten years to exit.
      mm   Unfamiliarity with industries/business models: Many investors are used to investing
           in real estate or agriculture, but an important segment of new high-growth companies
           emerging from incubators and accelerators are in knowledge intensive industries. A
           recent World Bank study found that the number of angels familiar with the business
           models prevailing in these industries is still relatively small, and as a result, business
           angels’ investments in the ICT/ICTE sector remains at low levels.20 This mismatch
           between angels and entrepreneurs is one reason why angels do not invest more.
      mm   Lack of trust: Joining an angel group may mean expanding your professional circle,
           revealing information about your financial assets and investment approach, and
           potentially revealing your lack of expertise and knowledge in some areas. In many
           cultures, this degree of openness is not an integral part of the mainstream business
           culture.
      mm   Not wanting to be visible: Angels are typically private about their investments, and
           can seem “invisible” to entrepreneurs. This hinders the match making process when
           entrepreneurs do not know how to connect with investors that could be interested in his
           or her company.


     Recommendations
     If your assessment reveals weaknesses in your potential angel community, keep the
     following in mind:

      mm   Training for angels and angel group managers: You may have to invest time in
           educating potential angels on the process and fielding their questions. Several group
           founders have commented that they started by simply talking to people and inviting
           them to pitch events or introducing them to entrepreneurs. As you demystify the angel
           process for potential members, you will start to see who is comfortable with trying
           something new and/or has a personal interest in supporting young startups. It may take
           several months or more than a year of dedicated networking and engaging potential
           angels before you find the right people, but this approach has worked for many angel
           founders, especially in countries where no angel groups previously existed.

           You should also know that once angels have joined your group, education should be
           an ongoing process. Most angel groups, even established groups in the U.S., Canada,
           and Europe, provide additional training for group members on a variety of topics. The

 mm   Tap into diaspora networks: Many diaspora communities already support family and
      friends in their home countries. Being part of an angel group is just one more way
      to stay connected. In addition to providing capital, diaspora members may be more
      familiar with angel investing practices and can contribute expertise and international
      networks. While angels have traditionally invested in their local communities, cross-
      border investing is a possibility when the long-distance investor trusts a person, group,
      or entity to provide local oversight and regular updates.
 mm   Start small: It is sensible and quite common to start a network with a small group of
      dedicated individuals. If your assessment reveals that only three or four people have
      what it takes to become potential members, do not hold back. Many groups have started
      small and grown organically as other angels in the community become interested.
 mm   Visibility is important: Angels are an important component of the entrepreneurial
      ecosystem. All parties benefit when entrepreneurs and advisers can interact with and
      get to know angels and learn what they are looking for in start-ups. They can also
      deepen their understanding of the angel investing process; and how angels can support
      their business through networks and industry knowledge.
 mm   Addressing trust issues: For angel groups to be successful, members need to develop
      a level of trust regardless of the business culture, however slowly that may happen.
      Spending time getting to know other angels and entrepreneurs one-on-one can help
      break down mistrust and fear. Spend time educating potential group members on
      angel investing, and allow them to attend angel group meetings to observe the process.
      Introduce potential angels to entrepreneurs and showcase success stories. Encourage
      angels to ease into the role by mentoring entrepreneurs, or even offering mentorship in
      return for a small equity stake—an option explained in more detail on page 66. Before
      making investments, talk through potential problems that may arise and agree on
      how each party should handle a situation. This tactic has helped build trust among
      co-investors and between angels and entrepreneurs in environments where this type of
      investing is new and legal institutions are weak.



Assessing the entrepreneurial pool
An active entrepreneurial pool is essential to sustain any angel network. In this part of
the assessment, try to identify potential and existing entrepreneurial companies in your
community. Here are some questions to orient your research:

 mm   Do you have a number of young companies starting up in your area? From the pool of
      start-ups, do you think your group can find at least three or four investible companies a
      year to get started?
 mm   Is your community considered attractive to entrepreneurs?
 mm   Does your community have centers of higher education, particularly with graduate
      programs in the areas of business, engineering, or science?
 mm   Does your community have research centers?

                       m   Does your community have growing business activity around which young ﬁrms are
                           being or can be formed? This could be anything from a major public or private sector
                           project, or simply a growing population in need of products and services.


                      Assessment approach and tools
                       m   Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM): Launched in 1999, this report provides
                           information on entrepreneurial activity in 70 economies, representing all regions of
                           the world. It captures entrepreneurial attitudes, such as perceptions of opportunities,
                           capabilities, and fears of failure, and can give you a high-level view of the strengths and
                           weaknesses in your country’s entrepreneurial pool.
                       m   Universities and colleges: Contact these education institutions to learn about their work
                           with new products and services, which are often found in areas of applied research.
                       m   Incubators and accelerators: Visiting these local organizations will give you an idea of
                           the number and quality of deals that are in the pipeline. You can also learn about the
                           industries in which the start-ups are working to see if they match your group members’
                           backgrounds and interests.
                       m   Business intermediaries: Professionals such as accountants, commercial real estate
                           agents, recruitment agencies, and equipment suppliers may interact with start-ups and
                           have a feel of local business activity and dynamics.
                       m   Publicly available information: Local business trade publications can be a good
                           indication of entrepreneurial activity if available in your community.

                      Some problems you may encounter
                       m   Lack of viable companies: This is a very common problem in young ecosystems where
                           many companies are in the very early stages.
                       m   Lack of understanding among entrepreneurs of the role of angels: Even when there
                           are viable companies, entrepreneurs often do not know how to communicate and
                           work with angels, and they can be reluctant to take advice. They can have unrealistic
                           expectations about their company valuations and may not want to give up any portion
                                                         of their businesses. Some entrepreneurs think that they
                                                         can build a business alone. Some entrepreneurs are
                                                          reluctant to share information about their companies

      individuals may live in your community. There will not be adequate deal flow to support
      a formal group. You could be better off mentoring entrepreneurs until there are a good
      number of companies ready for angel investments.
 mm   Seek out “coachable” entrepreneurs who possess talent and passion: Effective
      entrepreneurs recognize their limitations as well as their talents, and should be open
      to working with mentors and angels who can help their businesses grow. As you build
      relationships with potential investees, look for entrepreneurs who are active listeners
      and who respond well to constructive criticism. If you feel that potential investees do
      not change their views on mentors and angels, do not invest in them.
 mm   Build entrepreneur coaching into your angel group strategy or practices: Most groups
      offer coaching to entrepreneurs prior to pitch events to ensure that the entrepreneurs
      present the necessary information in an efficient way. However, in many communities
      entrepreneurs need more than just last-minute guidance. Your angel group should
      determine how much time it is willing to spend in teaching entrepreneurs on how to
      work with angels. Hopefully there are organizations in the community that can provide
      such training. Some angel groups have formal or informal ties to incubators and
      accelerators to make sure that all potential investees are well prepared before they
      meet with investors. If such organizations do not prepare entrepreneurs to engage
      properly with angels, let the institutions know!



Assessing the entrepreneurial infrastructure
Entrepreneurs, and in turn angel groups, have a greater chance of success when
communities support, educate, and foster entrepreneurs. To get a better idea of the number
and types of support systems in your region, get answers for the following questions:

 mm   Do organizations exist in your community with a specific mission to support and foster
      the growth of entrepreneurial businesses, such as incubators, accelerators, or other
      organizations that provide start-up businesses with services and programs? If so, do
      these organizations have experienced staff?
 mm   Do you currently have, or is there interest in having, regular entrepreneurial networking
      events?
 mm   Does your community have high quality educational institutions with programs in
      business, especially at the graduate level?
 mm   Are there experienced entrepreneurs or business professionals willing to volunteer as
      mentors, program managers, or trainers as a way to give back to their communities?
 mm   Do local organizations support entrepreneurial programs, such as start-up weekends,
      hackathons (short, collaborative events centered on developing specific software
      projects), or demo days to give entrepreneurs opportunities to develop ideas and
      practice pitching in front of an audience?
 mm   Do trade industry associations exist in your community to support and foster existing
      and new companies?

     Assessment approach and tools
      mm   Support organizations: Visit local support organizations and inquire about the services
           they provide and expertise of the staff. See if they have information about the types and
           number of start-ups that have grown into successful, sustainable companies. If they
           have hosted any competitions, inquire about participation, outcomes, and plans to hold
           future events. Be sure to ask about their business model. Do they take an equity stake
           in the companies they support? As a potential follow-on investor, what else should you
           know?
      mm   Trade or industry associations: Meet with trade or industry association members
           to gauge their level of involvement with, or interest in engaging, local start-up
           organizations.
      mm   Cashed-out entrepreneurs or experienced business professionals: Assess the level
           of involvement that these individuals have with, or their interest in engaging, local
           entrepreneurs through your personal and professional networks, and through your
           research. These individuals can contribute greatly to a support system, and if they are
           active in your community, it will bode well for your angel group.


     Some problems you may encounter
      mm   Lack of support organizations: Even if you have a solid pool of entrepreneurs, the
           likelihood of developing successful businesses is diminished, or your community’s
           potential will not be met, without an active entrepreneurial support system.
      mm   Support organizations not sure how to work with angels: Incubators and accelerators
           may also be new to the community and still working out business models. They may
           provide equity investments to companies, but may not be experienced with handling
           follow-on investments from angels. Be sure to discuss this with accelerator managers
           to see if they provide funding for companies and how they work with angels.


     Recommendations
      mm   Manage expectations: Even if entrepreneurs have access to business advice, resources,
           and industry expertise outside of what your angel members can provide, these support
           systems take time to become effective. You may be able to address some gaps in the
           infrastructure, by leveraging your personal and professional networks to cultivate
           mentorship programs for entrepreneurs or support the growth and development of
           local incubators, but there are no quick solutions. Your angel group should be realistic
           about the amount of support investment recipients will need from members versus how
           much support they can get from the ecosystem.

Assessing service providers




                                                                                                       Getting Started
Having a solid pool of experienced service providers such as lawyers, accountants, and
marketing professionals is important to help start-ups get off the ground. These young
companies will also need senior managers with business experience at some point as well.
Investigate the following to get a better idea of the number and types of support systems in
your region:

 mm   Is there a good base of young and/or experienced talent for key roles in companies
      through local undergraduate and/or graduate school programs, optioned-out high-tech
      employees, successful corporate managers, or researchers?
 mm   Does your community have legal, accounting, marketing, and other services
      experienced in early-stage company development and financing?
 mm   Do these service providers often speak on relevant topics at various programs?


Assessment approach and tools
 mm   Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial support organizations: At some point,
      entrepreneurs and/or support organizations will have reached out to legal or
      accounting professionals for advice or support, and can give you feedback on the quality
      of such services.
 mm   Local colleges/universities: Find out if the education institutions in your community
      are producing graduates with the necessary skill sets to advise start-ups, or if they are
      good candidates to fill human resource needs of the start-up companies.
 mm   Professional associations: If there are professional associations in your community,
      they can help you assess the number of firms and individual professionals that service
      early-stage companies. This can give you a starting point from which you can investigate
      the quality of their services.


Some problems you may encounter
 mm   Lack of professional support: Without excellent professional support, bright and
      ambitious entrepreneurs may struggle to create a solid company, placing your
      investment capital at greater risk. In addition, investment grade companies are not
      made up of just one person, the presence of key talent is critical to a successful
      company.


Recommendations
 mm   Import or outsource talent: Depending on the services needed, start-ups in which you
      invest may be able to fill service and local human capital gaps with talent from outside
      your community. Marketing and accounting services can be provided virtually, and it
      may be possible to find legal experts among your diaspora network knowledgeable
      about local laws. Also, platforms like Angel List allow companies to advertise
      management positions internationally, so it may be possible for attractive companies
      to import human capital if necessary. In today’s global and highly connected world, this
      obstacle is getting easier to overcome.

     Assessing follow-on funding
     Many high-growth entrepreneurs will need funding past the initial angel round. As a result,
     additional funding sources become essential, if for no other reason than to protect your
     angel investment. It is important to think through how additional funding needs will be met
     before launching your angel group:

      mm   Could your angel organization support any and all financing needs, and would this fit
           with member interests?
      mm   Are there other angel groups nearby interested in deal syndication?
      mm   How many VC funds or PE firms are located in your community or general region?
      mm   Are there smaller VC funds or PE firms that may invest in earlier-stage companies?
      mm   Are there any government, philanthropic, or non-profit organizations that may offer
           grants or other types of financing for start-ups? If so, what stage of financing do they
           target?
      mm   At what point in a company’s growth will banks agree to provide financing?


     Assessment approach and tools
      mm   Angel associations: Some of the more developed markets have umbrella organizations,
           called angel associations, that facilitate networking among individual angel groups. For
           more information about angel associations, see page 24.
      mm   Corporations: Investigate the possibility of mature companies providing partnerships or
           funding to start-up companies. See if any have worked with start-ups in the past or are
           likely candidates for partnership.
      mm   Banking resources: Talk to your local banks to see if they offer debt and/or other types
           of financing.
      mm   Regional VCs and PE firms: In addition to VCs and PE firms that may be in your
           community or country, you can also research PE firms and VCs that invest in your
           region, although they may be less common depending on your location.
      mm   Philanthropic or non-profit organizations: If you identify some in your area, try to
           pinpoint the types of recipients they support and the resources they offer.


     Some problems you may encounter
      mm   Lack of above-mentioned sources of follow-on funding.
      mm   Presence of philanthropic or non-profit organizations targeting the same deals and
           offering better terms than angels can provide (cheaper money, essentially). In small
           markets, this may reduce deal flow for angels.


     Recommendations
      mm   Build connections with other angel groups, PE firms, and VCs: If possible, develop
           a relationship with local groups to take advantage of potential follow-on funding and
           better screening of early investments through reciprocal referrals.
      mm   Consider funding subsequent rounds: If your angel group has the capacity to continue
           investing beyond the first round, you could grow start-ups in the absence of other funds.

      As mentioned before, academic research has demonstrated
      that many angel investors support an increasing number of

      entrepreneurs who aim to have specific social impacts in areas
      such as health or education, which may or may not directly
      compete with angel investors’ investment focus.



Assessing regulatory environments
Some countries have more welcoming investment climates than others. Governments can
actively look for ways to make investing easier for angel investors, or do nothing about the
miles of red tape and disincentives that deter investors and limit start-up growth. You can
assess how the regulatory environment will influence your angel group by considering the
following:

 mm   Is there a legal environment that allows for establishment and operation of an
      investment structure preferred by venture capital investors?
 mm   Are investment laws overly restrictive with regard to number of investors, amounts they
      can invest, proportion of ownership, and ease of entry and exit?
 mm   Do investment laws provide appropriate shareholder protection during disputes?
 mm   Do insolvency and bankruptcy laws provide appropriate balance to creditors and
      debtors, allow for the speedy resolution of cases, and not place unreasonable
      obligations on entrepreneurs wanting to re-enter the market?
 mm   Are tax laws and administration relatively clear, or do they discriminate against the
      typical type of investment and investment structure used by angel investors?

      investment structures will work best given your regulatory environment.

                        mm   You should have clear reasons for forming the angel group. Make sure that your angel
                             group’s plans include a clear set of reasons for establishing the group and that these
                             reasons fit with prospective member expectations and interests. Consider this when

                             question of why investors join angel groups is the question of why people become
                             angel investors. Angel organizations can also fulfill the motivations of individual
                             angel investors, which should also be considered to ensure the success of any
                             angel organization. Understanding the psychology of angel investors will bode well
                             in structuring your angel group. According to the Center for Venture Research, the
                             top five reasons for becoming an angel investor are: expectations of high financial
                             reward, to play a role in the entrepreneurial process, to have fun and be involved in an
                             entrepreneurial firm, and to have a sense of community and social responsibility
                        mm   Understanding the risks. One must also be aware of the downsides of angel investing
                             as it is a high-risk game. Angels typically invest at an early stage, and most start-up
                             companies fail. Angels make their money on the small percentage of companies that
                             are successful, and compensate for all the failed investments. Return on investment
                             can often take from six to eight years, if it happens at all. This seemingly negative

                                                                                                                  Getting Started
     Bahrain’s first formal angel group, the Bahrain Business Angels Holding Company, launched in
     2011, thanks to the persistent efforts of Hasan Haider. As a successful entrepreneur, Hasan was
     aware of the innovative start-ups in his country and wanted to create an angel network to help
     them grow. However, finding willing investors was difficult. The concept of angel investing was
     new and even the name–angel investing–did not translate into Arabic. People he approached
     mostly did not understand start-ups and their technologies. Investors were skeptical their
     investments would pay off.

     To get more traction, Hasan realized that the angel
     group would have to broaden its investment focus to
     support innovative entrepreneurs in other industries,
     not just in technology. He also highlighted that an          “There should be an emphasis
     angel network, by investing in local human talent             on getting a core group and
     and creating jobs, could benefit the community and
                                                                   just starting. When you have an
     innovation in Bahrain, which appealed to investors’
     desire to give back. Hasan invited investors to pitch         impact, others will follow. Lead
     events to learn more about the companies and to               by doing. Sit with angels and

     community.                                                                          — Hasan Haider
                                                                                   Bahrain Business Angels
     After the initial investments, the network began                                     Holding Company
     to solidify. The more that investors interacted with
     entrepreneurs the more they became invested in the
     success of the companies, and the more time they
     donated their time as mentors. Investors also started
     recruiting friends and professional contacts to join
     the network, which has now grown to 16 members and three full-time staff. In all, it took Hasan
     about one year to set up the network and another six months to make the first investment.
     Thanks to several events and word-of-mouth, the network’s visibility has grown in just two short
     years. The group was worried about deal flow at first, but it received 60 applications right off the
     bat. The angel group’s investment recipients are now ready for their second rounds of funding,
     which may be difficult since there are no VCs in Bahrain. However there is a chance a foreign VC
     may be interested in their companies, although a merger or acquisition is the most likely exit.




Getting started: community assessment                                                                        27
     Building the framework
     for your angel group
     Now it is time to select the right organizational, management, and membership
     structure for your group. This section will lead you through several decision-
     making steps so that you can select an organizational structure that is
     appropriate in your local context and is based on the goals and preferences of
     your prospective members. Remember that nearly every decision you make can
     affect previous assumptions or decisions. As such, continue to challenge your
     previous choices or decisions for ﬁt and appropriateness with each step. Keep in
     mind the following:

      m   There is no one best model for angel groups. The angel organization “industry” is still
          young in many respects, and only limited global research and evaluation have been
          conducted to date. As a result, one cannot draw any conclusions about the superiority or
          success of one particular model. In fact, anecdotal evidence suggests that many models
          have been successful.
      m   Form must always follow function. Do not choose a particular legal model or
          management structure and then try to shoehorn your members into a model that
          does not ﬁt their interests or investment orientation. Let your members’ interests and
          comfort levels guide your ultimate decisions.
      m   Remember to be ﬂexible. As much as you would like the process of angel group
          development to be straightforward, your willingness to listen to input and adjust
          previous assumptions will bode well in creating a successful organization. Keep in
          mind that you may need to adjust your model over time to accommodate a larger
          membership or new strategy.

Decision Step #1

Determination of membership and culture




                                                                                                                          the framework
Nearly all angel groups have established membership criteria. In countries that have
accredited investor definitions, membership is usually limited to individuals who meet the
criteria. Most countries, however, have no such parameters, and
membership requirements are left to the founders to decide. This
section will walk you through the numerous factors to consider
when determining membership criteria for your group:
                                                                           “A group has to define its

articulating values.                                                                              —Nelson Gray
                                                                                              Archangels, Scotland
Archangels, a group based in Scotland, attributes the group’s ability
to remain active for more than 22 years to its strong culture and
commitment to its core values. Its members share a vision and rally
around four main goals: 1) to give back to Scotland by investing
in young people and companies, particularly those in science and emerging technologies,
2) to look for investments where they could add value by passing on their own business
experiences, 3) to have fun, and 4) to make money. These principles orient the group during
decision-making processes and reinforce shared values among the members.

Setting cultural aspirations can be easy but preserving them is more difficult. This can be
accomplished through:

 mm   Clear articulation of culture in membership documents and on group website
 mm   Regular reminders to members
 mm   Keeping your culture in mind when considering other types of membership such as
      sponsors or VCs
 mm   Designing meeting agendas to achieve cultural goals
 mm   Membership limitations
 mm   Internal communications plan that ensures all members are regularly informed and
      involved in group activities

Membership numbers
 mm   Small groups (less than 15 members): Groups often limit membership, if for no other
      reason than to maintain a desired culture. Intimacy and frankness of discussion may

           be overriding goals that naturally limit the number of members. Limited membership
           can also preserve cohesiveness. Group size should also be compatible with your
           investment structure. If you aim to establish an angel investment fund with upfront fund
           commitment, you will want to set a defined size for the fund and a minimum investment
           per angel investor to give members an understanding of the intended fund size.
      mm   Large groups (from 16-100+): On the other hand, many groups find advantages in large
           numbers. By combining many individual networks, members may enjoy better deal flow,
           opportunities to make larger deals, and a greater pool of resources in membership
           skills and backgrounds. However, the larger the group, the greater the associated
           expenses in terms of communications, need for formality of operations and structure,
           and meeting logistics. You may be able to leverage membership dues and greater
           access to sponsors to cover those expenses.


     Geographic location of members
     Traditionally, angel group members invest close to where they live. Geographic proximity
     promotes closer personal ties among group members and allows investors to closely
     monitor and mentor investees. Technology, however, now makes it possible for meetings,
     pitch sessions, and mentorship to happen virtually. Some angel groups are challenging
     the notion that all members have to live nearby and invest only in local companies. If your
     group has limited deal flow or members lack certain expertise, it may be beneficial to have
     members located elsewhere who can connect the group with new investment opportunities
     and fill skills gaps. On the other hand, if members do not know each other very well, it may
     be difficult to build trust among members through email and video chats, not to mention
     that it will be harder for members to develop relationships with entrepreneurs. Consider
     how much face-to-face interaction your group will need with each other and with investees
     when deciding membership criteria and meeting schedules. You can always test out a hybrid
     approach with some in-person sessions and some virtual sessions until you find what works
     best.


     Member expertise
     Functional expertise and/or industry experience may be important membership criteria.
     Most groups have members with a mix of backgrounds and professional skills such
     as management, finance, marketing, human resources, or research. Such diversity
     of professional backgrounds can be critical in conducting due diligence on potential
     investment opportunities. If your group decides to have a specific investment focus, make
     sure your community has adequate interest and entrepreneurial base to support this.

Indian Angel Network
When the Indian Angel Network (IAN) launched in 2006, it looked like any other small, newly




                                                                                                            the framework
formed angel group. As IAN was the first formal angel group in India, its Delhi-based founders
had no local template to follow. The group tested various operational models and discovered that
some approaches common in the U.S. and Europe did not fit well with Indian culture. After some
trial and error, the group adopted some new practices and eventually started to enjoy fruitful
investments. Their success attracted attention from other angel investors across the country
who wanted to invest with the network. The group was open to including new members, but the
distances between cities were not conducive to in-person meetings. To remedy this, the group
held virtual meetings and pitch sessions for members outside Delhi. Eventually new chapters
opened across India, and the members continued to share deals and due diligence virtually.
IAN’s membership grew to more than 250 angels across the country.

To manage the rapidly expanding growth, IAN’s leadership adopted a glocal model to leverage
local relationships and global expertise. Members who are geographically close to deals
are responsible for due diligence regarding the management team, and for mentorship and
monitoring the business. Members from other cities collaborate on technology diligence,
industry knowledge, and by providing global connections. Pitching happens via video conference,
as well as due diligence and contract negotiations. Investors enjoy this model because it allows
them to diversify outside their own local communities. The group achieved another milestone in
2014 when it opened a chapter in London, its first outside of India.



Gender considerations
Women are often under-represented in angel groups, even when they make up nearly
half of the top wealth holders in countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom. In
2010, women comprised just 15 percent of angel investors in the U.S. and only 5 percent
of angel investors in Europe.27 This is unfortunate as angel networks have much to gain
from diversifying their membership. The diversity of expertise and perspectives can reduce
risks and generate better returns for the group. Research from the European Business
Angel Network (EBAN) suggests that women angels help groups widen their sector focus
beyond technology and tap into new sources of deal flow. Researchers also point out that
women approach due diligence differently than men, often asking more questions and
digging deeper into financial projections.28 As mentors, women bring a different set of
experiences and business connections to the table, which strengthens resources available
to entrepreneurs.

If your group aims to increase gender diversity among its members, be conscientious
of factors that may encourage their participation. Researchers suggest that women
entrepreneurs are less likely to seek external financing than their male counterparts,29
which may contribute to low awareness among women about the risks and rewards of angel
investing. If this is the case in your community, be sure to highlight the educational offerings
your group will provide to members to enhance knowledge of angel investing practices.
Researchers also point out that angel network structures and requirements may be
incompatible with women’s schedules as women may have family duties and require flexible
options to attend group meetings.30 Some groups solve this by having lunch meetings,
allowing virtual participation, or by recording pitch sessions and allowing members to watch
and provide comments later.

                 Membership tiers
                 Some groups have tiered membership structures with certain benefits and restrictions for
                 each category. In addition to standard individual membership, affiliate and sponsorship
                 memberships can benefit the group:

                  mm   Affiliate membership: If there are VCs in your country, you may consider offering
                       affiliate memberships to VC representatives as a way to access and share deals. You can
                       offer a range of member rights, from only attendance at meetings to full participation
                       rights in any deal. Whether or not a VC fund or sponsor is a voting member of your
                       angel group is an individual choice; take care that if voting rights are given, control
                       is not inadvertently shifted away from the angel members. Sharing deals may be a
                       disadvantage for some, as the VC could scoop good deals out from under the group.
                       These concerns can be alleviated to some extent by requiring VC funds to share deals
                       in order to be members. You can also offer affiliate memberships to students or young
                       professionals who may be interested in observing group activities. This is a great way to
                       strengthen ties among various groups in your entrepreneurial ecosystem.
                  mm   Sponsor memberships: Sponsor members, who are typically professional service
                       organizations such as law and accounting firms, can benefit an angel group by paying
                       for some of the operational or event-related costs. Sponsors are generally not provided
                       memberships but rather allowed to attend meetings for the benefit of finding potential
                       clients. The challenge is allowing attendance without your group meetings turning into
                       a networking event for service providers. Some mechanisms to assure meeting focus
                       include limiting the number of sponsors and sponsor representatives at each meeting
                       and controlling membership lists and correspondence. Benefits that may be provided
                       to attract sponsors include introduction of guest speakers, opportunity to conduct
                       member-training sessions, sponsorship of the angel group’s website, and placement of

      A note on diaspora investing
      Diaspora communities are a source of pride and financial resources for many emerging
      economies and an important population for angel groups to consider when seeking members.
      Countless studies have highlighted diaspora economic might, with an estimated $401 billion in
      remittances flowing to developing countries in 2012.32 Contributions “back home” are not limited
      to just family-bound remittances. A 2013 infoDev survey of high-net worth Caribbean diaspora
      in the U.S., Canada, and the United Kingdom revealed that private sector investment is also of
      interest to diaspora. In the Caribbean, one in ten diaspora invests in a business venture of some
      form, with up to a quarter of their investments made in the Caribbean.33 When asked what types
      of venture investments they preferred, start-ups ranked first among other types of venture
      investments, such as small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

      Of course, not all diaspora groups are eager to
      invest in risky companies halfway around the world.
                                                                                     “I found that you should

      Decision Step #2

      Organizational structure
      Member-managed
      By its very description, a member-managed (or member-led) organization requires active
      member involvement in nearly all aspects of operation. Member-led organizations usually
      hire administrative support to handle matters such as member communications, meeting
      coordination, and database maintenance.

      Manager-managed
      In contrast, a manager-managed (or manager-led) organization employs the services of
      an individual(s) with experience and background in the investment process and/or in the
      industry in which the angel organization intends to focus its investments.

Typically, a manager does the following:

 mm   Much of the up-front work while vetting possible deals




                                                                                                   the framework
 mm   Conducts initial interviews with companies
 mm   Coaches entrepreneurs for presentations to the group
 mm   Handles member communications and relationships
 mm   May make recommendations on investments and negotiate investments on behalf of the
      organization.

The manager does not have authority and control over all investment decisions. Instead,
a manager handles the group’s processes so that members can focus on investment
decisions. Keep in mind that even with active member participation, a manager may still
be appropriate, particularly with large groups (more than 75 members); many groups
with actively participating members have executive directors, and nearly all have some
type of administrative support. Both manager-led and member-led structures are popular
among angel groups. Historically, the member-led model has been more predominant, but
research by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed
that in 2011 more than 50 percent of groups had opted for manager-led model.


Example of member-led organizations
A member-led structure works well for a Cambodian angel group, as members did not
want the additional overhead of a management team. The members are actively involved
with every step in the decision-making process, as a more hands-on approach is preferred
in their community. The business incubator, Emerging Markets Entrepreneurs, and a few
angel group members lead the management of day-to-day operations, interacting with
potential investees. Meetings occur as needed, depending on the deal flow. All steps of the
investment process are done by members, including deal sourcing, deal screening, and
handing administrative tasks.

Through active participation and good governance, members feel confident that they can
preempt problems that may otherwise slip through the cracks if decisions were left up to
a manager. While not having a manager keeps operational costs down, members admit
that processes can move more slowly at times. The members are experienced investors,
bankers, and entrepreneurs, mainly from the West, who are knowledgeable and active
mentors. A few members are also actively involved as mentors in the business incubator,
which provides further continuity to the angel group.


Example of manager-led organizations
An excellent example of a manager-led organization is Angel Ventures Mexico. A small
group of friends from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched the group
in 2008 with financial support from friends and families. The founders decided that a
manager-led structure suited the group, as most members were busy senior executives
from multinational companies, just being introduced to the technical aspects of angel
investing. Having a manager to shoulder operations and to coordinate due diligence with
experts seemed more efficient and easier. Also, working with high-net worth individuals
comes with security concerns in certain parts of the country, so it is beneficial to have a
manager dedicated to setting up small meetings to brief investors on potential deals.

      access to capital remained a challenge for entrepreneurs.
      Concerned by the lack of capital and with support from           country, it was better to have
      the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), an established           a fund rather than an open

      found that Panama had no seed capital, no refundable or          a scenario where one person

     costs, which would greatly reduce start-up and operational expenses. The angels could also count
     on City of Knowledge to ensure investment readiness of companies selected for presentations, as
     all companies that reached out to the angels would be redirected to the accelerator. The accelerator
     generated sufficient funds to support operations by holding forums and promotional events. There
     were drawbacks, however; staff could not focus exclusively on the needs of the network, and group
     members may not have been as driven to become sustainable. There was also a risk that the group
     would not receive deal flow from outside the City of Knowledge due to its close linkages with the
                                                  accelerator.

                                       actual angel fund, and they may prefer to build up trust levels before
                                       developing a more formal organization. Similarly, some investors
                                       are fiercely independent and private about their investment
                                       decisions, and while they appreciate and enjoy group camaraderie,
                                       they consider the actual investment choice and process to be their
                                       own business. For these investors, an affiliation is a good choice.

While most traditional chamas invest in real estate, some groups
with a higher risk tolerance have started to invest in Kenyan start-up
companies. These groups tend to have a mix of entrepreneurs and
individuals who work in strategic sectors, such as IT. They enjoy
working with local entrepreneurs and can bring industry expertise
to the investments. One of the main advantages of the informal
affiliation structure is that it provides flexibility to members as the
group forms. Members can focus on making deals and developing
group dynamics without worrying about formalities. As the group
matures and enjoys successful investments, members may decide
to register as a formal limited liability corporation (LLC) or as
another for-profit entity.

The Bedaya Angel Network in Jordan is an excellent example
of a non-profit organization. Its founders, former entrepreneurs
who were involved with the iPark incubator in Amman, launched
the network in 2010 after they realized that entrepreneurs were
having trouble finding financing between $30,000 and $250,000.
The founders wanted the angel network to help companies grow
and create new jobs for the betterment of the local economy. Given

Individual investment
 m   Based on group due diligence, individuals can decide if a company ﬁts their investment
     criteria and portfolio. They can invest directly and individually or with other interested
     angels through a single investment vehicle, such as an LLC. The basic difference
     between these approaches and the pooled funds approach is the understood intent and
     the group’s investment process. With a pooled fund, group members understand that
     investments will be made through a group decision process, with pooled or combined
     funds invested into the portfolio company. On the other hand, even with group due
     diligence, an individual investment structure allows each angel investor to make his
     or her own decision for investment. From this individual decision, based on group (or
     individual) due diligence, the group can always decide to combine their investment
     amount into a single investment. Keep in mind that local ﬁnancial regulations will vary.
     Check with legal experts to understand more about individual and group investment
     mechanisms in your city or country.

     Sidecar funds
     A sidecar fund is a fund through which individuals, groups, and institutions can invest
     passively alongside angels. Just as a passenger in a motorcycle sidecar puts trust in
     the rider, investors in the sidecar fund trust in the due diligence and decision making of
     angels who handle the fund. A sidecar fund gives angels the ability to invest more money
     than what the group can afford by itself. It can also boost the angels’ negotiating power
     with other institutional investors in later investment rounds. Investors in the fund also
     benefit, as they might want exposure to risky asset classes, but do not have the confidence
     or ability to invest on their own. Many groups use sidecar funds, such as Angel Ventures
     Mexico. The group previously raised $20 million USD through this vehicle, with investors
     from the Multilateral Investment Fund, the Mexican government, and other high-net worth
     individuals.

     If your angel group decides to have a sidecar fund, be sure to outline how it will be invested
     and governed. It is a best practice to have the investment decisions for the fund mirror
     those of the angels in your group. This gives confidence to the fund contributors that their
     money is being invested alongside that of experienced angels. Some groups have a formula
     to determine when to invest the fund, such as when a minimum number of angels in the
     group are investing. Your group should identify a group, such as a committee of member
     or the board of directors, to oversee decision-making for the fund. Of course, there may be
     conflicts of interest between individual angels and the decision-makers. It may take some
     trial and error to determine the best way to manage such conflicts, but you can temporarily
     try removing conflicted individuals from the fund decision-making committee, or allowing
     your angel group leadership to weigh in on the problem. Sidecar fund investors usually pay
     a management fee to help cover the costs associated with its management.

renewals some time before the start of your next fiscal year. For
members joining mid-year, you can offer a percentage discount on
dues to encourage membership.


Percentage of committed capital or pooled funds
Angel funds in which members are required to commit capital up front typically have a
portion of the committed capital allocated to cover operational costs. Along with the industry
standard 2 percent to 3 percent to cover management costs, staff can be compensated to
maximize investment value and return by directing a percentage of the deal (referred to as
the “carry”) to them. In countries with accredited investor status, there may be a problem if
the carry is given directly to staff-members who are not accredited investors. The discussion
on limited partnerships under Legal Structure offers one structural alternative to resolve
this problem. Your lawyer can recommend other solutions, including a possible LLC.

Another form of “percentage of committed capital” is to allocate a portion of the group’s
specific investment commitment to cover operational costs related to investments. This can
be a bit complicated but, arguably, fairly allocates expenses. The mechanics would be that
after individual members make their contribution to the group investment, but before the
actual investment is made, a percentage of the investment amount is carved out to cover
related costs. Problems that can arise from this approach that must be considered include:

      mm   The possible need for a separate legal entity for each investment, since members for
           each investment will be different (although some groups already successfully use this
           model.
      mm   No one invests after expenses are incurred, but they still must be covered. This is called
           a “broken deal fee.”
      mm   Disagreement as to the value and time contributed by staff and, even possibly, other
           members. This issue is coming up with more frequency as member-led groups struggle
           with how to encourage members to volunteer for the time-consuming task of due
           diligence. A possible solution is to offer these members some form of compensation.
           Since cash is usually not appropriate, offering a percentage of the group investment or
           warrants (if the company is amenable) may be a good solution, but this takes advance
           planning and group agreement.


     Sponsorships
     Sponsors can be an effective and significant source of funding, as long as the group ensures
     that member meetings maintain their focus on member needs. It is important to control the
     number and nature of sponsors and representatives. The Group Operations section contains
     parameters for sponsorship and its benefits. Remember, however, that service providers do
     not sponsor an angel organization or any other group/event just to be good citizens. Budgets
     are often tight, and sponsors need to have some return for sponsorship dollars.

     One caveat: many professionals are also high-net worth individuals and qualify for
     membership. An individual’s professional background should not prevent membership;
     otherwise, your membership numbers will be limited. However, all members should
     understand that meetings are for evaluating investment opportunities and not selling
     services. Some groups have gone to the extent to include rules that prohibit members
     actively soliciting other members during meetings.


     Events and programs
     Investment and educational forums can be an effective mechanism to introduce promising
     new companies and educate the public. Events are complex and time consuming and you
     should recognize this. They can include public educational programs. Some nonprofit
     organizations use investment forums as a source of group funding, which can work
     particularly well in a community with unmet needs to match investors and entrepreneurs
     or in which the angel organization has a strong presence that attracts investors, presenting
     companies, and sponsors.


     Company fees
     In developed countries, some organizations charge selected companies for the right to
     present at a member meeting. Most are willing to pay a reasonable amount for the privilege
     of exposure to a group of potential investors. However, the amount should not be so large as
     to drive good companies away or raise possible issues of broker-dealer status for the angel
     group. Some groups also charge a small administrative fee to all applicants. This amount
     helps cover the administrative activities associated with processing applications.

Summary of building the framework
We hope that this first part of the guidebook has given you
considerable food for thought and valuable guidance in the
establishment of your own angel organization. Although not
mentioned before, do not forget the most important reason
for devoting thousands of volunteer hours to creating an angel
organization—the journey and resulting successful group are
rewarding, personally satisfying, and fun.

         In many respects, deciding the structure of your organization is the easy part,
         the actual operations can pose the most difﬁcult issues. Proper and thoughtful
         implementation of your plan will determine the future of your group, member
         satisfaction, investment success, fulﬁllment of your group’s objective, and group
         culture. This section is divided into three parts:  launching group operations,
          identifying deals and investing, and  follow-on activities.




PART 1   Launching group operations
         Recruitment
         The ease with which you can ﬁnd other angels to join your group will depend on your
         membership criteria as well as the results of your community assessment. In some cases,
         you may already have strong community of high-net worth individuals enthusiastic about
         creating an angel group. In others, you may have to work much harder to get the right
         investors. Below are a few approaches to ﬁnding new members:

          m   Personal and professional networks: The overwhelming majority of champions
              interviewed for this manual said that they approach recruitment by ﬁrst looking within
              their personal and professional networks. Each new member could then provide
              suggestions for good candidates to join the group.
          m   Pitch events: Some angel groups connect with local incubators or other
              entrepreneurship centers to have innovation and/or pitch events that may interest
              angels. This is most successful when a targeted communications campaign reaches
              potential angels, such as a pitch event for companies in a certain industry.
          m   Networking events: Tap into people’s desires to network by hosting interesting events
              related to your angel network’s investment focus or desired culture. For example, you
              can ask IT companies or leaders to give a presentation on an interesting topic and invite
              successful local entrepreneurs from that industry. Usually, well-known entrepreneurs
              or investors, domestic or foreign, can draw a crowd. For help ﬁnding a big-name
              speaker or an extensive invitee list, see if your chamber of commerce can offer support.
              This tactic worked well in Serbia and Cambodia where the respective chambers of
              commerce played an important role, using its convening power to help bring potential
              group members together.




48                             Creating Your Own Angel Investor Group: A Guide for Emerging and Frontier Markets
 mm   Training seminars and workshops: Hosting educational events is another way to attract
      potential members. For example, the U.S.-based Angel Resource Institute offers a
      full suite of courses entitled The Power of Angel Investing. Such events help bridge
      the knowledge gap in places where angel investing is new. You can also conduct this
      training seminar for members once your group is established.

members

Time commitments
Willingness by members to volunteer time is an important factor in determining whether
your group should be manager or member-led. Groups surveyed for this manual met
anywhere from four to twelve times a year depending on deal flow and the needs of the
group. For more detail about individual responsibilities, see appendix 5.

Group Operations — Part 1: Launching group operations                                                                 51
                      Sponsorship
                      As discussed under the Building the Framework section, sponsorships can be an effective
                      and viable mechanism for funding (at least partially) your angel group expenses. Many
                      groups shy away from sponsorships fearing that meetings will become a vendor event
                      rather than staying true to angel investing. Steps can be taken to prevent or minimize
                      sponsors monopolizing meetings. At the same time, remember that sponsorship is not
                      provided out of charity. Sponsors represent legitimate and important business services and
                      need recognized benefits for the money they spend.


                      Control of sponsorship activities
                                              mm   Limit the number of sponsors. If you have a tiered sponsorship
                                                   structure, you may want to offer exclusivity for particular
                                                   professional categories (for instance, accounting, law, investment
                                                   banking) for the highest sponsorship level. The overall number of
                                                   sponsors should remain at a level so that representatives will still

                                              mm   Ensure that sponsors understand and value your group philosophy,
                                                   goals, and objectives. The better everyone understands the

                      Sponsorship benefits
                       mm   Interaction with members at meetings. Sponsors are unlikely to sign up unless they
                            understand the opportunity to interact with group members. But, as discussed above,
                            the number of representatives should be limited.
                       mm   Exclusivity for top-tier sponsorship. If you create a tiered sponsorship structure, you
                            can often give the top-tier sponsors exclusivity in their professional category. This gives
                            a sponsor the comfort of having no competition in their professional field.
                       mm   Marketing materials and promotional materials. Allow sponsors to place marketing
                            materials at a designated location without dominating a meeting. Passive use of
                            materials satisfies sponsorship needs for take-away reminders but allows members
                            the choice of taking or not taking the materials.
                       mm   Training/speakers/event coordination. Sponsors can play a valuable role in
                            coordination of group training, guest speakers, and events. Not surprisingly, sponsors
                            are attracted to groups and events that complement their area of professional expertise.
                            Coordinating and conducting member education and training can be a very effective way

      speakers and would enjoy introducing speakers at member meetings. Events such as
      investment forums also fit well with sponsor interests.
 mm   Website and program recognition. An easy benefit to offer is prominent display
      of sponsor logos on the group website, in meeting programs, and even on group

      sponsorships.

Collaboration with other angel groups
As you launch your group, consider reaching out to established angel groups or plugging
into international angel networks. You may be surprised at the wealth of knowledge and
resources that you can tap into simply by networking. Angel Venture Mexico, for example,
worked with the Angel Capital Association and the U.S. Embassy to hold one-day workshops
for its various chapters on the technical aspects of angel investing, and invited other local

angel groups to attend. While some groups may hesitate fearing that outsiders will “steal”
their members or deals, it is much more likely that you will find professionals committed
to strengthening the industry and syndicating deals. The Lagos Angel Network in Nigeria
found the help of an angel group in Texas as it was sorting out its structure, and Angel
Ventures Mexico met with angel groups in Rwanda, South Africa, and Lebanon to guide
them on setting up operations. To kick off networking for your group, you can reach out to
networks such as the ACA, EBAN, or any other professional association of angels to learn
about upcoming events and/or networking opportunities.

PART 2   Identifying deals and investing
         The investment process can take many routes. These range from members
         making their own investment decisions to investment of group funds based
         on committee or manager recommendations. The actual investment structure
         can vary from individual investments to creation of a limited liability company
         for each investment to investments from an established fund. For purposes of
         this discussion, let us walk through the entire investment process, discussing
         alternatives for each step.

         Deal sourcing
         The success of any angel organization ultimately depends on the quality of investment
         opportunities available to its members. These opportunities can come from several sources:

             m       Generally, members are the best source of business plans. If members are active
                     investors in the community, they become well known and have their own deal sources.
             m       Local incubators and accelerators are also a good place to ﬁnd talent. Certain
                     organizations, such as mLabs (mobile labs), support speciﬁc types of entrepreneurs
                     that may ﬁt into your investment focus.
             m       Some groups have found good potential deals through local universities that have
                     strong technology-transfer programs and enterprise centers, which support
                     development of entrepreneurial companies and community entrepreneurship.

     for VCs and encourage them to send interesting business plans
     for your group’s investment consideration. Additionally, VCs may
     offer the angel group limited opportunities to participate in ﬁrst-
     round venture ﬁnancings because of this relationship.

Even with companies sourced through members, professional service organizations, VCs,
and other methods, the best angel groups use one uniform mechanism for company
applications, typically the angel group website. This provides an opportunity to inform
applicants of your rules of presentation as well as the screening and selection process, and
to handle any charges associated with company applications (appendix 6 shows a sample
funding application).

    A Note on Platforms*
    Online platforms are a popular tool for angel investors because they can streamline
    group operations and help fill gaps in local ecosystems, such as access to deal flow
    and other investors. The best platforms have some type of screening mechanism and
    are highly transparent, which reduces the costs of due diligence and makes investors
    more comfortable with doing deals at a distance. Most are U.S.-based, but interesting
    websites are starting to pop up in emerging markets that have a strong focus on
    building communities and educating users. While there are too many platforms to
    mention here, it is helpful to know the types of products in the market and the benefits

    that they offer to angels. It may be worthwhile for your group to consider using a
    platform to facilitate internal operations:
      ll   Platforms for fundraising: One of the most popular and reputable websites for deal
           discovery and fundraising is Angel List. Entrepreneurs create profiles describing
           their companies and fundraising goals, and angels, usually accredited investors,
           can scroll through their various investment options. Angels can see other investors
           who are interested in syndication, and they can work together on due diligence and
           term sheet negotiations. Most companies that post on Angel List are based in the
           U.S. or Europe, although there is some representation from Asia, Latin America, and
           Africa. Crowdfunding platforms are also rising in popularity, although not without

           controversy. The following page provides a more in-depth look at this growing
           phenomenon.
      ll   Platforms for managing the deal process: GUST is another popular website
           that allows angel groups to manage an influx of deals and facilitate virtual due
           diligence. The platform offers tools and templates to guide investors through the
           process. Another tool, Caplinked, provides virtual storage space for your investment
           documents that can be shared among members. Similar to Angel List, these are
           mostly used in the U.S. and Europe, with growing popularity in other regions.
      ll   Mentorship platforms: These tools help entrepreneurs in remote locations connect
           with experts around the world. These platforms offer a range of features, such as
           educational materials for entrepreneurs, ability to share business plans and track
           progress over time, and the ability to set and manage meetings with mentors. Most
           platforms facilitate existing mentor-mentee relationships, but a growing handful
           facilitate the matching process online. Launchpad Central is one platform that
           encourages the lean start-up methodology and gives good direction to entrepreneurs
           on customer development. A few others include Chronus, Insala, and MentorCloud.
      ll   Community and educational materials: As interest in angel investing grows around
           the world, platforms are cropping up to educate newcomers and to grow networking
           opportunities. VC4Africa is one platform that strives to build a community among
           African angels and entrepreneurs. It has succeeded in attracting members from 40
           countries, including entrepreneurs at all levels and more than 400 investors. It also
           has a fundraising component through which entrepreneurs have raised $12 million.
           Expect to see similar platforms in your region in the near future!

     A look at crowdfunding
     The practice of crowdfunding has generated buzz as an innovative new way to invest in start-ups.
     The basic model is an online platform that posts start-ups’ business plans and financing needs,
     and allows potential investors to peruse the listings for investment opportunities. Start-ups
     typically receive investments from a variety of sources. Since the investors and recipient may
     be far apart geographically, the practice hinges on a high degree of transparency and trust.
     Crowdfunding works best when platform managers are diligent about vetting deals before they
     are posted online for investment, and when there is a strong local ecosystem to support the
     investment recipient. This support could be in the form of a reputable incubator, accelerator
     or a lead angel investor who works closely with the start-up and facilitates reporting and
     communication with investors.

     How can crowdfunding help angel groups?
     The answer to this question is highly disputed, and it is still quite early to have a definitive answer.
     One possible scenario is that angels will use crowdfunding as way to measure demand for a
     product or service. Some angel groups require start-ups to prove market acceptance through a
     successful crowdfunding campaign before receiving an investment. Angels see this as a way to
     reduce the risks associated with investing in a new idea. Crowdfunding also has the potential to
     help angels find high quality deal flow, facilitate cross-border flows of capital, and improve the
     availability of information, as some platforms have stringent vetting requirements. The U.S.-based
     Heartland Angels is one group that is testing the waters by operating its own crowdfunding portal.

     Where is crowdfunding a viable option?
     Crowdfunding is still a nascent phenomenon that exists mostly in the developed world. In
     Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, crowdfunding has been operational
     for several years. Canadian and Mexican governments are currently discussing regulatory
     frameworks, and the U.S. government is on the verge of allowing equity crowdfunding investments
     (debt and rewards-based funding are currently allowed). Based on estimates of household
     income and savings, East Asia, Central Europe and Latin America/Caribbean have the potential
     to deploy $93 billion a year in crowdfunding by 2025. While Asia represents a huge opportunity,
     there may be reasons to believe that Central Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, and Africa may
     adopt crowdfunding investing sooner. These factors include willingness to takes risks, support
     for free market innovation, strong diaspora communities, early stage entrepreneurial activity, and
     education.

     What are the risks and how can they be mitigated?
     There are high risks associated with investing in any startup, but with crowdfunding there is the
     additional threat of fraud. While instances of fraud have been impressively low, this may become
     a greater concern as crowdfunding expands. Good legal frameworks and systems are necessary
     to protect investors, and small business regulations should be updated accordingly. There should
     be country-specific regulations for attracting diaspora remittances, and burdensome regulations
     should be removed. As mentioned above, it is more difficult for angels to oversee crowdfunded
     investments, so having a credible third party to facilitate investor relations and communications
     is critical. Lastly, some platforms add additional controls by limiting access to the platform. For
     example, some platforms only accept screened and approved high-net-worth investors. Other
     platforms may have open membership but limit investments based on income.

Coaching
Once the screening committee has selected promising companies to present, the
entrepreneurs must present to the angel group as effectively as possible. Experienced
angels want to see the best opportunities and entrepreneurial teams with good
communication skills. Coaching the selected businesses can make a significant difference
in ensuring that companies present the right information, in an effective format, using their
best representatives. Some groups give presenting companies exact instructions on what to
include in their presentation and meeting handouts. Sponsors (such as law or accounting
firms) are often keenly interested in providing these coaching services at no cost and, in fact,
as a benefit of sponsorship. These service providers see the opportunity to coach presenters

as a chance to promote their services and possibly obtain a new client that is already
considered a cut above.

Most companies see coaching as a benefit, particularly if a group charges companies for
applying and/or presenting. As with other steps in the investment process, the manager of
a manager-led organization may take on the responsibility of coaching companies along
with other aspects of deal screening and investment. The allocation of these various
responsibilities will depend on member preferences, interest in participating in various
steps of the process, legal structure, group collective experiences, and manager experience,
as well as the level of organizational funding (more work by the manager and staff equals
greater overhead costs).

In a manager-led organization, the manager typically leads the investment-evaluation
process. The manager also often negotiates the structure of an investment or participates in
the negotiation process with the lead investor. In member-led groups, whether an informal
group with individual investment decisions or one in which members invest collectively, the
due diligence process must ensure coverage of relevant topics and should be conducted by
those with experience and expertise in particular areas. Some groups retain university or
MBA students to support due diligence through an internship program with local business
schools. Other groups retain outside experts to evaluate a company or give a briefing on
cutting-edge technology related to the potential investment, although most do not have

budgets to pay for outside consultants. After due diligence is complete, those involved with
the process present findings to the angel group, and members vote on whether or not to
fund the company.



Investment terms and negotiations
The purpose of this guidebook is to help champions select appropriate structures for their
angel groups but not to delve into the intricacies of investment terms and negotiations;
however, such a critical part of the process cannot be ignored. Luckily, there are many

publicly available resources. This guidebook provides a sample term sheet and an
explanatory term sheet (see appendices 10 and 11). These examples introduce some of the
terms and options that angels use. The Angel Resource Institute provides free, detailed
materials on its website, and offers in-person full and half-day seminars for a fee. The
website also has up-to-date research and news on trends in angel investing. Online
tools may be helpful as well, such as the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati Term Sheet
Generator. Although it may not be relevant in all jurisdictions, the notes for each section are
helpful as they explain the terms and options at each step.

Angel investors, often being the first outside money in a company, need to be aware of
follow-on funding needs and possible sources for this additional company capital. Do not
make the terms so complicated or onerous as to effectively prevent attracting follow-on
financing, which is undesirable for the company and the angel investor. From an operational
perspective, in manager-led groups, the manager often plays an integral in determining
and negotiating investment terms. A manager’s (and, for that matter, a member’s) ability to
negotiate investment terms will depend on a few key factors:

 mm   Is your group the lead investor? If not, you probably have little influence over the terms
      and must rely on the sophistication of the lead investor to negotiate investor-favorable
      terms. If a VC fund is leading the round, you will most likely receive favorable terms.
 mm   Does your manager (or do your members) have the requisite experience? Professional
      advice should be sought and used with the first few investments and even thereafter as
      a safety factor.
 mm   Has the company already established terms, and does it have multiple sources of
      funding? Entrepreneurs usually know if they are a “hot” deal. If this is the case and you
      want to play, both your ability to get in on the deal and your negotiation leverage may be
      limited.




Group Operations — Part 2: Identifying deals and investing                                         61
     One of the most important lessons learned by experienced angel groups is the timing of
     the initial “hand shake” on terms between company founders and angels. It is wise to get
     to a memorandum of understanding or term sheet on key terms—valuation, board seats,
     information rights, dividends, etc.—before competing due diligence.



     Liability and risk exposure
     With any structure in which members make independent investment decisions, there should
     be a strong disclaimer of organizational liability. The disclaimer should indicate specifically
     that each member makes his or her own investment decision and that the organization is
     not recommending any particular company for investment. (See appendix 3 Membership
     Agreement for sample disclaimer.) Members with a relationship to any company presenting
     (as a board member, adviser, officer, or current investor) should disclose to the group their
     relationship with the presenting company to ensure fair and equitable review of the potential
     investment. In theory, with greater organizational structure, you should provide insulation
     from liability for board members and others actively involved in organizational management.
     However, there are no risk-free circumstances, and you should consider obtaining
     insurance for directors and officers, as appropriate, depending on your legal structure.

Part 3             	Follow-on relationships and
                     activities
So what type of relationship should an angel investor expect with an entrepreneur
after investment, and how much time should be devoted to post-investment
monitoring? One study from Germany shows that angels spend an average of 6.2
days per month working with investees, which comes out to 1.34 days per month




                                                                                                      GROUP OPERATIONS
on each investment.34 The answer for your group will depend to a great extent on
investment size, specifically the percentage of the round or the percentage of the
company acquired by the angel investor or angel group.

The first step in this section is to determine who among your angels will be involved with the
invested company. The selected person should be able to devote some time to monitoring
the company, including tracking the milestones your group has set for the company. Even if
your group does not take a board seat, someone should be responsible for monitoring the
entrepreneur informally.




                                                                                                      Part 3: Follow-on activities
Board seats
Taking the lead position in a funding round provides leverage to request a board seat
or board-observation rights. Whether an angel investor, or representative of an angel
fund or pooled investment, the decision to take a board seat depends on fit with existing
board members, skills needed on the board, investor recognition of the increased time
commitment, and possible increased liability exposure as a director. Whether the role is
board representative or observer, there should be an ongoing relationship and transparency
of data sharing. It is the sharing of information and communication of the good, the bad, and
the ugly that marks the nature of the angel experience.



Access to information
Outside of the more active role of board director, all angel investors should insist on
information rights, which include access to annual financial statements and annual reports.
Some investors ask for management visitation rights, and others request additional
information, such as all business plans, monthly or quarterly financials, and annual
operating plans. The amount and quality of information you receive will depend on your
desired level of involvement and the company’s willingness to share information with a
minority investor.

 mm   Technical skills or knowledge: Deep knowledge of a specific technology, industry, or
      business model is very valuable to young start-ups. Mentors can help entrepreneurs
      work through kinks in a product or service to give the company a competitive edge.
 mm   Knowledge of local environments: Mentors from different industries than those in
      which they are investing can still leverage their knowledge and connections in the
      ecosystem. Seasoned businesses men and women often know how to maneuver various
      business, legal, and operational challenges that the environment presents, and can
      help remove roadblocks for new companies.

The best angels are those who approach mentorship with a clear vision of how they can
add value to a start-up beyond a financial investment. For this reason, it is important that
entrepreneurs make their needs known and pitch for expertise, not just money. Here are
some steps you can take:

 mm   Make sure that your angel group encourages entrepreneurs to share their mentorship
      needs with you. This can be done formally during company presentations or informally
      during networking events. Entrepreneurs may be reluctant to admit they need help, or
      are unaware of what they lack. Do your best to express to entrepreneurs that the angels
      in your group have a wealth of experience, and by asking for specific expertise, the
      entrepreneurs can leverage the angels’ knowledge, connections, and passion, which




                                                                                                       Part 3: Follow-on activities
      will greatly improve the chances of their success.
 mm   Once the entrepreneur’s needs are known, angels should reflect on their own
      professional and personal experiences to determine what kind of additional value
      they can bring to the start-up. It could be specific industry experience, or a network of
      international business connections. It may be deep knowledge of a target market, or
      personal experience working with a specific business models or problems. No matter
      what you and the other angels bring to the table, the most important part is that the
      mentors can see how their contributions can benefit the company. If an angel cannot
      see a connection, it may be better to let someone else with more relevant experience
      mentor an entrepreneur.

What if there is significant mentor-entrepreneur mismatch?
Matching of entrepreneurs and mentors is not always easy. For example, some countries
may have burgeoning IT or mobile app entrepreneurs, but do not yet have a pool of
successful experts in these industries to provide mentorship. You may be interested in
investing in one of these companies but hesitate due to your lack of knowledge of the
industry. If you are facing this problem, you may want to tap into diaspora networks and
other international groups to find the right expertise.


How much time should I dedicate to mentorship?
There is no hard and fast rule on how much time angels should spend mentoring
entrepreneurs. It should be a function of the needs of the start-up and type of support you
give. Some angels spend as little as one hour a month working with an entrepreneur, while
others can spend up to six hours a week. Prioritize quality, not quantity, and be sure to
listen to entrepreneurs and ask tough questions that help them see their blind spots. Once
you begin working with the entrepreneur, you will organically see what works best.

                                             for the first three months after making an investment, totaling
                                             32 hours of mentorship from senior members of the business
                                             community. Then, strategic partners give specific advice on finance,

                                             basis. Any additional mentorship beyond that is left to the angels.

                                             interested in being mentors in the beginning, but through the
                                             mentorship program they have developed personal relationships

Role of angels in exits and follow-on financing
A major aspect of angel relationships with start-ups is securing follow-on financing and
planning for eventual exit by investors. Most angel groups plan for the provision of follow
on funding by reserving 100 to 200 percent of the original investment to support additional
rounds of funding. Few investors provide all the funding a company needs at one time,
preferring to match the funding with the company’s achievements. Such milestones can
include the completion of a prototype or the securing of the first customers. Even when
angels plan to bring in new funding from other sources, such as venture funds, it is a good
idea for the angels to reserve some funds to invest alongside the new investors. This allows
angels to get better terms, and it encourages the new investors to become involved if they

you think it will to be successful.” Thus, honest dialog among the stakeholders about timing
and amount of follow-on financing is key. Whether it is internal resources or searching for
new funders in the community, it is the responsibility of the angels to research and network
alternative funding sources until the company reaches cash break-even. Company founders
should inquire about the resources available from the angels, especially downstream
funders like private equity, banks and—if there are any in your community—venture
capitalists. Business plans should spell out future funding needs. Monthly meetings
between investors and entrepreneurs should include updates on funding and eventual exit

Exits
It is worth repeating that the most common exit for start-ups              GenKey acquires ClaimSync
is that they fail and close down. In these cases, investors can
                                                                           The acquisition of Ghanaian software

groups should prepare for this scenario during the contract
                                                                           can expect. ClaimSync is an Accra-
negotiations stage, and legal agreements and discussions
                                                                           based company that offers technology
should outline the responsibilities of each party if the start-up
                                                                           solutions to healthcare providers,
happens to goes under.
                                                                           such as electronic patient records
For companies that are successful, there are several ways to               and platforms to facilitate preparation
exit and generate returns for investors:                                   and payment of medical claims. In
                                                                           October 2013, ClaimSync was acquired
 mm   Trade sale/acquisition: This is the most likely exit for             by GenKey, a Netherlands-based
      angels, especially as established companies in developed             company that provides biometric identity

      Ventures Mexico has exited this way on two occasions,
      providing investors with an internal rate of return of more
      than 26 percent.
 mm   Fund acquisitions: There is a possibility that other fund managers may be interested in
      buying shares from current investors, giving angels an opportunity to exit. If you think
      this may be a possibility, be sure to include language explaining this option in your
      contractual agreements.




Group Operations — Part 3: Follow-on relationships and activities                                                     67
      mm   Buyback: At some point in the growth of the business, founders may wish to buy back
           shares to increase their controlling stake in the company. Companies usually offer to
           buy back the shares at a premium to compensate investors.
      mm   Dividend or royalties: When none of the above-mentioned options is likely, a dividend or
           royalty model can provide investors with returns of about 5 to 8 percent annually. While
           not ideal for such a high-risk investment, this is at least a realistic option in markets
           that have not yet attracted larger industry players or fund managers.
      mm   Initial public offering (IPO): IPOs are rare, even in highly developed markets. Stock
           exchanges in places like Brazil, China, India, and Russia are seeing more IPOs, but most
           countries do not have the financial infrastructure to support such offerings or enough
           companies that are ready to go public.



     Legal concerns
     As mentioned throughout this guidebook, some angel groups operate in countries that
     lack investor protection or strong judicial systems to uphold the rule of law. Investors are
     at risk of losing their money to entrepreneurs who fail to hold up their end of a contractual
     agreement. Research by the Kauffman Foundation and interviews with angel groups
     conclude that contracts and agreements can be effective in these contexts, as long as
     investors are willing to commit time to developing relationships with entrepreneurs and
     providing oversight.

     Cambodia is one example of a country that lacks some components of investor protections
     typically found in more mature economies. An informal angel group operating there has
     executed contracts with start-ups, even though both parties know that legal recourse
     is unlikely. What makes the written agreement effective is that it allows angels and
     entrepreneurs to talk through various scenarios and agree how each party should handle a
     potential disagreement. The contract provides for arbitration procedures that should allow
     for dispute resolution outside of the judicial system. The process clarifies expectations on
     both sides, and the threat of legal recourse can deter unethical behavior in some cases.
     Angels are also active mentors as they know that a strong, trusting relationship, also acts as
     an informal insurance.



     Measuring success
     There are many ways for angels to measure success. Your group should have several
     metrics that make sense in your local context and which do not speak solely of financial
     returns, as it could take years before you see any financial benefit from your investments.
     Other short-term metrics could be the number people who are interested in joining your
     group, and the satisfaction levels among members. On the qualitative side you can observe
     if there is an improvement in members’ understanding of angel investing and if internal
     operations are improving. The number of quality deals seeking funding from your group is
     a fantastic indicator as well. If your group has a socially focused mission to support your
     community, you can also measure the number of entrepreneurs that are getting funding
     and their ability to grow companies and create jobs. After a few years, your group can then
     start counting the number of successful exits and returns. Whatever your goals, it is good
     practice to identify what success will look like for your group.

¦   Summary
          Summary
          This discussion of angel group operations may have left you
          wondering how to pull everything together successfully. The
          appendices should help you with many of the mechanical
          processes. Also knowing that many other angel groups have
          started and continue to operate successfully should give you
          comfort that you are not alone. The Building the Framework
          section of the guidebook took you through the formation process,
          keeping in mind, at all steps, the purpose of your investment
          and steering you in the right direction in terms of structure and
          membership. Similarly, the Group Operations part covered the
          investment process once the group is operating. To summarize
          the investment process from the operations perspective, here
          are a few simple rules that will help, regardless of structure or
          process.

           m   Keep the terms simple if follow-on funding will become necessary.
               Nothing can prevent follow-on funding faster than an overly
               complicated and burdensome ﬁrst round, which later investors
               must try to unwind, often demanding discounted values and other
               requirements to offset onerous or overreaching ﬁrst-round terms.
           m   Reserve an investment amount if you expect to support the next
               round of funding. One of the biggest concerns for angel investors
               is lack of follow-on funding. In addition, entrepreneurs often need
               more funds than they originally expected in order to meet the goals
               connected to the funding round in which the group participated.
               You must plan for this possibility or work to help the company ﬁnd




                                                                                          SUMMARY
               the next round of funding; otherwise you have just thrown your
               investment away.
           m   Double-check due diligence and ask yourself: Are all areas
               covered? Was information objectively reviewed? Is the company
               structured appropriately for investment? Do you understand the
               reasons for investment? Do you understand the risks and potential
               for return on investment?




Summary                                                                              71
      mm   Be realistic. Investing in any venture has risk, and early-stage investing represents
           particularly high risk, with little or no company track record, no market, and unproven
           technology. An investor must have the capacity and willingness to lose his or her entire
           investment.
      mm   Do not put all your investment eggs in one basket. A balanced portfolio will help
           ease the pain of a bad investment decision. Do not expect all, or even most of your
           investments to be home runs. Statistics are not in your favor. Most angel investors
           continue this form of high-risk investing because their overall, long-term returns
           are positive, and because of personal satisfaction and an interest in working with
           entrepreneurs.

     As with the Building the Framework part of this guidebook, stay nimble and willing to
     accommodate your group’s changing needs. This means good up-front development with
     contingency planning. But most importantly, have fun. Enjoy the entrepreneurs you choose
     to work with or invest in, enjoy the investment process, and enjoy spending time with your
     group members.

                       Group Membership
                       Survey
[Group name] is interested in providing members with maximum beneﬁt, which is aligned with member interests.
One of the few ways we have to better understand these interests is to conduct membership surveys and carefully
review the results for trends, such as: 1) investment interests; 2) need for expertise among membership, and
3) membership skills which may be valuable to the group as well as portfolio companies. Individual data will be
treated conﬁdentially and will not be shared internally or externally; only selected board members will be privy to
individual responses. The survey results may be used in aggregate to present [group name] as an entity to venture
capitalists, businesses, and the media for the purpose of securing high-quality deal ﬂow, membership, and public
relations.

APPENDIX 6:
                        Funding Application
  [Note: Company applications should be limited to an executive summary or response to speciﬁc questions. Accepting entire
  business plans can be an exercise in futility as business plans often exceed 30 to 40 pages, in addition to attachments.
  Members seldom have the time the time or patience to read through numerous, lengthy business plans, and often the
  essential information needed for this initial screening step is not readily apparent in a large document.

  You should also have a page limit for the company application. Requiring answers to speciﬁc questions, as opposed to
  accepting executive summaries, gives greater assurance of receiving all information your screening committee desires
  in reviewing applications, but you risk losing the unique story-telling quality that an executive summary has, which often
  tells you much about management style and communication skills. Additionally, some companies will not want to take the
  time (or have the time) to answer a series of questions, and these are often the “hot deals” that do not need to go through
  additional processes to raise money. The brevity requirement may seem harsh, but through experience, companies able to
  clearly articulate their mission, product, market, and future in ﬁve pages or less have the greatest chance for success.]



Please submit your executive summary of NO MORE THAN FIVE PAGES (including attachments, appendices, and
exhibits, which contain information on the subjects identiﬁed below. Material beyond the ﬁve-page limit will not
be reviewed or considered. The list below is not intended to suggest any particular order of information; the

 Pre-emption       All shareholders will have a pro rata right, but not an obligation, based on their ownership of issued
                   capital, to participate in subsequent financings of the Company (subject to customary exceptions).
                   Any shares not subscribed for may be reallocated among the other shareholders. The Investors may
                   assign this right to another member of their fund group.

 Right of First    The Investors shall have a pro rata right, but not an obligation, based on their ownership of Ordinary
 Refusal and       Shares, to participate on identical terms in transfers of any shares of the Company, and a right of
 Co-Sale           first refusal on such transfers (subject to customary permitted transfers, including transfers by
                   Investors to affiliated funds). Any shares not subscribed for by the Investors would then be offered to

 Drag Along        In the event that the holders of a majority of the Ordinary Shares wish to accept an offer to sell all of
                   their shares to a third party, or enter into a Change of Control event of the Company, then subject to
                   the approval of the Lead Investor and the Board, all other shareholders shall be required to sell their
                   shares or to consent to the transaction on the same terms and conditions [subject to the liquidation
                   preference of the Lead Investor].

 Undertakings      consent of the Investors. A breach of any of the foregoing restrictive covenants or undertakings by a
                   Founder shall result in immediate dismissal for cause of such Founder.

 Founder Shares    Shares held by the Founders will be subject to reverse vesting provisions over three years as follows:

                   installments over the next two years]. If a Founder leaves the Company voluntarily or is dismissed for
                   cause, they shall offer for sale to the Company (with a secondary purchase option for the holders of
                   Seed Shares) any unvested shares at the lower of nominal value or subscription price. [There shall
                   be acceleration upon double trigger provisions so that if a Founder leaves after a Change of Control,
                   unvested shares may become vested.]

APPENDIX 11:
                       Guidance Note on
                       Sample Term Sheet
                        [Reproduced with permission of Archangel Informal Investment group, Scotland.]



The purpose of this guidance is to provide a narrative on the model term sheet, to highlight common legal and
practical issues that arise in relation to the term sheet and to provide guidance on how best to deal with these. The
term sheet is not intended to be exhaustive and will need to be tailored to the particular circumstances of each deal.
The term sheet should be used to assist in agreeing upon the terms of the deal and to ensure that all key points
in relation to the deal are discussed at an early stage. Further, the term sheet will be used to ensure that certain
matters (such as exclusivity, conﬁdentiality, and fees) are contractually agreed upon by the parties.

The term sheet has been designed to be used as an instruction sheet for the professional advisers involved in the
deal and has been drafted to include all relevant information that they will require. It is intended and recommended
that each party involved in the deal passes the completed term sheet to their advisers so each adviser receives the
same information.

It is a recommended good practice that all fundamental points in relation to the deal be included in the term sheet
and agreed upon at an early stage. Raising key and fundamental points later in discussions may increase the
amount of time involved in ﬁnalizing legal documents, cause unnecessary tension between parties, and increase
costs.

The term sheet and this guidance note are not a substitute for full legal advice. Appropriate legal and accountancy
advice should be taken for each deal.


General
Objective
The objective of the investment and the intended exit strategy should be discussed with the management team at
an early stage. This will ensure that the investors and management team are aware of the long term goal of the
investment and that there is a focus on an exit. The proposed exit should also be considered and provided for in the
business plan.


Investment
Lead Investor
The lead investor should be identiﬁed as early as possible and her/his remit should be clariﬁed and agreed upon. In
particular, it should be clear whether the lead investor has the authority to agree or not to matters relating to legal
documentation. This should prevent other investors (who are not directly involved in negotiating the documents)
                                                                                                                          APPENDICES



from raising additional matters later in the process that have been agreed to or negotiated by the lead investor. It is
important to set out early in the deal who has the authority to make decisions, who is pushing the deal forward, and
that all relevant contact details are included in the term sheet (particularly in syndicated deals).

Tranches
The investment may be provided in a number of ‘tranches’ (or separate stages) for which speciﬁc milestones
(such as the achievement of certain ﬁnancial targets) may be set. This helps investors reduce the risk involved




Appendices                                                                                                         101
in the investment and to incentivize the management of the company. If this is the case, the basic terms of this
arrangement should be set out in the term sheet. The investors may require further warranty protection on each
closing date of a tranched investment. Careful consideration should be given to how milestones will be measured
and that these details are included in the investment documents.

Options/ Warrants	
There are a number of different ways in which share options or warrants can be structured and again, this may be
a useful manner in which investors can minimize their risk/exposure in an investment. For example, a shareholder
or employee can be given the right to acquire shares at a later date (usually on an exit) for a price agreed upon
at the grant of the option/warrant. Brief details of any such provisions should be included in the term sheet with
full details being provided in the investment documentation. Full legal and accountancy/tax advice relating to the
structure of any such arrangement, should be taken both by the investee company and individual shareholders.

Loan/Loan Notes
The investment may comprise an equity investment (subscription for shares in the investee company) and a loan
element. The loan may be constituted by way of loan notes (which are often convertible into shares). If this is the
case, details should be included in the term sheet and further detail (relating to interest rates, repayment dates,
and conversion rights, etc.) should be included in the capitalization table of the term sheet. Again, full details of
these provisions will be included in the investment agreement and associated loan documentation. Full advice
should be taken about the structure of the investment to ensure that the most efficient and appropriate structure is
used (both from the company and shareholder perspective) and tax reliefs are not jeopardized.

Conditions Precedent
Key conditions precedent in relation to the deal should be identified at an early stage. The term sheet includes a
number of standard conditions precedent but these will need to be added to in light of the diligence carried out.
Any unusual or particularly onerous precedent conditions should be highlighted to the company as early in the
deal process as possible. Where other funding is being provided, and it is a condition that this is in place prior to
the investment being made, this should be made clear to all parties at an early stage and other parties should be
asked to ensure that funding is arranged appropriately. The management team should be instructed to contact the
company’s bank and organize all other funding (including grants and government-assisted loans) as soon as they
know that the deal is proceeding and well in advance of completion so that these matters do not delay completion.

Ratchets
No provision relating to ratchets has been included in the term sheet as it is fairly unlikely that a ratchet
mechanism will be used in a typical deal of this nature. Ratchets are performance related price adjustment
mechanisms designed as an incentive for owner managers. Mechanisms vary but generally ratchets have the effect
of increasing the amount of equity held by managers if certain targets are reached. Ideally these should be kept
as simple as possible and companies, investors, and their advisers should keep in mind the size of the deal and
the fact that complex price mechanisms may not be appropriate or helpful in the circumstances. However, these
mechanisms can be an effective incentive and a manner in which differences in opinion on the valuation of the
company between the investors and managers can be addressed. If ratchets or similar price mechanisms are to
be part of the deal, brief details of these provisions should be included in the term sheet and the structure of these
should be considered and agreed upon as early as possible. Again, full legal and accountancy/tax advice should be
taken in relation to the structure of any such price adjustment mechanism.

Return of Capital
It is fairly common for all investors and existing shareholders to rank equally on a return of capital (on winding
up/liquidation or otherwise); but if this is not the case (for example, if investors are to rank ahead of the existing
shareholders) this should be provided for. Investors should consider what rights they would expect on a return of
capital.

Legal Structure/Investor Rights
Investor Director/Observer
The composition of the board should be discussed at an early stage so that a clear management structure for
 the company going forward is agreed upon. Conﬁrmation of whether or not investor director(s) will be appointed
 should be discussed and any such investor-director should be carefully chosen to ensure that she/he adds value
 to the company. Remuneration or monitoring fee of any such investor director(s) should also be agreed upon.
 Replacement directors may be appointed by the investor majority. Investors may also require the right to appoint an
‘observer’ to attend board meetings.

Investor Majority/Investor Protections
Consideration should be given to what needs to be decided at board level with the approval of the investor-director
(usually matters of management) and what needs to be decided at shareholder level subject to the consent of the
investor majority (usually more fundamental matters). Although adequate investor protections should be included,
these should be kept to what is required to adequately protect the position of the investors and not go beyond this.
Full provisions relating to matters that will require investor consent or the consent of the investor-director are
included in the model investment agreement. Consideration should also be given to what will constitute an investor
majority and how, on a practical level, decisions will be made by the investors (particularly in syndicated deals).

Information Requirements
In order to protect the investment and to keep up to date with the business of the company, certain information
(both commercial and ﬁnancial) is required by the investor(s). The level of information required, the format in which
this is to be presented (that is, hard copy/email), how and to whom (whether all investors/angel group) it is to be
communicated should be discussed and agreed upon. Investors who are investing as part of a group should also
agree how this information will be circulated to the group.

Warranties
A warranty is a contractual representation or assurance as to the condition of the company. It is usual practice for
warranties to be provided by both the company and members of the management team. If the warranty turns out
to be wrong, investors can claim damages from warrantors. Appropriate warranties for the size and type of deal
should be sought from the management team and, usually, also the company. Common matters that need to be
warrantied has to be considered in light of the diligence exercise and nature of the company.

Management may seek to impose limitations on their liability under the warranties being provided (such as certain
time periods within which warranty claims must be made) but investors should ensure that they are able to recover
their full investment (plus costs and expenses if possible). The management team (and usually the company) should
be asked to give the warranties on a joint and several basis which is normal in investments of this nature (this
can be regulated between the management team by way of a contribution agreement if required). Members of the
management team may seek to limit the level of their liability (with regard to their salary) although whether or not
this is agreed upon will depend on the terms of the deal. This will need to be determined on a case by case basis.

The importance of thorough diligence cannot be emphasized enough and, although negotiating appropriate
warranties is important, in practice these are fairly seldom relied on and the most crucial exercise for investors
is to ensure that a thorough and appropriate diligence exercise has been carried out. As noted above, the
management team (and their advisers) should be encouraged to make disclosures as early as possible.
                                                                                                                           APPENDICES




Voting Rights and Dividends
As noted above, accountancy and tax advice should be taken at an early stage. Consideration should be given to the
voting rights attached to the shares (and these rights should tie in with the investor protections discussed above).
Appropriate controls over the payment of dividends should be sought. Consideration should be given to whether or
not a set percentage of proﬁts available for distribution should be paid each year.




Appendices                                                                                                           103
Drag Along/Tag Along
‘Drag along’ rights are commonly contained in investment documents and provide that a certain percentage of
 shareholders of a company, when accepting an offer to sell their shares, can force other shareholders to sell their
 shares on the same terms. Similarly, ‘tag along’ rights or ‘piggyback’ rights allow shareholders to force other
 shareholders who wish to sell their shares to ensure that their shares are also bought on the same terms.

Good Leaver/Bad Leaver
Good leaver and bad leaver provisions are used to tie the management team to the company by regulating how their
shares are valued when they leave the company, depending on the reason for their departure. A person is usually
deemed a bad leaver if she/he leaves within a certain period of time following completion or if he/she is dismissed.
A person is usually a good leaver if she/he leaves as a result of incapacity or retirement.

Although these provisions can be useful in incentivizing key members of the management team to remain with
the company, as with the price mechanism provisions discussed above, they should be kept as straightforward as
possible in light of the nature and size of the deal.


General
Disclosure Letter
A disclosure letter should be exhibited at least ten days prior to completion. Investors should encourage the
management team to ensure that the diligence process and disclosure letter are dealt with as early as possible to
avoid problems later. Set out a speciﬁc date in the term sheet to encourage early disclosure. This should prevent
any tension or issues arising as a result of material issues being disclosed at the last minute, and allows investors
to consider any warranties that are required.


Other
Exclusivity/Conﬁdentiality/Fees
Investors should ensure they have a period of exclusivity (during which the company cannot negotiate or discuss a
deal with any other party) for an appropriate length of time.

Conﬁdentiality provisions should be formally agreed upon to protect all parties negotiating the investment. These
should be formalized at an early stage (using the term sheet).

Given that investors will invest time and incur costs during the diligence process, provisions for fees should be
formally agreed upon at the term sheet stage. It is usual practice for the investors’ fees to be met by the company.
Consideration should be given to who will meet the fees if the investment does not proceed to completion. This is
often the company unless the investors have withdrawn from the investment.

Accountants
Investors should take accountancy and tax advice early in the deal process to ensure that the deal is structured in
the most efﬁcient manner possible.

Bankers
The management team should be advised that the company’s bankers should be contacted as early as possible
in the deal to ensure that all necessary consents and other documents (such as letters of non-crystallization) are
obtained when required and do not delay completion of the deal. These documents can take some time to obtain, so
this should be anticipated.

APPENDIX 12:
                        Mentorship for Equity
                        Contract Template
The example Adviser agreement is not a substitute for full legal advice and appropriate legal and accountancy
advice should be taken for each deal.


                                         Example Adviser Agreement
    This Founder Adviser Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into the date set forth on the signature page by
and between the undersigned company (the “Company”) and the undersigned Adviser (the “Adviser”).

The parties agree as follows:

    1.   Services. Adviser agrees to act as a mentor or Adviser to the Company and provide advice and assistance
         to the Company from time to time as further described in Schedule A attached hereto or as otherwise
         mutually agreed to by the parties (collectively, the “Services”).

    2.   Compensation. Adviser shall not be entitled to receive cash compensation; however, Adviser shall be
         entitled to receive the equity compensation indicated on the signature page hereto at an exercise price
         equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Ordinary Shares, which will be documented in the
         applicable Stock Option Agreement or Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement to be entered into by Adviser
         and the Company.

    3.   Expenses. The Company shall reimburse Adviser for reasonable and documented travel and related
         expenses incurred in the course of performing services hereunder, provided, however, that all such
         expenses shall be approved by Company. The Adviser shall email a request for approval including
         documentation detailing the nature of the expense and amount requested to the Company, when possible,
         in advance of incurring any such expense.

    4.   Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall continue until terminated by either party for any
         reason upon thirty (30) days prior written notice without further obligation or liability.

    5.   Independent Contractor. Adviser’s relationship with the Company will be that of an independent contractor
         and not that of an employee. Except for the compensation set forth in paragraph 2 above, Adviser will not
         be eligible for any employee beneﬁts, nor will the Company make deductions from payments made to
         Adviser for employment or income taxes, all of which will be Adviser’s responsibility. Adviser will have no
         authority to enter into contracts that bind the Company or create obligations on the part of the Company
         without the prior written authorization of the Company.

    6.   Nondisclosure of Conﬁdential Information.
                                                                                                                        APPENDICES




         a.   Agreement Not to Disclose. Adviser agrees not to use any Conﬁdential Information (as deﬁned below)
              disclosed to Adviser by the Company or its representatives for Adviser’s own use or for any purpose
              other than to carry out discussions concerning, and the undertaking of, the Services. Adviser agrees
              to take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure or use of Conﬁdential
              Information of the Company in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession




Appendices                                                                                                       105
              of persons other than agents of the Company or persons to whom the Company consents to such
              disclosure. Upon request by the Company, any materials or documents that have been furnished by the
              Company to Adviser in connection with the Services shall be promptly destroyed or returned by Adviser
              to the Company.

          b.	 Definition of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means any information, technical
              data or know-how (whether disclosed before or after the date of this Agreement), including, but
              not limited to, information relating to business and product or service plans, financial projections,
              customer lists, business forecasts, sales and merchandising, human resources, patents, patent
              applications, computer object or source code, research, inventions, processes, designs, drawings,
              engineering, marketing or finance to be confidential or proprietary or which information would, under
              the circumstances, appear to a reasonable person to be confidential or proprietary. Confidential
              Information does not include information, technical data or know-how that: (i) is in the possession
              of Adviser at the time of disclosure, as shown by Adviser’s files and records immediately prior to the
              time of disclosure; or (ii) becomes part of the public knowledge or literature, not as a direct or indirect
              result of any improper inaction or action of Adviser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Adviser may
              disclose Confidential Information with the prior written approval of the Company or pursuant to the
              order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental body.

  7.	 No Rights Granted. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights under any patent,
          copyright or other intellectual property right of the Company, nor shall this Agreement grant Adviser any
          rights in or to the Company’s Confidential Information, except the limited right to use the Confidential
          Information in connection with the Services.

      8.	 Assignment of Intellectual Property. To the extent that Adviser jointly or solely conceives, develops or
          reduces to practice any new inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how,
          improvements or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws
          or other intellectual property which would be deemed to be Confidential Information of the Company
          (collectively, “Intellectual Property”) which clearly relates to the Company’s business or technology and has
          been created by the Adviser solely in the course of the performance of Services such as in correspondence,
          e-mails, or meetings relating to the Company, Adviser hereby acknowledges that it is “work made for
          hire” for the benefit of the Company and hereby assigns all rights, titles, and interest to such Intellectual
          Property to the Company.

      9.	 Duty to Assist. As requested by the Company and only with respect to Intellectual Property created
          by Adviser for the Company as provided in paragraph 8 above, Adviser shall take all steps reasonably
          necessary to assist the Company in obtaining and enforcing in its own name any such Intellectual Property
          right. Adviser’s obligation to assist the Company shall continue beyond the termination of Adviser’s
          relationship with the Company, but the Company shall compensate Adviser at a reasonable rate after
          the termination of such relationship for time actually spent at the Company’s request providing such
          assistance.

  10.	 No Conflicts. Adviser represents that Adviser’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement and provision
          of Services hereunder will not violate any duty which Adviser may have to any other person or entity (such
          as a present or former employer), and Adviser agrees that Adviser will not do anything in the performance
          of Services hereunder that would violate any such duty. In addition, Adviser agrees that, during the term
          of this Agreement, Adviser shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any direct competitor of the
          Company which Adviser is also performing services. It is understood that in such event, the Company will
          review whether Adviser’s activities are consistent with Adviser remaining as an Adviser of the Company and
          shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion.

    11.	 Miscellaneous. Any term of this Agreement may be amended or waived only with the written consent of
        the parties. So long as the Adviser continues to serve as an Adviser to the Company, the Adviser hereby
        consents to the Company including his or her name on its marketing materials, website or private
        placement memo, or offering materials as an Adviser of the Company. This Agreement, including any
        schedules hereto, constitute the sole agreement of the parties and supersedes all oral negotiations and
        prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof. The validity, interpretation, construction and
        performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of [YOUR COUNTRY], without giving effect to
        the principles of conflict of laws. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
        deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
