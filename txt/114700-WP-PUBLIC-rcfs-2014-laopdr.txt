Introduction to the Recovery Framework
Case Study Series


The World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is
working with United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the European Union
(EU) to develop a Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF) Guide that will help governments
and partners in planning for resilient post disaster recovery that contributes to longer
term sustainable development. For the guide to be based on global good practices, it
requires gleaning them from country experiences of disaster recovery and then clearly
establishing and articulating these practices. Hence, the development of the RF Guide
includes the conduct of country-level and thematic case studies on disaster recovery.

     These case studies have been designed to collect and analyze information on:
i) disaster recovery standards and principles adapted by countries for specific disasters;
ii) means adopted by countries for planning recovery including efforts, considerations
and provisions (if any) for making such recovery efficient, equitable and resilient; iii)
policies, institutions and capacities put in place by countries to implement and monitor
disaster recovery; and iv) ways and means adopted by countries to translate the gains of
resilient recovery into longer-term risk reduction and resilient development.

     Importantly, these case studies aim to learn from, and not evaluate, country
reconstruction initiatives. Best practices and learnings from each country’s experience
will be used to inform the Guide. Additionally, the case studies examine the planning
processes and not the implantation details of recovery experiences. As such, they do
not seek to offer a comprehensive account of the recovery program as it unfolded, but
rather provide details and insight into the decision-making processes for reconstruction
policies and programs.

                                 1. Introduction
                                 1.1	Background
                                 In 2011, the World Reconstruction Conference recommended the development of an international
                                 best practice Recovery Framework Guide to assist governments and partner agencies in delivering
                                 effective and efficient post-disaster recovery programs. In application, the Disaster Recovery
                                 Framework (DRF) Guide is intended to complement the government-led Post-disaster Needs
                                 Assessment (PDNA) process – an assessment method that presents damages and losses in a
                                 consolidated report.

                                      The DRF Guide will include: global thematic case studies that capture and analyze how
                                 disaster recovery standards and principles are adopted; methods adopted for planning
                                 efficient and resilient recovery; lessons learned on policy, institutions, and local capacity;
                                 as well as ways in which recovery is translated into long-term disaster risk reduction and
                                 development. Ten countries, including the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),
                                 were identified for country-level case studies on disaster recovery.

                                     This Country Case Study focuses on the recovery and reconstruction experience of Lao
                                 PDR during recent disasters including typhoons Kestana (2009), Haima/Nok-Ten (2011)
                                 and the most recent 2013 flood events. The Country Case Study assesses the disaster
                                 recovery process in Lao PDR across four thematic areas outlined in the Recovery Framework
                                 Guidelines:

                                 ■■ Institutional arrangements to implement and manage recovery;
                                 ■■ Policy, planning and prioritization for recovery;
                                 ■■ Designing, costing, and financing recovery; and
                                 ■■ Monitoring and evaluation for disaster recovery.

                                     Within this framework, an analysis of the transport sector has been undertaken.
                                 Examples from two provinces – Salavan (affected by Ketsana) and Bolikhamxay (affected
                                 by Haima and Nok-Ten) are also provided.

                                     The Case Study has been informed by a combination of secondary data analysis and
                                 national and provincial-level stakeholder consultation. The overarching objectives of
                                 the Case Study are two-fold: to inform the global guidelines and to provide a basis for
                                 operationalizing the Disaster Recovery Framework in the local Lao PDR context.

                                    1.2	 Lao PDR Context
                                    In Lao PDR, the most common natural disasters are floods and droughts. Floods occur annually
                                    between May and September, caused by heavy rainfall from the annual southwest and northeast
                                    monsoons. Droughts, caused by significant changes in monsoon patterns, are becoming more
                                    frequent and lasting longer. Between 2009 and 2013 Lao PDR had an unprecedented number of
                                    natural disasters, claiming lives and causing widespread damage.

                                         On September 19, 2009, Typhoon Ketsana hit the five southernmost provinces of Lao PDR:
                                    Savannakhet, Salavan, Attapeu, Sekong, and Champassak. Ketsana brought severe flooding that
                                    affected over 180,000 people (23% of the population in these provinces) and resulted in 28 storm
                                    related deaths (GOL 2009). Flash flooding in mountainous areas and river overflow onto low
                                    lying areas of the Sekong River basin, caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure
                                    worth an estimated LAK 4.1 trillion (US$5.185 billion) (NDMO 2013). The worst affected areas
                                    were not accessible for up to three weeks. Many of the affected population were extremely poor
                                    and vulnerable. This high magnitude flood was the first of its kind in the area for over 50 years.
                                    The Government of Lao PDR (GOL) mounted a significant response and recovery operation, with
                                    support from the international community. This devastating event highlighted the country’s
                                    vulnerability to natural hazards and underscored the need to strengthen national and provincial
                                    level capacity in DRM.

                                         Since Ketsana a number of additional high magnitude flood events associated with typhoons
                                    or tropical depressions have occurred.

                                          In 2011 tropical storms Haima (June) and Nok-Ten (August) both hit central Lao PDR with
                                    devastating effects. Haima caused widespread flooding in 12 provinces, affected 429,954 people
                                    (Women 218,154 persons), 82,493 households, 1.790 villages, 96 districts and 42 persons were
                                    killed. The flood also severely damaged people houses and infrastructures, costing around 1.8
                                    billion Kips (US$174 million) (NDMO 2013).

                                         In 2013, a series of five major storm events crossed the country resulting in severe flooding
                                    in 12 of the country’s 17 provinces. According to a report to the National Assembly, approximately
                                    350,000 people were affected, with 29 storm-related deaths and 77 reported injuries. Loss and
                                    damages were estimated at LAK 2.2 trillion (US$219 million) (NDPCC 2013).

LAO PDR Strengthening institutional capacities for resilient recovery



A Snapshot of Good Practices
and Lessons Learned




The DRF Guide will complement the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) by using its outputs to help governments
develop comprehensive, integrated, multi-sectoral recovery plans and management strategies. The DRF Guide
addresses key elements such as: (a) Institutional framework for recovery; (b) Policy making and planning for recovery
programs; (c) Costing and financing recovery programs, and; (d) Managing recovery and monitoring the delivery of
results. Over time, the DRF is intended help improve government readiness for disaster recovery. By following the
Guide, disaster recovery will be seen not as a short-term, remedial response, but an opportunity to build resilience and
contribute to long-term development.

The Guide is being developed as a completely practice-based tool with input from: (a) an International Advisory Group
(IAG), composed of senior international experts with first-hand recovery management experience; (b) a Technical
Working Group (TWG), including professionals from the World Bank, UNDP, EU, and other stakeholder partners with
practical expertise in various aspects of recovery, and; (c) a series of national-level and thematic case studies that will
synthesize various global recovery experiences. The stakeholder engagement process encourages government officials,
civil society organizations, and private sector entities familiar with large-scale recovery efforts, to collaborate in the
development and dissemination of the DRF Guide. The DRF Guide is scheduled to be launched at the Second World
Reconstruction Conference.
