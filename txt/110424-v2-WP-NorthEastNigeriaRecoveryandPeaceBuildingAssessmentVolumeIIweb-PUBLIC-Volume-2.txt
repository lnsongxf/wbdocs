tion or training opportunities and have few employment prospects.
Supporting youth is a key element of sustainable recovery and peace
building in the North-East. The RPBA response strategies need to
be designed with the input of young people and include initiatives
addressing young men’s and women’s needs and concerns; promote
inter-generational dialogue and youth involvement in the arts and
sports to enhance social cohesion; promote youth participation in lo-
cal and national governance processes and policy making; and address
livelihoods and vocational training for young people.


5.4 Explosive Remnants of War
The use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and victim-activated
IEDs, also considered as land mines in this context, has been wide-
spread in the context of the crisis with Boko Haram. Military activities
have also employed aerial bombardment and the use of artillery, mor-
tars and rockets, which inevitably leads to widespread contamination
by unexploded ordnance (UXO). This situation affects possibilities of
return of IDPs and puts under risks the lives of local populations in
areas affected by the crisis. To address these issues various initiatives
will need to be undertaken, including Emergency Risk Education
campaigns, a systematic survey coupled with risk education and ex-
plosive ordnance disposal/demining and medical/rehabilitation and
psycho-social care for those affected by IEDs/UXOs.

1.3 Assessment Scope and Methodology
The assessment comprised a desk review of existing primary and
secondary data, and semi-structured interviews and focus group dis-
cussions. Key informants and focus group discussion participants

levels, including the Vice President’s Office, Ministries of Education,
Finance, Health, Justice, Local Governance and Chieftaincy Affairs,
Youth and Sports, Women Affairs, the State Emergency Management
Agencies (SEMA) and State Attorney Generals. International NGOs,
local non government organisations (NGOs), civil society organisa-

gender-based crimes and crimes against children. This will require
mainstreaming the roles of women, youth, traditional and commu-

Structural conflict drivers such as poor governance and weak rule of
law will not be addressed unless community needs and participation
are embedded in recovery programming. Strengthening accepted
grievance redress mechanisms, with appropriate capacitation to en-

the availability of all forms of grievance redress should start with an

6. Costing Peace Building, Stability and
Social Cohesion Component
The costing of the implementation of the suggested activities under
this component has been calculated based on a number of assump-
tions. These include:

(i)      Overlapping costing items among the three components (i.e.
         physical infrastructure and humanitarian support needed to ad-
         dress the immediate needs of IDPs) were not included as costed
         items in this component;
(ii) costing for this component does not include project manage-
         ment costing. The only costing as ‘personnel’ is for technical
         staff; and
(iii) ‘Support to community cohesion platforms’ is included under
         sub-component 3 but it is a mechanism put in place to support
         all subcomponents as per the implementation model in Figure
         1.2.

through customized sector templates. This was supplemented by in-
dependent secondary data collection by the RPBA team from other
sources. Data validation techniques included field inspection visits,
interviews with relevant stakeholders such as civil society, and desk
reviews. Remote sensing data was used to analysis damages in edu-

private enterprise, both for data gap filling and corroboration. Fur-

      1.4 Key Assumptions, Constraints and Limitations
Several key assumptions, constraints and limitations are applicable to
all sectors under the Infrastructure and Social Services Component.
These include:

• Where possible, the analysis of damages and needs is disaggregated
       at the State level, and collated from the Local Government Author-
       ity (LGA) level.
• As a result of limited access to some of the heavily affected areas
       for data gathering and verification, the sector teams used relative to
       baseline analyses where inventory based damage data was not avail-

2.3 Energy
Historically, power supply in Nigeria was provided by a vertically in-
tegrated government monopoly that generated, transmitted and dis-
tributed electricity. Reform began in 2001 with the adoption of the
National Electric Power Policy, followed by the Electric Power Sector
Reform Act (EPSRA) in 2005. In accordance with EPSRA, the Power
Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) was unbundled into six gen-
eration companies (GenCos), one transmission company (TransCo),
and 11 distribution companies (DisCos). These were to operate as
separate companies in preparation for eventual privatization (DisCo

as self-supply. Urban growth is out-stripping new water connections
and with the current trend, the service coverage may drop below 30
percent within 10 years, and only 20 percent of the urban residents
will have a direct water connection. While this data is from 2011,
2012 and 2013, it gives a picture of the situation pre-crisis in the
North-East.

Based on data provided by the North-East States, typical water fa-
cilities include protected wells (nearly 30 percent); hand pump, mo-
torised, and solar powered boreholes (nearly 70 percent); and others
such as piped scheme (less than 1 percent) in the directly affected
LGAs. The sanitation infrastructure is largely based on on-site sanita-
tion facilities, predominantly comprising of pit latrines in households
as well as in institutions and public places. Pour flush latrines exists
in very few institutional settings. In urban areas, centralised sewer-
age systems with sewer networks and treatment plants do not exist,
even in cities in the North-East. Faecal sludge management is not
organised and regulated and services are largely provided by private
informal and formal providers.

Persistent challenges to the water and sanitation sector cut across a
weak and divergent policy framework including:

• a lack of political will for policy implementation with most states
     yet to develop state-specific WASH policies;
• low autonomy of WASH institutions and lack of accountabili-
     ty framework;
• lack of harmonized approach for planning, budgeting and invest-
     ment mobilisation;
• weak institutional arrangements, especially at the sub-national lev-
     els with absence of statutory WASH institutions in about a quar-
     ter of the states whilst LGA WASH Departments exist in only six
     states across the entire country;
• coordination mechanisms are weak (both for development and
     emergency programming);
• participation of non-government actors (private sector and civil
     society organizations) is still nascent;
• inefficient subsidies from states and poor cost recovery;

damages to houses and assets. Economic impacts of housing damage
were calculated based on the average values of permanent and tem-
porary houses, and average value of household assets provided by the
various state agencies. For each state, the average value varied across
LGAs. For example, in the State of Borno, the average value of per-
manent houses ranged from N600,000 to N5,500,000, temporary
houses ranged from N100,000 to N800,000 and the average value
of housing assets ranged from N160,000 to N850,000. Based on
the values provided by states, the direct financial loss due to housing
damage is estimated at US$ 3,329 million across the six states (Figure
2.10). While not included in the damage, additional expenditure has
been incurred by a large percentage of IDPs for rental costs.

(US$ 25.1 million in damages)

In 2011, in response to the conflict, the National Communications
Commission (NCC) required all mobile phone subscribers to register
their subscriber identity modules (SIMs). During March 2011-Jan-
uary 2012, NCC registered SIMs, and required unregistered SIMs
to be deactivated. In subsequent months, conflict heavily targeted
telecommunications infrastructure, particularly base stations (or base
transceiver stations, or BTSs) used for creating a mobile phone net-
work. In 2012, attacks were reported on base stations in four North-

In addition to direct damages to infrastructure, the conflict has had
other impacts to the ICT sector. In the summer of 2013, the Nigerian
military, as part of its operations against Boko Haram, shut down
GSM mobile telephones in the three North-East States of Adamawa,

approximately 60 percent of the baseline stock. Of this about 94 per-

and ministry buildings. These four categories share nearly 82 percent
of the total damage. Also, key to note is that prisons, police stations,
cultural/historical houses and other buildings all have over 80 percent
of the baseline (2010) stock damaged.

Due to the paucity of the State level economic and employment data
related to disruptions of government activities, it is difficult to esti-
mate the economic loss due to loss of workforce and disruptions in
public administration and decision making, as well as additional ex-
penditure incurred by the State and Local Governments for operating
from makeshift facilities, etc. For example, many LGA offices have
moved to the State Capitals due to lack of office spaces and they work
in makeshift arrangements.

of property must take into consideration that women are historically
impoverished and disadvantaged (owning only 4 percent of the land
in the North-East) and must be included when resources are being
disbursed regardless of past ownership history. Support for the CSOs
working to improve women’s financial inclusion and literacy will help
more women access existing credit facilities for agriculture and build
capacity in managing finances. Gender considerations will also be key
in the design of private enterprise and livelihood interventions.

Many youth in the North-East fall under the Not in Education,
Employment or Training (NEET) category. Sectors including ag-

provide cash for work opportunities to young people.

Community infrastructure and non-formal services are important
for local communities, but yet challenging to make exact estimation
of needs. Therefore a contingency has been added to cater for com-
munity infrastructure and non-formal services, which is particularly
relevant for the education, health and nutrition, public buildings,
transport, water and sanitation sectors. This accounts for example
for non-formal or traditional education and schools as well as locally
managed community infrastructure, such as community centres or
local pathways, which are not yet specified in the assessment. It also
accounts for a security premium, which for example relates to higher

excluding schools and health facilities as these are covered in their re-

populations hosting IDPs. The recovery strategy will gradually move
from stabilization phase through early and medium term recovery
and thereby transit from emergency to medium-term development
leading to the eventual attainment of SDG-6 targets in 2030. The re-
covery strategy will comprise the following key elements: (i) provision
of immediate relief through Repairs, Reconstruction and rehabilita-

bridging of infrastructure needs in affected communities and address-
ing infrastructure deficits in communities hosting IDPs; (iii) build-

adaptive technology options are used and built to standard; (iv) com-

water and sanitation infrastructure deficits as well as the prevailing
poor sanitation and hygiene practices among the affected population.

3.2.3 Livelihood Impacts on Host Communities

Large-scale displacement also causes significant stress for the host
communities and family members supporting IDPs. Displacement
created greater competition for access to basic services and natural
resources, as well as disruption to livelihoods and lack of access to
markets and agricultural land. Already poor host communities have
been sharing resources with one of the largest IDP populations in the
world (comparable to Yemen) for more than 12 months with little
support, and are now relying on negative coping strategies after sav-
ings and assets have been used up. More than 90 percent of IDPs live
in host communities with relatives or friends or in accommodations
they rent or can use free of charge. Only the remaining few (less than
10 percent) are staying in formal IDPs camps managed and assisted
by the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and/or
the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) or in spontaneous
self-made camps within hosting communities. The displacement situ-
ation is playing heavily on the situation of host communities, whose
generous hospitality is overstretched due to the duration and great
numbers of IDPs to host.76

The overall economic situation in host communities is in an alarming
state. Supplies reach communities only in a reduced manner because
of partly inaccessible transport routes due to insecurity or destruction
through violent attacks. The cohabitation of IDPs and hosting popu-
lation is under more and more pressure due to limited resources such

The North-East has suffered tremendously in the past six years. We have all been witness
to the destruction of infrastructure, farmlands, businesses and trades, of schools and
the loss of school years. Rebuilding, restoring and rehabilitating what has been lost or
damaged will cost money and time.

...the tasks before us are many and profound but paramount: to fix brick and mortar
and to mend hearts and minds damaged by senseless, murderous violence.

            About the Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA):

On 21 August 2015, the Government of Nigeria requested assistance in assessing the needs associated
with peace building and crisis recovery. Support has been provided in accordance with the 2008 Joint
European Union (EU) – United Nations (UN) – World Bank (WB) Declaration on crisis assessment
and recovery planning. A Recovery and Peace Building Assessment was initiated and findings are
presented in this report.

The Recovery and Peace Building Assessment (RPBA) informs a collective vision and strategy on peace
building and recovery, and provides a framework for coordinated and coherent support to assist con-
flict-affected people in the North-East. The assessment covers the six States of Borno, Yobe, Adamawa,
Gombe, Taraba, and Bauchi, and provides an overarching framework for stability, peace building, and
recovery.

The RPBA is founded on the recognition that a durable resolution to the conflict in the North-East
requires addressing the structural and underlying drivers of violent conflict. This understanding has
also underpinned the identification and prioritisation of needs presented in this report.
