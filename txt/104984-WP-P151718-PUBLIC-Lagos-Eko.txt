This case study was written by Sabrina Roshan, Roland Lomme, Halimatou Hima and Claudio Santibanez as part of the Delivery Case
Studies series produced by the World Bank’s Nigeria Country Team under the guidance of Olatunde Adetoyese Adekola and Katherine
Bain. The Delivery Case Studies series—part of the Doing Development Differently initiative—aims to generate knowledge on what
works in Nigeria and why. These cases are among a number of instruments being piloted to help the World Bank continually improve its
effectiveness as a partner to Nigeria. The Doing Development Differently pilot is task managed by Katherine Bain in the Governance Global
Practice. The authors are grateful to Indira Konjhodzic for comments and support on earlier drafts. They also acknowledge the invaluable
feedback provided by national stakeholders, including the former Project Coordinator and Special Assistant to the Governor, Ronke Azeez
as well as editorial support from Amanda Green. The paper does not represent the views of the World Bank’s Board of Directors, and any

2	     According to the Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), the net attendance ratio (NAR) indicates participation in schooling
       among those of official school age (6–11 for primary and 12–17 for secondary). The gross attendance ratio (GAR) indicates school
       attendance among youth of any age, from 5 to 24, and is expressed as a percentage of the school-age population for that schooling
       level, although technically the GAR is not a percentage. The GAR is nearly always higher than the NAR for the same level, because the
       GAR includes participation by youth who are older or younger than the official age range for that level.

Note: The project was set to close on December 31, 2015. The government requested a six-month extension in additional
financing to June 30, 2016. The rationale, as captured in the September 2015 Aide Memoire, was the delay in project effectiveness
and implementation as a result of school closures due to the Ebola Virus Disease, the recent change in government, the
retention of a new project coordinator, and the need to disburse the remaining/committed funds for the following activities:
disaggregated analysis of 2015 test results to justify the increase in performance compared to 2014, monitoring and evaluation of
