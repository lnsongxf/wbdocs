1.2 Key Development Result

Despite the political uncertainty and the security challenges that weigh on regional economic activity, IFC advisory
service programs were able to support our clients in delivering strong results across MENA. Thanks to strong
commitment from our clients combined with financial support from international development partners and
collaboration with the World Bank, joint interventions have multiplied the developmental impact of our projects.


In fiscal year 2014, IFCs advisory clients have delivered over 1 million loans to MSMEs, more than half of which went
to women-owned businesses, mostly micro enterprises. Through these loans, nearly $4 billion dollars in financing
was funneled to micro, small, and medium enterprises, which make up the majority of firms in our region, but
which all too often have difficulty accessing finance. In addition to enhancing access to credit, we also helped our
client financial institutions add 400,000 new depositor accounts, thus delivering increased access to other financial
services which are crucial to helping small enterprises grow. In addition to access to financial services, we worked
to help our clients deliver other services that firms need to grow, such as management and corporate governance
training. When we surveyed beneficiaries of this work, over 1000 individual SMEs reported that these services
helped improve the performance of their business.


Our work in helping to increase the use of mediation to speed up the resolution of disputes among businesses
has continued to pay dividends, as clients that we have helped train reported settling 587 cases this year which
released nearly $300 million dollars back into the economy. While the time and fees saved by business owners due
to regulatory and alternative dispute resolution reforms supported by IFC projects is estimated at over $74 million
(please see methodological notes for details on this estimation).


However not all the results of the year have met expectations. Our work with firms to adopt resource-saving
technologies has seen much lower than expected results due, in part, to the slow speed of change in the highly
subsidized prices of key resources like electricity and water, in many markets. The good news is that several
governments such as Egypt recently, have now begun to make these changes and the private sector is finally
becoming seriously interested in the savings offered by cleaner technologies. We restructured our work in this area
and are pursuing more targeted industry strategies which appear to be working as we have now signed two new
agreements with clients in this FY.

    1.3 Regional Coverage

    We continue to offer our services where we see market need and client interest. We have increased our presence
    in selected countries and remain committed to operating in fragile and conflict-affected states in areas where we
    believe we can have impact. While support for inclusive green growth and infrastructure development concentrates
    on economies where market conditions and government interest is supportive, our work in advisory activities
    to favor MSME development cover the vast majority of the regional countries (lower-, middle- and high-income
    countries, and fragile and conflict affected states).

1.4 Future Prospects

The Middle East and North Africa continues to be a priority region for IFC and we believe that the focus of our
programs address the core challenges of the region. Therefore, we do not plan to dramatically change our strategy
and focus areas for the program over the next year.


Given the extremely challenging situation in many countries in our region, we expect to continue to face difficulties
in the implementation of our programs, whether these are due directly to violent confrontations (as has happened
to some of our clients operating in West Bank and Gaza, for example) or due to the knock on effects of political
and social unrest. However, we also see increasing political stability and greater strategic clarity from governments
in some markets which we believe will result in opportunities to be more ambitious in our program in these
economies. Given these realities, we may decide to ramp up or slow down particular activities in particular markets.
We will of course discuss these changes with our partners in each case.




                                                                                      OVERVIEW OF FISCAL YEAR 2014      5
             2. Areas of Intervention and Results




    A weak regulatory environment and limited access to credit hinder micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs),
    key players in the push for economic development. Inclusive growth also requires a transformative approach to
    clean energy and resource efficiency. At the same time, MENA's young workforce must be equipped with skills that
    match the needs of a competitive job market. Reforms that address these impediments can accelerate productivity,
    boost private sector investment, and export competitiveness. Most importantly, these reforms can create jobs4 .


    The job challenge is even more pressing in the current context of transition and reform. An inclusive and
    competitive private sector has proven to be one of the most effective long-term solutions for unemployment, and
    will be critical in tackling the problem in MENA5 .


    With the support of committed development partners, IFC is implementing a portfolio of programmatic advisory
    service interventions. They focused on MSME development, infrastructure investment, green growth, and youth
    employability, paying particular attention to gender-related issues and their impact on sustainable and inclusive
    economic growth.

    This thematic approach, as discussed in last year's annual report, will receive additional support from recent World
    Bank Group reforms. IFC regional teams will join sectoral global practices and departments, facilitating direct
    access to global expertise in the design and implementation of regional operations. Our responsiveness to clients is
    expected to improve, further deepening the impact of IFC and the World Bank Group in the region.

represent between 80 and 90 percent of all formal businesses6 , and provide a large share of private sector jobs.


Critical constraints to MSME growth include regulatory burdens, lack of access to financial services, and inadequate
skills training. IFC has developed a set of integrated interventions to enhance smart business policies and
regulations, improve access to financial services for entrepreneurs, and strengthen business capacity.


2.1.1 Encouraging Efficient Policies and Regulations

A well-functioning business environment promotes private sector investment by reducing complexities and
facilitating compliance with targeted, transparent, and efficient regulation. This regulation should ensure
that public safety concerns are fully met, while at the same time ensuring that markets are contestable, that
competition is encouraged through ease of entry and ease of exit, and that there is a high level of predictability
in regulation affecting firms. It is critical for legislators to consider the impact of government policies on business
creation and growth, and the contribution of the private sector to economic development. The state should
also provide services, or allow others to provide them, in areas of need, such as dispute resolution and contract
enforcement.


The 2014 Doing Business Report shows that, among the regions of the world, the Middle East and North Africa had
the smallest share of economies implementing regulatory reforms in at least one area (40 percent), a development
that is partly linked to the political turmoil in the region7 . Some countries, though, have made significant progress
since 2005, including Egypt, Morocco, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.


To support MSMEs and spur economic growth, IFC focuses on interventions that range from alternative dispute
and debt resolution to business regulatory reforms and financial infrastructure. These are key reform areas where
the World Bank Group has established global and regional expertise.

    capacity of client counterparts in Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt,

    and Tunisia. The main objective is to improve loan recovery, thereby allowing distressed firms to either reorganize
    or exit the market more efficiently.


    Main Accomplishments

    Alternative Dispute Resolution. Operations are ongoing in Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, and Pakistan, as are efforts
    to create a regional network of practitioners in Egypt, Lebanon, and Morocco.


    In Egypt, 190 cases were resolved through mediation by IFC project-trained mediators and/or project-assisted
    institutions. That resulted in a combined $249 million in funds released and an estimated $40 million in private
    sector savings during FY14. Additionally, our team provided technical assistance during the revision of mediation
    center rules undertaken by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones. The rules were recently submitted
    to the authority's board of trustees.


    In Morocco, the central bank launched in June a new banking mediation center that was created with support
    from IFC. This new mechanism allows SMEs to become eligible for banking mediation services and covers non-
    performing loan disputes. Mediation has continued to thrive since the project's completion. During FY14, 145 cases
    were settled through mediation, releasing $45 million previously tied up in litigation and generating estimated
    private sector savings of $15 million.


    Debt Resolution and Exit. In Lebanon, IFC produced a comprehensive policy note to assist in the drafting of a
    new bankruptcy regime and a supervision framework for insolvency practitioners tailored to the country's needs.
    The policy note covers the main standards and principles governing a modern bankruptcy regime and proposes
    new procedures enabling the rescue of viable businesses facing financial distress. IFC is also working closely with
    the banking sector to introduce out-of-court solutions to private-debt-related disputes.


    IFC and the World Bank are jointly assisting the Tunisian government in reviewing the legislative framework
    governing restructuring and insolvency. A revised framework is expected to increase returns to creditors, enable
    viable businesses to rehabilitate, and efficiently return assets back into productive use through more efficient
    reorganizations and liquidations.

IFC Backs Mediation in Egypt, Helping Expedite Commercial Justice
IFC is stepping up its efforts to help firms in Egypt avoid long court procedures by training judges in
mediation skills, and helping resolve commercial disputes quickly and cost-effectively.

Currently in Egypt, according to Doing Business, it takes the courts over three years to enforce a
contract, which is a major bottleneck for businesses and investors.

“Every time I accept a new brief I can only trust that the contract will be honored” said Sayed Eissa, who
owns a small graphic design company in Cairo. “The court system is so torturous and expensive that for
small companies like mine, it is often easier to accept a loss when customers don’t pay up.”

As an alternative to a full-scale court process, mediation can resolve disputes in just 90 days and free
up vital company funds. Such a rapid process fosters a better business environment for investors and
entrepreneurs alike.

To encourage mediation, IFC has been helping key stakeholders, like the Ministry of Justice and the
General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, to build capacity and train judges.

The next step is to introduce a mediation law, supported by IFC, encouraging businesses to use
mediation, reduce the load on courts, and protect investor rights by using accredited mediators.

“A mediation law in Egypt would be a great relief to me and my business,” said Sayed. “It would give me
more confidence in dealing with stubborn clients, and make doing business in this country much easier.”

Milo Stevanovich, Manager of IFC’s Commercial Justice Project in the Middle East and North Africa,
agrees. “Mediated solutions are more likely to be adhered to because the parties resolved the dispute
themselves. Poor contract enforcement is a major impediment to improving Egypt’s investment climate.
Aside from being faster and less costly than going to court, mediation preserves business relationships
whereas adversarial court cases often ruin those valuable relationships.”

Mediation is part of IFC’s wider efforts to speed up commercial justice and improve the investment
climate across the Middle East and North Africa. IFC has also rolled out mediation efforts in Lebanon,
Morocco, and Pakistan to promote and improve the practice of judicial mediation across the region.

10     REPORT ON ADVISORY SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
Investment Climate. In Tunisia, IFC is leading a large, multi-component investment climate program. It includes
reforms of business formalities in eight ministries, investment framework reforms, and the simplification of
bankruptcy procedures. The program has already produced promising results, simplifying over 100 business
formalities at the Ministry of Finance. It has also reduced the dichotomy between onshore and offshore sectors
when it comes to incentives. The program’s objective is to review Tunisia’s investment code, simplify regulatory
procedures, review bankruptcy laws, and remove barriers to competition. Egypt’s Ministry of Investment and
Ministry of Local Development, in concert with IFC, launched a study on the investment climate in 15 governorates
in December 2013. Following the appointment of a new government, IFC began discussions on targeted reforms
to be implemented in several governorates. They would focus on construction regulations, trading across borders,
enforcing contracts, and registering property. Reforms are expected to leverage IFC’s analysis and our teams will
work with ministry officials to develop action plans and provide technical support.


Business Registration. In Lebanon, we are working with the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Justice to
simplify the commercial registration process. The project is designed to reduce the time it takes for new businesses
to register. IFC is also supporting the Minister of State’s Office for Administrative Reform in expanding key sectors,
like tourism, reforming regulations to attract investors, and improving competitiveness. In the West Bank and Gaza,
we are helping simplify business registration procedures, making it easier for MSMEs to get off the ground. IFC
worked with the Ministry of National Economy and the chambers of commerce of Ramallah and Nablus to simplify
administrative procedures. That reduced the average registration time for limited liability corporations to nine days,
from 63.


Tax Reform. IFC and the Yemen Tax Authority agreed to re-engage on tax reforms designed to improve the
country’s investment climate. The changes would simplify tax regulations and processes, making them more
transparent for entrepreneurs and reducing the compliance burden. They would also make collection easier to
administer for the authority and help widen the tax base. The reforms should also facilitate the formalization of
new businesses and reduce opportunities for corruption. Finally, in Pakistan, IFC and the Punjab Revenue Authority
agreed to work together towards the implementation of a streamlined general sales tax on services. The reformed
framework should increase the taxpayer base and boost Punjab’s revenues, while reducing compliance costs by
halving the time needed to file for the tax.



Financial Infrastructure

Credit bureaus, collateral registries, and payment, remittance, and securities settlement systems are all vital parts
of a country’s financial infrastructure. When financial infrastructure is available, efficient, and reliable, the cost of
financial intermediation falls9 . IFC intervenes in this area to promote lending to MSMEs by helping credit providers
better manage their risk while avoiding cross-lending and over-indebtedness among clients. In FY14, we supported
the launch in Afghanistan of the region’s first electronic collateral registry and helped Jordan establish the first
credit bureau in MENA covering financial institutions, microfinance lenders, and telecoms companies.
Interventions in the target countries are beginning to achieve their goal of improving access to finance. For
instance, during the past financial year, microfinance institutions in Pakistan made over 620,000 credit inquiries
nationwide. In Afghanistan, 16 local banks are participating in the collateral registry, while the public credit registry,
launched during the same period, is now fully operational.



Main Accomplishments

In FY14, the financial infrastructure program ramped up its activities, spearheading 14 projects in 10 economies,
namely Afghanistan, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, West Bank and Gaza, United Arab Emirates
(UAE), and Yemen.

     Credit Reporting. In Afghanistan, a public credit registry was launched in December 2013. Currently, 16 banks
     participate by submitting their credit data and enquiring about prospective customers. The first online credit report
     was issued by the registry in April 2014. In Pakistan, over 3 million microfinance records were available in the credit
     bureau database as of June 2014, with microfinance providers now able to report data and enquire on a national
     scale. IFC signed new agreements for prospective projects with the Central Bank of Morocco, the Central Bank of
     Tunisia, and the Central Bank of Yemen to support each regulator in strengthening credit reporting infrastructure.


     Secured Lending. A collateral registry in Afghanistan has achieved increased utilization by financial institutions,
     whereby local businesses, predominantly SMEs, can receive credit facilities by offering movable assets as collateral.
     More than 2,250 registrations for credit facilities were reported, with a total financing value of $618 million in FY14.
     In Jordan, a secured lending law was approved by the Council of Ministers in January 2014 and is pending final
     approval by parliament. The law is expected to expand access to finance for SMEs and provide them with better
     terms of credit, including interest rates and repayment periods. In Lebanon, a draft law on secured transactions
     was finalized and submitted to the Presidency of the Council of Ministers’ Office for further approval by parliament.
     In the UAE, a secured lending law was finalized and presented to authorities. In Morocco, a secured transaction
     institutional assessment, which would guide the establishment of a collateral registry, was presented to the
     Ministry of Finance. A draft law on secured transactions was supported by the European Bank for Reconstruction
     and Development (EBRD) in collaboration with IFC. In Egypt, despite governmental changes during the past year,
     IFC succeeded in re-engaging with the relevant authorities on secured lending reform. A draft law was developed,
     while IFC is providing technical support on the legal reform process.


     Leasing. The presidents of Afghanistan and the Palestinian Authority signed new leasing laws, supported by IFC, in
     early 2014. The regulations are based on the UNDROIT model, a global best practice. IFC teams also advised officials
     in both countries on laws that would govern leasing companies. The rules, which are expected to be adopted
     during the next fiscal year, are designed to stimulate the leasing market, leading to new financing opportunities for
     SMEs.


     Mobile Payment. IFC engaged the Association of Mobile Money Operators of Afghanistan on the improvement of
     its internal structure and the implementation of sector-level interventions focused on facilitating the development
     of mobile financial services.



     Future Prospects

     There were tangible results achieved during FY14 despite political instability in some of the countries where the
     financial infrastructure program is active. Two leasing laws were enacted, the establishment of the public credit
     registry enhanced credit information in Pakistan, and the collateral registry in Afghanistan continued to report
     increased usage. Those achievements show the potential impact of legal and institutional reforms to the region’s
     financial infrastructure.


     The goal for the next financial year is to increase engagements with governments to complete the on-going legal
     reform process in secured lending. That will be accomplished through increased collaboration with the World Bank
     and other development partners, ultimately improving access to finance for MSMEs and supporting their growth.


     Where feasible, IFC will maintain its focus on developing operations in fragile and conflict-affected states, and
     International Development Association countries. This is particularly important in light of the political situations
     Iraq, Syria, and West Bank and Gaza, which have the potential to harm the economic stability of neighboring
     countries.

2.1.2	   Improve Access to Finance for MSMEs

Access to finance is a key area of intervention for IFC in the region. MSMEs have little or no access to credit,
savings, nor payment products. The strategic relevance for IFC to address such market failures and policy needs
is strong, and the response from clients has been overwhelmingly positive. During FY14, we signed 24 new client
agreements and registered growing client contributions towards our interventions; partners particularly value our
advisory services.


In FY14, we started the first women banking operations in Jordan, West Bank and Gaza, and Pakistan, specifically
targeting female entrepreneurs. We also signed IFC’s first Islamic finance advisory project with the largest Islamic
bank in the world, and committed to an important bank advisory project in Iraq. Finally, we have started an
innovative Islamic micro-equity project in Egypt with the Alexandria Business Association.

The results from our projects with partners have surpassed our annual targets and reached out to a significant
segment of the MSME market. We have also seen excellent results in fragile and conflict-affected states. In
particular, the microfinance work in Yemen is yielding incredible results due to the strength and dedication of our
clients and this is changing the local microfinance landscape.

and training events. In FY14, IFC provided in-depth
advisory services to 12 banks operating in West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia,
Morocco, Iraq, and Jordan. In collaboration with the World Bank, IFC engaged with the Jordan Loan Guarantee
Corporation (JLGC), developing suitable and profitable products to help increase SME access to the banking sector.


Results generated during FY14 were impressive. The value of SME loans disbursed by IFC’s MENA clients reached
$3.1 billion, almost double times the target set for the period, thanks to the strong results of our partners, namely
JLCG, Quds Bank, Bank Muscat, BLC Bank, Bank Al Falah, and HBL Bank.


During the year, we received $2.1 million in cash fees from clients receiving IFC advisory services. This amount was
directly re-invested in our programs. Growing client contributions show market appreciation for IFC’s technical

     expertise and commitment from program clients, who are eager to invest time and resources in our technical
     advice. IFC is in fact increasingly perceived as the advisor of choice to many of our regional clients.


     Main Accomplishments

     SME Banking. We work on establishing sufficient operational capacity within banks to cater to the financial needs
     of SMEs. We have started work with Bank al Etihad in Jordan and Bank of Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza.
     We have focused on an integrated approach to SME banking and placed a special emphasis on banking for women
     entrepreneurs. In Pakistan, we helped the client to complete the establishment of a new SME banking unit within
     Bank Al Falah, and re-organize its sales and credit processes. IFC’s SME toolkit was also deployed as part of the SME
     non-financial advisory offering.


     In Saudi Arabia, we are assisting Al Rajhi Bank, the largest Islamic bank in the world, in further strengthening its
     SME banking operations, re-engineering its back-end processes, and developing new products to support the
     growth of SME banking. We developed value propositions for SMEs, with a special focus on women and very small
     enterprises for Bank Muscat, the largest conventional bank in Oman. These two banks paid for the full cost of
     IFC advisory services. We approved a new engagement with one of the largest banks in Morocco and the region,
     Banque Centrale Populaire (BCP). We will help the lender develop sufficient operational capacity for very small
     enterprise banking, expanding outreach and supporting the country’s underserved very small enterprise sector.


     Risk Management and Institutional Capacity. IFC continues to support Amen Bank in Tunisia as it enhances
     its corporate governance and risk management practices, an effort expected to boost lending to SMEs. We are
     also working with United Bank of Investment, in collaboration with our investment team, on building sufficient
     institutional capacity to better serve Iraqi businesses.


     Agribusiness Finance. We are working with HBL Bank in Pakistan to improve its outreach to the large and
     underserved agricultural community. We provided the bank with recommendations on new product development,
     through which the bank is anticipated to greatly expand outreach to rural communities.


     Financing for Women. IFC commenced one of the largest engagements in banking for women in Pakistan,
     where we are helping HBL Bank focus on the female market. We are also assisting the institution in becoming
     an employer of choice for Pakistani women. Similarly, we engaged Bank Al Etihad in Jordan and Bank of Palestine
     in West Bank and Gaza, advising these institutions on how to become champions for women banking in their
     respective countries.


     Knowledge Management. IFC has shown thought leadership with events in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria
     on key topics such as innovation in SME banking, sustainable energy finance, warehouse finance, and Islamic
     banking. We sponsored a conference in partnership with Egypt’s Fawry, a major nationwide electronic bill payment
     platform, to encourage access to financial and governmental services for MSMEs and the neediest Egyptians. We
     also conducted a flagship study on Islamic banking opportunities for SMEs in MENA. The report was launched
     in May and received good media coverage, including the Wall Street Journal. Finally, we conducted new market
     studies on SME banking in Tunisia and Jordan to evaluate local SME demand and help banks develop a business
     strategy for SME banking.

16       REPORT ON ADVISORY SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
MENA Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Facility

The MENA Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Facility is a joint multi-donor World Bank and IFC initiative
that aims to improve access to finance for MSMEs, promoting sustainable job creation and private sector-led
growth during a critical time of transition in the region. It operates on three pillars:
Pillar I: Developing the enabling environment for MSMEs by supporting policy, legal, and regulatory reforms to
facilitate access to finance.
Pillar II: Providing advisory services to financial institutions that serve MSMEs to develop a more inclusive system
focusing on youth, women, and regional disparities.
Pillar III: Building the capacity of MSMEs through analytical work and technical assistance.


Regional target economies include Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and West Bank and Gaza.
Total resources of the facility have grown to $41 million, of which $28.6 million (70 percent) were already mobilized
thanks to significant contributions from UKaid, SECO, DFATD, DANIDA, and the Government of Japan.


The facility has continued to generate significant results, increasing outreach and volume of lending to micro,
small, and medium enterprises. During FY14, a total of $179 million in loans were disbursed by project partners
towards SMEs and $897 million in loans to micro enterprises, for a combined value of more than one billion. The
facility has also helped leverage over $1.5 billion of World Bank Group loans and equity to governments and financial
institutions to support MSME finance.


Future Prospects

The reorganization of IFC and the World Bank Group will provide new opportunities to enhance our relationship
with financial institutions in the region. The World Bank Group is increasingly focusing on a client-centric strategy,
which entails closer interaction and the offer of a wider range of products and services.


IFC is aiming to become the advisor of choice for the largest financial institutions in the region. SME banking, risk
management, and gender finance remain focus areas. Business development efforts have led to a robust pipeline of
new potential interventions in Pakistan, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, and Lebanon.


Under the auspices of the MSME Facility, the World Bank and IFC will continue in FY15 to work with country
officials and private sector representatives to address the barriers to MSME development in the region, and to
closely coordinate project implementation.


With regard to microfinance, IFC will deliver high-quality technical assistance to its existing MFI clients while
expanding the program to Pakistan and Afghanistan. It will also help MFIs launch new products such as savings-
linked micro insurance and, if possible, leverage new distribution models like branch-less banking.

        IFC, World Bank Join Forces to Help Smaller Businesses in Jordan
        The Middle East and North Africa can be challenging environments for entrepreneurs. Getting credit is
        usually an uphill battle, bankruptcy laws can be harsh, and outside training is prohibitively expensive.

        In an effort to change that, IFC and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
        are joining forces.

        IFC and IBRD signed an advisory agreement to help The Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation (JLGC) ramp
        up lending. The organization helps its customers - mostly micro, small, and medium enterprises - secure
        bank loans.

        The deal is expected to help scores of smaller businesses, which form the backbone of Jordan’s economy.
        It also represents what can be accomplished when the World Bank Group works together, say staff
        members.

        “There are so many areas in which we can combine our efforts, maximizing our impact on the ground,”
        said Xavier Reille, Manager, IFC’s Access to Finance Business Line in the Middle East and North Africa.

        The Jordan project is part of the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Facility, a joint investment and
        advisory initiative designed to help drive growth in MENA post-Arab Spring. IFC and World Bank are
        managing the facility, and the advisory component has $29 million in available funding. It’s designed
        to encourage policy reforms, help banks ramp up lending to SMEs, and provide training directly to
        entrepreneurs.

        “Activities under the facility have been focusing on assisting JLGC in strengthening its core internal
        capabilities, expanding its outreach, and increasing the impact of its SME-related products, especially
        those targeting marginalized areas and women”, said Sahar Nasr, program manager of the MENA MSME
        Facility with the World Bank.

        Reille says working with the IBRD in Jordan was easy as they were all focusing on bringing the best value
        to clients. IBRD will contribute $200,000 towards the project cost, take a seat on the project steering
        committee, and provide oversight. IFC will manage the project through to implementation.

        The Access to Finance Business line is looking for other partnerships, and Reille encouraged other project
        leaders to explore co-operation with the wider World Bank Group.

        “In some quarters, there may be hesitation because people are used to working in a certain way,” he said.
        “But the process of co-operation is not very difficult, and the development results can be dramatic.”

In Pakistan, IFC helps Entrepreneurs Take Their First Step

When learning how to start and run a business, one often needs a guiding hand. For twenty-one-year-old
Usama Hamid Khan, an IFC-backed diploma in entrepreneurship was exactly that.

The course, offered by Pakistan’s Management Development Institute (MDI) in collaboration with IFC’s
Business Edge program, taught him how to launch and manage his own business. Six months after
graduating, he partnered with a friend to open an interior design and construction firm, Emarat Interiors.

In a nation where over 90 percent of gross domestic product originates from the private sector, and nearly
70 percent of that comes from small firms, entrepreneurs like Khan are vital.

“The course taught me how to be my own boss,” he said. “The trainers had hands on experience and were
entrepreneurs themselves.”

Backed by IFC and delivered by certified local trainers, Business Edge is a world-class training system that
strengthens the management skills of owners, managers, and staff of small and medium enterprises.

MDI joined the Business Edge program in January 2010 and has already trained over 1,350 participants in 65
workshops, offering them practical management tools. The institute developed and launched a Diploma in
Entrepreneurship in January 2013, drawing on a package of Business Edge modules.

Khan, one of over 50 participants who have successfully completed the diploma, learned how to understand
the market and identify its needs.

Khan is now employing one full-time and five part-time staff members; efforts like that are in key in a
country where unemployment is close to 6 percent.

Khan knows he still has a long way to go and believes this is just the beginning.

“While attending this course, I developed the blueprint for my business,” he said. “If anyone wants to start a
business and is lost on how to take the first step, this is a good place.”

MDI Pakistan, in collaboration with Business Edge, delivered the entrepreneurship program over 12 weeks. It
was led by experienced entrepreneurs and business managers, as well as guest speakers. The program was
funded by Japan’s Ministry of Finance for fiscal year 2014.

     Main Accomplishments

     Strengthening Governance Practices of Firms. IFC provided in-depth advice to 17 firms by assessing their
     corporate governance practices and offering guidance on how they could be improved. International Computer
     and Communications Systems, which provides information technology solutions in the Middle East, solicited IFC
     to assist in it in implementing sound corporate governance practices. It was counseled to establish a board of
     directors in addition to improving its control environment.


     Malia Holding, a family-owned company preparing for an initial public offering, was also advised by IFC to
     restructure and clarify the responsibilities of its board, strengthen its control environment, and formalize a
     family assembly. Arab Potash Company was advised to improve the functioning of its board, restructure board
     committees, and establish a compliance function. As part of our efforts to improve access to finance for SMEs, IFC’s
     corporate governance and microfinance teams conducted an assessment of the Jordanian microfinance institution
     Tamweelcom.


     After an assessment of Al Kuraimi Islamic Micro Finance Bank was successfully completed in FY14, the Yemeni
     MFI reported that it has taken important steps towards improving corporate governance practices. The bank is
     finalizing its corporate governance code and is adding three independent directors to the board with the aim of
     adding an external, objective perspective to the oversight and direction of the company.


     Forging Links with Investors. Through a series of ‘Meet the Investor’ networking sessions, together with the
     Egyptian Private Equity Association, IFC helped build connections with investors to encourage better access to
     finance for SMEs. Our partnership with Dubai SME continued to develop programs for its top ranked 100 SMEs,
     helping them attract investment and enhance their corporate governance practices. IFC’s support also continued
     to SMEs listed, or planning initial public offerings, on the Nilex (Egypt’s SME Stock Exchange), through the Egyptian
     Institute of Directors. A similar initiative was introduced in Pakistan, where collaboration with the Center for
     International Private Enterprise focused on the specific governance challenges faced by SMEs.


     Increasing Outreach to Firms. IFC worked with several partners on the ground to increase outreach to firms and
     ensure the sustainability of IFC’s work. We collaborated with the Jordan Institute of Directors, Jordan Securities
     Commission, and the Palestine Capital Market Authority to provide technical support on corporate governance
     and on the implementation of corporate governance scorecards. A corporate governance assessment program for
     companies in Jordan and West Bank and Gaza has also been launched.


     Developing Institutional Capacity. IFC expanded its outreach in Egypt beyond Cairo by working with the
     Alexandria Business Association to launch an SME governance program, which aims to equip smaller business
     owners with the skills needed to run companies. As well, the Egyptian Banking Institute continued to roll out
     corporate governance training in collaboration with IFC.

     IFC is helping the Moroccan Institute of Directors deliver a
     training program aimed at widening the pool of professional      “Working with IFC has             Maali Qasem,

Knowledge Tools for SMEs. IFC is developing a curriculum for trainers from the Institut Arabe des Chefs
d’Entreprises. Tailored to Tunisian financial institutions, it will cover corporate governance and how it can be
applied to the institute’s SME clients. The SME Governance Toolkit, being adapted to Tunisia and Morocco, will
be used as a platform to launch outreach activities to SMEs in the Maghreb. A corporate governance handbook
targeted at SMEs is also being developed for wider regional use. Further, a revised version of the Success Stories
publication on good corporate governance in MENA was finalized. The publication outlines the governance
challenges faced by SMEs and puts forth best practices based on IFC’s corporate governance methodology.


Future Prospects

IFC’s supply chain management efforts will help improve the business performance and competitiveness of farmers
in the supply chains of larger corporations. It will focus on activities aimed at improving quality standards in the
dairy industry in Pakistan and bolstering horticulture practices in Afghanistan. IFC’s SME development work will
also be expanded to include building the internal training capacity of investment clients.


IFC will also work to deepen its corporate governance operations across the region, while rigorously exploring new
countries to engage in. Building on its efforts in fragile and conflict-affected states, IFC will sustain efforts to build
capacities in local markets. For instance, in Yemen, it will support the expansion of training programs for directors,
while teams will continue to respond to sector-specific needs in the region.


In FY15, IFC will support the roll out of the corporate governance for SMEs program, expanding it to the Maghreb
and linking the offer to the clients of private equity funds. In doing so, lessons are being drawn from the Egypt
program for SMEs - for example, better targeting of SMEs has been identified as an important element. It will
also strengthen its focus on family-owned businesses in Yemen, Morocco, and Jordan. Building on internal IFC
partnerships, the team will also promote learning and knowledge sharing opportunities, similar to efforts that
brought together global institutes of directors in the past year.

      IFC Helps Yemeni Businesses Thrive

      Two years of uncertainty have taken their toll on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Yemen. But
      IFC teams have stayed in the country despite the unrest, showing businesses that improved corporate
      governance can help firms boost performance and attract essential investment.

      “One of the biggest obstacles facing the growth of the Yemeni economy is old-fashioned management styles
      for family businesses,” said Hamoud Al-Motawakkel, Vice Chairman of The Yemeni Group for Contracting and
      Engineering (YGCE). “This is one of the most important reasons preventing any real growth in the size and
      quality of businesses in Yemen.”

      That hurdle has been compounded by the nation’s political unrest, adding a layer of security concerns that
      damage the business environment, particularly in the construction sector.

      Family businesses like YGCE are believed to employ about 95 percent of workers in Yemen. IFC teams have
      delivered training events and workshops across the country to SMEs, banks, and financial institutions, raising
      awareness about the benefits of good corporate governance and providing technical assistance.

      Najaat Jumaan, a board member in her family business, Jumaan Trading and Industry, says the project was
      particularly well received by women. Though there remains work to be done, she believes women have since
      had success in implementing IFC’s recommendations.

      “New methods—like developing a clear strategic direction for the company, supporting and guiding the
      executive director, and establishing committees to support the board have changed my company for the
      better,” said Jumaan. “IFC has a role to play in increasing the awareness of the value that women can add to
      their company’s success and providing more technical assistance for businesswomen.”

      Overall, IFC reached out to nearly 600 companies in Yemen, either directly or through local partners. Along
      with encouraging gender diversity—by teaching female board members the corporate governance skills
      they need to guide their business—companies have also benefited by improving performance and making
      themselves more attractive to investment.

      “The work environment in our company is now healthier than ever before,” said Al-Motawakkel. “The new
      internal structure, including a formal board of directors and a strong financial department, has lifted the
      general performance.”

      “Our management style has been transformed, so we have well defined roles and responsibilities at all levels,
      and it has given us the confidence to manage any kind of project,” he added.

      Thanks to IFC’s recommendations, YGCE is now able to develop real estate projects without waiting to be
      commissioned. In addition, the company’s new ambitions are attracting local and regional investors.

2.2 Addressing Constraints to Growth in
Infrastructure

In order to close the region’s infrastructure gap,
private sector investment is key. The IFC advisory
services program is active in regional countries
that demonstrate the political stability and will to
pursue public-private partnerships (PPPs). Many of
these countries are economically weak or have little
experience with PPPs. IFC is therefore increasing its
local presence to be close to its clients, support capacity
building, and help develop the appropriate enabling
environment13 .

     Future Prospects

     We believe that successful PPP transactions in infrastructure are essential to driving economic growth and
     restoring market confidence in post-Arab Spring economies, many of which have a limited track record with PPPs.
     We are therefore increasing our local presence to build strong client relationships, support capacity building, and
     encourage the development of an appropriate enabling environment for PPPs.


     As a result of World Bank Group reforms, we expect new opportunities to arise during FY15; our teams across the
     region stand ready to embrace them. We will continue to take a broad approach to the PPP infrastructure business,
     building on a pipeline of potential operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan, West Bank, Egypt, Iraq, Tunisia, and Morocco.
     We are also discussing some innovative transactions in the renewable energy and water sectors.


     IFC also developed a new product to assist governments in the post-closing implementation of PPP projects. In
     FY15, the MENA team is expected to launch its second post-transaction advisory mandate to help Da Afghanistan
     Breshna Sherkat implement the Kandahar’s management support contract, after which the winning bidder will sign
     the PPP agreement.

2.3 Supporting Inclusive Green Growth

Inclusive green growth is the pathway to sustainable
development14 . As part of the World Bank Group, IFC
defines green growth as economic growth that is
environmentally and socially sustainable. IFC pursues
green growth which is inclusive, clean, and resilient.


The complexity and diversity within the Middle East
and North Africa cannot be understated, particularly in
relation to sustainable development and green growth.
The region suffers from varying levels of energy access,
endemic water security issues, and excessive energy
subsidies, along with an aged infrastructure which is
straining to support a burgeoning urban population.




                                                                    Inclusive Green Growth

2.3.1	      Public-Private Partnerships

The region presents significant opportunities to attract private sector participation in the design and
implementation of energy efficient, environmentally-friendly infrastructure projects. The implementation of public-
private partnerships also offers the opportunity to introduce IFC performance standards and best practices in
PPP contracts. IFC focuses on areas like green building, renewable energy, and energy efficiency across a host of
industries.



Main Accomplishments

During FY14, we completed a joint investment-advisory wind project in Tafila, Jordan. The wind farm is expected to
increase the country’s current generating capacity by 117 megawatts and help Jordan reduce the amount of gas and
heavy fuel it consumes, resources that are expensive and, at times, in short supply.


IFC is also providing post-closing advice on a concession to manage and operate a solid waste management facility
in the southern West Bank. The agreement with the winning bidder was signed and the facility is expected to
significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the handling of solid waste.


The signing of a new agreement for the construction of Taif International Airport will also set high standards for
eco-friendly construction. IFC has already completed a similar project, Madinah Airport, which introduced global
best practices in energy efficiency, recycling, greenhouse gas reduction, and water use. Those lessons can now
be replicated throughout the region. The Madinah project received LEED’s silver certification, a first in the region.
The PPP team is consistently looking for projects that will contribute to green growth in MENA and beyond. IFC is
governed by a solid environmental and sustainability framework, identified as a best practice and adopted by other
leading developmental institutions.

     2.3.2	   Sustainable Energy Finance

     The sustainable energy finance (SEF) program aims to increase financing by local financial institutions to
     companies, businesses, and households in the area of energy efficiency, renewable energy, cleaner production, and
     emission reduction. SEF interventions aim to help improve access to finance for MSMEs and large corporations
     looking to invest in sustainable practices. These investments help firms improve their competitiveness while
     addressing climate change issues. IFC has been advising banks and leasing companies on sustainable energy
     finance since 2011, with the first operations in Jordan and Lebanon.



     Main Accomplishments

     IFC signed two new advisory service agreements, one in Jordan in July 2013 and another in Lebanon in December
     2013. In Jordan, we supported the Ejara Leasing Company in building capacity for sustainable energy leasing
     operations. We helped provide training for leasing officers, allowing management to align this new business with
     the company’s strategy, and build a pipeline of eligible projects. Ejara Leasing presents a solid pipeline of future
     projects to be financed, varying from fleet modernization (hybrid cars) to renewable energy (solar photo-voltaics
     for industrial companies).


     In Lebanon, IFC is developing a strategic partnership with Fransabank and its leasing company, LLC. In view of
     investing later in sustainable energy, IFC has entered into an advisory engagement with Fransabank to train loan
     officers, build a pipeline of eligible projects, and assess the market potential for energy efficiency and renewable
     energy projects in the country. IFC provided training for over 125 employees of the bank and leasing company, and
     assisted in 12 client visits to build a pipeline of potential projects. In April 2014, IFC signed a loan agreement with
     both Fransabank and LLC for $40 million targeting sustainable energy projects.


     Our teams completed a market survey in Pakistan to identify the market size of bankable sustainable energy
     finance projects for commercial banks in the country. Results were presented to the Pakistani banking community
     in September 2013 at an event organized by IFC in Karachi.



     2.3.3	   Resource Efficiency

     The Middle East and North Africa is the second most energy-intensive region by economic output in the world. It is
     also the third most emissions-intensive region by economic output. The region, in other words, does not efficiently
     use its energy resources for economic production.


     There is a need to increase the adoption of resource-efficient practices and technologies in order to remain
     competitive, particularly as energy subsidies are eliminated, the cost of fossil-fuel-based energy increases, and
     its availability decreases. IFC supports the private sector across MENA in adopting a more efficient use of energy
     and water resources for economic production. In FY14, we worked with individual companies and sector-specific
     aggregators to extend cleaner production assessments and provide implementation support for resource-efficient
     practices and technologies.


     We continue to be focused on Egypt, Morocco, and Pakistan but, despite the difficult operating environment
     throughout the region, opportunities in other countries are routinely investigated.

had a slow uptake over the first two years. As a result we re-structured our efforts in this space and begun to focus
much more on specific industries. This has been done through assessments to ensure we know which sectors have
the highest return on energy efficiency. We have focused our efforts in just three markets, Pakistan, Morocco and
Egypt.


During FY14, scoping activities were completed at 14 industrial firms in Morocco and five in Egypt. As well, 12 boiler
energy efficiency walkthroughs were conducted in Pakistan. Those activities showed that companies could save
water, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and save millions by improving resource efficiency. Follow-up advisory
engagements were signed with two boiler efficiency clients in Pakistan (Interloop Textile and Hilal Textile), while
additional interventions are under negotiation in the country. In both Pakistan and Morocco, client engagements
have been managed through local intermediaries (the national cleaner production center of each country), a pilot
model for the program. The effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated in FY15.


Sector Approaches. We have focused particular attention on the following sectors:
• Boiler Efficiency. In Pakistan, IFC aims to boost the energy efficiency of boilers, which would limit industry exposure
to a volatile electricity supply and reduce production costs. Based on early analysis, potential energy savings were
identified, particularly for boiler energy efficiency improvements. Interventions will focus on issues including
monitoring equipment and boiler automation, combustion efficiency, and steam condensation collection systems.


• Fish Canning Sector. In Morocco, a targeted focus on fish canning aims to encourage the uptake of resource
efficiency measures. IFC is working with seven companies that have undergone cleaner production scoping
activities. Negotiations are being finalized to start in-depth resource efficiency assessments, and to develop a
cleaner production manual for the sector. The fishing industry in Morocco, among the largest in Africa, is a leading
foreign exchange earner and is a major economic pillar for the country.


• Cement Sector. In FY14, IFC started a landmark review of the use of alternative fuels by the Egyptian cement
industry. This national study aims to identify their sources and uses, as well as investment opportunities throughout
the supply chain and processing, in order to make alternative fuels more widely used.


Cleaner Production Audit Review. Jointly with the Egyptian National Cleaner Production Center, IFC has
begun the analysis of 500 cleaner production audit reports conducted over a period of seven years in multiple
industrial sectors. The study is expected to identify cleaner production technologies with the highest potential for
implementation and the key incentives to promote a wider adoption of cleaner production practices. Similarly,
in Pakistan, a cleaner production audit analysis of more than 200 assessments supported by IFC, Pakistan’s
Cleaner Production Institute, and the National Productivity Organization was completed. The study will establish
a roadmap for high-potential cleaner production technologies in Pakistan, focusing primarily on four industrial
sectors – sugar, textiles, leather, and pulp and paper. The findings of the study will be complemented by a national
workshop to encourage cleaner production by November 2014.


Supporting Dissemination of Resource Efficiency Awareness. The MENA program team contributed to the
development of an IFC report that revealed up to $5 billion worth of investment opportunities in improving waste
heat recovery systems in the cement sector. The Waste Heat Recovery for the Cement Sector: Market and Supplier
Analysis report15 provides in-depth analysis on eleven markets, including Pakistan and Egypt.


Regulatory and Policy Interventions for Climate Efficient Industries. Resource efficiency policies are used by
governments globally to generate high-impact energy and resource savings across sectors. Industries in MENA tend

     to be large consumers of energy, with low efficiency. IFC’s work on climate-efficient industries helps policy makers
     and industrial associations implement private-sector-friendly policies that stimulate investments, while improving
     the energy situation in the region and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.


     In Pakistan, IFC is working with the Government of Punjab to develop a five-year energy efficiency program, the
     first of its kind. This is a crucial step in a country where sector-wide energy efficiency uptake is weak and energy
     shortages are affecting the competitiveness of local industries. IFC will also work with the government on selected
     standards and labeling systems, with a focus on high-impact equipment including motors, fans, and industrial
     boilers.


     We are collaborating with the World Bank in Jordan to develop a standards and labeling program in order to unlock
     the energy efficiency potential of the industrial sector. This program will help update Jordan’s energy efficiency
     standards to European Union standards, and improve the government’s capacity to effectively screen and test
     energy efficient equipment. IFC will also engage with local industries to ensure that they will be able to comply
     with the new standards and leverage emerging market opportunities.


     Industries in Egypt are facing the removal of energy subsidies, which will affect their cost competitiveness. IFC plans
     to work with the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Small Industries to improve energy efficiency policies, enhance
     institutional capacity to support energy efficiency initiatives, and support the growth of local green industries.



     2.3.4	     Renewable Energy

     Sustainable development is a critical concern given the inefficient use of energy resources across the region.
     Fortunately, most countries are well endowed with renewable energy resources including solar, hydro, biomass,
     and wind. IFC is actively promoting the uptake of clean and renewable energy in MENA through a range of
     interventions at the firm, sector, and market level.


     The Renewable Energy Development Support program provides assistance to private sector project developers in
     markets where renewable energy is relatively uncommon. Meanwhile, our lighting program aims to increase access
     to off-grid lighting and energy solutions, particularly for the poor.

30    REPORT ON ADVISORY SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
• The Renewable Energy Development Support project has also signed with Yunus Brothers, one of the largest
conglomerates in Pakistan, to provide advisory support in the development of a 215 megawatt hydro project in the
country’s Swat Valley.


• Work continued with Karachi Organic Energy to support the development of a 22 megawatt biogas plant. A
feedstock availability survey was completed and the first phase of the plant has been resized from to 5.5 megawatts
from 11 megawatts based on IFC’s recommendation. Currently, work is ongoing on a study of different feedstock
supply options, which include cattle manure and other organic waste. IFC also used its convening power to help
the firm overcome political risks to attract world-class partners and to engage with key local stakeholders. As a
result of IFC’s involvement, the company is now working to develop the project with internationally-known biogas
technology providers, engine manufacturers, a private equity firm, the local government in Karachi, transportation
providers, and dairy farmers.


• A complete market assessment of developers and renewable energy projects in Pakistan has also been completed.
We are following up with project developers and advisory services negotiations are underway, with a focus on
hydro projects. Biomass and solar projects will also be explored to a limited extent. Over 60 projects were screened
and meetings held with a wide range of project developers. A Punjab biomass resource mapping study is due to be
finalized early in FY15.


• Market scoping was completed for Lighting Pakistan and the program has been implemented. The goal is to
increase access to modern energy services for lighting and associated services (including mobile phone charging)
for 1.5 million people in Pakistan. This will be accomplished by accelerating the development of a sustainable
commercial market for off-grid lighting products. A wide range of organizations, from product suppliers to micro-
finance banks to major telecommunications companies, have expressed a keen interest in working with the
program. Negotiations have begun with several prospective clients.



Future Prospects

IFC intends to increase sustainable energy finance activities in the region, particularly in Pakistan and Morocco.
A market survey focusing on microfinance potential will be conducted in Morocco in partnership with a local
microfinance organization. As well, workshops to disseminate the results of Egyptian and Moroccan market studies
will be held in Cairo and Rabat. The sustainable energy finance team also plans to sign advisory agreements with
new clients during the next fiscal year.


We will continue to apply IFC’s high-performance standards and target reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in
future transactions. We are strongly aligned to support the appraisal of new IFC investment clients with the aim of
potentially including climate change opportunities in upcoming investment deals.


We have also supported the review of prospective and existing portfolio clients to identify potential resource
efficiency and clean energy interventions. We expect to expand into other target countries such as Tunisia, Jordan,
and Algeria, while our teams will continue to share key clean energy and resource efficiency studies.

     2.5	        Jobs and Inclusion: Gender Focus

     It is estimated that up to 38 percent of SMEs worldwide (or 10 million businesses) are fully- or partially-owned by
     women, making them significant contributors to the economy. Yet, female-owned businesses face considerable
     barriers to growth. In developing economies, women entrepreneurship is largely skewed towards smaller firms.
     They make up 32 to 39 percent of the very small segment of firms, 30 to 36 percent of small businesses and 17 to 21
     percent of medium-sized companies16 .


     A focus on women remains an important cross-cutting theme for IFC, and is a continuously growing component
     of IFC’s investment and advisory work17 . IFC’s gender focus includes expanding opportunities for women
     entrepreneurs to grow their business. We help increase financing to women-owned SMEs. We help improve
     employment opportunities and working conditions for women by promoting global best practices. And we help
     expand training for female board directors.


     Every project implemented in the region drives furthers gender inclusion. Where possible, projects include
     gender-specific indicators to track progress. This usually materializes in SME banking, microfinance and business
     strengthening operations. Policy reforms, infrastructure, and economy-wide programs encompass all beneficiaries
     without any gender bias.


     Under IFC’s corporate governance program, 154 women were trained by country-specific and regional or sub-
     regional projects and their intermediaries in FY14. Some projects focused on enhancing the gender diversity of
     boards and senior management, presenting a compelling business case for gender inclusion.


     In Jordan, IFC and the Jordan Institute of Directors conducted a research study on gender diversity in the
     boardrooms of 237 publicly-listed companies and 996 private shareholding firms. It was designed to raise
     awareness about the value of diversity and its influence on an organization’s performance. The results of the
     study, about to be published, point to a positive correlation between female representations on boards and firm
     performance. It is expected that this study will be replicated in Lebanon during the next fiscal year.

34     REPORT ON ADVISORY SERVICES OPERATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA
In the Maghreb, the IFC corporate governance team conducted a seminar on board composition with a gender
focus. It was held in Casablanca in partnership with the Moroccan Chapter of Women Corporate Director. Two
hundred participants, including 55 women, received training on the benefits of gender diversity at boards and in top
management.


Afghanistan was also a focus of IFC’s gender-related efforts. The Business Edge team partnered with training
companies owned by women. It also encouraged the participation of women in a trainers-of-trainers program by
giving them a 50 percent discount. As well, the team met with development and donor organizations that focus
on women. During FY14, 1,342 women participated in Business Edge training, more than half of the program’s total.
In Yemen, 29 percent of all trainees (or 1,515 people) were women. These efforts are part of IFC’s push to empower
women as agents of change in the private sector.


Female entrepreneurs are more likely than men to be in the informal sector. They often run smaller firms from
home and specialize in services. That makes women a less appealing segment for banks and has constrained their
access to finance.


The Middle East and North Africa has among the lowest levels of female access to finance in the world. This is
attributed to gender specific-challenges, such as lack of collateral and less control over assets. As per one IFC study,
48 percent of women-owned businesses in MENA have identified credit as a constraint to growing their businesses.
The estimated credit gap for this population is $72 million. That represents an opportunity for banks and financial
institutions.


IFC promotes access to finance for women by partnering with banks in the region to meet this demand. IFC help
clients capture more business by catering to both the financial and non-financial needs of women entrepreneurs.
IFC does this by working with clients to develop strategies, form business models, conduct market research,
develop a customer value proposition, and build staff capacity.


During FY14, we had four active engagements with a focus on gender-related access to finance. The engagements
with banks are in Jordan, West Bank and Gaza, Pakistan, and Oman. They aim to boost SME lending to women-
owned businesses to 25 percent of our client banks’ portfolios. This goal is complemented with a strong pipeline of
potential interventions in Morocco, Egypt, and Yemen, expected to materialize by FY15.


All applicable projects have a set of distinct monitoring and evaluation indicators that help track the outreach and
growth of the number of women depositors, number of women borrowers, and number/value of loans disbursed to
women, among other things. Such indicators are tracked to measure annual growth and in comparison to the total
portfolio of banks.

     3.1	     Sources of Funding                                 increase as the programs ramp up implementation.
                                                                 Programs focusing on MSMEs (regulation, capacity, and
     The IFC Advisory Services business model is financed by     access to finance) continue to represent nearly two
     three main sources: IFC funds, international partners’      thirds of the overall program. Infrastructure (largely
     support, and fees from clients. Such funding structure      PPP) has, unsurprisingly, been negatively affected over
     entails the need to ensure strong and open relations        the last two years and is currently about half of what
     with partners who share IFC’s vision and mission, and to    it was pre-Arab Spring. We expect the situation to
     pursue a sound application of IFC pricing policy.           improve in the coming year.


     The program has continued to grow and leverage IFC’s        Figure 3.2
     contribution with both partner and client funding. As
     discussed last year, we sought to ensure that client
                                                                              Yearly Project Spending by Thematic Area

3.4	        Development Partnerships

As can be seen in the table, of the nine agreements signed, five address the implementation of programs in IDA
and/or FCS countries, while four agreements focus on Northern Africa/Levant. Another agreement was signed
centrally between IFC and Japan. Under the Tokyo International Conference on African Development, Japan will
support IFC’s advisory service activities on SME development in Africa with $30 million over a period of five years.
Projects in North African countries will be eligible for these funds but the majority are expect to go to Sub-Saharan
Africa (the implementation plan will be defined in FY15).

In addition to these agreements, an additional $4.14 million were mobilized through centrally managed trust funds
(Table 2). Of this amount, $2.91 million was already deposited, and $1.56 million was spent or committed by June 30,
2014.

Overall, the FY14 MENA advisory services program finalized agreements on financial contributions amounting to
$21.64 million, of which 84 percent are supporting activities in IDA and/or FCS, and 13 percent in the middle-income
countries of North Africa and the Levant.
