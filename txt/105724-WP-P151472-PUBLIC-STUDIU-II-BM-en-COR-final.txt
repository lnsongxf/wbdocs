farms of less than three hectares) make up 95 percent of all farms and account for 71 percent of total agricul-
tural output, thus forming an extremely important part of the agricultural sector (Figure 1). These farms – on
which this paper focuses - are seen as a pool for a viable, commercially oriented family farm sector that still has
to be developed in the country. The other 5 percent of farms - not covered in this analysis - are composed of
commercial medium-sized farms of 3 to 50 ha (around 42,000 farms) and big farms of more than 50 ha
(around 3,000 farms). The agricultural sector in Moldova, therefore, has a strong dualistic structure.
The formation of these small family farms is the result of the land privatization process at the end of
the Soviet era. During this process, most rural villagers received a small amount of land (small share), usually
less than one hectare per household, to satisfy their consumption needs. In addition, every active and retired
collective farm worker was entitled to a land share (big share) of one or two hectares when the collectives were
dismantled at the end of the 1990s. Consequently, land ownership is almost universal in rural areas, but most
rural households own less than three hectares of agricultural land, leading to a fragmented land structure. Me-
dium-sized and big commercial farms emerged as a few former heads of collectives benefited from the transfer
of considerable parts of collective farms from the public sector and consolidated (mostly through renting) the
big shares from smallholders. The large commercial farms are powerful because they own most of the machinery
and dominate the land rental market, but they hire mostly seasonal low paid labor and are therefore not an
important source of employment for rural populations.
Enhancing the livelihoods of smallholders is critical to the poverty reduction and shared prosperity
agenda since they are more vulnerable to poverty due to high (farm) income volatility. In 2013, farmers
and agricultural workers accounted for 40 percent of Moldova’s poor. The diagnostic of small farms and their
growth potential presented in this report is based on the Moldovan Household Budget Survey (HBS). As the
HBS focuses on households rather than businesses, it covers well the target group of this study - small farms -,
while capturing few medium-sized or large family farms. However, the data poses several limitations. First, the
HBS is not designed to specifically cover farm households, hence, for the purpose of this analysis, farm house-
holds are defined as households that indicate to own or rent land (around 35,000 observations out of the full
dataset of 45,000 households in the 2007-2013 period). Second, the analysis of farm transformation makes use
of the rotating panel of the HBS, but repeated observations are only a part of the HBS sample available
(around 13,000 out of the full dataset). Nevertheless, the HBS provides rich data on socio-economic indicators
and can link household welfare with farm activities, and is therefore used to identify the poverty outcomes of
farm changes.
Findings reveal that structural change is slow and smallholder farm growth in Moldova is an excep-
tion, not the rule. Small farm activities are declining, and farm exits are exceptionally rare while subsistence
farming is becoming more important. The majority of farms are engaged in semi-subsistence farming - a core
component of the rural livelihood strategies in Moldova - and this is likely to persist in the medium and longer
term. Between 2007 and 2013, very few farms gave up their land and farms are more likely to shrink than to
grow (5.6 vs. 2.2 percent). Similarly, more farms moved toward subsistence (those with more than 90 percent
of production for self-consumption) than commercialization (39 percent vs. 13 percent, respectively). This
pattern is due to several reasons:
    •	 First, families tend to keep the small shares to grow subsistence crops for self-consumption and lease the
       big shares to commercial farms. As the land market is only gradually developing, land sales are limited
       and families who cannot lease their big shares choose to leave them fallow or cultivate them in a very
       labor-extensive manner making use of mechanization services.
    •	 Second, demographic aging and emigration result in rural populations getting smaller and older, which
       contributes to the decline of labor-intensive farm activities. Farm households headed by females or
       older or less educated individuals who stay behind increasingly turn toward subsistence farming. By
       2013, subsistence farms make up around three quarters of all family farms. They tend to be smaller, are
       more likely to face food insecurity, and report lower farm and total incomes, yet subsistence farming is

        Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

        perceived as an important safety net for smallholders.
    •	 Finally, the few smallholders with slightly bigger farms, more household members in active age, and
       higher non-farm income (used for purchases of mechanization services and inputs) are more willing to
       commercialize, but they face challenges in market integration detailed below.
Small farms engage in more diverse production activities, but only a small share of their products go
to markets, and market integration opportunities are limited. Different from large commercial farms
which specialize in commodities, small farms produce a large range of vegetables, fruits, nuts, grapes, dairy
products, livestock, and wine. Most of their produce are self-consumed and the surpluses are mostly sold in
local open-air agricultural markets. They are generally excluded from the export markets since they cannot ful-
fil requirements in terms of food safety and quality, which will only increase as Moldova adopts EU regulations.
Small family farms are also less likely to benefit from public investment (less than 0.05 percent) since they lack
the capabilities to take advantage of such opportunities.
Instead of commercialization, farm households often opt for diversification toward non-farm income,
which is more effective in lifting them out of poverty. Farm income contributes less than 20 percent of
total household income on average and most farm households rely on additional income sources, primarily
pensions and wage employment and, to a lesser extent, remittances. Higher education seems to facilitate the
diversification of income sources and those households are also less poor. Indeed, a counterfactual exercise
shows that remittances and diversification into the non-farm sector are associated with better livelihoods, while
concentration on farm activities or commercial orientation of these small farms is correlated with higher pov-
erty.
To make agricultural commercialisation more attractive and effective for poverty reduction, the small
segment of commercially oriented smallholder farms should be enabled to grow and modernize. Ac-
cording to the World Development Report 2008, commercial smallholders not only benefit from expanding
markets and higher values of their activities but also contribute to the growth of the agricultural sector through
delivering surpluses to the market. Evidence from other agriculture-based economies show major declines in
rural poverty accompanying agricultural growth. In view of Moldova’s opportunity to integrate into the EU
market, this paper reviews the EU accession process of Romania and Poland to derive important lessons for
increasing Moldova’s competitiveness and adaption to EU rules. In particular, to enable a new generation of
business-oriented family farms to commercialize and intensify their farm activities in a sustainable manner, the
government should: (i) closely monitor market entry and exit conditions for small commercially oriented farms
and provide (temporary) direct support where potential spillovers into the sector exist; (ii) generate incentives
and build capacities for sustainable and productive agricultural practices; (iii) remove the barriers in the land
market that hinder farm consolidation; (iv) address the market failures in access to finance; (v) implement food
quality and safety programs that aim to reach international standards; (vi) support the penetration into higher
value and organic product markets; (vii) encourage farmers to form cooperatives to strengthen their bargaining
position and getting better access to input and output markets; and (viii) promote professional education and
agricultural extension services to improve quality and productivity in the long term.
However, the majority of smallholders in Moldova do not seem to have the interest or capacity to
commercialize; for those, enhancing their livelihoods calls for policies beyond the agricultural sector.
The agricultural workforce tends to be older and less educated than in other sectors, which indicates the
decreasing importance of agriculture as a source of employment in the future. Rural development therefore
depends on unlocking the full potential of the rural economy through strategies that go beyond the agricultural
sector. The policy agenda should focus on (i) promoting a viable rural non-farm sector that offers alternative
local employment; this requires investments in infrastructure to strengthen rural-urban linkages, attract
investment in rural areas and connects farmers to markets; (ii) promoting a business environment conducive to
higher job creation in both urban and rural areas; and (iii) provision of social protection for elderly farmers who
are likely poor and dependent on subsistence farming with limited income alternative. This can only happen in

an environment of rule of law, more efficient public spending and functioning public institutions, including
local institutions.
This paper is part of the Moldova Poverty Assessment 2016, which includes two analyses in addition
to this paper: “Poverty Reduction and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects” and “A Jobs
Diagnostic for Moldova.” The first identifies the trends and drivers of poverty reduction and shared prosperity,
while the second explores in details the main labor demand and supply challenges in Moldova.
This paper is structured as follows. The first section introduces the motivation and the research question of
the paper. Section 2 provides an overview of the Moldovan farming sector and its policy environment. Section
3 describes the characteristics of smallholder livelihoods. Section 4 presents analyses of the livelihood pathways
of smallholder farms and discusses some poverty implications. The final Section concludes with policy
recommendations based on the results of Section 4 as well as the experiences of other EU accession processes
by Romania and Poland.

Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

The Republic of Moldova (hereafter Moldova) is one of the poorest countries in the EU’s neighborhood.
Despite a clear downward trend in recent years, poverty and food insecurity are still significant. More than 20
percent of households consume less than the recommended level of calorie intake, and around 10 percent live
below the poverty line. The agricultural sector and domestic food production play a key role in fighting poverty
and food insecurity (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). However, the importance of the agricultural
sector must also be seen in its key economic role: agricultural land, about 2.5 million ha, is the country’s main
natural resource (World Bank, 2015b). Currently, Moldova finds itself at a decisive stage of its transition process.
It belongs to the few member states of the former Soviet Union who joined the Commonwealth of Independent
States and decided later to re-orient towards the European Union. In 2014, it signed an Association Agreement,
which includes the establishment of a so-called Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, support in
undertaking a number of reforms, and paves the way towards further integration within the EU economic
space.
Given the current challenges of a further economic integration of Moldova into the Common European
market, strategies how to guide the agricultural development and restructuring process, including
buffering negative consequences of increasing competition, are needed. This paper focuses on
smallholder farms. In Moldova, these small farms are typically strongly subsistence oriented, and make up
about 95 percent of all farms. They are seen as the pool for a viable, commercially oriented family farm sector
that still has to be developed in the country. At the same time, smallholders are particularly vulnerable in terms
of poverty. It is therefore important to understand what constrains current smallholder livelihoods. Thus, the
paper looks at recent trends in the development of farm structures and gives answers to the questions on what
drives the progress of these smallholder farms and what are the related poverty implications. Experiences from
other countries which recently joined the EU are used to derive important lessons with a view to increasing the
sector’s competitiveness and adapting to EU rules.
The core results of this paper include a description of the current situation of Moldova’s agricultural
sector and a discussion on how its structural transformation affects the large number of smallholders
in the country. Semi-subsistence farming is found to be a core component of the rural livelihood strategies in
Moldova, and it is likely to persist in the medium and longer term. Different livelihood options and their drivers
are analyzed with a view to recent developments based on Household Budget Survey (HBS) data of the years
2007-2013. We look at poverty and shared prosperity impacts of certain livelihood pathways, and discuss the
challenges of sustainable development of Moldova’s rural areas.
Results show that, in general, poverty in Moldovan farm households is declining over time. Yet, for
most farm families non-farm oriented livelihood pathways seem to be the more promising choice. A
majority of farmers seems to hardly respond to market-based policy signals designed to provide incentives for
market integration, and only a limited number of farms shows aspirations and potential to develop their farms
into viable agricultural businesses. All policy efforts should distinguish these two groups, the subsistence
oriented one and the more market oriented one, as each of them needs specific approaches. The latter group
has an interest in commercialization and policies should facilitate this strategy. The large majority of smallholder
families, however, is better served with general economic and social policies.
A comparison with Romania and Poland reveals that the implementation of the acquis communautaire
and the fulfilment of the EU administrative requirements is a tedious and complex task. Poland is a
good example of how giving priority to enhancing competitiveness, adapting to EU standards, and modernizing
the sector resulted in a positive development of agriculture in the post-accession period. Romania is more
similar to Moldova as for cultural and geographical aspects. In Romania, the strong dualistic structure of the
sector, a lack of entrepreneurial experience and investment capacity of the large majority of smallholder farms,
as well as prevailing market failures, that were not sufficiently and effectively addressed by policy makers,
hindered a smooth transformation. The Moldovan government should learn from these experiences in order
to let its citizens reap the full benefits of the association process.

This report is accompanied by two additional pieces – with the three together comprising the Moldova
Poverty Assessment - that are also critical to understanding in more depth the challenges that Moldova
faces for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The paper Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress
and Prospects explored the recent poverty trends in Moldova and finds that its drivers – public transfers and
remittances – are not sustainable forces for progress moving forward. The second research, A Jobs Diagnostic for
Moldova, explores the demand and labor supply in Moldova to uncover the job creation challenges in a country
with very weak labor markets. The three pieces are providing significant inputs to the more comprehensive
approach of the Moldova Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) (World Bank, forthcoming) which precisely
explores in depth what are the main constraints, across the economy, to achieving progress in poverty reduction
and shared prosperity moving forward.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 starts with an overview of some general
structural features of the Moldovan farming sector including key policies. Section 3 introduces the Moldovan
Household Budget Survey (HBS), and, based on this database, provides some stylized facts on the main features
of smallholder livelihoods. Section 4 presents analyses of the livelihood pathways of smallholder farms and
discusses some poverty implications. Finally, Section 5 discusses policy implications with view to the results of
Section 4, but also along experiences of former EU accession processes. It concludes with policy
recommendations.

This section first introduces some general structural features of the Moldovan farming sector and rural poverty
issues (sub-section 2.1). It further provides a brief overview of the key policies and those aspects of the
institutional environment that affect the farming sector, in particular the well-being of smallholders (sub-
section 2.2).


2.1 Moldova’s farming sector and poverty in rural areas
Moldova has a large rural population that is affected by rural-urban and international migration.
Overall, Moldova has the highest population density among European post-communist countries after Kosovo
and the Czech Republic, placing it in the medium range compared to Western European countries (95 inhabitants
per square km according to the 2014 Census), but with a clear preponderance of small-scale settlements instead
of urban concentrations. According to preliminary data of the latest Census, around 1.9 million people,
representing 66 percent of the total population, live in rural areas. The Census data further show that the urban
population decreased considerably in the last decade due to significant out-migration. The rural population,
although also affected by migration which has become an important livelihood strategy for many families
(Bolganschi, 2011), remained constant.
The country is divided into five development regions with different agricultural potential: North,
Centre, South, Gagauzia, and Chisinau. The North includes eleven districts and the municipality of Balti.
Due to its more favorable climate, it has traditionally been the most developed area from the agricultural point
of view, with larger farms and a specialization on orchards. The Centre comprises thirteen districts. It is the
most densely populated area apart from the capital, with comparatively smaller farms and a long tradition of
vine growing. The Centre can benefit from the spillover effects of the big Chisinau market. However, it includes
also some more remote districts, like Soldanesti and Rezina. The South has eight districts. It is the most remote
region. Due to the dry climate, yields in the South are lower, and the prevailing of steppes has favored extensive
sheep breeding. Gagauzia is a small autonomous region located in the South and inhabited by a Turkish minority;
its geographical features are analogous to those of the South.
Agriculture is an important sector of Moldova’s economy, but its productivity remains low. In 2014, the
share of agriculture in the GDP was at 14 percent (World Bank, 2015b). Although agricultural employment,
after a tremendous increase over the 1990s, has dropped significantly since 2000, the agricultural sector still
provided accounted for 30 percent of employment in 2014. Its low productivity is linked to missing investments,
and a lack of capital and credit availability, which resulted in low-yield technologies and low use of fertilizers
and pesticides (Moroz, Stratan, Ignat, & Lucasenco, 2015). It clearly affects the welfare of Moldova’s rural
population, who depends significantly on the farming sector.
Rural poverty is a widespread phenomenon. Moldova’s economy fails to provide sufficient income sources
for its rural population. The poverty incidence among rural inhabitants is significantly higher than among the
urban population. In rural areas, 18.8 percent of the population was poor in 2013. In urban areas, this percentage
was only 4.6 percent. Although poverty rates generally declined in recent years, the gap between urban and rural
areas persists (World Bank, 2016). It seems also no longer true that rural households are less vulnerable to food
insecurity (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). Thus, a close monitoring of rural poverty is needed.
Poverty is particularly found among landless people, small and medium-scale farmers, entrepreneurs,
and people engaged in agro-processing in rural areas and small towns. In general, rural people are more
vulnerable to poverty due to high (farm) income volatility and a strong dependence on remittances (World Bank
& World Food Programme, 2015). The poor tend to live in larger households with higher dependency rates. In
addition, their educational level is relatively low: many have not completed secondary education (Davalos &
Meyer, 2015). The heads of almost 70 percent of all poor households are employed, yet their wages are too low
to enable their households to leave the poverty zone. Poverty and food energy deficiency are particularly high

                                                              5
           Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

           among those who strongly depend on agriculture. In 2013, farmers and agricultural workers together account
           for 40 percent of Moldova’s poor (World Bank, 2015b; World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015).
           Almost all Moldovan farms are small family farms. These smallholders suffer from limited access to
           agricultural land and extreme fragmentation of land ownership. This happens due to different reasons.
           First, at the end of the Soviet era most rural villagers received a small amount of land, usually less than one
           hectare per household, to satisfy their consumption needs. This land, called small share, was split into separate
           parcels, which became property of the family based on the 1991 Land Code (Law 828, 12.25.1991). Second, as
           a result of the equity-driven privatization process (Lerman & Cimpoies, 2006), every active and retired collective
           farm worker was entitled to a land share when kolkhozes and sovkhozes were dismantled in the second half of the
           1990s (Giovarelli & Bledsoe, 2001). These plots, called big shares, were designed in order to grant equal access
           to land of different types to every recipient, and therefore, they included a portion of arable land, one of
           orchards, and, if available, one of vineyards. Their surface varies between one and two hectares per entitled
           person, depending on the land stock of the collective farm (i.e. of the village). Finally, rural houses are
           surrounded by household plots whose area varies between 0.05 and 0.5 hectare. Hence, on average, rural
           households own between two and three hectares of agricultural land.
            Although small family farms form the overwhelming majority of agricultural enterprises, most of the
            available farmland is cultivated by a few large farms, implying a strong dualistic structure of the
            farming sector. According to the 2011 General Agricultural Census, there are around 900,000 farms working
            on 2,243,540 hectares of land in Moldova (Figure 2 and Annex Table 1). More than half of them cultivate less
            than 0.5 ha, while about 95 percent of all farms use an area of less than 3 ha. Together the small family farms
            (below 3 ha) cultivate 26.8 percent of total agricultural land. Opposed to them, around 3,000 farms with more
            than 50 ha (but usually much more than that) cultivate over 60 percent of the total agricultural land. These big
            farms emerged during the chaotic years of the privatization process as a result of gathering together the big
            shares. People belonging to the rural nomenclature bought or, more often, rented land, and usually registered
            their new farms as limited liability companies (1,261 out of 3,029 farms, or 50.5 percent of land cultivated by
            farms over 50 ha), or similar enterprise types (896 farms, or 26.3 percent of land). Cooperatives (184 farms, or
            11.0 percent of land) and State enterprises (46, 1.3 percent of land), but also large family farms (555, 7 percent
 nterprises (46, 1.3 percent of land), but also large family farms (555, 7 percent of land) are

         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Despite their smaller share in the total land area, small family farms form an extremely important part of
the agricultural sector, as they provide a fundamental contribution to the overall food production and food
security in Moldova. They not only produce as much as 71 percent of total agricultural output (Volk, Erjavec, Rac,
& Rednak, 2015), but seem also to be more productive and more efficient than large farms (Lerman & Sutton, 2008).
Therefore, the difference in productivity most likely origins from a more intense use of labor and a different
production portfolio, featuring more high-value products like vegetables, wine and livestock by smallholder farms. A
similar situation is observed in Romania, where farms with larger land areas have a higher labor productivity, but a
lower standard output value per hectare of farmland. This is explained also by the different production structure
where the small-sized farms integrate crop and livestock production, while the large-sized farms are mostly
specialized in crop production (Tudor, 2014).
Large-scale agricultural companies specialize in the production of commodities such as cereals and
sunflower, while small farms show higher diversity. Cereals and industrial crops, in particular maize,
sunflower and (in the North of the country) sugar beet, are dominating the production portfolio of agricultural
companies. This specialization has been driven by a number of factors such as relatively low production costs, the
availability of agricultural machinery, relatively simple and cheap post-harvest processes, as well as export markets
for these commodities, which, up to the recent disputes with Russia, could be considered secure. However, the
lack of appropriate rotation schemes and of irrigation as well as the cultivation of crops unsuited to the local soil
and climatic conditions has led to depleted soils and low yields (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12). Differently from large
commercial farms, small ones are more diversified. They typically divide their land into three major production
activities: (1) vegetables, including potatoes and leguminous plants, and fruits; (2) cereals – mostly maize – and
sunflower; and (3) vineyards (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12). Also livestock production is primarily managed by
smallholders (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). We find that dairy cattle is the most common (and
successful) investment of small farmers, including the elderly. According to Piras and Botnarenco (2015), cow
breeders sell around one third of their milk; the rest is either self-consumed or used for producing cheese and
sour cream. Such processed milk products are then often sold. Experienced milk and dairy sellers have a space in
the open-air town market, and implement regular sanitary controls. Decent incomes can be obtained even with a
limited number of cows (most of the interviewees had just one or two) especially if market access is given: in the
village of Clișova (Orhei), for example, farmers benefit from a local collection point for cow milk, which facilitates
market access for small producers.



   Box 1: Small family farms and large commercial farms: are
   they direct competitors at all?
   Large commercial farms and the majority of the subsistence oriented smallholder farms are closely
   interconnected via several ways. Based on qualitative research, we identified three major types of relations:
   •	 Land rental markets: Large commercial farms are renting in land from smallholders. In most cases,
      small farmers rent out their big shares and use the small shares for their own needs. The latter are
      closer to the village, but more fragmented and, thus, less attractive for tenants. In general, there seems
      to be no competition for rental land. However, it is not clear in how far the decision to lease land is
      always a completely free and revertible one (see Box 2). It seems that the current practice of one
      powerful large local farmer as the sole renter of land in a village may prevent that other farmers with
      growth potential would be able to compete in a fair way from the beginning on.
   •	 Private short-term loans: Local large commercial farmers often lend money to smallholders at the
      beginning of the agricultural season to finance the purchase of seeds or the provision of machinery
      services. Smallholders usually pay back once they have sold their products after harvest. This type of

                                                               7
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity


       financing seems to be the most important source of credit for smallholders, as it goes with low
       administrative burden and with low or even without interest rates. According to our interviews with
       smallholders, this practice creates, however, an uncomfortable moral obligation to keep good relations
       with the moneylender. It thus strengthens the position of the local leader with view to the rented in
       land.
   •	 Provision of machinery services: Due to their low level of mechanization, smallholders rely on
      contractors for machinery services. The local large commercial farmer usually offers these machinery
      services, but there is some limited competition, as also a few medium-sized farmers – for whom this
      activity might be a very important source of income – offer such services.
   Overall, we observe that small and large farmers depend on each other. Large farmers depend on the land
   that they rent from smallholders. Small farmers rely on large farmers for financing their purchase of
   inputs and for this reason will not easily withdraw their leased big shares as this might lead to being
   refused a credit the following year. In this relationship, we find widespread resentment among smallholders
   toward large farmers, who often used to be directors, or heads of a brigade, in the former Soviet collective
   farms, and are respected for their economic success, but also feared for their influence if conflicts arise.
   Concerning product markets, there is currently no direct competition between small and large farmers.
   Large commercial farms are mostly export-oriented and concentrate on the production of low value-
   added commodities, like cereals and oil seeds. Small farmers produce mainly for their own consumption.
   Sales refer to high value-added products that are offered at local open-air markets or to neighbors.
   Smallholders rely on direct relations with the buyers because their agricultural and processed products
   usually do not meet international standards on food quality. However, there are single cases where small
   dairy producers (two cows) mentioned that they do veterinary and sanitary controls, showing that there
   is a chance of improving quality and earning a decent profit, even with a small investment.
   [based on qualitative interviews conducted by Piras and Botnarenco (2015)]


Integration into international agricultural trade poses significant challenges, e.g. due to quality and
food safety issues and the oligopsonistic structure of the agribusiness. Moldovan agricultural products
are in the low-price segment on international markets because of deficiencies in terms of quality and food
safety standards. Indeed, Moldovan producers tended to rely on the positive reputation of their products within
the CIS market dating back to the Soviet period, rather than innovating; therefore, they did not invest either in
marketing or in a better product presentation (packaging, etc.) (Piras & Botnarenco, 2015). Furthermore, the
national agribusiness sector presents an oligopsonistic structure, i.e. only a few private companies are allowed
to export agricultural products and can thus set the purchasing prices from farmers. In general, only large
commercial farms are able to serve the export markets and form the export potential of the agri-food sector,
while small farms only generate a limited surplus of high value-added crops. These surpluses, which include
fruits, nuts, grapes, vegetables, potatoes, but also milk, dairy products, eggs, poultry meat, and wine, are mostly
sold in local open air agricultural markets (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12).


2.2 The institutional environment for
agriculture and rural development
The main actor in the field of agricultural and rural policies is the Ministry of Agriculture and Food
Industry (MAFI). Subordinated organizations are responsible for managing financial resources, implementing
sectoral policies for the wine sector, implementing registers of producers, and for food safety aspects.

                                                     8
         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Furthermore, the Ministries of Economics; Environment; Construction and Regional Development as well as
Labor, Social Protection and Family, develop policies, which, directly and indirectly, affect the agricultural sector
and rural households.
The National Development Strategy “Moldova 2020” aims at achieving economic growth and poverty
reduction. In line with these overall goals, there are a number of policy documents with a direct focus on
agriculture and rural development. The current National Strategy on Agriculture and Rural Development for the
period 2014-2020 guides the structure of spending on agriculture. For the seven-year period, an overall budget
of more than 2 billion EUR is foreseen for financing the goals of the strategy (World Bank, 2015b). It has three
general objectives: (1) to increase competitiveness of the agri-food sector through modernization and market
integration; (2) to ensure sustainable management of natural resources in agriculture; and (3) to improve
standards of living in rural areas. The National Strategy for the Sustainable Development of the Agro-industrial Complex
(2008-2015) has the overall goal to ensure a sustainable growth of the agro-industrial sector with a consequent
improvement of quality of life in rural areas by increasing the sector’s competitiveness and productivity. The
Food Safety Strategy for the years 2011-2015 aims at achieving the highest standards of health protection and food
safety. The Strategy for the Development of Rural Extension Services for the period 2012-2022 foresees a rapid transition
to a modern model of organization of rural extension services based on knowledge and innovation, and
oriented towards continuous improvement of the quality of life in rural area (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12).
Despite a rather liberal foreign trade regime, agricultural producers are implicitly taxed. Comparison
of domestic and reference prices over the period 2004-2013 reveal negative price protection for crops. Domestic
producer prices for wheat, maize, potatoes, and sunflower have been 10 to 51 percent below a border reference
price. Furthermore, domestic prices for sheep meat and eggs are substantially lower (-60 percent and -40
percent) than the reference price whereas prices for pig meat and poultry are much higher (in some years up to
100 percent). Volk et al. (2015) relate this observation to an undervaluation of the Moldovan currency and the
low purchasing power of Moldovan consumers. However, high transport costs could also cause price wedges.
Furthermore, administrative costs represent an additional barrier to trade: based on the Doing Business Ranking,
the country occupies a middle rank among the ECA countries (13 out of 26) (World Bank, 2015a).
Moldova’s spending on agriculture is sufficiently high, but could be more effective. The total value of
the State budget expenditures for agriculture, forestry and fishery has been fluctuating between 1.4 percent (2013)
and 1.7 percent (2009) of GDP during the last years. Due to the depressed economic situation, there is no fiscal
space to increase spending; however, the current share of expenditure on GDP exceeds that of comparable countries
such as Romania (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12; World Bank, 2015b). Still, the World Bank (2015b) clearly criticizes that,
in particular, tax expenditures arising from preferential tax treatment arrangements for agriculture are not effectively
addressing the challenges identified for the sector. Moreover, persistent delays in the administration of state payments
create a sense of insecurity that hinders large investments by commercial farmers. Finally, public support for
agricultural investment usually does not reach smallholders, who also lack capabilities to take advantage of such
opportunities if they arise. For example, the 2011 Agricultural Census revealed that the number of family farms
which had benefited from rural development measures during the previous three years was just 322 out of 898,768
for measures targeting farm modernization, and 297 for those targeting farm diversification (0.04 and 0.03 percent).
The same figures were, respectively, 338 and 301 out of 3,446 for corporate farms (9.8 and 8.7 percent).
The most important mechanism for supporting agricultural production are subsidies provided through
the Agency of Intervention and Payments for Agriculture (AIPA). AIPA subsidies flow into measures
targeting farm restructuring; a smaller share of funds flows into direct producer support and post-harvest and
processing infrastructure. In 2014, investment support for improving post-harvest and processing equipment
received the largest amount (26 percent). Compared to 2009 figures where only 2.7 percent of the budget was
devoted to this type of support, post-harvest and processing gained substantially. Support of investment into
machinery and equipment comes second occupying 22 percent of AIPA’s budget in 2014. The third and fourth
position of the budget, respectively, represents investment support for new orchards and vinery (17 percent) as
well as protected field vegetable production (9 percent). The livestock sector received investment support for
                                                                9
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

pedigree livestock as well as equipment and technological renovation (both measures occupy nine percent of
the budget in 2014). Recurrent subsidies declined in budgetary relevance. The share of subsidies of risk
insurance premiums, as the largest position among the group of recurrent subsidies, amounts to five percent in
2014 (World Bank, 2015b).
However, subsidization alone is not enough: rural development and a healthy structural adaptation of
the agricultural sector depend on a functioning institutional environment and a supporting governance
structure. For the farm sector, and for structural change within this sector, the land and credit markets are of
core importance. Furthermore, the education system and extension services should play a major role for a
successful restructuring. A smoothly functioning agricultural administration is known to be of key importance
for increasing the effectiveness of any supporting measure. In particular, with a view to achieving budget
support in the field of agriculture through EU funds, a sound financial management system is needed (Sobjak,
2015). Some of these aspects are discussed in more details in the following sections.
A land market is gradually developing in Moldova. Starting in 1999 real estate has been included in the
Land Registry. Therefore, this year can be considered the start of the land market. The yearly number of land
transactions grew from zero in 1999 to more than 70,000 in 2008. The price of land varies considerably within
the country, and even within districts. Most of the overall around 400,000 transactions in this decade took place
in the central districts. All in all, only around 38,000 ha (1.7 percent of the total agricultural land) changed
owner in the first decade, and the average transaction involved barely 0.10 ha (Cimpoies, 2010).
Most agricultural land is in private hands, constituting about 74 percent of total land at the beginning
of 2015, while the remaining 26 percent was in public ownership (Figure 3). However, there are drastic
differences in the ownership status depending on the type of land. Most strikingly, only 2 percent of pastures
and hayfields are private. They usually belong to the municipality, and management costs are covered with a
modest annual tax proportional to the number of animals (cows, goats, sheep and horses) kept by the respective
household. On the opposite, 94 percent of vineyards and 84 percent of the arable land are owned by private
individuals (National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova, 2015b).

total agricultural land was leased, of which 72 percent by limited companies, 15 percent by production
cooperatives, and 8 percent by joint-stock companies. Most of the leasing contracts have a duration of one to
three years, limiting the possibility for the tenant to plan in the longer term (Cimpoies, 2011).
Despite a modest increase of agricultural lending in recent years, farms remain poorly financed. The
major deficiencies can be summarized as follows: (1) overall insufficient collateral options; (2) almost no supply of
long-term loans; (3) hardly any support instrument to facilitate access to credits, like loan guarantee funds (Moroz,
et al., 2015, p. 12). Interest rates are high, amounting to 15-20 percent annually, while annual inflation was below 5
percent during the last years. After 2014, due to the spreading effects of the crisis of the Russian ruble, inflation
picked up again and interest rates grew. While large farmers can still negotiate a bank loan with 16 percent interest
rate, small farmers, if loans were available at all, pay more than 20 percent for bank loans and up to 30 percent if,
due to lacking collaterals, they have to take a credit from local agencies based in the villages (Piras & Botnarenco,
2015). Hence, the majority of farmers rely on own financial sources or do not invest at all.
The agricultural education system in Moldova seems outdated and hampered by a mismatch between
the skills and knowledge taught and those demanded by the labor market. Agricultural education is
offered by the State Agricultural University of Moldova, eight agricultural colleges (five of them situated in the
North, where agriculture is more intensive and export-oriented, and one each in Chisinau, Ungheni, and in
Gagauzia), and about 20 vocational schools. The EU funded EUniAM project, which aims at consolidating the
higher educational system of Moldova, recently recommended the closure of the Agricultural University, whose
branches should be included in other high educational institutions (Turcan & Bugaian, 2015). Indeed, public
funding seems not enough for the development and consolidation of educational infrastructure, repair of
buildings, modernization of equipment, and professional training. In addition, there is a lack of young,
internationally trained teachers. The resulting negative image of the agricultural education system is reflected in
the declining number of students. Similarly, the agricultural research and innovation system operate in isolation
and did not manage successfully the transition. Due to insufficient funds, outdated methods, and low performing
personnel, research institutes fail to offer viable solutions for the development of the agricultural sector (Moroz,
et al., 2015, p. 12; World Bank, 2015b).
The network of agricultural extension services (ACSA), established in 2002 with World Bank support,
reaches out to about 50 percent of Moldova’s farmers. The extension network is coordinated from the
head office located in Chisinau, and consists of 35 regional offices and regional advisers, involving 75 regional
and 350 local consultants working in rural areas. Benefiting for a long time from financial support of international
donors, the extension network services are free-of-charge (Moroz, et al., 2015, p. 12). Services are provided to
all types of farms, including large-scale corporate farms, medium-size commercial farms, as well as small
subsistence farms, which form the largest client group. Indeed, the 2011 Agricultural Census revealed that
25,313 family farms (2.8 percent) had benefited from consulting services in the previous three years, while this
figure was 87 (2.5 percent) among corporate farms. Since the international donors have ceased their payments
in 2013, the network is now exclusively depending on state funding.
Agricultural policies especially target large farms and, to a lower degree, small farmers who aim at
commercialization, yet, the majority of subsistence oriented farms would benefit most from general
economic and social policies. Social policies need to be developed in order to reach the most vulnerable
groups. A considerable share of about one quarter of the socially vulnerable population in working age has, for
instance, no adequate access to healthcare services (Molodikova, 2008). The poverty-targeted program Ajutor
Social (Social Aid), which specifically addresses those most in need, is one recent, positively evaluated program
(World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). For smallholders, agricultural land represented an important
social buffer during the economic hardship of the reforms aiming at economic liberalization and privatization
that the country went through in the early years of transition. However, in the course of economic development,
agricultural activities will increasingly lose their importance when subsistence farmers more and more diversify
into non-farm sectors or exit production due to age and health reasons. Thus, the development of the non-
farm rural economy needs to be in the focus of policy makers addressing rural areas as well.

         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

In this chapter, we turn toward our core database, the Moldovan Household Budget Survey (HBS) for the years
2007-2013. We start from a brief discussion of definitions of small and (semi)subsistence farms and their
identification in the HBS (sub-section 3.1) and continue with some stylized facts on the main features of smallholder
livelihoods (sub-section 3.2).


3.1 Small and (semi)subsistence farms:
definitions and operationalization
Defining small family farms is not a trivial task, as the sole consensus on small farms may be the lack
of a sole definition (Nagayets, 2005). Small-scale agriculture is often used interchangeably with smallholder,
family, subsistence, resource-poor, low-income, low-input, or low-technology farming (Heidhues & Brüntrup,
2003). As a result, the issue spans a widely diversified group, from market-oriented, middle class family
businesses, to poor subsistence farmers. Criteria such as the farm size, the economic size, and market participation
are crucial to distinguish (semi-)subsistence farms from commercial farms (Buchenrieder, Fritzsch, Wegener,
Curtiss, & Gomez y Paloma, 2009). The most common approach, driven by availability of internationally
comparable data, is to define small farms simply based on the size of landholding. It is important, however, to
recognize the limitations of this measure, given that it fails to properly account for the quality and quantity of
other resources (e.g. animal stock), the types of crops grown, the degree of commercialization or disparities
across regions. Still, size based measures may be seen as more robust compared to income-based measures,
which are always prone to bias.
In this paper, we make use of the dataset of the Moldovan HBS, which, although rich, presents some
limitations with respect to the analysis of smallholder farming. The HBS is conducted annually by the
National Bureau of Statistics and covers a representative sample of the whole population. It comprises between
5,000 (2013) and 6,000 (2007-08) interviewed households per annum. We use data covering the years 2007-
2013. While 50 percent of the households are interviewed only once, or twice at a distance of 3 months, the
remaining ones are foreseen to be interviewed four times at a distance of 12 months. However, since the
sampling proceeds as a rotating panel, only a very small share of households reported data for the full period
of four years (less than 6 percent). It has to be noted that this time period includes the financial crisis that
started in 2008 (GDP declined by 6 percent from 2008 to 2009). Moreover, in 2007 and 2012 the Moldovan
farming sector was affected by severe droughts (World Bank, 2015b). Apart from these setbacks, the decade
between 2004 and 2013 witnessed impressive GDP growth rates (ranging from 3 percent in 2007 to 9.4 percent
in 2013).


   Box 2: Defining small family farms
   Definitions of farms and farmers vary across Europe. In the context of the EU Common Agricultural
   Policy (CAP), a farmer is an individual (or group of individuals, e.g. partnerships, companies, and other
   legal structures through which a business is conducted), whose holding is situated within the territory of
   the European Union, and who exercises an agricultural activity. A holding means all the units used for
   agricultural activities and managed by a farmer situated within the territory of the same Member State.
   The 2011 Moldova Agricultural Census defines a farm as follows: “An agricultural holding is a technical
   economic unit (with or without juridical status) having a single management and carrying out agricultural
   activities by utilizing agricultural land and/or livestock breeding, or activities related to maintaining
   agricultural land in good agricultural and environmental conditions, whether as its principal activity or as
   a secondary activity” (National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova, 2013).

                                                              13
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity


   Commercially oriented farms need to be distinguished from subsistence and semi-subsistence ones.
   Subsistence farms are those that produce (almost) exclusively for their own consumption. The EU defines
   semi-subsistence farms as agricultural holdings, which produce primarily for their own consumption and
   market a proportion of their output (Regulation EC/1698/2005). However, the definition gives no
   threshold with respect to the share of farm sales (or any other indicators) in order to distinguish between
   subsistence and commercial farms. The European Commission (EC) advises Members States that a
   precise definition should take into account the minimum and/or maximum size of the farm, the
   proportion of production marketed, and/or the level of income of the farm (Regulation EC/1974/2006,
   Annex II).


Various size-based definitions are used in Moldova to identify small farms. According to the definition
adopted in the quarterly Research on Agricultural Activity of Small-Sized Agricultural Producers (National Bureau of
Statistics of the Republic of Moldova, 2015a), small farms comprise of personal auxiliary households (gospodarii)
of citizens, peasant households holding a surface of land smaller than 10 hectares regularly registered, and
people who received equivalent shares of land but did not register their agricultural household. The National
Institute of Economic Research uses a three-hectare threshold for defining small and semi-subsistence farms
when calculating standard agricultural costs, and does not calculate them for farms under this threshold.
However, as shown in Figure 1, this group includes already about 93.6 percent of all farms of the country. An
adequate definition of subsistence and semi-subsistence farms in Moldova should reflect the specific farm
structure in the country. Therefore, even very small farms should not be omitted. Defining the farm size along
income figures (economic size) is in theory preferable, but highly complex and prone to bias. The main
limitations of this criterion are, first, data availability, in particular regarding the smallest entities, due to a lack
of precise record keeping, and second, its reliance on standardized values, which could be erroneously
misinterpreted as the actual economic results of the agricultural holding (EC, 2011).
The HBS is not designed to specifically cover farm households. Therefore, we identified farm
households as those households who indicate to own or rent land. This land includes shares distributed
in line with §11 (82) and 39 of the Land Code (i.e. small shares) and in line with §12 of the Land Code and §2 of
the Law emending it (i.e. big shares), as well as home gardens. We defined this group of households as farm
households regardless whether they are located in urban or rural areas. We do not apply a minimum size
threshold, thus reflecting the full range of typical small farms. In general, the majority of farms in Moldova are
tiny (see Section 2.1). We excluded households who own only dachas, i.e. countryside houses with a garden. As
a result of this selection, our sample size ranges from 4,782 in 2007 to 4,165 in 2013. In the following pages, if
not indicated differently, we will refer to these farm households as the sample tout court. The biggest farm in our
HBS sample has a size of about 49 ha and is a clear outlier. Large corporate commercial farms cannot be
identified based on the HBS, which looks at households and not at businesses. Middle-sized and large family
farms should in theory be included in the HBS. However, they are very rare, in line with their low relative share
in the Moldovan family farm population. Figure 4 clearly indicates that farms of 10 ha or more are almost
negligible in the HBS sample and that a targeted survey would be necessary to get a better picture of them.
The terms small farms and smallholders are confined to all farms identified in the sample. This has
pragmatic reasons, as the HBS sample consists almost exclusively of small farms, as defined by the 3 or 10 ha
thresholds mentioned above. The number of farm households with more than 3 ha is already extremely small.
However, we distinguish three size groups: farms smaller than 1 ha, farms with between 1 and 2 ha, and farms
larger than 2 ha. The farm size is measured here as the available land defined as owned land minus rented out
land plus rented in land, thus reflecting the land utilized by the family including abandoned land on which the
family can expand its production in the short term. We further classified subsistence farms by selecting

negative) are classified as pure subsistence farms. Unfortunately, no separate data on farm sales are available in our database.
2	 The periphery indicator adds to the classical urban-rural divide. Since the capital Chisinau is by far the major agglomeration of the country,
we separated the households of the sample into those settled within 60 km of road distance from it, and those settled further away in the periph-
ery. We assume that those living next to the capital have better options in marketing their agricultural products, but also better opportunities for
tapping non-farm jobs.

Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

the share of extremely small farms (less than 1 ha) slightly increased, whereas the share of farms holding 1-2
ha or more than 2 ha slightly decreased (Table 3). This seems similar to Romania, where there is a trend of even
further concentration of agricultural land around the farms of small and very small size (Timofti, Popa, &
Kielbasa, 2015). The major reason for this decline seems to be the drop of families using their big shares. Indeed,
the average area of small shares and house gardens remained constant at around 0.29 ha, while that of big shares
declined from 1.29 ha (2007) to 1.05 ha (2013).
Land productivity is higher within the smallest farms (<1 ha). The agricultural income per farmed hectare is
about three times higher for them compared to the middle-sized group (1-2 ha), and even more than that compared
to farms over 2 ha. However, this should not be seen as the effect of size, but is most likely linked to the production
portfolio. Typically, farm households use the land around their house for cultivating higher value crops (e.g.
vegetables and berries) or for keeping their animals (for which they also use common grazing land). Surplus
production of milk, dairy products, honey, etc. is sold. The small share includes some parcels of arable land and is
used mostly for maize (animal feed), for subsistence crops like beans, or for vineyards. On the other hand, the big
shares are used more extensively. Cultivating the larger fields of the big share without a minimum level of mechanization
requires significant labor input. If this land is not leased out, families tend to cultivate it in a very labor-extensive
manner, with crops like cereals, alfalfa and sunflower, paying for machinery services.
Irrigation is rarely possible, since most irrigation facilities deteriorated after the collapse of the Soviet
Union. Only 213 thousand hectares of arable land (11.7 percent), and 13 thousands of permanent crops (4.6
percent) were irrigated in 2015; these figures have not changed since 2011 (National Bureau of Statistics of the
Republic of Moldova, 2015b). No farmer in the 2007-2013 HBS sample reported expenditures for irrigation,
apart from one in 2007. The same situation was detected by the qualitative survey: only two interviewees could
benefit from the water of a nearby river and extracted it using a gasoline pump. Instead, wells are very common
in the home gardens (Piras & Botnarenco, 2015).
Farming provides an important source of income to smallholder households. Yet, its share in total
household income is declining over time. While, on average, farm income made up almost 30 percent in
2007, its share dropped to 18 percent in 2013. This drop took place mainly in the years until 2009. The share
of farm income is higher for households with bigger farms, but decreased in all size categories (Table 3)3.
Moreover, a higher dependency on agricultural incomes is found in poor households.
Peripheral farms are highly dependent on farm incomes, and their absolute farm household income is
lower. Household incomes and their structure differ considerably between farms located in peripheral regions
and those close to Chisinau. Peripheral farms have a generally higher share of farm income in total incomes. In
2007, they earned about 25 percent less than non-peripheral farms; the gap in 2013 was lower, at 18 percent. This
gap between peripheral and more central regions is also observed in the poverty headcounts; again, the differences
are getting smaller over the years (Table 5).
Overall, poverty numbers show cautious positive trend. Income figures in Table 2 show that the average
household income is more or less stable over time, amounting to about 36,000 MDL. However, since the average
household size declined during the same period, the average per capita income4 gradually increased from
17,084 MDL in 2007 to 18,911 MDL in 2013. Hence, the economic situation is cautiously improving, and the
overall share of poor farm households decreased from 28.5 in 2007 to 14.9 percent in 2013 (Table 2).
Despite still high levels of poverty and food insecurity, small farms in Moldova tend to not make full
use of their land and production potential. Farms lease out a considerable share of their farmland, or even
leave it abandoned. Particularly farms in the smallest farm size category (<1 ha) lease a relatively large share of
over 30 percent of their initial land. Leased land usually comprises the big share, while the household plot and
the small share are kept. A considerable portion of total farmland, on average almost 20 percent, is left fallow.
3	   Given that data on cash and in-kind farm income were collected in 2007 for the first time, the impressive drop from 2007 to 2008 is possibly
caused by an adjustment of measurement methods after the first pioneering year.
4	   Per capita incomes are calculated based on equivalent family size, i.e. household head = 1, other adults = 0.7; children under 15 years = 0.5 (NBS,

           Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Land abandonment is likely to be the result of restitution, but old-aged farm operators and out-migration
further contribute to the tendency to leave land unused; often the abandoned parcels are small, difficult to reach
and/or of poor land quality (Dudwick, Fock, & Sedik, 2007; Rolfes, 2008). The average surface of land that is
actually farmed decreased by 12 percent within the smallest category of farms, while it stayed constant within
the middle one, and increased by 10 percent among the biggest farms between 2007 and 2013 (Table 1).5
Out-migration of younger household members may be one reason why farm activities are shrinking
and poverty rates decreased. As mentioned above, declining household sizes helped to improve the poverty
situation. The average household size is less than three members, and it declined from 2.76 in 2007 to 2.46 in
2013 (Table 1). Probably, younger household members have left rural areas in search of employment. Indeed,
the Moldova Food Assessment reports a drop in agricultural employment due to massive outmigration, from 51
percent in 2000 to 26 percent in 2012 (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). The elder generation,
however, stayed back6. This is in line with the gradual increase of the age of the household heads, from 55 years
in 2007 to 57 years in 2013. The share of households headed by females increased gradually within the period
under study, from 37 percent to 39 percent (Table 1). For life expectancy reasons, women tend to head old-aged
households. As the average farmers’ age increases, this group is getting more and more important. In small and
old-aged households, labor-intensive farm activities may be expected to go down.
The ageing of smallholders is linked to their subsistence orientation. As mentioned above, we categorize
subsistence farms as those who consume more than 90 percent of their farm production. In other words, they
almost exclusively produce for their own consumption. Subsistence farm households are often small, female
headed, have a lower education level, and older household heads with health problems (Table 4). Thus, ageing
seems to be a driver of subsistence orientation. In line with this, subsistence is also linked to lower levels of
education. In 2013, still 10 percent of the heads of the subsistence farms had only primary (or lower) education,
while this share was less than 6 percent among the more market-oriented farmers. However, the share of household
heads with a low educational level is declining among both subsistence and more market-oriented farms.
In most farms, agricultural activities mainly serve the subsistence needs of smallholder families.
Subsistence farms make up around three quarters of all family farms in the sample (Table 4). Compared to the
more market-oriented farms, subsistence farms are overall smaller. The gap in farm sizes seems to be expanding
over time: while the difference was about 16 percent in 2007, it increased to 36 percent in 2013 (Table 4). On
average, more than 80 percent of farm production is consumed directly by the farm family; in subsistence
farms, this share is over 99 percent, while the more market-oriented farms still have a share of in-kind income
of around 45 percent in 2013. The high level of subsistence has not changed much over time, although there
is a clear declining trend for more market oriented farms. Hence, farm activities mainly serve subsistence needs,
and only a small share of farm production reaches the markets. This is true even for the group of the biggest
farms, having access to more than 2 ha (Table 3). The latter show, however, a noticeable drop of subsistence in
recent time, from 85 percent in 2010 to 77 percent in 2013. As for peripheral households, the share of own
consumption of farm output is slightly higher, but also close to Chisinau the subsistence level exceeds 80
percent (Table 5).
Although subsistence production is an important source of food at household level7, families from
subsistence farms are not automatically protected from food insecurity and poverty. More than one
third of all farm households indicate that they faced difficulties in paying for the food needed to ensure a decent
nutrition of their members over the previous year. The numbers are higher for subsistence farms and for poor
households (Table 4 and Table 2), but also for farms close to Chisinau (Table 5), where food prices are higher.
Although subsistence farming does not seem to provide sufficient protection from food insecurity, it works as
5	 The increasing average size of land held by the bigger family farms goes together with a declining number of observations from this group.
The mobility between groups is further analyzed in Section 4.1.
6	 This generation is still the one who was given land shares after the dissolution of the collective farms. Since most landowners tend to keep
their land, outsiders, including the young generation, can hardly get access to land. However, it will be interesting to see what will happen to the
land when the cohorts who worked in Soviet time reach a physical limit to work on the land.
7	 HBS data reveal that between 8% and 12% of the rural household meals are sourced from own food stocks, while values for urban house-
holds are lower, between 5% and 8% (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015).

a counterbalance to poverty-caused food insecurity: in every year between 2007 and 2013, the share of
households reporting problems in paying for food is higher for non-farmers compared to farmers, and for
families living in central regions compared to those living in the periphery.
Compared to subsistence farms, more market-oriented farm households report significantly higher farm
and total household incomes. In general, household incomes are 15-20 percent higher in this group over the
whole survey period. For more market-oriented farm households, farm income is by far more important, but its
share in total income is declining. While it made up about 43 percent in 2007, it dropped to about 34 percent in
2013 (Table 4). For this group, farming is a relevant source of cash income, as almost half of household production
is marketed (about 45 percent in 2013). Subsistence farms have lower farm income shares, declining from about a
quarter in 2007 to less than 13 percent in 2013 (Table 4). Thus, subsistence farming is clearly a sideline activity.
This is also reflected in the lower land productivity, which is steadily declining (from 26,373 MDL per hectare of
used of land in 2007 to 16,509 MDL in 2013), whereas this decline is less pronounced and concentrated in the
second half of the period among more market-oriented farms (from 35,541 MDL in 2007 to 28,579 MDL in
2013).8 The observed decline in land productivity may be linked to the ageing of smallholders and labor-intensive
production strategies, which cannot be efficiently implement by elderly farmers.
Although commercial farming seems to be a potentially viable livelihood pathway, in many cases
marketing of surplus production could be the result of a lack of employment opportunities in the non-
farm sector. The share of households with underemployed members (i.e. members who reported to like to work
more hours during the interview) is, at least in recent years, higher among more market-oriented households. In
2013, 26 percent of them reported underemployment within the households, while just 21 percent of the
subsistence-oriented ones did so. Since farm activities could be increased (as indicated by the generally high shares
of rented out and abandoned land), this underemployment certainly refers to the wish to work off the farm. In
line with this, market-oriented households reported also more often that at least one member was looking for a
job. We interpret this as an indication that the lack of alternative non-farm employment pushes smallholder
households into farm-based marketing activities. Tudor (2014) describes a similar situation for Romania and states
that the large semi-subsistence sector is maintained by the lack of non-agricultural occupational opportunities.
As long as local non-farm employment alternatives are missing, out-migration is the most attractive
choice for the younger generation. Currently, out-migration to urban areas and, even more, international
migration, seem to be the most attractive options for the young generation. This is reflected not only in shrinking
household sizes and ageing, but also in the importance of remittances. Indeed, Moldova is among the most
remittance dependent economies in the world. In 2013, remittances represented one quarter of the country’s
GDP (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). In the HBS data, the average share of remittances on farm
household incomes varies between 13 percent (2007) and 16 percent (2008), but it is significantly higher for non-
poor farm households (14.9 percent) compared to poor ones (7.0 percent) (Table 1 and Table 2). Migration may
have positive income effects on migrant-sending households (see Section 4.4): many non-poor ones are probably
escaping poverty exactly thanks to remittances. However, migration may be seen as rather problematic with view
to a viable regional economic development.
If the local economy is not developing, structural change is not taking place in a way that family labor
is sufficiently re-allocated between sectors. Farming is a significant source of income, but already today
local off-farm employment is the most important source of earned income for smallholder farms. It is without
doubt vital for ensuring rural livelihoods. A lack of local non-farm income sources poses a major problem for
sustainable rural development. It is not only key in fighting poverty, but successful farm restructuring is hindered
if viable employment alternatives are missing.
The successful development of both the farm and the non-farm sectors requires a well-educated labor
force. At least on paper, the educational level within Moldova’s small farm households is high: about one fifth

8	 Careful interpretation of these numbers is advised, since we do not have sufficient information on the conversion rates for in-kind consump-
tion and marketed products.

                                                                18

of all farm household heads passed higher education, i.e. college or university studies.9 The share of households
with at least one member having a high level of education stands at about 30 percent, while the share of
households having a low level of education is gradually declining (from about 11 percent in 2007 to less than 7
percent in 2013, see Table 1). Lower educational levels are more common in peripheral areas (Table 5) and
among poor households (Table 2). Non-farm income sources can be easier tapped by better-educated individuals.
Farm development also seems to be linked with better educational levels, as suggested by the significantly
higher share of educated households in the biggest farm size class in Table 3 in the most recent year (2013).

9	     It needs to be stressed, though, that university education in Moldova is hampered by deep-rooted systemic inefficiencies. This will of course
limit the increase in capacity that better education should usually imply. Molodikova (2008) stresses that there is a persistent and widening
inequality in education opportunities, and informal payments and bribes in higher education seem to be common.

Note:	      Farm households are defined here as all urban and rural households owning individual plots (backyard or small share) and/or big shares. Households are grouped according to farm size classes defined along
            total available land. Total available land refers to owned land minus rented out land plus rented in land, i.e. the land on which the family can expand its production in the short term (otherwise it is left fallow);
            the relative stability of leasing agreements makes rented in land available for a reasonable period of time, while it is unlikely that a family can get leased land back in the short time. Incomes are adjusted
            according to consumer price index with 2010 = 100 (World Bank Development Indicators, accessed June 2015). Significances for group differences are indicated at the 1 (***), 5 (**) and 10 percent level (*).

Note: 	 Farm households are defined here as all urban and rural households owning individual plots (backyard or small share) and/or big shares. Subsistence farms are those farms that earn
           more than 90% of their farm income in kind. Incomes are adjusted according to consumer price index with 2010 = 100 (World Bank Development Indicators, accessed June 2015).

         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Rural poverty in less developed countries is closely linked with the structural development in agriculture and the
livelihood pathways of farms. This section starts with discussing whether there is a dynamic pattern in terms
of farm sizes and the currently prevailing subsistence orientation in Moldova. We then identify factors that
support or hinder certain livelihood options, like market integration, farm growth, and diversification into
alternative income sources. Finally, we discuss poverty implications of different livelihood strategies.


4.1 Is structural change happening? Changes in farm sizes and
subsistence orientation
In this section, we make use of the HBS panel by looking specifically at variations in important indicators of
structural change. Although dataset covers several ten thousands of households, more than one observation is
available for just 13,505 cases. A complete four-year panel is reported for less than six percent of the sample
households. This fact limits the use of dynamic panel data estimators.
Generally, farm exits are almost not observed, and land sales are very limited, which implies that
possibilities for farms to grow are severely hampered. A strong indicator of structural change would be if
a significant number of panel farms gave up their farm completely or at least a part of their land. However, as
our analysis in the previous section has already shown, such transitions are in general not frequently observed.
Only those households with consecutive observations in the HBS panel are considered. First, nine cases of
farm exit through selling out all owned land are observed, all of them in 2008. Second, the share of farmers
who sell or purchase a part of their land drops progressively: 23.2 percent of panel farmers changed the
amount of land they owned between 2007 and 2008, while only 7.0 percent did so between 2012 and 2013. The
decrease is also substantial if considering the total amount of land involved: 10.6 percent of the land owned by
panel farmers changed owner between 2007 and 2008, only 3.6 percent between 2012 and 2013. These figures
show that the land market is becoming less and less dynamic, at least if family farms are concerned. In addition,
the share of farmers engaged in leasing contracts decreases, from 40.1 percent in 2007 to 36.9 percent in 2013.
The share of lessors dropped from 39.0 to 35.8 percent, while that of tenants increased slightly, from 1.5 to 1.7
percent. Finally, the share of farmers who changed the amount of leased land also dropped, from 12.0 percent
between 2007 and 2008, to 6.2 percent five years later. Land consolidation through renting is, thus, much more
common: farmers tend to lease their land for a long time.
Structural change is slow and farm growth is an exception, not the rule. Structural change is often
discussed along changes in farms sizes. Growing farm sizes are seen as a sign of increasing competitiveness and
economies of scale. However, as discussed above, we observe overall shrinking farm sizes among the small family
farms covered by the HBS in Moldova. At least part of the released land must have been overtaken by the large
commercial farms which are not covered by the HBS. Farm growth among smallholder farms is an exception and
not the rule: the large majority of farms do not change their size category over the observed period, no matter
whether we look at total or available land (Table 6). If considering total land (including land that is leased out), the
probability that a farm grows is clearly lower than its probability to shrink (2.2 percent versus 5.6 percent). This
difference is even more pronounced if we look at the land that is actually available to the farm, i.e. owned land,
minus leased, plus rented-in. Thus, we conclude that currently structural change affects only a minority of small
family farms.

Smallholder farms furthermore show little interest in commercialization and market integration.
Instead, they appear to be moving backward to subsistence farming. This is underlined by figures in
Table 7, which show that the transition probability towards almost pure subsistence farming (i.e. 90 percent
of self-consumption) is much higher than vice versa (39 percent vs. 13 percent). On the one hand, dynamics
are not very high. On the other hand, as we have shown above, there is a small segment of smallholders with
slightly bigger farms (over 2 ha) who increased the share of marketed production in recent times. Whether
this will result in a competitive middle-sized family farm business is not clear. Even for those who are utterly
willing to commercialize, Moldova’s gradual adoption of EU regulations on food safety, traceability, etc. will
pose a major challenge – perhaps one reason why the probability to fall back into subsistence is comparatively
high. The necessary investments cannot be shouldered by the large majority of small farms leaving them no
other options but to keep relying on more informal marketing channels if they do not turn away from the
market at all.

           Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity


    Box 3: Subsistence farming: a safety net that hinders farm
    consolidation and farm growth?
    To understand the persistence of subsistence farming, one needs to look at historic roots and the resulting
    mentality of today’s smallholders. During Soviet times, about 60 percent of the Moldovan workforce was
    employed in the agricultural sector and related activities. The dissolution of the collective farms and
    industries was not only a livelihood shock, but left many with a feeling that decollectivization and
    privatization was an unfair process in which a small group of powerful people took the best assets for
    themselves (Petrick & Carter, 2009). Due to this experience, and due to the sluggish agricultural and
    economic development since the end of the Soviet Union, smallholders generally lack trust and confidence
    in government policies (Gorton & White, 2003). Adding to that, the 1998 Russian financial crisis and
    recent bankruptcies and scandals destroyed the confidence in the banking sector.
    All this led to a mentality of building up private safety nets instead of relying on formal organizations and
    the banking sector: most people, including farmers, prefer to keep their money in cash despite the
    currency risk. One important source of private safety nets are remittances. They are often the only
    consistent income, and the most difficult to detect even by the HBS, since families want to avoid taxation.
    Remittances, if not used for consumption, are invested in assets like mini-buses or city apartments.
    Smallholders, who are usually not able to invest, tend to keep the few hectares they got as a security for
    bad times. During our interviews, many farmers pointed out that the “land feeds the people”. Indeed,
    land is the personal safety net of thousands of (mostly elderly) smallholders who have no access to a
    viable state welfare system.
    This explains well why land sales are a rare exception. Instead, the land is either cultivated, mostly for
    subsistence purposes, rented out to large commercial farms, or simply left fallow. Since this behavior is
    fully rational in the current situation, structural change towards a business-oriented middle class of family
    farmers is effectively hindered. Agricultural policies aiming at a more competitive family farming sector
    will thus face a situation in which farmers will probably react very cautiously, or not at all, because their
    interest is in subsistence farming, and their willingness to take part in consolidation programs will be
    certainly low10.
    New dynamics in the land market situation might be set off when the next generation, who has a growing
    negative perception of agricultural activities, takes over. They might be more open to selling their land, if
    they see chances for a better future in the capital or abroad. However, experience shows that even for
    urban or international migrants (most of whom fear they will not receive a pension from their host
    country) a plot of land might still be considered a fallback option for a worst case scenario or, if migration
    is successful, land might not be sold out of nostalgic reasons. Furthermore, even if the land market
    situation would become more dynamic, large scale farms may make use of their better bargaining position
    compared to new middle sized family businesses (see Box 1).
                                           [based on qualitative interviews conducted by Piras and Botnarenco (2015)
                                              as well as on experience of the team in other transition economies with
                                                                                a persistent subsistence farm segment]


Similarly, the interest in commercial farming as a main income source is also shrinking. Full-time
commercial farms are defined here as having an in-kind farm income share of less than 90 percent and a share of
farm income in total household income of 50 percent or more. This group is very small in the sample from the
10	 Indeed, the current subsidization program for land consolidation has not brought results so far. In 2013, only six applicants are reported
(World Bank, 2015b).

                                                                             27

beginning on, and the probability to quit commercial full-time farming (Table 8) is even higher than that of
switching from commercialization to subsistence as shown in Table 7. Entering commercial full-time farming
goes with a very low probability of 3.8 (Table 8). We see this as a strong sign that the large majority of smallholder
farms has little interest in developing their farming activities. Instead, farms are kept as a sideline, subsistence-
oriented activity while the livelihood strategies turn towards the non-farm sector.

In general, smallholders have only very limited possibilities to commercialize and to increase their
farm size, even if they are willing to do so. The observation that farms are shrinking, and the tendency to
reduce agricultural activities to subsistence production could, theoretically, open up opportunities for farms
with a potential to grow and modernize. However, as we have argued above, the land rental market seems not
very dynamic. While many lease their big shares to large commercial farms, this leads to no visible dynamics in
our sample of small family farms (where these farms are not included). Occurrence of renting in land is
negligible among family farms. This is in line with qualitative interviews, in which smallholders stressed that
they keep their land mainly as a sort of insurance to provide a certain minimum level of livelihood security for
their family (see Box 4).



   Box 4: The reality of land rental markets – do smallholders
   have full command over their big share?

   Many Moldovan smallholders, who received a big share when former collective farms were dissolved, lease
   this land to a local leader. This person is often the former head of the local collective farm, who is able to
   make use of the knowledge from this previous position. Leaders either manage large commercial farms
   themselves or sublet to large commercial farmers (local or from outside the village), who negotiate their
   lease contracts with the leader.
   Interestingly, several small farmers interviewed in center-northern districts were not able to identify their
   big share. Initially, the shares were physically delimited by the land registry officers of the village. However,
   shareholders were not automatically given the land, but were only offered the possibility of leasing it to the
   local commercial farm. Thus, they never had full command over their land. This situation is also described
   by Dudwick et al. (2007: 23) for southern Moldova: “Workers on the farm reported that its powerful ma-
   nager has used his ties with municipal authorities and police to prevent all but two well-connected and
   determined families from withdrawing land. The remaining people in this village of 6,000 lack land titles

Gaining actual access to the land, once it was leased out like this, means that the smallholder has to embark
on a complex administrative procedure. Farmers reported that clear and complete information is hard to
obtain for them, and it usually will involve unpleasant arguing with employees of the town hall. Moreover,
local leaders are often in control – or coincide with – local institutions (mayors, village councilors), and may
make use of this power for example in hindering administrative processes (Petrick & Carter, 2009). Far-
mers also fear, probably not without reason, that if land is physically given back, they will be given unattrac-
tive plots of low fertility and at a far distance from the village.
Renting is, in general, practiced on a rather informal basis, based on short-termed (three years) contracts.
The leasing conditions usually foresee a fixed rent (not a share of the yield), which is given to the land
owner in kind (a modal value of 400 kg of wheat, 100 kg of corn, and 100 kg of sunflower seeds for a big
share, regardless of its area). The high degree of informality poses risks for both sides. The short duration
of rental agreements, which have to be renewed regularly, certainly decreases the interest of tenants in
longer-term investments. However, it seems that the power is generally on the side of tenant, as underlin-
ed by anecdotal evidence of several cases when low yields (evaluated by the tenant!) led to cutting down
in-kind payments, sometimes to even nil. It also seems to be common that land renting contracts are re-
newed without informing the landowner. Smallholders are in general not in the position to easily resist
such practices as they are strongly dependent on the local big commercial farm (see Box 1).

4.2 Drivers of farm growth and market integration
As mentioned above, farm growth and market integration are classical indicators of structural change towards a
more competitive and viable (family) farm sector. Since in Moldova consolidation of the family farming sector is
clearly hampered by land fragmentation and by farm sizes that are too small for viable commercialization, these two
features need a more thorough investigation with view to their local drivers (or constraints).
A deeper understanding of what keeps smallholder households in the state of subsistence is needed.
The findings of a probit regression analysis estimating factors linked with the state of being a subsistence farm
are presented in Table 9. As in the previous analyses, subsistence farming, our dependent variable, is a dummy
turning one if the share of own consumption makes up more than 90 percent of farm income (subsistence
farms), and zero if 10 percent or more of total farm production is sold on the market (more commercially
oriented farms).

Household and family characteristics are important determinants of whether a farm is commercially
or subsistence oriented. Regression results clearly indicate that certain characteristics of the family limit the
possibilities for (and the interest in) market integration. If a household is headed by a woman, and/or the
household’s head is burdened by bad health or old age, the probability that this smallholder farm relies on
subsistence increases. Market integration increases until a certain age of the household head and starts declining
only for very high ages, as shown by the coefficient of age squared. The positive coefficient for the variable
indicating pension income in the household underlines once more that old age is an important determinant of
subsistence farming11. Yet, if the household is located in an urban region or in the North, the likelihood that
this household uses almost its entire farm production for its own consumption decreases. Subsistence orientation
is further negatively linked with increasing sizes of the big share.
Despite a static land market, a few farms grow or shrink over time. The fact that no middle-sized family
farm sector is developing must be seen in relation to limited changes in farm sizes (see Section 4.1). Yet, it is
still interesting to see what differentiates farms that grow (or shrink) from those that stay stable. This is done
based on a multinomial logistic regression (Table 10). The dependent variable can assume three different values:
-1 if the farm shrinks in comparison with the previous year, 0 if there is no variation, and 1 if the farm grows.
The units are farm households for which data for (at least two) consecutive years are available. Overall, 746
cases of farm shrinkage, 783 of farm growth, and 6,926 cases of no variation are observed (Table 10).
The crisis year 2009 induced some dynamic in the land market; however, this effect was limited and
did not reach out to the following years. In 2009, the probability for farms to either shrink or grow was
particularly high (Table 10). In this year, Moldova was hit by the world financial crisis, which, among others,
caused a severe decrease in remittances. After the drought in 2012, we observe a significant decrease in land
dynamics in the following year.
Farm size changes are linked with certain family characteristics and the location of the farm (Table
10). A bigger family size is associated with more growth dynamics: bigger households have the possibility of
using family labor for managing a bigger farm. Not surprisingly, older ages of the household head are negatively
associated with farm growth. With an increasing share of unearned income (mostly pensions), shrinkage is
inhibited, most likely due to a stronger dependence on subsistence farming. Farm size changes are furthermore
correlated to the location of the farm. The probability of either shrinking or growing is lower if the farm is
located in the North, were agriculture is more developed. It is also low for locations in the direct vicinity of the
capital (within 60 km from Chisinau); landowners are probably not selling their land here because they expect
land prices to keep growing, and at the same time, they can barely afford buying new land.




11	 State transfers account for between 40-50 percent of rural incomes. Pensions account for the bulk of transfers (80-90 percent) and repre-
sent an important safety net. However, pensioners need to complement their pensions, since these, on average, cover less than 60 percent of the
minimum consumption basket (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015).

While non-farm income seems to work against downsizing, the availability of more active household
members and more land pushes farm growth. If the land area per equivalent family member is bigger, this
leads to a higher probability to further increase the farm size, while it becomes less likely that the farm shrinks
(which shows that farming represents a viable economic activity for the family only over a critical point). A
higher number of household members in active age also increases the likelihood of farm growth. Non-farm
income is negatively linked to farm shrinkage. The more off-farm income is available, the more this works
against downsizing the farm. This is consistent with what was declared by some interviewed farmers, who
stated that they could keep cultivating their big shares only because they were earning money in other sectors.
Thus, non-farm income is used for mechanization services and the purchase of other inputs (Piras & Botnarenco,
2015).

Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Poor farm households benefit from slightly less income sources, but the shares of these sources on
their total income are more equilibrated. In 2013, non-poor households had 2.57 income sources on average,
poor ones 2.46. Starting from 2009, non-poor households show a stronger concentration of income streams
on few sources, as revealed by the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) in Table 11. Non-poor households rely
on more income sources, typically waged income, supplemented with remittances, part-time farming and,
eventually, self-employment income. Poor ones, especially the elderly, mainly rely on farming and income from
social transfers.
The number of income sources is not only negatively correlated with poverty, but also with access to
land, and low education. As the number of income sources is a count, a Poisson regression is the most suitable
econometric method to analyze the determinants of income diversification (Table 12). The negative correlation
between poverty and the number of income sources is proven by a negative and statistically significant coefficient
of the poverty variable in the basic specification (first column), as well as by a slightly smaller constant term in the
specification for poor households (second column), implying that they draw from a lower number of income
sources. Furthermore, not surprisingly, larger households benefit from more income sources, while those with an
older head show significantly less sources. The number of income sources is positively linked to higher education
levels and female household heads. It is negatively correlated with the amount of the big share (probably because
these families chose a farm-centered livelihood), with more children in the household, and with low educational
levels.

Higher education facilitates the tapping of non-farm income sources. Table 13 presents estimated
coefficients of probit models based on the HBS panel sample (2007-2013). Non-farm waged and self-
employment incomes are equally correlated with the same factors. Besides a higher educational level, also a
central location increases the probability to have income from non-farm work. This is understandable, as
Chisinau represents the only sizeable urban area of the country, where off-farm sectors experienced a decent
development. Taking up non-farm work is more likely for bigger households with younger and male heads, and
less children. Household characteristics that work against taking on non-farm activities are female heads, a bad
health status of the head, lower educational levels, and bigger farm areas, which bind the family to agriculture.
The existence of unearned income (mainly welfare payments, pensions) is correlated to the same factors
observed for non-farm incomes, however with opposite signs. The only exception is the size of the big share,
which is significantly negatively correlated with all potentially available income sources apart from farming.
Unearned income is more common among households that have heads who are older, female or with bad
health status, and those that have more children or lower level of education.

in Figure 6. Relative poverty, measured by taking as a threshold half the value of the median national income,
results in lower but still substantial poverty rates, with a gap of between one and two points between farm
households and the entire population. Poverty deficit and severity measures are also slightly higher for farm
households: the poverty deficit, defined as the average distance of the poor from the poverty line, is two
percent with respect to the absolute poverty threshold in 2013. Poverty severity, which gives a greater weight to
households that are further away from the poverty line, lies at 0.5 percent with respect to the same threshold in
2013.

Note: 	 Poverty measures refer to expenditure based indicators. Relative poverty is measured in comparison to the 50 percent
        median income of all individuals in the sample.

Various livelihood strategies have different impact on poverty outcomes. In Table 15, we explore
counterfactual scenarios, derived from a Propensity Score Matching analysis for the year 2013, for a number of
livelihood strategies. We compare poverty headcounts for different scenarios. Here, poverty headcounts are
calculated based on incomes instead of expenditures, since income is directly associated with the analyzed
livelihood paths. The aim of this exercise is to better understand poverty effects. The counterfactual scenarios
describe how the poverty situation would have been if households had followed certain earning strategies.
Based on this, we are able to compare, for example, the situation in which a household follows a migration and
remittances strategy with the counterfactual of having no access to remittances. If the counterfactual poverty
headcount is higher (lower) than the sample headcount, this means that the respective livelihood strategy may
be associated with a positive (negative) effect on poverty. Table 15 shows four different livelihood strategies and
their associated poverty status: livelihood strategies that are farm-centered, commercially oriented, non-farm
oriented and relying on migration and remittances; a definition is given below Table 15.
Migrant remittances lift the highest number of households out of poverty; the second highest positive
impact on poverty results from diversification into the non-farm sector. Remittances show the strongest
effect on poverty (Table 15). Yet, while for the single household, migration might be the optimal solution to
ensure better livelihoods, the effects on Moldova’s rural areas might be less beneficial. Only if trickle down
effects materialize, longer-term positive impacts can be expected. Therefore, from the rural development
perspective, local off-farm employment opportunities would be more desirable. If livelihoods are farm-centered,
meaning that farming is the main income source of the household, this contributes to higher poverty levels in
a household. This effect is also observed for commercially oriented full-time farms, but to a lower degree.
Diversification into the non-farm sector, however, has a low, but positive impact on poverty levels.
Income distribution is, overall, not extremely unequal, but farm and non-farm livelihood strategies
have different impacts. Gini indices for all years are shown in Table 14. Income inequality is slightly lower
among farm households compared to the overall HBS sample. As for 2013, we show that certain livelihood
strategies (see description in the Note to Table 15) have different impacts on the income distribution. Again,
we use counterfactual income scenarios. Results are presented in Table 16. We find that the migration-based

                                                                   37
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

livelihood strategy tends to increase inequality. Thus, the positive effect of remittances on poverty outcomes is
unequally distributed. In addition, farm-centered livelihoods (i.e. if farming represents the main income source)
have a disequalizing effect. The examination of partial coefficients in the lower section of Table 16 allows for
quantifying elasticities. Here we see that, overall, farm income tends to decrease inequality, while non-farm
incomes, including remittances, increase it. Especially for remittances, this effect is high: a one percent increase
in this income would lead to an increase of the Gini coefficient of 19 percent. Other incomes, which include
mainly pensions and social transfers, have the expected strong equalizing effect.

Box 6 Is migration offering a solution
to successful rural development?
Rural outmigration may have both negative and positive effects. Migration in Moldova is driven by a lack
of alternative local income opportunities, and the negative perception of agriculture by the younger ge-
neration, who prefers not to work in this sector even if other local jobs are not available. It is linked to
an ageing farm population and depopulated villages where public services are not always offered any
more. On the other hand, (international) migrants’ remittances are an important income source. Re-
mittances to Moldovan farmers overall are thought to be a more important vehicle for reducing poverty
and food insecurity than public transfers (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015)
However, the impact of remittances depends much on their use. While it is known that they are spent
mainly for consumption purposes (Molodikova, 2008), targeted investment would increase the sustaina-
bility of the effect. We find anecdotal evidence that remittances flow into agriculture, however rather for
current agricultural expenditures, e.g. buying seeds, animal feed, or paying for mechanization services.
This was reported by several interviewed families – especially those where a child migrated abroad and
the old parents live in the countryside. If remittances are invested, the money will seldom flow into agri-
culture, but rather into real estate in the cities, the transport sector (e.g. minibuses), or the small retail
sector. Thus, apart from a short-term relief for recipient households, a broader effect of migration and
remittances is rather theoretical at this stage. Yet, from very few examples where farm investments finan-
ced by remittances took place, it gets clear that remittances based farm development is possible. In two
cases, the interviewed farmers had bought a few hectares of land for planting walnut trees. In three cases,
they had built small greenhouses and bought drop irrigation equipment in order to cultivate berries and
vegetables. Such small investments into family farm development are difficult to finance for most small-
holders and farmers confirmed that they would not have invested at all if they had to rely on a bank loan.

In this section, we summarize the core results of the paper and discuss their implications. We further offer
some perspective lessons derived from the developments in two EU countries: the neighboring Romania, with
many similarities to Moldova, and Poland, which went through a particular successful transition. We close with
a number of policy recommendations targeted at the development of smallholder farming in Moldova. A
poverty perspective guides these recommendations. We focus on the needs of smallholders with the will and
potential to develop their farm business, and call for a balanced structural change accompanied by measures
that protect and support the most vulnerable part of the farm population.


5.1 Summary of key results and conclusions
Land privatization in Moldova has led to an unfavorable agricultural structure, with many subsistence
farms. Given the initial conditions, broad land distribution provided a minimum of social security to many
rural households. While, initially, land privatization was expected to result in a quickly emerging agricultural sector
dominated by family farms, reality brought about a rather unviable, fragmented land structure. Furthermore, insider
privatization resulted in a transfer of considerable parts of the former collective farms from the public sector to a
few powerful people, often the former heads of the collective, who nowadays manage large commercial farms. They
not only kept most of the machinery, but also bought land shares of people who needed fast money during the first
harsh years of independence. Until today, many smallholders lease parts of their property (usually the big share) under
rather non-transparent conditions to these large farms and work on small pieces of land mainly for subsistence
production.
Structural change and land consolidation is extremely slow: for smallholder farms, there is even a
tendency towards shrinking farm sizes and a pullout of commercial activities. The hope that smallholder
farms would develop into a successful class of middle-sized family farms were not fulfilled. Instead, we observe
a general tendency to withdraw from (in particular commercial) farming activities, but without a visible effect
of farm growth within the family farming sector. Farm sizes of Moldovan family farms, on average, decreased
from 1.60 ha in 2007 to 1.35 ha in 2013. Only around 50 percent of this land is actually used for farming by the
owners, while around 30 percent is leased out, and up to 20 percent is abandoned. Thus, it looks as if in a few
years’ time, the situation will be similar to the one of the late USSR, when families worked on small pieces of
land (the so-called household plots) for fulfilling their family needs, with the difference that in Moldova there
are no collective farms providing jobs and rural services any more. The large private farms hire mostly seasonal
low paid labor, which cannot offer a significant income source to rural families.
Semi-subsistence farming is a core part of the rural livelihood strategies in Moldova, and it is likely to
persist in the medium- and longer term. However, semi-subsistence farmers are not forming a homoge-
neous group. Most farmers pursue subsistence farming as a survival strategy and as an important fallback op-
tion and insurance for bad times and old age. Farmers who grew up in Soviet times tend to be conservative and
risk-adverse: they prefer to neither sell their land nor invest in agriculture. Thus, they rarely respond to market
based policy signals designed to foster market integration. This is also the case for those who deliberately chose
subsistence farming and enjoy it as a lifestyle. Many farmers insist on producing their own safe food for cultur-
al reasons. Subsistence production of food is highly esteemed by the society, so that working their land brings
additional intangible benefits to small farmers. Only a very small minority of smallholders seems to be ready
and willing to leave the subsistence zone towards growth and/or commercialization.
Although a higher share of marketed production is linked to higher incomes, the interest in commer-
cialization seems to be low. This is reflected not only in the fact that the production potential is not fully used
by most farms, but also in very few observations of actual farm growth or commercialization. Farm consolida-
tion is currently hindered by the described widespread subsistence mentality, but also by the powerful position
of large commercial farms who have not only rented much of the land that would be needed to develop a
family farm sector, but are at the same time the main providers of financing. Those smallholders who would
                                                              41

like to dissolve existing renting contracts are sometimes confronted with ownership insecurity and with the fact
that the power is generally on the side of large farm tenant, on whom they usually depend.
Furthermore, market integration of more commercially oriented smallholders is a challenge. On the
one hand, the export markets are currently exclusively served by large farms and smallholder farms are excluded
from international trade. On the other hand, domestic markets confront smallholders with local consumers
who traditionally prefer to buy their food from neighbors, whom they know personally. Furthermore, town
markets are saturated and town dwellers have a low purchasing power. Western-style market chains like
supermarkets are generally difficult to enter due to quality and food safety standards that currently cannot be
fulfilled by smallholder farms. Finally, the lack of storage facilities is a constraint to commercialization, as small
farmers are forced to sell for a low price when there is a supply peak.
Neither subsistence farming nor more commercially oriented farm strategies protect smallholders
from poverty. Although poverty among smallholder farms has been declining during the last seven years, it still
represents a significant challenge. Poverty prevalence remained between 4 and 7 percentage points higher
among farm households compared to the overall population. While the subsistence production of food
contributes significantly to feeding the rural population, many small farms are not able to generate a sufficient
income for overcoming poverty. Similarly, although commercialization of farm products generates higher
incomes compared to a purely subsistence based strategy, it does not show significant poverty effects. One main
challenge is, therefore, the lack of alternative employment opportunities, in particular in more peripheral areas.
Especially young people are forced to search for work in urban centers or even abroad, causing further ageing
of the rural population.
The rural non-farm economy and international remittances seem the most promising starting points
for rural development with visible effects on poverty. In particular, remittances seem much more effective
than agriculture in lifting rural families out of poverty. However, there are also negative effects as migration
leads to ageing and shrinking of the rural population, while remittances increase income inequality and might
fuel inflation by appreciating the real exchange rate through raising domestic prices, and lead to an unsustainable
growth model.12 Therefore, a flourishing local economy would be preferable and should be in the focus of rural
development policies.



5.2 Lessons for Moldova’s small-scale farms from Romania’s and
Poland’s accession to the EU
Moldova is advised to make use of the experience of the countries of Central and Eastern European
that recently acceded the EU (World Bank, 2015b). If and how the EU membership and the resulting CAP
support helped countries such as Romania and Poland to restructure their farming sector could be an important
lesson for Moldova (Annex Table 4). The situation of smallholders in Romania is, in many respects, comparable to
Moldova’s small farms. Both countries started transition as economies with a strong focus on agriculture. Both have
a high, but under-used potential for agricultural production, and suffer from a similar dualistic and fragmented agri-
cultural structure with a large subsistence sector. Experiences from Poland, a country with a similar large semi-sub-
sistence farm sector, provide additional insights with a view to a successful adaptation.
Both Romania and Poland showed a more dynamic structural change in agriculture compared to Mol-
dova. In Poland, the agriculture’s share in GDP was comparatively low already in the 1990s, and went down
from around 5 percent in the mid-1990s to slightly above 3 percent in 2013. But also in Romania, where in 1990
the importance of the agricultural sector was high (24 percent of GDP, compared to 36 percent in Moldova,
according to World Bank WDI data), the share of agriculture in GDP decreased much faster over the first two
12	   See accompanying report on Poverty and Shared Prosperity in Moldova: Progress and Prospects (2016).

                                                              42
           Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

decades of the transition compared to Moldova. Romania halved its agricultural share in GDP within one de-
cade (and again in the following decade). However, the share of employment in agriculture stayed high. In
Romania, similarly to Moldova, employment in agriculture keeps being significant, with shares close to 30 per-
cent. In both countries, the transition led to an increase in agricultural employment during the first decade, and
only a slow decrease since then. Thus, agricultural productivity stayed low. Poland, which started transition with
a share of agricultural employment of 25 percent, showed a slow but continuous decrease in this indicator, and
could halve the initial share of agricultural employment by 2013.
Farm restructuring is sluggish in Romania, while Poland’s farm sector is on a good way to profession-
alize. After more than five years of EU membership, Romania’s farming sector continues to be strongly dual-
istic, and a viable, commercially oriented, middle-sized family farming sector has not yet evolved. There are still
about 3.6 million agricultural holdings, with an average farm size of about 3.6 ha. In 2013, according to Eu-
rostat data, about 73 percent of all Romanian farms cultivated less than two hectares, or about 13 percent of
the total utilized agricultural area (UAA). On the other side, only 0.5 percent of the farms cultivated an area
larger than 50 ha, but accounted for 53 percent of the total UAA. Based on national thresholds13, about 94
percent of all farms can be classified as subsistence farms (i.e. with less than two ESU), another five percent are
semi-subsistence farms (i.e. between two and eight ESU), and just less than one percent are commercial ones.
In Poland, instead, the number of farms dropped by more than 20 percent between 2000 and 2010. The de-
crease in the number of small farms is particularly significant, showing the professionalization of the sector
(Potori, Chmieliński, & Karwat-Wózniak, 2014). However, even in Poland up to one sixth of all farms are
subsistence farms (Wolz, Grau, Hockmann, & Levkovych, 2015).
In Poland, smallholders could adapt more successfully due to several reasons. First, Polish smallholders
were mostly family farmers even during communist times. This means that they were better prepared to adapt
their farms compared to those who became private farmers only as a result of land privatization. They were also
comparatively well organized and gained a certain political influence. However, also in Poland the transition came
with hardship for farmers, and many smallholders turned away from the markets, at least during the harshest
economic periods. A turning point came with the EU accession in 2004. The agricultural sector not only benefit-
ted from high CAP support, but also from increased demand due to a general rise in incomes. In particular, mid-
dle-sized farms used this opportunity for investing in their business, and could increase their land productivity. At
the same time the food industry, with the help of significant foreign direct investment, was modernized and be-
came highly competitive – also because markets along the food chain were functioning well (Wolz, et al., 2015).
Successful adaptation depends on a strategic, long-term focus on enhancing competitiveness. Unlike
in Poland, in Romania there is little progress in modernization of the agricultural production process and the farm
sector is still not developing as it was expected given the good natural conditions and the large CAP support. This
may be seen as a result of focusing too much on price and market support and too little on enhancing longer term
competitiveness. In Poland, problems with adjusting to EU regulations seemed also pronounced. Yet, the country
is a good example of how giving priority to enhancing competitiveness, adapting to EU standards and modernizing
the sector resulted in a positive development of agriculture in the post-accession period (World Bank, 2015b)
EU funds offer massive financial support for the farming sector. However, in particular income sup-
port measures could be seen as counterproductive, in the sense that they rather slow down farm con-
solidation. Within the period 2007-2013, a total of about 13.5 billion EUR were made available to Romania
under the CAP, including both the so-called direct payments (Pillar I) and rural development measures (Pillar
II). The lion share of the support measures are direct and indirect income support measures for farmers (World
Bank, 2010). This implies that the incentives for subsidy recipients to leave the farm sectors are lowered. Direct
payments were also found to be one important barrier for land sales in Poland, as they tend to drive land prices
up (Biró, Wasilewski, & Tóth, 2014).



13	   Romania adopted a 2 ESU threshold to define subsistence farms, instead of the Eurostat one (1 ESU).

                                                                            43
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

In Romania, funds are distributed highly unequally, and smallholders are widely excluded from sup-
port. In order to be eligible for direct payments, Romanian farms have to fulfil certain criteria, including a mini-
mum threshold of one hectare, based on a national decision. Hence, just about 1.2 million farms qualify and the
distribution of funds is highly uneven. Whereas around half of the income support available under Pillar I went
to about 11,000 large farms, one million small farms (operating 1 to 5 ha) received about one quarter of the avail-
able funds only. Nevertheless, most small-scale farmers did not benefit from this scheme at all due to the one-hect-
are threshold. Various measures under Pillar II aim at increasing competitiveness through promoting basic struc-
tural change in the farm sector; among them are the measures for supporting subsistence farms; early retirement;
the setting up of young farmers; and the setting up of agricultural producer groups. However, farmers have to
fulfil the same application criteria as for Pillar I. Thus, the Romanian case shows that the specific problems of
smallholders are not automatically tackled by CAP support, but require targeted policies (Wegener, et al., 2011).
Not all smallholder farms will become competitive and, as the case of Romania shows, they keep
being loci of poverty. Absolute poverty decreased dramatically during the last decade in Romania, from 35.9
percent in 2000 to 4.4 percent in 2009. However, in 2009, the poverty rate among farmers was still at 8.7 percent,
while it stood at 3.4 percent among the non-farm population. Romanian smallholder farms are still strongly
subsistence oriented and have an unfavorable age structure, with more than 40 percent of them being older than
65 years. These socio-demographic characteristics of farm managers influence the structure and organization of
their production activity and the economic performance of the farm. Instead, younger and well-trained managers
have a positive and significant influence on the level of agricultural production (Tudor, 2014).
The main conclusions for Moldova arising from the Romanian and Polish experiences are summarized in Box 7.



   Box 7: Key perspective lessons for Moldova
   1. The dualistic farm structure, with a high share of (semi-)subsistence farms is highly persis-
   tent and it bears the risk that smallholders are excluded from financial support and market inte-
   gration. The hope that a viable, commercially oriented family farm sector would quickly arise was not
   fulfilled in Romania. Policy measures widely failed to successfully target subsistence farmers, who were
   not able or willing to tap the offered support. Thus, policies need to specifically address smallholder far-
   ms and the market failures that work as a barrier to their development. A clear distinction should be made
   between more socially oriented measures and those that target the modernization of the farming sector.
   2. Farm growth and the formation of a class of middle-sized family farms is severely impeded
   by a lack of entrepreneurial spirit and/or a ‘subsistence mentality’, as well as by a number of
   market failures. Unlike Poland, Moldova has no pre-transition tradition of entrepreneurial family farms.
   Also for this reason, smallholders tend to keep their land mainly as a social buffer within a harsh econo-
   mic environment. Similar to the situation in Romania, Moldova’s farming sector is faced with significant
   market failures in the land and credit markets, and output market barriers for small producers. These
   factors need to be addressed as they are impeding the aspirations of (the few) farmers who would like to
   become commercial and expand their farms.
   3. To increase the effectiveness of agricultural policy measures, they should be targeted at lon-
   ger-term competitiveness instead of direct income support. CAP funds seem to have rather slowed
   down farm restructuring, and, in the case of Romania, did not help overcome prevailing deficiencies in
   the management of food safety and quality. Reasons for this might be seen in an unfavorable allocation
   of funds, which lacked the strategic vision of enabling competitiveness, but also in bottlenecks in the
   agricultural administration (World Bank, 2010). Poland offers some positive examples how modernizati-
   on can be supported.

         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity



   4. Rural poverty rates are decreasing, but farm incomes stay low, and agriculture may not be the (main)
   key to alleviating poverty. For most smallholder households, farming is an important source of subsistence
   and a last resort in case of economic problems. It therefore serves as a social insurance, but is not necessarily the
   main source of rural livelihoods. This helps explaining why, in an unfavorable general economic environment,,
   modernization and commercialization are taking place so slowly. For the majority of rural people, significant
   improvement of their welfare situation is much more dependent on a dynamic non-farm economy, targeted
   socio-economic services, and infrastructural investments than on agriculture. If, however, like in Poland, the rural
   non-farm economy grows, this would clearly contribute to a successful transformation of the agricultural sector
   as well.




5.3 Policy recommendations
The following recommendations focus on the reduction of rural poverty and the development of the
agricultural sector with a particular view on smallholder farming. However, the results of this paper pose
significant limitations for drawing general conclusions. This is due to missing information on medium and
large-scale farms in the HBS dataset analyzed. Also important macroeconomic conditions such as, for example,
developments in the labor market or price policies and taxation were beyond the scope of the analysis at hand.
Still, we suggest to policy makers to develop a vision of a business-oriented family farm sector and identify a
number of fields in which policy could address such development of the smallholder sector. Some of our
suggestions are targeting constraints to farm development identified in our analysis; others are more general
and point at framework conditions that have to be improved to facilitate the development of a viable family
farm sector. Recommendations 1 to 8 directly address the development of a commercial family farm sector. We
explain why market integration and intensification of production play a key role for this and in which fields
policies could target their support. It is important to stress that by far not all current smallholders will be able
to develop their farms. Recommendations 9 to 11 point at policies for the majority of small farms who would
benefit more from social measures and alternative employment in the rural non-farm sectors, and at necessary
improvements in the general framework conditions that are key for both the agricultural and the wider rural
development.


I. Towards the vision of a commercial family farm sector

Moldova should make better use of its great agricultural potential by enabling a new generation of
business-oriented family farmers to commercialize and intensify their farm activities in a sustainable
manner. Smallholder farms generate already now a higher productivity per unit of land, while, at the same
time, their agricultural practices seem in general well adapted to the ideal of conservation agriculture. Market
integration and productivity growth are the main pathways towards this vision. They mutually reinforce each
other, while productivity growth creates the basis for a surplus to be marketed, increased marketed production
provides incentives for investment, creates cash surpluses, and can generate significant multiplier effects (FAO
2013).
The example of Romania shows that farm consolidation is a slow and tedious process, if it is hampered by high
fragmentation of land parcels, missing cadaster, but also unfavorable mental models and a weak non-farm rural
economy that fails to absorb the rural workforce. Therefore, we recommend that broad agricultural development
that is inclusive for smallholders should start from the sustainable intensification of production. In Moldova,
the sector is clearly in need of modernization, for example with view to new seed varieties, farming techniques
                                                                 45
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

and practices, that would boost productivity and output (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015).
Sustainable intensification, but also bringing back abandoned land into production may be the best ways to
achieve short-term successes. In the medium and longer-term farm consolidation and growth, and the
development of and integration into modern food supply chains should be achieved. Successful market
integration is known to be affected by a number of constraints, which must be first identified in their local
context and then proactively addressed. Market integration therefore requires targeted and wisely timed policy
support, but also patience as a significant level of trust from both buyer and producer has to be built up.
Experience shows that the presence of an honest broker of the relationships and guardian of business
confidentiality, for example an NGO, may facilitate market integration, and that appropriate support from the
public sector is essential (FAO 2013). Proactive government intervention should first provide the necessary
enabling framework conditions in which the smallholder sector can develop. Direct interventions often have
undesired side effects and should therefore be used only with care. In the following, we discuss a number of
fields that seem to be of particular importance for the development of Moldova’s smallholder farms.

1. Targeting the smallholder farm
While past and current policies seem to have favored large scale corporate farms, which also form an influential
interest group in Moldova (World Bank, 2015b), we advise to focus more attention towards the development
of small and middle-sized business-oriented family farms. Implementing the vision of increasing land and labor
productivity based on sustainable intensification is, however, knowledge intensive. Therefore, a new generation
of business-oriented professional farmers is needed to form the backbone of a strong rural middle class. Public
policy should create an environment in which business-oriented smallholders, but also newcomers have a fair
chance to establish viable farms. With view to the framework conditions, it is important to ensure that
smallholders willing to engage in commercial agriculture get equal access to the markets (including both the
land market and output markets), but also to important services such as financial services, public advisory
services and subsidies, as well as food quality and safety programs. To allow small farmers to get this equal
access, (temporary) direct support might be used to set the process in motion. The CAP measure for ‘Setting
up young farmers’ was seen as a success in Romania and could give guidance to how the target group can be
reached (ENRD, 2014; Tudor, 2014).

2. Promoting sustainable intensification of production
To motivate smallholders to adopt sustainable intensification measures, first, policies need to ensure that commercial
farming is profitable. At the same time, incentives should be set in a way to use natural resources wisely – for
example, through payments for environmental services as done for example in the EU’s CAP. Finally, smallholders
should be protected from power imbalances when dealing with traders or large corporate farm competitors.
Policies targeted towards intensification should build capacities and set incentives to introducing sustainable
agricultural practices based on high yielding locally adapted varieties, integrated pest management, efficient soil
and water management and the integration of crops, pastures and livestock (see for example FAO, 2011). Our
analysis points at a very low level of irrigation used by smallholder farms. Upgrading irrigation facilities and
ensuring that also commercial family farms get equal access, would certainly contribute to increasing productivity.
As Rolfes (2008) has shown, smallholder farms are generally interested in and willing to pay for irrigation. However,
experiences from almost all transition countries show that management of the irrigation infrastructure conceived
for large-scale agricultural production cannot be easily transferred into a sector dominated by small-scale farms.
Often collective action problems prevent the emergence of a new effective management structure (Ostrom,
2000). We also find that mechanization services are used only if necessary (e.g. for ploughing), while most
smallholders harvest and weed manually. Hence, revitalizing interest in new types of cooperation and overcoming
risk averse behavior, but also financial restrictions and other limitations is needed (see below).
Given the considerable area that is currently left unused by smallholders, bringing back suitable abandoned
farmland into production is another important option for increasing production. Land abandonment is mainly
                                                    46
         Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

the result of a low attractiveness of agricultural production for respective land owners, an ageing rural population
and out-migration of the youth (Dudwick, et al., 2007; Rolfes, 2008). Often the abandoned parcels are small,
difficult to reach and/or of poor land quality. Still, making better use of potentially suitable farmland is desirable.
Our recommendations with view to the land market should contribute to this.

3. Removing barriers in the land market that hinder farm consolidation (and farm exits)
The land market may be seen as one key to smallholder farm consolidation and farm growth. Although
Moldova’s land market has seen a positive development since the early 2000s and may be described as generally
operational (Rolfes, 2008), our results show a rather low dynamics on land markets from the perspective of
smallholders, especially if land sales and purchases are concerned. High transaction costs of land transfers and
the role of land as social buffer might be two of the underlying reasons.
As for land sales, a general slowdown was observed since 2008. One explanation is that the first wave of
landowners interested in selling their land had done so by this time (Rolfes, 2008). Yet, in some places, there
seems to exist a lack of transparency and asymmetric power relations that cause a certain degree of land
ownership insecurity. This is the case, for instance, when the big shares have never been physically demarcated
and transferred to the owner. If, in such cases, landowners want to dissolve existing renting contracts, they
depend on the goodwill and support of the current user (usually the local large corporate farm) and the
administration. Furthermore, land rights over the small shares need to be clarified all over the country. This is
important because secure ownership of small shares will ensure enough subsistence production to increase the
inclination of smallholders to rent out their big shares for longer periods or even sell them.
Land rental markets do not seem to be very active either in the sense that parcels hardly move from one lessee
to another (Rolfes, 2008). Furthermore, official renting is usually restricted to short-term leasing contracts (up
to three years), which are often extended due to lack of alternatives. The main reason may be seen in higher
transaction cost for longer-term contracts which are often only concluded if the land user intends to invest in
vineyards or orchards (Rolfes 2008). From the point of view of smallholders, we came across complaints of
farmers who stated that leasing agreements are sometimes extended without the consent of the landowner or
that (in-kind) payments were cut-down without the consent of the landowner.
For addressing problems in the land market, we suggest to consider the following: (1) for further increasing the
transparency of land market transactions, an independent organization should be entitled to collect and publish
all land lease rates and land sale prices. The qualitative survey showed that the land rent is quite constant all over
the country, amounting to about 400 kilograms of wheat or corn and about 100 kilograms of sunflower seeds
per share, regardless of its size; moreover, the tenant is paying the land tax. A public documentation of prices
could reduce incentives for ex-post revisionary attempts and reveal opportunity costs of either keeping land in
own use or refraining from renting in more land. In order to prevent asymmetric power relations such an
organization should be independent from the village administration (i.e. at district level, where also the cadaster
offices are located). (2) Similarly, rental contracts should be approved in a more transparent way. Requests for
revisions of contractual terms have to be reasoned and all partners have to be informed. (3) Investments into
soil fertility and other measures of land improvement need sufficient time to generate positive pay-offs. The
currently cumbersome and expensive negotiation of long-term formal leasing contracts should therefore be
simplified and could be made more attractive by providing notary services in the village. Several burdensome
visits at the district center should be avoided, for example, by offering visits of district officers in local offices
(see Rolfes, 2008).
Without additional incentives to release land that is in the hands of the ageing generation of subsistence
farmers most likely attaching higher weights to land as social buffer, fast and successful land consolidation and
farm growth among smallholders cannot be expected. Additionally, a number of several cultural issues prevent
(subsistence) farm exits, among others a disapproving perception among the rural population of people in
waged agricultural work under current conditions and a high esteem of self-produced food. In Romania, the

                                                              47
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

‘Life Annuity Scheme’ allowed about 90,000 elderly beneficiaries to receive a guaranteed amount of money
until the end of their lives for selling or renting out their farmland. A positive side-effect of the program was
the updating of cadaster data and the formalization of leasing contracts (Alexandri, 2013).14 In Moldova, it
would be important to give family farms with growth aspirations a preferential access to released land as
otherwise they might not be able to compete with powerful corporate holdings (see concerns raised by Rolfes
(2008) who states that land consolidation programs might be abused to promote large-scale corporate
agriculture). With view to the vision of establishing a commercial family farm sector, land flows from large
corporate farms to individual farms would be preferable to the opposite direction.

4. Addressing market failures in capital markets
Viable financial services are a bottleneck for intensification, but also for farm growth (World Bank, 2015b).
Access to credit and cost of credits pose significant constraints to the agricultural sector, and in particular, small
farmers are currently almost completely bypassed by the financial sector. Smallholders report about an
unpleasant dependency on informal credits provided by the large farmers of their village. At the same time,
high interest rates and a lack of trust in the crisis-ridden banking system lead to a low demand of bank loans.
However, subsidized loans should only be considered if positive external effects are to be expected. Clearly,
distorting market prices of credits comes at some costs to the society and do not represent a first-best instrument.
In order to develop better-suited measures, the reasons for high interest rates need to be analyzed. Innovative
means of lowering the risk for moneylenders offering services to smallholders could improve targeting of
measures. As one option, government could provide the political framework and support in setting up self-help
initiatives of saving and credit associations as well as reinsurance of microcredits for small farms. It should be
explored in how far third parties could be supported in investing and providing services to farm households.
Examples could be the establishment of machinery services or marketing cooperatives.

5. Improving food quality and food safety, and, at least in the medium term,
reaching international competitiveness
It is necessary to pave the way to market integration for those smallholders with a potential and willingness to
develop, and to ensure that surpluses resulting from intensification can be profitably sold on the market.
Significant progress has been made in various areas of food safety and quality control (World Bank, 2015b), but
structural improvements and investments are still needed (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015).
Integrating smallholders into food quality and food safety programs is without doubt a challenge and no easy
solutions are available. Even in the EU, the functioning of agricultural value chains and price formation is
contested in the context of increasing retail and processing sector’s concentration. Single farm households will
always form the weakest link of the agricultural value chain. More collectively organized marketing, for instance
via group certification, may be one innovative option (see below), but investing in human resources is the
foundation of an appropriate management of a food quality and safety control.
Government authorities should start implementing food quality and safety programs with those farmers who
market most of their production and are willing to develop their farm. With view to reaching international
competitiveness, it must be stressed that international trade in Moldova is currently dominated by an
oligopsonistic structure: a few companies have export licenses and, more or less, dictate prices to agricultural
producers. Further research on the functioning of the supply chain and on reasons for negative rates of
protection needs to be conducted. Antitrust authorities should be enabled to analyze the concentration in
agribusiness and to take necessary actions to better protect farmers from unfair competition practices.

6. Tapping higher value and organic product markets
As markets for low-price and low-quality fresh and processed products are shrinking, Moldova’s farmers need
to adjust through modernization of production as well as harvest, post-harvest, processing and handling
14	 Similar ‘land for pension’ schemes were introduced in Hungary and Poland (Cartwright et al., 2010)

                                                                48
          Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

technologies (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). One promising option could be the market for
certified organic production. This type of farming is not only seen as particularly suitable for smallholders
(Barrett, Browne, Harris, & Cadoret, 2001; EC, 2012), but markets are expected to further grow and, as the
Romanian example shows, have a high export potential towards the EU. Investments in organic production
could not only be complementary with efforts to increase the resilience in face of climate and market risks, but
also contribute to increased food safety. We therefore see this as a niche with some potential for Moldova, if
smallholders receive necessary support for the certification and marketing. Within the EU, farmers converting
to organic agricultural production certified according to the EU directive and maintaining organic production
are entitled to apply for area-based direct payments under the heading of agri-environmental measures (Schwarz,
Nieberg, & Sanders, 2010). Romania, beside compensation payments per area, offers additional support for the
conversion period. Participatory or group certification schemes, which are currently discussed in Romania
(Munteanu, 2014), could be one important door-opener for smallholders. For successful marketing, such
producer groups furthermore need reliable partnerships with trustworthy exporters and EU importers (Barrett,
et al., 2001). Mid-term developments and expected income growth will push the demand for high-value and/
or more processed products also within Moldova. Furthermore, the establishment of wealthy consumer cohorts
is expected to lead the development of environmentally concerned consumer. Even if it remains a small share
of the population this development might open up new domestic market niches for Moldovan family farmers.
Livestock production, such as dairying, or high value crops may provide further opportunities for income
generation among small farmers. Based on current knowledge (such as Gorton et al., 2006), future research
should address their potentials.
As for the international markets, it might be advisable to increase the visibility of Moldovan agricultural
products. This could be reached if the national authorities, in collaboration with international organizations,
promote a branding strategy for Moldovan products, in particular those that are produced in a traditional way
and/or along organic production standards. The EU developed an elaborated system of geographical indications
and traditional specialties, which is intensively used by regions across EU member states. One possible challenge
could be fraud, which, in a weak institutional environment, is a problem that cannot be denied. (EurActiv, 2016)
reports that Romania plans to increase the controls and invest in laboratories for this reason. This should
increase the credibility of the sector and the trust of consumers, while at the same time the certification bodies
will become more efficient.

7. Organizing small-scale farmers to facilitate access to
financing and market integration
Assuming that Moldova’s farming structure will not change fast, for many smallholders, cooperation would be
a logical option to overcome many of the issues and market failures they face. Similarly, requirements of
modern supply chains push farmers to cooperate – as shown by the example of group certification above.15
However, we acknowledge that formal cooperation is not favored by small farmers in Moldova due to the
historical legacy and widespread mistrust. Smallholders also generally lack group power (World Bank & World
Food Programme, 2015). Nonetheless, farmers might be encouraged to set up their own (cooperative) processing
and marketing channels in order to strengthen their bargaining position and getting better access to input and
output markets as well as financing. It is recommended that the government not only sets incentives to voluntary
formal cooperation by providing an appropriate legal framework and campaigning for the cooperative idea, but
also seeks true understanding of the central market failures that prevent farmers from forming cooperatives
(Stewart, 2014). Experience shows that a trusted and transparent management is of highest importance
(Koester, 2012). For initiating cooperation, trusted third party support, for instance by NGOs, could be
important. Such a selfless third party might help to initiate the group formation process through training and
guidance during the first years of their establishment (Müller, 1994). First experience from Romania shows that
agricultural producer groups supported under Pillar II need to meet these pre-conditions (Calinescu, 2012).
15	 The downstream industry of buyers has not yet established long-term relationships with farmers and farming contract arrangements in this
field are weak ((World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015))

                                                                          49
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

Promising starting points for cooperation in Moldova could be the above mentioned producer groups for
organic certification and marketing or simple milk collection schemes, which have been successfully established
in some villages. In addition, storage facilities are identified by farmers as a major barrier to successful marketing,
thus, this is also a field in which cooperation could be beneficial for smallholders.

8. Promoting professional education and agricultural extension services
If the vision of a business-oriented family farm sector should materialize, the new generation of farm
entrepreneurs needs to be properly educated. Currently the Moldovan agricultural education system, at all levels
from vocational, to college and university, is weak. Curricula have not significantly changed since Soviet times,
so it has lost connection with present market requirements. Agriculture is a knowledge intensive business and
without appropriate agricultural education, there is only limited scope for substantial picking up, modernization
and sustainable growth of the farming sector. Addressing the education system is a general task of superior
importance. Moldova’s relatively low ranking (84th) on The Higher Education and Training Pillar of the Global
Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum points at the unsatisfying quality of education and identifies
poor education as a key weakness in the country’s competitiveness performance. Neighboring Romania, ranking
58th, is still struggling with its higher education system. Unlike most other important policy fields, education,
science and research are not part of the EU’s Acquis Communautaire.16 Therefore, there was no prescribed
pathway and, most likely, less reform pressure. Georgia may be a good example of a courageous reform of their
higher and general education (Sarychev & Livny, 2013). The system was in a short time successfully cleaned
from endemic corruption17 and access to higher education could be improved. Quality improvement, however,
remains a challenge and is certainly a longer-term process.
A strategy of a sustainable intensification of agricultural production that is inclusive of small farms needs a
strong agricultural extension service. Currently, the agricultural extension service seems to be hampered by top-
down channels, a bureaucratic structure, and qualification deficiencies. However, these services seem to be
much more accessible by family farmers than agricultural subsidies. Therefore, significant efforts in terms of
increasing the manpower and professional capacity of the extension services are desirable. In addition, there is
a lack of coordination and cooperation among the scientific community, educational institutions and extension
services in creating innovation and transferring it to farmers. The link with farmers seems in general to be
rather weak, so that fruitful cycles of mutual learning and innovation transfers are prevented. Moreover, farmers
seem to have no trust in extension personnel and tend to follow traditional practice.


II. Widening the vision towards the rural economy, governance and social aspects
Rural development depends on unlocking the full power of the rural economy. Agriculture certainly
continues to have an important influence on the rural economy. However, it was long recognized that rural
development requires a concerted effort that goes beyond sectoral policies. Thus, instead of purely sector-
based strategies the diverse development needs of rural regions need to be addressed by more coherence
among sectoral policies and the pooling of knowledge held by a wide variety of public and private actors
(OECD, 2006). In line with the main principles of this ‘new rural paradigm’, we stress that smallholder farm
development in Moldova must integrate the view on places (and their diverse livelihoods) instead of focusing
only on sectoral policies. It should also be critical towards the effectiveness of agricultural policy and in particular
agricultural subsidies as the predominant component of public policy for rural regions. Instead, more attention
should be given to investments (OECD, 2006). Providing framework conditions, which reduce transaction
costs and increase governance and rule of law are more difficult to quantify in monetary terms but are expected
to have longer lasting effects.
16	 The acquis in the field of science and research does not require transposition of EU rules into the national legal order. The areas of education,
training, youth and culture are primarily the competence of the Member States. See http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-member-
ship/chapters-of-the-acquis/index_en.htm
17	 The high level of bribery for grades or exams is, for instance, mentioned in a publication of the World Bank (Sondergard et al., 2012).

                                                                  50
           Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

9. Promotion of a viable rural non-farm sector that offers alternative local employment
Agricultural subsidies bring large resources into rural regions, but they are not intended to trigger rural development
directly and, in most cases, they do not do so as experience from other European countries show (OECD, 2006).
Even in Moldova, agriculture is no longer the major source of income for most farm families. While particularly
elderly farmers keep depending on subsistence farming, the majority of young people is no longer interested to
work on the farm. Ageing and depopulation due to outmigration could be the consequence.
There is ample proof that the rural non-farm economy has a large impact on rural livelihoods through income
diversification and poverty alleviation, but it also works as a facilitator for the decision to leave the agricultural
sector (Möllers, Buchenrieder, & Csaki, 2011). Although a flourishing family farm sector is in need of well-
educated, entrepreneurial young people, most of the youth will inevitably leave the sector, and maybe even the
rural areas or the country. Local employment alternatives are hence crucial to avoid land abandonment, rapid
rural depopulation and mass emigration, which are certainly not desirable for Moldova. To make the rural space
economically viable and attractive, rural-urban linkages, but also education as the main door opener for skilled
non-farm employment, need to be part of the rural development agenda. One well-known factor to push rural
development is investment into adequate infrastructure, which establishes the link to urban areas and other
sectors, attracts investment in rural areas, and connects farmers to markets.

10. Social protection for elderly farmers
While the young generation is in need of paid employment, elderly smallholders face with poverty and a high
dependence on subsistence production from their farms. The challenges of an aging population, persistence of
subsistence-based livelihoods and poverty cannot be solved by agricultural and rural policies alone. Better
policy targeting, coordination and exploiting synergies with, for example, social policies, are required. Sufficient
old age security systems are needed when consolidation is progressing and the subsistence sector shrinks. Up
to now, many rural Moldovans, even if farming is only a sideline for them, depend on their land resources. Only
if these farmers and their family members can make a decent living without depending on their farmland, it can
be expected that farmland is released and land consolidation can progress. One option for such a social security
policy would be a minimum pension system as was introduced in Romania in 2009. Such a system is part of the
general poverty alleviation strategy. One advantage is that this support will only go to those who are in need and
allow society to transfer limited resources to those in greatest need regardless of their previous work history.
This would be in line with the already existing and positively evaluated poverty-targeted program Ajutor Social
(Social Aid) (World Bank & World Food Programme, 2015). Anecdotal evidence shows, however, that
improvements in the management of funds and raising public awareness for this program can be still realized
(Piras & Botnarenco, 2015).

11. Good governance
Although there is no unique model for managing rural development, and there exists no single determining factor
of a region’s economic trajectory, it is clear that rural policies should aim at enhancing local capacity and actors’
participation ( Wolz, Hubbard, Möllers, Gorton, & Buchenrieder, 2012). This is a challenging task when, as typical
in Moldova, smallholders have no voice and public money seldom reaches the poorest people.
Rule of law, good governance and functioning institutions are indispensable for sound rural development. In
that sense, we would stress that any intervention should be monitored closely in terms of how it is implemented.
The spending of available funds18 should be conditioned to a transparent and targeted use with participatory
elements. Experiences from East Germany, for instance, illustrate that farms find ways to deal with scattered
parcel ownership of land by means of voluntary exchanges or informal management agreements. Such
18 This includes for example the EU’s Neighborhood Policy, which places high priority on public administration and agriculture. The European
Commission supports development and reforms in these two sectors during the period 2014-17 with a budget of 101 million Euros annually (of
which 37 million Euro for Public Finance Reforms and 64 million Euro for the European Neighbourhood Programme for Agriculture and Rural
Development (ENPARD)) (European Commission, 2014a, 2014b).

                                                                           51
Structural Transformation of Moldovan Smallholder Agriculture: Implications for Poverty and Shared Prosperity

constructions require a high level of trust among actors. To build such trust, Moldova needs to fight inefficient
institutions and weak governance at all levels. Indicators of institutional quality like the Worldwide Governance
Indicators (WGI) published by the World Bank or Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index
(CPI) suggest that Moldova faces significant challenges in this respect. Moldova belongs to the 20 percent worst
performing countries worldwide with respect to WGI’s dimension Control of corruption in 2014 and ranks 103
(out of 168) according to the 2015 CPI. The European Commission has also addressed this as a major challenge
extending through all levels of public administration and judiciary (Secrieru & Sobjak, 2014).
Experience of Georgia’s administrative and anti-corruption reforms has been cited often as best practice
example in the Eurasian region (World Bank, 2012). Major reforms include a reorganization of the system of
municipal finances, cutting down numbers of licenses and inspections and a stricter separation of local
administration and the sphere of political parties. However, the payoffs of such reforms emerge often with a
substantial time lag and are difficult to assign to individual sectors.
