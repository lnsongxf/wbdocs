This is a background paper to a report prepared at the request of the G20 Development Working
Group by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, the United Nations and the World Bank. I t h a s benefitted from consultation
with other organisations working in the tax area, officials of developing countries, Civil Society
Organisations, and business representatives. The report is prepared under the responsibility of the
Secretariats and Staff of the four organisations. It reflects a broad consensus among these staff, but
should not necessarily be regarded as the officially-endorsed views of those organisations or their
member states. The report was presented as requested to the G20 DWG in September, 2015, and to the
Executive Board of the IMF for information, in October, 2015.

October 15, 2015   EFFICIENT USE OF TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—
                   TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES
                   This background document describes five different tools that can be used for the
                   assessment of tax incentives by governments in LICs.

                   The first tool (an application of cost-benefit analysis) provides an overarching
                   framework for assessment. Evaluations of the various costs and benefits of tax
                   incentives are vital for informed decision making, but are rarely undertaken, partly
                   because it can be a difficult exercise that is demanding in terms of data needs. The
                   simple template presented here aims to provide a practicable framework to guide
                   evaluations, steer data gathering, and structure public discussions on the effectiveness
                   and efficiency of tax incentives.

                   The next three tools (tax expenditure assessment, corporate micro simulation models,
                   and effective tax rate models) can be used as part of a comprehensive cost-benefit
                   analysis, to shed light on particular aspects. For instance, tax expenditure analysis is
                   essential to understanding the costs of tax incentives in terms of revenue foregone.
                   Corporate micro simulation models are the most accurate and generally preferred
                   instrument to perform such a tax expenditure review. Yet, their value goes beyond this
                   and they are commonly used for wider tax policy analysis, including forecasting and
                   distributional analysis. Effective tax rate models shed light on the implications of tax
                   parameters—including targeted tax incentives—on investment returns and help
                   understand the implications of reform for expected investment outcomes.

                   Finally, the document presents two tools for assessing the transparency and
                   governance of tax incentives in LICs. These discuss principles in transparency and
                   governance of tax incentives, and allow for benchmarking existing LIC practices against
                   better alternatives.

                   Note that the tools discussed in this background document might well be
                   complemented by other, more sophisticated analyses. For instance, general equilibrium
                   models, systematic analysis of micro or macro data, and ex-post evaluations may be
                   critical for a full understanding of all costs and benefits of tax incentives. Such analyses
                   might indeed be considered, but are typically beyond reach in the short run in most
                   LICs due to capacity constraints and data limitations. Priority might therefore be given
                   to developing the tools discussed in this document.

                   Note also that this document offers only a brief introduction to the various tools,
                   without providing a complete handbook on each of them. Further references are
                   provided for additional reading.

COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS
This section develops a template for cost benefit analysis of tax incentives, aimed to structure
discussion about their effectiveness and efficiency and to offer a guide to the collection of necessary
data. The framework emphasizes both direct and indirect effects of tax incentives – the latter are
often overlooked in policy debates. The model captures several relevant components of a
comprehensive welfare assessment, but, it is hoped, in a fairly simple way. In particular, the following
simplifications are made (which could be expanded upon in a more complex model).

   Static approach— the model here uses a static (long-term) approach that cannot analyze timing
    issues. As costs and benefits of tax incentives often materialize in the future, these timing
    aspects could be modeled in a dynamic setting, with appropriate discounting.

   Limited fiscal framework—the model includes only taxes on FDI, often the main focus of tax
    incentive policies. Yet, there might be complex (and country-specific) interactions with other
    taxes, with indirect revenue effects, as well as indirect effects on public expenditures.

   Reduced form—equations here capture some of the most relevant feedback effects as identified
    in the literature. A more elaborate structural framework of microeconomic behavior and market
    structure might be adopted to derive a fully-fledged general equilibrium model that links micro
    behaviors with macroeconomic outcomes.

A. A Simple Model
Assume that welfare ( ) of citizens in a developing country depends on private consumption ( )
and public consumption—simply represented by tax revenues ( ) that finance public goods. For
simplicity, we assume utility is additive:

                                                                   																																																																						 1


where . captures the valuation of public goods relative to private goods, with ′>0. Private
consumption is constrained by income, which comes from two sources: domestic production ( )
and earnings of domestic residents working in a multinational corporation (MNC), where    is the
wage rate and    employment in the MNC:

                                                                   																																																																						 2


Domestic production is denoted by the function

                                                        ,   ,     ,																																																																						 3


which depends on domestic labor (     ) and domestic capital (       ). Moreover, FDI of the MNC enters
the domestic production function in (3), reflected by       . The latter is not a direct input into



6
                           TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



domestic production, but may affect it indirectly in two ways. First, there may be a technology or
knowledge spillover from FDI upon the domestic sector. In case of such positive spillovers, we have
      0 so that domestic output expands due to FDI. Second, FDI may displace domestic capital. In
that case, we have     /          0	 and FDI reduces domestic production (and domestic savers can
then generate returns elsewhere, at a rate       .


Labor supply ( ) is assumed fixed. In equilibrium, it equals the sum of labor demand by domestic
firms, labor demand by MNCs, and unemployment:

                                                               																																																																						 4


An increase in    due to FDI inflows will reduce either unemployment or employment in the
domestic sector (and thus domestic production). If the wage in the MNC sector is higher than in the
domestic sector, all workers will have an incentive to move to the MNC sector. Jobs in that sector
( ), however, are rationed. Even with full displacement of domestic labor, an increase in    can
raise total income due to higher wages earned by employees in the MNC.

Multinationals are assumed to be wholly-owned by residents abroad (in advanced countries). The
after-tax profits earned by the MNC in the developing country (Π ) will thus flow back to the
foreign owner, and equal:

                             Π      1                ,         1                     																																																 5


where and denote taxes by the developing country on, respectively, economic profit and the
normal capital return ( )—capturing two components of an ordinary corporate income tax. . is a
production function of the MNC, combining FDI with domestic labor, and is assumed to have
standard properties. The components of multinational income that accrue to the host country are
wages earned by host-country employees and tax revenue.

If FDI is a continuous variable and MNCs are unconstrained, the optimal amount of FDI is given by

                                                         1     ,																																																																						 6


and is guided by the cost of capital, which depends on , but is independent of —see below for
further discussion.

Welfare from public goods depends on total government revenue

which comes from taxes on economic profit and the normal return of the MNC.




                                                                                                                                     7

B. Taxation and Foreign Investment
Business tax incentives aim to attract FDI. In the framework above, this effect is captured by:


                                        Δ            ∆          ∆ 																																																																						 8



where ∆     0 represent profit-related tax incentives (such as reduced corporate tax rates, tax
exemptions, or tax holidays) and ∆      0 represent cost-related tax incentives (such as investment tax
credits or accelerated depreciation, which are targeted to reductions in the cost of capital). In a
neoclassical setting, equation (5) suggests that only ∆ will affect FDI and	                     /           0. However, in a
more general setting where e.g. FDI is lumpy and its choice reflects a discrete location decision, the
tax on profit ∆ can matter as well (	       /   <0). We will consider both effects.


Empirical insight into the two components of equation (8) may come from different sources:

   Studies looking directly at the impact of tax incentives on FDI. Some studies perform regressions
    to measure this effect; others use survey evidence to infer this.

   Using a two-step approach, first using studies that look at the impact of tax incentives on
    effective tax rates (see later Section) and second using studies that explore the impact of
    effective tax rates on FDI. Here, one needs to distinguish between marginal effective tax rates
    (METRs), which measure effects on incremental investment (cf. the second term in (8)) and
    average effective tax rates (AETRs), which measure effects on discrete investment (cf. the first
    term in (8)).

Estimated structural models can be used for the second step: they quantify the systematic impacts
of taxes on investment, based on investment theories that describe how tax incentives influence firm
behavior. Structural models can be estimated using (micro) data to test their validity and to infer the
average magnitude of tax effects on investment. Many empirical studies, however, take a reduced-
form approach to infer this effect, using ETRs as explanatory variables. In countries where data
restrictions make it impossible to derive appropriate estimates, officials may rely on the best-
available knowledge from other—preferably similar—countries.

C. Welfare Assessment
Equation (1) suggests that social welfare is the sum of welfare derived from private consumption
and public consumption, respectively, both of which can be affected by tax incentives. We discuss
the changes in private and public welfare in turn, thereby distinguishing direct and indirect effects.

                             TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



Private component of welfare

Combining (2) and (3), we derive the change in private consumption as a result of the inflow of FDI:


                         Δ                                                               	Δ       																																			 9


where is the opportunity cost of domestic saving. The private welfare gain depends on four
factors. The first term measures the direct effect; the other three terms measure indirect effects.

Direct effects

   Jobs and wages (first term). Some studies take the number of jobs created by an FDI project to
    measure the benefits of a tax incentive. Equation (9) suggests that the wage paid to these
    workers is important as well.

Indirect effects

   Displacement of labor (second term). The jobs created due to the FDI inflow may be occupied by
    people who were previously unemployed. However, to the extent that these workers previously
    worked in the domestic sector, domestic production declines by               /    . Equation (9)
    shows that the net benefits to the developing country is still positive if the wage paid by the
    MNC is higher than the production loss in the domestic sector.

   Displacement of capital (third term). FDI may (partly) displace domestic capital, e.g. when the FDI
    involves a takeover or when there is round tripping. Empirical estimates and general equilibrium
    analysis can shed light on such displacement effects. If there is full displacement, the net effect
    on the total capital stock will be zero.

   Productivity spillovers (fourth term). FDI can bring new technologies and skills to a developing
    country, with positive effects on the productivity of workers and capital in the domestic sector.
    Empirical studies (such as those summarized in the main document) can reveal the importance
    of such spillovers.

Public component of welfare

Using (1) and (7), the change in public welfare can be written as

                     Π
       Δ                      ∆        Δ         ΔΠ       Δ    																																																																						 10
                    1                       1



where the change in profits (ΔΠ ) can be inferred from (5). The change in public welfare depends on
direct and indirect effects, and should be corrected for the social value of public funds:


                                                                                                                                      9
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



    Direct revenue loss (first two terms between brackets). General tax relief is costly for
     governments as it reduces revenue from the existing base. Targeted tax incentives generally aim
     to mitigate such losses by only granting relief to new FDI. Some of these new FDI projects,
     however, might have been undertaken even without the incentive, which then leads to revenue
     foregone.

    Indirect revenue effects (last two terms between brackets). To the extent that tax incentives
     attract new FDI, they can expand tax bases. As long as the tax rate remains positive, this base
     broadening will recover some of the direct revenue loss from the incentive. However, tax
     incentives may also create new leakages (for example through domestic profit shifting to the
     incentivized firms), so that tax bases are eroded—so the sign of ΔΠ is ambiguous.

    Scarcity of public funds (term ). Public funds may be scarcer than private income, as taxes
     necessary to generate public revenue are distortionary. Alternatively—and perhaps especially
     relevant for developing countries—there can be administrative constraints to domestic revenue
     mobilization that make public revenue particularly scarce. With a marginal cost of public funds
     larger than one        1 , a dollar of public revenue is more valuable than a dollar of private
     income, which should be accounted for in assessing the welfare implications of changes in
     government revenue.

Evaluation studies on tax incentives sometimes compare the jobs created by (incremental)
investment with the revenue foregone from (non-incremental) investment—the so-called dollar-
cost-per-job calculations. This essentially takes account of only the direct effects listed above.
Indirect effects, however, can be critical, yet are often more difficult to quantify. Indirect effects can
be inferred from general equilibrium models, which capture linkages and feedback effects through
other markets. This could account for displacement effects, spillover benefits and distortions in
resource allocation due to discriminatory treatment. Quantifying these aspects generally requires
calibration of critical parameters, based on available econometric analysis—which is not always
readily available in LICs. General equilibrium models would also enable one to infer the
macroeconomic and overall welfare implications of tax incentives. If one is unable to quantify these
indirect effects, it might still be helpful to analyze the direct effects as a starting point.


TAX EXPENDITURE ASSESSMENT
This section discusses how to undertake a tax expenditure assessment, discussed and advocated in
the main body of the paper. Tax expenditures (TEs) usually refer to provisions in the tax code (or in
Ministerial decrees with the force of law) in deviation of some benchmark tax system and to the
benefit of the taxpayer. A TE review quantifies the revenue forgone for each provision thus
identified. The core objective of a TE review is to improve transparency and support policy
evaluation, thus contributing to better informed decision making and better governance. Indeed,
TEs and their revenue costs are inherently less visible than direct public expenditures, with the
consequence that they often undergo less scrutiny and evaluation. This makes them prone to
lobbying and pressures from special interest groups, leading to inefficient policy design and



10
                         TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



corruption risks. By supporting transparency and evaluation, TE reporting enables greater control
over the use of public funds. TE assessments should be carried out by the Ministry of Finance and
reported as part of the budget process, for example being appended to budget documents or
released as a separate document.

TEs are not necessarily bad policy. Indeed, offering provisions through the tax code may sometimes
have distinct advantages over direct spending measures, for instance because the tax administration
can exploit economies of scale by utilizing information it already collects for tax purposes. The
purpose of a TE assessment is thus not necessarily to reduce TEs, but rather to enable a proper
assessment and allow for a comparison with alternative (spending) measures to achieve certain
policy objectives.

A. Measuring Tax Expenditures
A TE report generally includes the following elements:

   A list of tax expenditures, with a clear description (e.g., full/partial profit exemption, tax
    allowance, tax credit), duration, and identification of the law/decree that provides for its legal
    basis. Each TE should come along with a stated policy objective. In some countries, there are
    hundreds of TEs, often scattered throughout the chapters/articles of an Act and across different
    Acts.

   For each tax expenditure in the list, an estimate of total tax revenue foregone. The report
    should provide an indication of the model and data used in the quantification (e.g. micro-
    simulation model, data from tax returns).

   Supplementary material, such as an analysis of the distributional impact of the tax relief across
    taxpayers (e.g. corporations, by size, or sector). Moreover, tax expenditures can be presented
    alongside direct expenditures classified by type/ category of expenditure to indicate total
    expenditures (direct plus tax expenditure).

When quantifying the revenue forgone from tax expenditures (as in step 2 above), analysts need to
make two calculations. The first is a simulation of tax revenues under the scenario that the given TE
is in place, along the lines of the actual tax code (or Decrees) of which it is part. This revenue is
called the ‘base case’. The second is a simulation of tax revenues under a scenario where the TE is
removed from the code, along the lines of a specified ‘benchmark’ tax system. This revenue is called
the ‘hypothetical case’. The difference measures the revenue foregone from the tax expenditure (see
Figure 1).

The specification of the relevant benchmark tax system to which tax incentives are to be compared
is often a contentious issue. For some taxes (such as personal income taxes), there is no
internationally agreed benchmark. Indeed, diverse benchmark systems are observed in TE analyses,
with countries typically adhering closely to their existing tax system. As these often differ from each
other, international comparisons of TEs are usually problematic (see for example OECD, 1996). For



                                                                                                     11
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



other taxes (such as VAT and CIT), the benchmark system is usually defined more uniformly across
countries. Still, several choices need to be made with respect to details.

When a benchmark tax system is specified, tax expenditures can be estimated by using alternative
methods:1

    The revenue foregone method. This is a calculation of the static revenue loss incurred by
     government due to a TE. It does not take into consideration changes in behavior of taxpayers
     due to the removal of the TE. For example, a tax credit that reduces tax liability by $100, given
     current behavior, would involve a TE of $100. This is the easiest and most popular method of
     calculating TEs as it uses simple accounting principles, usually based on tax returns (or
     documents provided to customs). This method is likely to be the most attractive for LICs to
     pursue.

    The revenue gain method. This method calculates the revenue gain from removing a TE, taking
     into account behavioral changes by taxpayers. For example, if an investment tax credit is
     removed, this might result in lower investment and, therefore, a narrowing of the CIT base. The
     computation of the TE would take this behavioral effect into account. In the example above, if
     removing the tax credit would cause a loss in revenue of $10 due to a reduction in investment,
     the TE associated with the tax credit would be $90 instead of $100. This method better accounts
     for the purpose of certain incentives, but can be more contentious given the inevitable


1
  A third method, not discussed here, is the so-called outlay equivalent method, under which a TE is calculated as the
direct spending equivalent that would result in the same benefit for the taxpayer as the TE. It may differ from the
revenue forgone method if direct spending is itself taxable. For example, the equivalent to a $100 tax deduction if the
tax rate were 50 percent would be a taxable transfer of $200. The outlay equivalent method is less popular than the
revenue foregone method because the outcome is often viewed as less intuitive.

       uncertainty on the extent of behavioral responses. It is also much more complex and therefore
       unlikely to be attractive for LICs.

In calculating TEs, a model is needed to simulate tax revenue under the two different policy
scenarios—that is, with and without the tax incentive. Different models based on different data can
be used for this purpose. For personal income tax and corporate income tax, good practice in this
regard is to use micro simulation models (MSMs) for, respectively, households and firms. They are
usually based on administrative tax return data, sometimes complemented with survey data on
certain characteristics. The next section elaborates in more detail on corporate MSMs.

A possible estimation error can arise when different tax expenditures are calculated separately and
then added up. For example, when a tax rate for certain businesses is reduced while, at the same
time, tax depreciation for certain assets is made more generous, the total revenue foregone
measured by adding up two tax expenditure estimates (under ceteris paribus assumptions)
erroneously ignores the interaction between those two measures. Such cross-effects can lead to an
underestimation of the revenue effect (Box 1).


                               Box 1. Estimation Error in Adding-up Tax Expenditures
 Consider a CIT system with a reduced tax rate and reduced tax base for targeted (qualifying) investment.
 Let (T) denote the basic CIT rate, and (t) denote the reduced CIT rate (with t < T). Let (B) denote the CIT
 base measured without tax incentives, and (b) denote the base with incentives (e.g. accelerated
 depreciation).

 In principle, the ‘true’ total tax expenditure from the two incentives would be measured as the difference
 between CIT revenues where the basic CIT rate and CIT base without incentives apply, and CIT revenues
 where the reduced CIT rate and base apply:

 TE *  T  B  t  b                                                                                    (1a)

 This measure may be expressed alternatively as follows:

 TE     *
             ( B  b )T  ( T  t ) b  ( B  b ) t  ( T  t ) B                                       (1b)

 If tax expenditures are calculated separately for each incentive and then added up, the total tax expenditure
 estimate is measured as:

   
 TE  ( B  b )t  (T  t )b                                                                             (2)

 Comparing (1b) and (2), we see that the sum of two tax expenditures understates the true CIT revenue loss:

   
 TE  TE *  (T  t )( B  b )                                                                           (3)




                                                                                                                13
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



Also important to note is that TE estimates obtained from the revenue-foregone method using
aggregate data (e.g. National Accounts or input-output tables) may not reflect the expected true
revenue effect of the removal of tax concessions. Indeed, the revenue calculations not only ignore
behavioral effects, but might also ignore tax non-compliance. In reality, however, there can be a
significant tax compliance gap: a gap, that is, between the expected revenue from a tax under full
compliance and the true revenue. In principle, one could infer the expected true revenue effect from
the removal of tax concessions by applying an estimated compliance gap to both scenarios (on the
assumption that the incentive itself does not affect the extent of non-compliance). When relying on
taxpayer-level data from tax returns or macroeconomic data, effects of less than full compliance are
reflected in the base case and hypothetical case estimates.

B. Country Examples
A growing number of countries now prepare TE reports on a regular basis, including several
developing countries. In some cases, TE reporting is supported by regional coordination initiatives.
For example, the Inter American Center of Tax Administrations (CIAT) has been active for a number
of years in organizing workshops and events to encourage Latin American countries to report their
TEs. The countries thus share modeling and data gathering experiences and use similar methods in
performing their TE estimates (CIAT, 2011). Table 1 shows TEs in selected countries in this region,
both by type of tax and by type of tax expenditure.

An example of a country that has recently released its first TE report is the Philippines. The Ministry
of Finance provided its analysis in 2011 to help guide policy regarding tax incentives. In the CIT, the
Philippines employ income tax holidays, special (reduced) tax rates on business income, additional
deductions for labor costs, tax credits for certain raw materials used in exported products, and VAT
and duty exemptions for imported capital equipment. Data availability currently limits TE reporting
to tax revenues foregone from income tax holidays and reduced tax rates. Table 2 shows detailed TE
reporting by type of business activity. For 2011, the total TEs from the two categories add up to an
estimated foregone tax revenue of 4.5 per cent of 2011 government revenues (ignoring cross-
effects).2 This has induced the government in the Philippines to push for the enactment of a Tax
Incentives Management and Transparency Act. Its aim is to provide resources to establish a TE
measurement and analysis unit and a Fiscal Incentives Rationalization reform bill to coordinate the
use of tax incentives.

  The Department of Finance explains (Tax Expenditure Account of the Philippines, Fiscal Year 2011) that its 2011 tax
expenditure estimates cover 1,318 firms (submitting electronic returns), reflecting roughly 29 per cent of all
registered investors.

C. Corporate Income Tax Incentives
The benchmark of the corporate income tax (CIT) may be defined in different ways. One approach is
to specify a normative benchmark, reflecting a system that is generally perceived to be desirable.
However, even specialists usually differ as to the optimal design of the CIT. Given the many
contentious issues regarding a normative benchmark, in practice most countries take their existing
system applying to ‘most companies’ as the benchmark CIT system. This means that profit under the
benchmark is taxed at the standard CIT rate. The benchmark corporate tax base thus typically
includes allowances for depreciation and interest, but no deduction for the cost of equity and no
other special provisions for particular sectors or firms.

The (annual) corporate TE on providing a tax holiday may be calculated ex post as the aggregate
amount of CIT revenue foregone by not taxing, at the basic CIT rate, the amount of corporate profit
sheltered by the tax holiday. To obtain such information, qualifying firms need to file a corporate tax
return and report exempt amounts of profits. TE estimates of CIT foregone each year over a holiday
period may suffice to bring about transparency and information for evaluation. A more
comprehensive analysis would also analyze the profile of hypothetical CIT payments over time,
taking into account transitional rules governing ‘pools’ (balances) of tax depreciation and business
losses, and ‘stability clauses’.

Accelerated depreciation might be another form of TE, but one that raises both conceptual and
measurement issues.3 To circumvent them, standard practice in TE estimation is to take the generally
applied existing depreciation rules used in the CIT system as the benchmark. Accelerated
depreciation is then taken to be the application of rates (and possibly methods) that provide for
faster write-offs for certain asset classes targeted at certain sectors or taxpayers. The corporate TE
from providing accelerated depreciation may then be calculated as the aggregate amount of CIT
revenue foregone in a given year by accelerated as opposed to regular (or normal) depreciation.
Reporting may also include estimates of the difference in the present value of tax depreciation
claims under the two scenarios (requiring more complex analytics).


CORPORATE MICRO SIMULATION MODELS
This section elaborates on the development and use of a micro-simulation model (MSM) of
corporate income taxes (CIT). The models (essentially corporate tax calculators) can be developed in
a straightforward manner and used in common spreadsheets, such as Excel. For many countries, the
main hurdle has been allocating scarce resources to building datasets (based on tax returns) as an
input to the models. Where resources are limited, steps can be taken (as analyzed below) to limit the
resource requirement (e.g. by focusing on large taxpayers). Experience shows that the payoff can be
great.

 Conceptual issues relate to the appropriate benchmark regarding depreciation, such as economic depreciation or
current tax rules. Measurement difficulties arise if economic depreciation is chosen as a benchmark in light of
considerable uncertainty.

A CIT MSM is essentially a firm-level CIT calculator, with flexibility in the adjustment of tax policy
parameters and economic variables. An important feature is that it can analyze the revenue and
distributional impacts of detailed tax policy changes, such as preferential CIT rates, alternative tax
depreciation rates and methods (with separate calculations for different categories of depreciable
assets), tax allowances and credits and other specific tax incentives.

A CIT-MSM may be used by Ministries of Finance for policy simulations, and for revenue forecasting
purposes. CIT-MSMs contribute to transparency and can improve the quality of information that is
needed for policy preparation. Especially relevant for the underlying paper, is that a CIT MSM is the
preferred instrument to estimate the revenue foregone from corporate TEs. Indeed, models relying
on aggregate data, such as from the National Accounts data, yield less reliable revenue estimates
and can usually not be used to explore detailed tax policy changes. Moreover, unlike tools based on
aggregate data, CIT MSMs can yield insight in how CIT reform affects the distribution of tax
liabilities across firms (by, for example, industry, firm size and location). This may be helpful in
addressing political-economy concerns associated with CIT reform, such as with the removal or
scaling back of tax incentives.

When deciding to develop an in-house CIT MSM, one should of course consider the benefits as well
as costs of developing and maintaining such as model, most notably staff costs. Moreover, one has
to identify constraints regarding the availability (and confidentiality) of data or possibly political
resistance to the use of such data. Problems may arise also when modeling a proposed but currently
non-existing tax instrument, such as a tax credit for regional development, for which one requires
information on existing levels of investment in targeted region(s) which may not be available. In
such cases, other sources of information (such as survey data) would need to be found and
incorporated into the dataset to be able to analyze the tax measure. Before developing a CIT MSM,
moreover, it is important to identify the most relevant applications, guided by the demand for tax
policy analysis in the Ministry of Finance and Revenue Administration.

A. Developing a Model
A CIT MSM uses a structured programming language or software (such as Excel) to calculate CIT
payments at the firm level. The models requires (exogenous) input information and produces
(endogenous) output.

    The input data to a MSM calculation include receipts, expenses and balance sheet items from
     individual corporate tax returns. These values are exogenous to the model and are held fixed
     when calculating CIT under alternative tax policies. The other important category of exogenous
     input variables are tax policy parameters, such as statutory CIT tax rates (basic CIT rate and
     possibly other rates), tax depreciation rates (of which there may be many), and investment tax
     credits. The base-case values are obtained from the current tax law. These parameters can be
     varied when simulating the revenue implications of tax reform or when calculating the
     magnitude of TEs (hypothetical cases).

   The output of the CIT MSM is a number of endogenous variables, which are ‘modeled’ and
    calculated by the MSM. Examples include claims for depreciation allowances, which change
    when the tax depreciation rate changes, investment tax credit claims, which change with
    investment tax credit rates change, taxable income, and final CIT liability. The output variables,
    based on sample data, can be weighted and aggregated to give economy-wide estimates of CIT
    revenue under current law. They can also be calculated under alternative hypothetical laws, for
    example in the estimation of corporate TEs. Estimates can also be presented for various
    aggregates (by industry, firm-size, or other dimensions).

Some tax allowances can be endogenous in the model, for instance, if they depend on firm-specific
characteristics or outcomes. For example, some CIT systems provide a deduction as a non-linear
function of income based on some qualifying indicator (e.g. small firms under a certain turnover,
income, or asset level). Rather than treating the deduction in the model as fixed, it needs to be
modeled as a function D=θ(q), where q measures income based on a qualifying indicator as
reported in the tax return and θ is a function of q that determines the deductible amount. The policy
function θ can be changed in the MSM, reflecting tax policy. The model yields an estimate of the
deduction, D, and CIT revenue.

Some variables have a dynamic character and need to be traced over time. For example, depreciable
capital costs are written off gradually over time. CIT systems typically require that accounts be kept
of balances (stocks) of undepreciated capital to determine tax depreciation claims that can be made
in the current year and those that are carried forward to future years. This is illustrated in Figure 2—
beginning of year balances (‘pools’) are increased by Additions (current investment) and reduced by
Deductions (current year claims). Similarly, balances (pools) are used to track unused business losses
and investment tax credits.

Table 3 gives an illustrative example of how a CIT MSM works, showing tax parameters in rows 4-6,
exogenous tax return data in column D and a mix of exogenous data (copied from column D) and
endogenous ‘base case’ variables calculated by the spreadsheet model in column E. In the example,
columns D and E are equivalent since they both reflect the actual tax system. Column F shows
‘hypothetical case’ values, where the investment tax credit rate is set to zero (elimination of the
credit). Current year investment expenditure (143 currency units) no longer generates credits, but
credits (20 units) carried over from prior years reduce CIT. The example reflects the importance of
taking into account opening balances of undepreciated capital costs (UCC), business losses and tax
credits.

An important step in the development of a CIT MSM is the validation of the model. In particular, a
comparison should be made between the estimated base case aggregate CIT revenue as simulated
by the MSM and the actual aggregate CIT revenue reported in the government accounts. At this
point, a process begins to check for errors and to adjust the sample size until differences between
estimated and actual aggregate CIT revenue are small enough by some metric.

B. Data Issues
A critical step in the development of a CIT MSM is the creation of a dataset, based on corporate-
level tax returns, which serves as input to the model.4 Ideally, one would copy data from tax returns
for the entire population of corporations. This might be feasible in countries with complete
electronic filing of tax returns. If this is impossible or deemed too resource intensive (for example
because it is necessary to manually transcribe data and take information from paper corporate tax
returns into an electronic database), an alternative is to construct a representative sample. The
results based on the sample can then be weighted to replicate economy-wide results for the entire
population of corporations. Where a sample is used, CIT data transcription generally involves the
creation of two files: a ‘population file’ and a ‘sample file’:

   The population file includes limited data entries for all corporations. It is used as a basis for
    establishing the sample file and to cross-check estimated aggregate CIT revenues from the
    MSM. The population file may be adjusted compared to the raw data, e.g. by the removal of
    inactive corporations, corporations with limited activity (e.g. less than two months in the fiscal
    year), and very small corporations identified using an asset and income threshold test.

   The sample file is drawn from the population file by first identifying firm-level characteristics
    (‘dimensions’) to create sub-groups (strata) of firms with common characteristics. For example,
    the population file may be stratified (grouped) using the following dimensions: 25 industry
    sectors; 4 asset sizes; 10 locations; 2 ownership types (resident, non-resident); 2 types of tax
    status (taxable, tax-exempt). These dimensions would create 4000 (25x4x10x2x2) sub-groups.
    Each sub-group is relatively homogeneous. Independent sampling of each sub-group provides a
    better representation of the population than random sampling from non-stratified population

4
  Corporate tax return data are also frequently used by tax administrations to calculate various ratios, which are
inputs to their risk-based auditing practices. The same data can thus be used also to build a MSM.



                                                                                                                     21

      data. The stratified population file is used to create the sample file, which has the same number
      of sub-groups as the stratified population file. Given the significant contribution of large
      corporations to total CIT, it is important to include all large corporations in the sample file. For
      each remaining sub-group in the population file, a random sample of firms is drawn and
      assigned to the corresponding sub-group in the sample file.

Table 4 provides a simplified example of the creation of a sample file from a population file. In the
example, firms are stratified into two dimensions: industry (A, B, C) and size (Large, Medium, Small).
This gives a total of 9 sub-groups. The total population consists of 40,100 corporations, 100 of which
are large. All large corporations are automatically assigned to the sample, given their importance in
determining total CIT revenues. From the remaining 40,000 tax returns, a random selection is made,
with a target of including 5 per cent of the returns in the sample. In the example, this results in 2000
corporations being included in the sample (in addition to the 100 large corporations automatically
included).

The last three columns of Table 4 show weights to be applied to MSM firm-level results for firms in
each of the sub-groups in the sample when constructing estimates for the full population. Large
firms all have a weight of one, as they are all included in the sample. For each of the other (6) sub-
groups, the weight is determined by dividing the total number of firms in that sub-group in the
population by the total number of firms in that sub-group in the sample. Weighting firm-level
results from any exercise with the MSM will yield aggregate (economy-wide) estimates.

The representativeness of the sample needs to be validated through the comparison of simulated
aggregate outcomes with actual aggregate data. For instance, Table 5 compares actual data on total
assets, total taxable income, and total CIT revenue with the simulated MSM calculation for these
variables, using a weighted sample. The ratio between the two in the last column is between 99 and
102 percent, which suggests a reasonable approximation by the MSM of the true aggregated data. If
the differences are large, the sample size must be increased (e.g. revising upward the target
percentage (5 per cent in the example above)), and possibly new dimensions added, to improve the
accuracy of the sample.

Differences in values between the population and weighted sample may be reduced by increasing
the sample size and/or increasing (or revising) the number of dimensions used to group
corporations. In general, a good stratification of taxpayer characteristics (one that results in largely
homogeneous firms in each strata) allows for a smaller sample size. The degree of homogeneity of
firms within each stratum may be tested by calculating the coefficient of variation for selected
variables (e.g. assets, taxable income, CIT liability) for firms within each stratum and ensuring that
the values are not greater than roughly 5 per cent.


EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MODELS
This section derives effective tax rates (ETRs) and elaborates on their use. These have been routinely
used in technical assistance work by the IMF and World Bank for many years, and have proved
instructive in better understanding the nature and magnitude of the incentives that various
corporate tax provisions and concessions create for business investment decisions.

ETRs are summary tax burden indicators aimed at measuring what firms effectively pay on their
investment returns. They account for not only statutory CIT rates, but also key features of the tax
base, which are important for the distortionary impact of taxation on investment.

There exist various types of ETRs.5 This section focuses on so-called ‘forward looking’ ETRs, which
are derived from algebraic formulae that assess the net present value of a representative investment
project.6 The formulae are transparent and flexible, allowing users to separately identify various
factors influencing net investment returns, including statutory tax rates, depreciation allowances,
interest deductibility and tax incentives. Two types of forward-looking ETRs are discussed:7

      Marginal effective tax rates (METRs) measure the extent to which taxation causes the pre-tax
       hurdle rate of return on investment to deviate from its normal (minimum) after-corporate tax
       rate of return, which shareholders could obtain elsewhere. METRs reflect the “tax wedge” on

    See OECD (1991, 2001, 2003), Nicodeme (2001), Sorensen (2004) and Clark and Klemm (2015) for reviews.
6
  Alternatively, backward looking effective tax burden measures are calculated at the firm or aggregate level as actual
tax payments in prior years, divided by adjusted book profits. They have appeal in that they measure the true tax
burden, accounting for tax base measures, tax incentives, enforcement, and income shifting. These aspects, however,
cannot separately be identified. Moreover, backward looking effective tax rates cannot measure distortions on future
investment.

  Seminal work on METR analysis includes Jorgenson (1963), King and Fullerton (1984), Boadway and Bruce (1984).
Devereux and Griffith (2003) introduced AETR analysis.

     investments that just break even. They are routinely used to assess how taxes distort the level of
     investment (scale decisions).

    Average effective tax rates (AETRs) are usually calculated as the present-discounted value of
     CIT payment on returns on investment, divided by the present discounted value of the (before-
     tax) income from the investment. They measure the tax burden on profitable investment
     projects, i.e. those earning an above-normal rate of return (due, for instance, to patents, market
     power, or location rents). AETRs are used to assess tax effects on discrete investment choices,
     and in particular MNC decisions of whether and where to locate FDI (location decisions).

A. Workhorse Model
We derive ETRs from a simple workhorse model of investment, which can easily be extended in
various directions to capture other aspects of taxation. Suppose there is an investment project in
period 0 of size , which is purchased at price . After period 0, the capital stock ( ) depreciates
every year ( ) at a declining balance rate . At the same time, the capital stock is increased by new
investments every year,	 , which are purchased at price . The physical capital stock thus
accumulates according to          1              . The net present value of the cash flow associated
with the investment is given by:

                                                          1           1
                                 1                                                         										 11
                                                          1       1

where . is a production function with properties          0,       0, is the price of output, is
the general rate of inflation and is the minimum (normal) real rate of return required by
shareholders (which they could obtain on alternative investments, such as government bonds). The
gross returns to the investment are taxed at the statutory CIT rate . For now, we assume that
financing costs are not tax deductible—reflecting equity-financed investment in most countries.
Moreover, we abstract from personal income tax (PIT) on investment returns or withholding taxes.
Tax depreciation allowances (which are assumed not to be indexed for inflation) are deductible at a
declining balance rate , which may differ from economic depreciation, , where the tax
depreciation rate is constant. The NPV of tax depreciation allowances in terms of the cost of
investment is denoted by and given by:

                                     1                1       1
                                                                          																													 12
                             1           1            1

Parameter generally lies between 0 and 1, since deprecation for tax purposes is not immediate (in
which case we would have        1). Multiplying by the tax rate gives the value of tax depreciation
allowances in terms of tax savings. According to (11),	 effectively reduces the price of investment.

In the remainder, for simplicity, we assume that replacement investment in each period t is just
enough to maintain the capital stock at its initial level, i.e.      so that we can drop time
indices for             . Also, we assume that and increase annually at the general rate of

inflation, . We normalize prices         1 so that we express investment and output in real value
terms. Using the geometric sequence, we can rewrite (11) as

                          1                    1                              1                              1
                                                                                                                 					 13


where              /          is the average pre-tax rate of return on the investment project, net of
economic depreciation. In the absence of taxation (                     0), the NPV of the stream of investments is
proportional to the rate of rate of economic profit (i.e. the rate of return in excess of the normal rate
of return), measured by             .

The profit-maximizing level of investment is at the point where an additional unit of physical capital
yields no further increase in the NPV:


                                           1                       1                  0																 14


Equation (14) can be rewritten in terms of the so-called ‘hurdle’ rate of return, defined as the real
gross (i.e. before-tax) rate of return net of depreciation ( ).8

                                                           1
                                                                                																							 15
                                                            1

In the absence of tax, the hurdle rate equals the normal rate of return, , i.e. where incremental
investment yields no economic profit. Taxation may affect the hurdle rate in (15), but not necessarily
so. For instance, if    1 (i.e. if tax depreciation allowances are 100 percent of investment cost),
taxation is neutral with respect to investment. However, if       1 (the usual case in most countries),
the hurdle rate of return exceeds the normal rate of return, implying that taxation is predicted to
reduce the optimal level of investment.

The marginal effective tax rate (METR) is generally derived from the hurdle rate as follows:


                                                          																																			 16


The METR thus measures the difference (‘tax wedge’) between the hurdle rate and the after-tax
required rate of return r, as a percentage of the hurdle rate. Combining (15) and (16), the METR can
be rewritten as:


8
 The so-called ‘cost of capital’ is closely related to this hurdle rate and is generally defined as the before-tax return
on investment for the project to yield an after-tax rate of return that equals the interest rate plus the rate of
economic depreciation.



                                                                                                                            25

The METR will be positive as long as      1 and      0. In that case, the CIT causes the hurdle rate of
return to rise. Fewer investment projects will then be profitable and investment will decline.

The average effective tax rate (AETR) does not use the optimality condition for investment above,
but rather divides the net present value of total CIT payments of any (profitable) project by the net
present value of (pre-tax) profit for that project:

                                                                                         1
                                                                                                          					 18


The numerator of the second expression in (18) contains two terms. The first term measures the CIT
on economic profit per unit of investment. The second term measures CIT, net of tax depreciation
allowances, on the minimum required normal return, per unit of investment. For projects that earn a
high rate of economic profit, the first term carries a large weight and is important for the AETR. For
projects that generate a low economic profit, the first term is of minor importance and the second
term becomes more important. This second term is similar to the METR in (17).

Expressions (17) and (18) can be used to numerically compute METR and AETR values, by making
assumptions about the rate of inflation, the real interest rate, the rate of economic depreciation, and
by substituting from the tax code the statutory CIT rate and the rate of tax depreciation. For the
AETR, the additional parameter needed is the assumed profitability of the investment. Illustrative
applications are shown in Box 2.

Such calculations can be made for investments that differ with respect to their (economic and tax)
depreciation rates. Moreover, the METR and AETR in (17) and (18) can be easily modified to allow for
the tax deductibility of financing costs—relevant if investment is financed by debt—the inclusion of
PIT on investment returns, or withholding tax rates on FDI. One can also extend the effective tax rate
calculations to allow for cross-border income shifting or various types of investment tax incentives,
as we will show below for the analysis of tax holidays.9




9
  Klemm (2010) extends the AETR framework to include tax incentives, such as tax holidays and time-varying tax
rates. Clark (2010) introduces multinational tax planning strategies, reflecting the fact that standard ETRs may not be
particularly informative about tax incentive effects on investments by MNCs engaging in aggressive tax planning.

The following table shows calculations of marginal and average effective tax rates under alternative tax
regimes. In the basic ETR model, there are two tax parameters – the statutory CIT rate (u), and the tax
depreciation rate (α). In the base case (current tax regime), these rates are 21 and 8 per cent. Base Case A
considers projects with a pre-tax rate of return of 15 per cent. Base Case B considers projects generating a
higher pre tax rate of return (25 per cent). Other non-tax parameters are held constant.

In Regime 1, the CIT rate is lowered to 20 per cent, and tax depreciation is accelerated to a 10 per cent
rate. Both reforms encourage investment, as reflected in lower METR and AETR values. The METR
decreases from roughly 26 to 22 per cent; the AETR decreases from 22 to 20 per cent.

In Regime 2, the CIT rate is unchanged at 21 per cent, but expensing of capital costs is introduced. The
METR is zero implying no tax distortion to scale (marginal investment) decisions. The AETR is also reduced,
implying reduced impediments to locating investment in the country.

In Regime 3, the CIT rate is lowered to 20 per cent (as in Regime 1), but tax depreciation is reduced to 6
per cent. The net effect is a higher METR, implying reduced investment. The AETR is unchanged, compared
to Base Case A. The latter result is sensitive to the rate of pre-tax profit.

Base Case B considers projects earning a pre-tax rate of return of 25 per cent (versus 15 per cent in Base
Case A). Introducing Regime 3 lowers the AETR, compared to Base Case B. While less generous tax
depreciation puts upward pressure on the AETR, this is more than offset by the reduced rate CIT on the
more significant economic profit (compared to Base Case A).

B. Use in Policy Analysis
ETRs are an important tool for policy analysis in many countries, including developing countries. For
instance, by varying tax parameters—including tax incentives—ETRs shed light on how complex tax
reforms are expected to influence investment. This includes also the variable impact of taxation on
investment in different asset types or by alternative sources of finance. ETRs can be used to infer
trends over time or to provide international comparisons of tax systems. ETRs are routinely used in
technical assistance by the IMF and World Bank to explore the impact of policy reforms on
investment incentives.

ETRs are often used as indicators of “international competitiveness” of tax systems. For example,
Table 6 shows, besides statutory CIT rates, average METRs and AETRs in G20 countries in 2012, as
computed by the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation (Bilicka and Devereux, 2012).10 The
average METRs and AETRs are computed as weighted averages for different types of assets and
different sources of finance. In particular, the calculations assume that one quarter of investment is
in the form of plant and machinery, another quarter in buildings, around 10 percent in intangible
assets, and 40 percent is in inventories. Moreover, 35 percent of investment is assumed to be
financed by debt, while the remainder is financed by equity. From Table 6, we observe that statutory
CIT rates range from 20 percent in Russia and Saudi Arabia to almost 41 percent in Japan. The range
of AETRs is similarly large, between 16.7 and 36 percent. The METRs range from −10 percent in Italy
to 27 percent in Argentina and Japan.11

A recent study by Chen and Mintz (2013) computes METRs for as many as 90 countries across the
globe—again as a weighted average of METRs for different sectors and sources of finance. Their
calculations, shown in Figure 3, indicate large cross-country differences in tax distortions at the
margin of new investment. Figure 4 shows how effective tax rates can shed light on the impact of
tax incentives for investment. For 15 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, it compares the AETR in the
absence of tax incentives with that under alternative incentive policies, showing that investments in
high-technology sectors or in specific geographic areas result in the lowest effective tax burdens.

ETR analysis is routinely used by academics, policy think-tanks, IOs and governments (notably
Ministries of Finance) to analyze the impact on investment of tax policy, including reform of tax
incentive policies. A main attraction is the limited informational requirement, as the values of the
parameters entering ETR formulae are determined by tax policy. In other words, the input to ETR
models is found in tax laws and tax regulations. For Ministries of Finance in developing countries
wishing to implement ETR models in their tool-kit, some technical assistance may be required to
adapt the general ETR formulae to capture country-specific tax policies.




10
  The European Commission publishes ETRs every year as part of its annual publication “Taxation Trends in the
European Union”.
11
   Several countries have changed their rates since 2012. E.g. Japan reduced its statutory rate stepwise to a current
level of 33 percent.

C. Tax Holidays
As Figure 4 makes clear, ETR analysis can be extended to include tax incentives, such as those
discussed in the main body of the paper. To illustrate this, we extend ETR expressions above to
include tax holidays for a limited duration. In that case, the NPV of the cash flow associated with the
investment at     0 is:

                                                                1                 1
                                                                                               										 19
                                     1                                  1

where       0 is the length of the tax holiday period. From this, the METR and AETR can be derived
along the lines above. Yet, they will now depend on , reflecting the remaining number of holiday
years:

                                             1

where d       1/ 1 r      for H 1. This time-variant indicator effectively determines the relevant tax
rate applying to investment in each year of the holiday period. Figure 5 shows METRs and AETRs
assuming a 20 year tax holiday, expressed in each of the 20 years of its remaining duration. In the
first year, with 20 years of holiday remaining, the METR and AETR are small but positive, close to 5
percent, reflecting future tax on the investment returns accruing after the 20-year holiday period.
Over time, the ETRs gradually increase since an increasing fraction of the future returns to the
investment will become subject to tax as the remaining holiday period gets shorter. After expiry of
the tax holiday, the standard ETRs apply with no incentive. In that year, the METR and AETR are 20
and 26 per cent, respectively. Interestingly, the METR and AETR exceed this level in the years just
before expiry: this holds for the METR for investments after the first 14 years of the holiday and the
AETR after 18 years. Hence, the tax holiday discourages the firm to invest during these years, relative
to the case with the normal tax regime. The reason is that, for investments in these years just before
expiration of the holiday, the firm is unable to claim depreciation allowances. This increases in the
CIT burden, an effect that more than offsets the CIT exemption for profits in these years.12

   This finding was first reported by Mintz (1990). Klemm (2010) shows how the relative attractiveness of tax holidays,
compared to investment allowances and reduced tax rates changes over time and depends on expected profitability.

DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF GOVERNANCE
This section discusses two templates that can be used to assess transparency and governance
practices in relation to tax incentives in LICs.

A. Ten Principles to Promote Better Management and Administration
The OECD’s Task Force on Tax and Development has pressed for a more effective global
transparency framework for tax incentives for investment—the purpose of which is to promote
transparency in decision-making processes, increase the information available on costs and benefits,
limit discretion and increase accountability. This led to the development of a set of principles to
promote the management and administration of tax incentives for investment in a transparent and
consistent manner (OECD, 2013).

1. Make public a statement of all tax incentives for investment and their objectives within a governing
   framework.

Tax incentives should only be granted in accordance with a comprehensive policy, which lays down
principles and policy objectives for the introduction or continuation of a tax incentive. Governments
should provide a justification for tax incentives (e.g. regional/territorial development, employment
creation) with the expected costs and intended benefits. This should be communicated publicly
through a regularly updated statement. Such a statement provides the basis for the assessment of
the performance of tax incentives, any overlap and duplication and allows for governments to be
held accountable for the tax incentives they have granted.

2. Provide tax incentives for investment through tax laws only.

Tax incentives for investment are currently provided through tax laws (e.g., income tax law), but in
many cases are also provided by laws governing investment, Special Economic Zones, etc. and in
other cases, through decrees, agreements and regulations. As a result their true extent may be
hidden. All tax incentives provided, along with their eligibility criteria, should be consolidated and
publicised in the main body of tax law. Bringing tax incentives into the tax laws (or mirrored in the
tax laws) increases transparency and may empower the tax administration to administer them. Those
tax incentives that are used should be as simple as possible to both apply for and administer.

3. Consolidate all tax incentives for investment under the authority of one government body, where
   possible.

All tax incentives should be placed under the authority of one government body, ideally the Ministry
of Finance. Currently, the granting and administration of tax incentives may be the responsibility of
finance, trade, investment or other ministries, increasing the risk of corruption and rent seeking.
Consolidating them under a single body increases transparency, helps to avoid unintended overlap
and inconsistencies in incentive policies, limits discretionary power and enables policy makers to
address problems that may arise with the governance of tax incentives. In countries where the


32
                         TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



granting and administration of tax incentives is decentralised and/or carried out by both the central
and sub-national governments, to the extent possible, various levels of government should
coordinate to maximize the efficiency and transparency of their efforts.

4. Ensure tax incentives for investment are ratified through the law making body or parliament.

Tax incentives provided through executive decrees or agreements when not scrutinized by the law
making body do not provide sufficient transparency in their granting and operation. Parliamentary
oversight, or its equivalent, is fundamental to transparency and accountability in the governance of
tax incentives. This ensures incentives are subject to scrutiny on their intended purpose and their
costs as well as benefits to the country.

5. Administer tax incentives for investment in a transparent manner.

Once provisions have been enacted in the relevant tax laws and regulations, tax incentives may be
claimed by a taxpayer by meeting the necessary conditions as prescribed, without negotiating with
any granting authority, except as provided for under the relevant tax laws. A minimum necessary
condition to be met by taxpayers in the case of a tax incentive should be the requirement to file a
tax return in the case of VAT and Income Tax, and in the case of other taxes a statement detailing
the duty or other exemptions availed in the prescribed period. In addition to enhancing
transparency, such taxpayer information contributes to data for determining the efficiency and
equity of tax incentives. Tax authorities should also periodically carry out audits of cases where tax
incentives have been claimed to ensure that they are not misused.

6. Calculate the amount of revenue forgone attributable to tax incentives for investment and publicly
   release a statement of tax expenditures.

The amount of revenue loss attributable to tax incentives should be reported regularly, ideally as
part of an annual Tax Expenditures Report (covering all main tax incentives). While cash expenditure
budgets are usually scrutinised on a yearly basis, the revenue cost of tax incentives is hidden when
estimates of revenues forgone are not calculated and reported. Embedding estimates of revenues
forgone by tax incentives in the yearly budget process provides policy makers with the required
inputs on a timely basis to inform policy decisions. It also supports medium term fiscal planning as
what seems like a small amount of foregone revenue in good fiscal times may become quite high
during periods of fiscal strain. The calculation of revenue forgone should recognise that the benefits
of some investments, mineral extraction, for example, may take many years to realise so losses
should be assessed over the life of the business concerned.

7. Carry out periodic review of the continuance of existing tax incentives by assessing the extent to
   which they meet the stated objectives.

Once granted tax incentives usually remain in laws unless revoked or introduced with a ‘sunset
clause’. Hence there is a need to assess performance on a regular basis. Performance reviews may
be conducted once every few years and would include the costs as well as the benefits of the tax


                                                                                                        33
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—TOOLS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF TAX INCENTIVES



incentive and if it has met its intended goals. The results of such periodic reviews would inform
decision-making around the continuation or removal of individual tax incentives. The review criteria
and results should be reported publicly. To the extent possible, behavioural responses, both good
(e.g., additional incremental investment) and bad (e.g., aggressive tax planning) should be tracked
and communicated.

8. Highlight the largest beneficiaries of tax incentives for investment by specific tax provision in a
   regular statement of tax expenditures, where possible.

It may be possible that a few investors, or sectors, benefit from most tax expenditures. The tax
expenditure statement should have sufficient detail to enable policy makers to identify which sectors
benefit from specific tax provisions and, where this is compatible with the requirement of laws and
regulations governing taxpayer confidentiality, authorities may wish to consider detailing the major
beneficiaries and the amount by which they benefit from tax incentives. Making such information
public can enhance the legitimacy of governments and their revenue authorities in the eyes of
citizens which in turn can enhance compliance more broadly.

9. Collect data systematically to underpin the statement of tax expenditures for investment and to
   monitor the overall effects and effectiveness of individual tax incentives.

Analysis of tax incentives is data intensive – required for public statements, budgeting, periodic
reviews, tracking of behavioural responses by business, etc. There is a need for the periodic
collection of taxpayer data and on-going analysis of these data by revenue authorities. This may
require introducing mechanisms to do so in some countries.

10. Enhance regional cooperation to avoid harmful tax competition.

In many cases tax incentives are provided in response to what neighbouring countries and
competitors are offering or perceived to be offering. Hence the issue of tax incentives cannot be
tackled in isolation. Governments can work together on a regional basis to increase cooperation in
the area of tax to avoid a race to the bottom when they provide competing tax incentives. Efforts to
enhance regional cooperation should also cover the use of non-tax instruments e.g., cash subsidies
and loan guarantees, which also provide incentives for investment.

B. Benchmarking Investment Incentives
The World Bank Group has developed a template to assess tax incentives for investment in countries
around the world, in four dimensions: i) the rule of law; ii) transparency; iii) efficient administration;
iv) incentive reviews. This subsection discusses the most recent version of the template, which is
dynamic in the sense that it is continuously being updated on-line.

Rule of law

The issues here are that i) fiscal incentives should be provided through tax laws only; and ii)
ratification of fiscal incentives policies should be through a law-making body / parliament.

Issues here include the public availability of laws and regulations related to investment incentives,
publication of a list of incentives, public statement of principles and policy objectives underpinning
incentives regime and disclosure of the largest beneficiaries of investment incentives.
