 The Global Environment Facility (GEF) brings together in partnership 183 countries with multilateral institutions, civil
 society organizations (CSOs) and the private sector to address global environmental issues that also support national
 sustainable development initiatives. The GEF provides grant funding for activities that target issues surrounding
 biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer, and persistent organic
 pollutants. Since 1991, the GEF has disbursed $11.5 billion in grants, which has leveraged $57 billion in co-financing,
 for over 3,215 projects in more than 165 countries. [http://www.thegef.org/gef/]

companies receive training, incentive packages that
include price rebates on the purchase of “green”
technologies such as improved tires, enhanced
aerodynamics, and driver behavior diagnostic
systems, as well as performance-based awards to
help defer purchase, installation and monitoring costs.

                                                                                                                             21
is dedicated to forests and pastures, and many
Albanians rely on these resources for their livelihoods.
Over several generations, socio-economic pressures,
unsustainable practices and weak enforcement
of laws and regulations led to overuse of natural
resources. Relying on wood for fuel, illegal logging,
uncontrolled harvesting and overgrazing of forests
and pastures, as well as poor forest management has
left a legacy of considerable land and forest degrada-
tion, compounded by significant soil erosion.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, a number of initiatives
were implemented to help reverse this trend. A
World Bank IDA credit, complemented by Italian and
Swiss funding, supported preparation of a natural
resource management strategy that was piloted in
30 communes, and established a participatory plan-
ning platform that empowered local communities to
participate effectively in land restoration measures
by supporting the transfer of user rights and for-
est and pasture management from Government to
the level of the communities. The Albania Natural
Resources Development Project (NRDP), supported
by a further IDA credit blended with a GEF grant,
extended the communal participatory forest and
pasture management approach to 251 communes,

     Adaptation to Climate Change in the
     Andean Countries

     Climate change has been linked to the acceler-
     ated retreat of tropical glaciers in the Andes and to
     increased weather variability and extremes affect-
     ing the Andean ecosystems. Tropical glaciers play a
     critical role in regulating water supply to associated
     watersheds, making runoff from glaciated basins
     essential for the regional water budget and the integ-
     rity of mountain ecosystems. Even during droughts

from fish legally captured each year in the region’s
waters. However, illegal trawling, often by foreign ships
has a punishing effect on local economies: it damages
the nets and boats of villagers, destroys the seabed
breeding grounds of many fish, depletes regional
fish stocks and, robs the countries of wealth gener-
ated from their fisheries. Yet regional governments
often lack effective tools to combat poaching. Better
enforcement of existing policies and stronger regula-
tions to effectively manage marine fish resources are
needed. Another challenge is that coastal communi-
ties in general, lack basic port and processing infra-
structure that allow for industrial vessels to land and
process fish locally. Taken together these constraints
contribute to slow regional development.

The West Africa Regional Fisheries Program (WARFP)
Project is successfully piloting a model for sustainable
harvesting one of the largest natural resources in
Africa. The project, which is currently implemented
in six countries across West Africa — Cape Verde,
Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone and
Senegal — is funded by IDA resources complemented
by GEF grants. The project directly supports
     SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA


     The program is similar for each country, and is based
     on four components: good governance of fisheries,
     reduction of illegal fishing, increased contribution of
     fish resources to local economies, and regional coor-
     dination. The GEF-funded portion supports develop-
     ment of new policies, laws and relevant institutions for
     rights-based fisheries, institutes a program of regis-
     tration and licensing of all fishing vessels, empowers
     communities to effectively manage resources, and pro-
     vides training and access to micro-finance for transi-
     tion to alternative livelihoods in zones of overexploited
     fisheries. Country-level activities are tailored to the
     individual needs of each country, while best practices
     and common goals are shared amongst the countries.

     The Sub-Regional Commission on Fisheries (CSRP)
     of West Africa implements the project, which ensures
     client buy-in and helps harmonize the long-term poli-
     cies of each country with the program.

     At the national level, the WARFP team works closely
     with ministries of fisheries to support legislation that
     increases illegal fishing surveillance, supports conser-    Fighting against wildlife poaching
     vation and protects the rights of artisanal fishermen       and illegal trade in Africa

     Sustainable Natural Resource Management and
     Resilient Landscapes in Ethiopia (under SAWAP)

     Ethiopia’s diverse production landscapes and
     natural resources provide a range of resources to
     its rural poor including, fresh water, crops, timber
     and firewood. However, these natural resources and
     landscapes are increasingly subject to persistent
     land degradation that damages the hydrologic
     cycle, reduces the availability of forest products, and
     reduces agricultural productivity. The cost of land
     degradation in Ethiopia is estimated to be at least
     2–3 percent of agricultural GDP. Enhanced sustain-
     able management of natural resources and land-
     scapes can help support prosperity and contribute
     to poverty reduction.                                     introduction of best-fit and tested sustainable land
