I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Uzbekistan perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Uzbekistan
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Uzbekistan
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From January to March 2016, 303 stakeholders of the WBG in Uzbekistan were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation
agencies; Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 156 stakeholders participated in
the survey (52% response rate).

Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier or email; other
respondents completed the survey with the presence of a representative of the independent
fielding agency. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Uzbekistan; their overall
attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work
and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Uzbekistan; and the WBG’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 58%, N=147). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix D (page 92).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with respondents from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community
       based organizations, private foundations, and youth groups were combined in the “CSO”
       category; and few respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister, local
       government, independent government institutions, and other organizations were included
       in the “Other” category. There were no respondents from the office of a minister, the
       office of a parliamentarian, the judiciary branch, trade unions, and faith-based groups.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey and the FY’13 Country
        Survey had statistically similar levels of familiarity with the WBG (weighted mean in
        FY’16 = 6.4; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.2)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Uzbekistan, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Uzbekistan and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

IV. General Issues Facing Uzbekistan
Headed in the Right Direction2
       Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, most respondents across
        stakeholder groups indicated that Uzbekistan is headed in the right direction, whereas
        respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies were least positive about the prospect of
        Uzbekistan.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey indicated that
       they most often attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to that “the
       World Bank is not sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground” (42%).
      Stakeholder groups: Among this year’s respondents, consultants working on WBG
       projects and respondents from PMUs were significantly more likely to attribute failed or
       slow WBG assisted reform efforts to that “the World Bank Group is not sensitive enough
       to political/social realities on the ground” compared to respondents from other
       stakeholder groups.

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents from PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects
       had the highest mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator
       questions, whereas respondents from CSOs and academia/research institutes/think tanks
       had significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by
       stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 65).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Uzbekistan,
bivariate correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty four
specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Uzbekistan. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at energy and energy efficiency; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agriculture and rural development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Uzbekistan, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at economic growth;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agriculture and rural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction.

                            World Bank Group Country Survey FY16 – Uzbekistan


The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Uzbekistan or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Uzbekistan, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop
more effective strategies that support development in Uzbekistan.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, I FC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you
prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank. If you feel that you do not have an adequate amount of
information on a subject, please check “Don’t know”.

PLEASE NOTE: IN SOME CASES THE SURVEY WILL ASK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF
RESPONSES. PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE ANY MORE THAN REQUESTED. IF MORE
RESPONSES ARE CHOSEN, DATA CANNOT BE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS.
