This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the botto m of the ranking on the

      Request and obtain a construction license

      The Municipality of Guatemala City introduced a new Land
      Management Plan (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial- “POT”) as
      of January 7, 2009, and new building control regulations that
      also regulate the construction permit issuance. According to the
      new POT of Guatemala City the land use classifications were
      changed based on the principles of sustainability, certainty, and
      better quality of life. In the old system the land was divided into
      industrial, residential, and commercial zones, whereas the new        14 days      GTQ 70,232

      zoning regimes are established according to general use of land
      which among others introduced mixed use of zoning regimes.
      This tool was developed in consultation with both private and
      public sector and widely publicized. It also introduces a more
      sophisticated risk-based system of approval of construction
      permits.

      Before, the application had only one process of approval,
      whereby the application would be classified as complete and
      compliant with all requirements. This led to the issuance of
Doing Business 2017                     Guatemala                                                         32

                                                                             Time to

                                                                            complete
      construction permit. However, if incomplete it would need to be
      corrected.

      Under the new implementing regulations of POT this mechanism
      is based on three stages: Simplified Procedure (Precedimiento
      Directo); Approval of Land Management Council (Junta de
      Ordenamiento Territorial); Approval of Land Management
      Council and Neighbours’ Consent. Each phase is triggered if the
      previous phase is not complied with.

      BuildCo's case would fall into the ‘Simplified Procedure' scheme
      and does not require the subsequent procedure with Land
      Management Council and neighbors. Under this scheme if all
      requirements established in the regulations are satisfactory and
      complied with, the application would be approved in 10 working
      days.

       As of February 28, 2009 out of 580 applications for a new

      40% of cases underwent the simplified procedure and was
      approved within this time-limit. This procedure is administered
      under a newly operationalized single window principle.
      Additionally, the application forms have been substantially
      simplified and reduced in volume from 27 pages to 3 pages.

      BuildCo must submit the corresponding form with all the
      requested specifics, together with all the requirements in the
      previous procedures, photocopies of the identification cards of
      its legal agent and the professional responsible for the
      construction, and a photocopy of the latest Single Real Estate
      Tax (Impuesto Unico sobre Inmueble) receipt and any other
      required receipts. An architect or engineer must be responsible
      for the construction work, signing the submitted form and the
      plans.

      Receive final inspection and obtain occupancy permit

      According to Article 78, upon completion of the construction
      work, the interested parties shall request a final inspection from
      the Construction Licensing Department. This request can now be
      done at the one-stop shop. This inspection shall be performed
      by the supervisor in charge, who shall record the result on an
      inspection card. If the building does not comply with approved
      specifications, the card must state the reasons and the
      appropriate remedies. If all aspects are in order and the card
      expressly states so, after the return of the respective license, the
      interested parties may request the building occupancy permit
      from the head of the office by completing the form stated in
      Annex 1 of the Regulation.                                               14 days       no charge

      If no objections are raised during the inspection (meaning that
      every part of the construction is authorized as complying with
      the plans submitted to the Construction Licensing Department),
      the professional in charge of the inspection may immediately go
      back to the office and issue the occupancy permit to be
      delivered to BuildCo. After that, BuildCo will be refunded its
      deposit of 0.01% of warehouse value that was paid at the stage
      of building permit approval.

      Request water and sewage connection and receive

      Once the construction is finalized, BuildCo must fill out the
      application at the one-stop shop and receive the requirements
      from the Water and Sewerage Authority (Empresa Municipal de
      Agua, EMPAGUA). EMPAGUA will notify BuildCo of the fee to be
      paid as a deposit to cover the completion of the procedure and a
      service feasibility study that must be carried out by EMPAGUA.
      EMPAGUA will start the feasibility study within about 15 days.            1 day        no charge

      In 2007 the Municipality of Guatemala unified the application
      forms and relevant requirements for EMPAGUA, Department of
      Urban Construction Control (Departamento de Control de
      Construcción Urbana) and Infrastructure Directorate (Dirección
      de Infraestructura).

      Another change is that the approvals from all these entities are
      given simultaneously. However, this has not had any practical
      impact on the ground.

        feasibility or nonfeasibility and the steps to be taken by BuildCo
        for EMPAGUA to make the necessary hook-up connections.
        Upon completion of the feasibility study, EMPAGUA notifies the

        Since it is a company that requests the service, it is required to present a
        copy of a legal representation document, local identity card (ID) of the
        legal representative, proof of ownership of the property or lease
        contract, list of technical data of the load required and the guarantee
        deposit which is refunded when the customer no longer requires the
        service of power supply (according to the General Electricity Law). Legal
        Representation documents and the lease contracts require notarization.
        Only a day passes from presenting the application to the signing the

        There is no cost for the customer, therefore there is no need to submit a
        budget or pay a fee again.

        With the application for electricity the customer must send a guarantee
        deposit that is refunded when the customer no longer requires the
        service of power supply (according to the General Electricity Law). For
        loads above 100 kW, the deposit is not paid in cash but is covered by a
        bond issued by a guarantee agency in Guatemala.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       and the cadastral value certificate ("Valor de matricula")

       The seller obtains a certificate at the Property Registry in which the buyer
       can verify that the property is free from mortgages and encumbrances,
       and to verify that the property is owned by the seller. In order to obtain
       the certificate the buyer needs to know the registry numbers where the
       property is registered. Usually this information is provided by the seller.
       It is usually the lawyer who verifies the books at the registry and obtains
       this information. This updated certificate of the property will be used
       later by the lawyer/notary to prepare the public deed.

      The public deed is delivered to the Property Registry for its recording
      under the name of the buyer. It is also advisable to obtain a certificate at
      the Property Registry to verify that the change of ownership is properly
      recorded after registration is completed.
      The internal procedures conducted by the Property Registry are as
      follows:
      (1) All incoming cases are scanned and then assigned to the officials
      (operadores). Since 2005, an electronic system is fully implemented to
      randomly assign cases to the officials.                                                            QTG 160 + 0.15%

      (4) The Registrar or auxiliary registrars approve and sign the registration
      certificate. With Decree 42-2006, electronic signatures from auxiliary
      registrars are legally valid. Each one is assigned a unique number by
      which they can electronically sign, facilitating the registration process.

      Notify the Municipality of the transaction

      Once the transaction is concluded the notary notifies the Municipality of
      the change in ownership. Sometimes this information is not updated, so
      in order to register the transaction it is mandatory to update prior
      information.
      This step is important to update the cadastral value of the property for

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                   A foreclosure would probably be the most likely procedure to apply, based on
                                    the Civil Procedure code, the Commercial Code and Decree 107 (Art. 294). In
                                   general, collective insolvency proceedings are less frequent than foreclosures

                                    The foreclosure proceeding would start with the creditor filing a claim before
Proceeding      foreclosure
                                    the court for the enforcement of the sale of the property used as a collateral.
                                    The debtor will have the opportunity to counter-claim. After that an approval
                                   to initiate foreclosure will be handed down by the Court and an order to set up
                                    an auction will be issued. Once the time allocated by law for appeal lapses an
                                        auction would take place and the sale of debtor’s real estate will occur.


                                    Because of the sale of the property through a public auction, the hotel won’t

                                        be able to continue operating and its assets will be sold piecemeal.

                                The foreclosure proceeding will take approximately 3 years in Guatemala from
                               the moment of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor.
                                 It will take 1.5 years until the approval to initiate foreclosure is handed down

years)                           After that stage, it will take 1 year for the auction to take place (including the
                               necessary time to appoint an auctioneer, the scheduling of the auction and the
                               sale of the real estate). It will take additional 6 months for the judge to approve
                                                            the sale and have it registered.

                                      The cost for a foreclosure proceeding as described above would amount
                                   approximately to 15% of the value of Mirage’s estate. The main component of
                                   this expenditure would be the attorney’s fees, which would amount 8% of the
                                     value of Mirage’s estate. The rest would be the costs of the custodian and
                                   property appraisal which would amount to 5% of the value of Mirage’s estate.
                                          The rest of the cost would be judicial and notification expenses.

assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
