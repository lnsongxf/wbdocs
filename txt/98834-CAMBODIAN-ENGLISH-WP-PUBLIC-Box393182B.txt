A More Detailed Roadmap for Cambodian Rice Exports was prepared by consultants
Tom Slayton, who has followed the world rice market for 35 years, and Sok
Muniroth, a close observer of the Cambodia’s agriculture sector.

Overall direction and guidance for analyzes was provided by Alassane Saw (country
manager, World Bank) and Paavo Eliste (senior agricultural economist, World Bank)

Valuable comments and support was received from Brett Ballard (advisor, Australian
Aid) and Tim Purcell (Agricultural Development Inc).

The report research was conducted May 19 – June 7, 2011, and expands upon “A
Road Map for Cambodian Rice Exports," World Bank working paper from June 2009.

This report was commissioned by World Bank and the AusAID under the Cambodia
Food Crisis Capacity Support Partnership (FCCSP) Trust Fund, funded by AusAID.

The FCCSP is a joint AusAID - World Bank initiative to support Royal Government
of Cambodia and stakeholders to address the constraints in smallholder agriculture
and social protection that have been identified in the context of the food and financial
crises.

     ៨. ដោយសារតែទំហំរបស់រោងម៉ាស៊ីនកិនស្រូវនីមួយៗ
         ប្រទេសកម្ពុជាធ្វើការនាំចេញអង្ករ តែ តាមកុងទីន័រប៉ុណ្ណោះ។

Executive Summary
Cambodia’s rice export highly dependent on the European Union due
to tax exemption


Cambodia's rice exports are on a steep upward trajectory, benefiting from import
duty preferences and new investments in rice mills and polishing factories. Exports
averaged less than 6,000 tons between 2004 and 2008. In 2009, the European Union
opened its market to duty-free and quota-free rice exports from Cambodia with the
“Everything but Arms” (EBA) trade agreement. As a result, the country’s exports
jumped to over 51,000 tons in 2010. Since then, the rice exports to the EU have grown
significantly, and are estimated to reach 175,000 tons in 2011. The EU exports are
evenly split between fragrant and non-fragrant rice. A vast majority (90%) of
Cambodia’s rice exports is shipped to the EU and Russia, which is another market
providing duty free access to Cambodia’s rice. Russia is buying mostly non-fragrant
rice.

Cambodia’s major export competitors are Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand is a
main competitor for fragrant rice, exporting itself ca 2.65 million tons of aromatic rice
(including brokens) in 2010/2011. Vietnam is the principal competitor for the non-
aromatic white rice markets such as the Philippines and Indonesia. Pakistan and Burma
are competing with Cambodia for low-grade white rice markets mainly in Africa.


Inefficiencies in logistics and export procedures keep rice prices too
high to enter new export markets in Asia


Cambodia’s prices for non-aromatic milled rice are increasingly out of
competition with its neighbors. While Cambodia has significantly cheaper production
costs than Thailand and Vietnam,2 higher milling costs and margins render its ex-mill
prices uncompetitive. This is further exacerbated by high domestic transport costs (both
formal and informal), expensive and time consuming export procedures and port
charges, and less competitive overseas freight costs. As a result, Cambodian rice is
unattractive to overseas buyers given that Cambodia has not established itself as a
reliable supplier yet.

 Wholesale harvest prices for fragrant paddy in northwest Cambodia were $305/ton in December 2010
(Riels 1,250/kg), while they averaged almost $445 in N.E. Thailand. Similarly, wholesale prices for IR
paddy in the eastern provinces averaged $237/ton in March 2011 (Riels 970/kg) compared to $263/ton
(VD 5,490/kg) in Vietnam's Mekong River Delta. Cambodian prices from provincial rice millers in
Battambang and Prey Veng, Thai values from USDA/Bangkok, and Vietnamese prices from Viet Food
Cambodia needs to export both fragrant and non-fragrant rice to achieve its export goals. Association.


                                                xvii
Cambodian fragrant rice (5% broken) is quoted at $950 as of June 2011 while the
fragrant rice from Vietnam is available at $600. Rice in Vietnam is cheaper
primarily because their milling and transportation costs are nearly half of those in
Cambodia. This dims down Cambodia’s potential to sell its non-fragrant rice to Asian
markets like Indonesia, the Philippines or China. Although the government buyers in
both Jakarta and Manila are interested in diversifying their purchases and include rice
from Cambodia, they won’t buy until the prices and quality are comparable to those in
Vietnam or Thailand. Thai producers’ Hom Mali is quoted slightly higher than
Cambodian rice, but it has very high brand recognition and stable market share
regardless higher price.


More investments are needed in milling, transport and export sectors
to increase competitiveness of Cambodia’s rice export


Cambodia has reduced its milling costs but more needs to be done to improve
competitiveness of its rice export. Milling costs are being reduced at factories that are
installing rice husk gasifiers which convert the rice husks to fuel and slash diesel costs
by up to 75% or save almost $15/ton. Cambodia also needs to encourage the adoption
of this cost-cutting technology by extending credit to rice mills and promoting private
sector investments in new storage infrastructure, which would be a good bases for
collateral based financing.


Larger rice mills and polishing factories are needed to facilitate break bulk
shipments. While there has been a doubling in the milling capacity of relatively large
modern rice mills in the last two years, more investments are needed to improve the
quality and capacity of mills. To encourage such investments, the government should
provide tax holidays etc for qualifying investments.

Exporters would benefit from quicker and cheaper export procedures. Although
there have been significant improvements, the Cambodia’s export documentation
process remains complicated and informal costs unacceptably high. The government
needs to further remove bureaucratic hurdles and lower expenses by inter alia setting up
"single stop service" offices.


The government needs to intensify its export facilitation efforts to increase its rice
exports. The capacity of Cambodia’s logistics system from mills to ports is inadequate
to accommodate large-scale volumes. All of Cambodia’s rice exports are shipped in
containers from Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville ports. Unless the government obtains a
transit access to Saigon Port via the Mekong River for uncontainerized milled rice, it is
unlikely that Cambodia will export even 500,000 tons by 2015.




                                         xviii
Cambodia needs to export both fragrant and non-fragrant rice at
lower prices to achieve its export goals


Cambodia has set a rice export goal of 1 million tons of milled rice in 2015, which
will require exporting both aromatic and non -fragrant rice. Outside of the E.U. and
Russia, the brightest export prospects in the near term are for the fragrant rice. The
Philippines, for example, is the world’ largest buyer of 25% broken rice, a quality that
Cambodia can produce. Therefore increasing export of aromatic rice should be the first
focus of the government of Cambodia. The export target of 1 million tons cannot be
reached by exporting only fragrant rice given the finite size of that market (less than 3
million tons) and popularity of Thai Hom Mali.


Private sector members of the Rice Technical Working Group should form a
advisory group for the government. The working groups should gather
representatives of the five largest rice exporters and meet every quarter to advise the
government in identifying ongoing hurdles and overcoming problems as they arise.
Membership of the group should be selected from companies based on their recent
export volumes as recorded by either Camcontrol or GDCE.


Key Findings


   1. Given the size of the different segments of the world rice market, Cambodia
      cannot reach its 1.0 million ton export goal without exporting both fragrant and
      non-fragrant rice.

   2. Thailand is Cambodia's principal competitor for fragrant rice, while Vietnam is
      the key competitor for non-fragrant rice.

   3. Cambodia has significantly cheaper production costs than Thailand and
      Vietnam, but its prices for non-aromatic milled rice become increasingly
      uncompetitive ex-mill, FOB the port, and delivered to the overseas destination.

   4. The rapid growth in exports since 2009 is due to import duty preferences
      granted by the E.U. and, to a lesser extent, Russia. Lower prices will be needed
      to penetrate other key markets such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and China.

   5. While there has been a significant improvement during 2011 in the turn-around
      time involved in getting documents approved, Cambodian export procedures
      remain highly bureaucratic and informal costs unacceptably high. Combined
      formal and informal costs add $17/ton to FOB prices.

   6. The government should promote wider adoption of rice husk burning equipment
      that can reduce milling costs by 70%, almost $15/ton.


                                          xix
    7. Uncompetitive local and international freight costs and high port charges can be
       "solved" by negotiating transit agreements with Vietnam and Thailand. An
       existing pact with Vietnam provides a framework for the barging of
       uncontainerized milled rice down the Mekong River to waiting break bulk
       vessels. A bilateral agreement between Thailand and Laos, which allows the
       latter to use Thai ports, could be copied.

    8. Because of the size of the individual mills, Cambodia only exports rice via
       containers. The exclusive reliance on containers could result in exports stalling
       at about 250,000 tons per year. This is due to domestic logistical constraints and
       because major importers in West Africa, the Philippines, and Indonesia
       primarily import rice carried on break bulk vessels. The proposed bilateral
       transit accords provide a "work around" to these twin hurdles.

    9. Depth limitations currently preclude larger vessels from loading in
       Sihanoukville.

Recommendations: Time is of the Essence

1.A viable road map to increase Cambodia’s exports should take into account the
realities of where the surplus is located, its composition by type of rice, and the
competitiveness of the different varieties.3
    •   Cambodia’s exportable surplus can be divided into aromatic, native non-
        aromatic, and IRRI varieties. The aromatic production is centered in the
        northwestern provinces that border Thailand, while the IRRI varieties are grown
        during the dry season in southeastern Cambodia in the provinces bordering
        Vietnam.
    •   In the ten months since the ambitious 1 million ton export target was
        established, only limited progress has been made in grappling with the complex,
        inter-related issues, which hamper Cambodia’s competitiveness of rice exports.
    •   If the government desires to quickly replace a significant share of the paddy
        leaking into Thailand and Vietnam with formal exports of milled rice, it is
        suggested that proposed measures are considered as a package.
    •   The planned rehabilitation of the railroads and the modernization of Phnom
        Penh and Sihanoukville ports are medium-term remedies, which will only
        partially alleviate the Kingdom’s high logistics costs and bottlenecks. According
        to several key exporters, these hurdles could result in Cambodia’s exports
        stalling at less than 250,000 tons. Even with urgent and concerted efforts,
        exports may only reach half of the export target by 2015 – albeit still a
        significant achievement.



3
  This makes its imperative that MAFF begin to monitor the breakdown of the rice crop area and
production by type.


                                             xx
2. The Cambodian government should give its highest priority to getting
Vietnam’s agreement to allow the barging of uncontainerized milled rice down the
Mekong River as a transit good to waiting conventional vessels in Saigon Port.

    •    This would help to overcome the current problem that even Cambodia’s largest
         mills are too small to individually supply coastal vessels carrying 5,000 tons on
         a timely basis.
    •    Initial shipments could be made on barges carrying 250 tons to 1,000 tons where
         they could be combined on the waiting ships with much larger tonnages of
         Vietnamese rice.
    •    As the size and sophistication of Cambodia’s rice milling, processing, and
         exporting sector grows, the size of the export sales could be gradually increased
         until it reaches the point where entire vessels of Cambodian rice are loaded. This
         “solution” lowers both Cambodian transport and export costs not only for rice,
         but also for other Cambodian exports.
    •    Also, it ensures that competitive FOB mill milled rice prices remain that way on
         a CNF basis.

3. Encourage private investments in larger mills and rice polishing factories with
capacities of at least 30 tons/hr4 by providing up a tax holiday up to five years for
qualifying foreign and domestic firms.
    •    These facilities offer the best opportunity for increasing rice exports in the near-
         term.
    •    The government could use its tax incentives to encourage overseas or domestic
         investments in the milling sector, which are able to meet export requirements.

4. The government would need to further remove bureaucratic hurdles and lower
export processing expenses although considerable progress has been made in the
last year in reducing the turnaround times for issuing Camcontrol, SPS, and
customs certificates.
    •    This could be achieved through expansion of the “single stop service” for export
         approvals in order to minimize the time currently spent getting documents
         approved.
    •    It is suggested that centralized “single stop service” offices be opened in
         addition to Phnom Penh, also in major milling centers of the country.
    •    Independent of this effort, it is suggested that Camcontrol staff its office in
         Battambang and in the other major milling centers with rice inspectors to
         facilitate the inspections upcountry. Further, its inspectors should be increased
         so that they are routinely available outside of regular office hours.



4
  As indicated in the appendix, the construction of rice polishing factories played a key role in Vietnam’s
relatively rapid advance from primarily an exporter of low quality rice to an origin that last year exported
2.5 million tons of high quality rice.



                                                   xxi
    •   In order to further streamline and simplify export processing functions, it is
        suggested that Camcontrol take over the inspection duties currently performed
        by the General Department of Customs and Excise and the issuance of SPS
        certificates for rice from MAFF.
    •   The government has a scope to reduce export costs by reducing fees charged for
        export documentation (rather than increasing official fees for SPS and customs
        certificates), and equally important, further slash port costs.


5. To assist the government in identifying on going hurdles and overcoming
problems as they arise, it is recommended that the privte sector membership of the
Rice Technical Working Group (RTWG) be reconstitued to consist of the five
largest rice exporters and that regular quarterly meetings be held to advise the
government.
    •   Membership of the group could be based on recent export volumes as recorded
        by either Camcontrol or GDCE. This RTWG would provide a cross section of
        the Cambodian rice sector – millers, polishers, and exporters without factories.

    •   Every two years the private sector membership could be changed based on the
        most recent export performance records.

6. It is suggested that MAFF urgently undertake a series of scientific studies to
prove that rice in the Kingdom is pests and GMO free. After the these studies are
reviewed and referenced in a recognized scientific publications, MAFF can issue a
blanket certification that the Cambodian rice crop is pest and GMO free,
eliminating additional testing requirements for exporters, although continuous
surveillance may need to be continued. It is suggested that MAFF also redouble its
efforts to eliminate insects and noxious weeds that are of concern to targeted
export destinations such as China.
    •   SPS issues are increasingly likely to become a major constraint. China, for
        example, will not allow Cambodian rice to be imported unless the government
        can certify that the milled rice exported to China are free from the following
        quarantine pests of Chinese concern: Leptochloa chinensis, Striga asiatica,
        Apenlenchoides besseyi, Ditylenchus angustus.
    •   Each batch passing inspection will be issued an official Phyotosanitary
        Certificate demonstrating that it has fulfilled the Chinese requirements and
        specifying the origin of production.5
    •   The EU, Cambodia’s largest export market is very sensitive about importing
        GMO-free food and there are no labs in Cambodia to test the goods.
    •   Presently, the exporters must ship a sample to Vietnam for testing, which costs
        $150 per test and takes several days to perform.

1. Targeted Overseas Markets &
Competition

1.      Cambodia’s rice harvests have been rising significantly since 2005, powered
by improved and expanded irrigation and attractive farmgate prices. This year’s
production is officially estimated at 8.25 million tons, including the recently harvested
dry season crop of 1.7 million tons. Cambodia's rice production is primarily comprised
of three types of rice: traditional non-aromatic varieties, fragrant rice, and IRRI HYV's.
While official statistics are lacking, the traditional non-aromatic varieties make up by
far the largest share of the production, accounting for roughly half of the total harvest.6
The IRRI varieties account for about one-fourth to one-third of the output,7 while
fragrant rice production, which recently has been expanding rapidly, is about 1.65
million tons or 20% of the crop.8


2.      The production gains have fueled a burgeoning exportable surplus which is
informally shipped to Thailand and Vietnam by well-financed traders which
swoop in to buy the freshly harvested paddy. The relative volumes and the mix by
variety depend on the price differentials in the neighboring markets in a given year.
Typically, though, about one-third of the surplus flows west to Thailand and the balance
east to Vietnam. A mix of varieties are shipped in each direction, but most of the
surplus fragrant rice is sold ultimately to Thai rice millers located in the border areas,
while IRRI varieties are predominantly traded to Vietnam.


3.   While Cambodia has significantly cheaper production costs than Thailand
and Vietnam,9 its prices for non-aromatic milled rice become increasingly
uncompetitive ex-rice mill, FOB the port, and delivered to the overseas destination.


6
  The non-fragrant traditional varieties include Phkar Khney, Neang Minh, and Neang Khon. These are
medium- and long-duration cultivars with growing periods of up to 210 days which are photoperiod
sensitive, i.e. they must be grown in the rainy season.
7
  IR 66 and IR 50404, which are non-photoperiod sensitive, are the predominant IRRI varieties grown.
While IR 66 has excellent grain quality and can be milled into rice with 5% brokens, IR 50404
typically can only be milled with difficulty into 15% brokens. Except for the very poor consumers, the
IRRI varieties are grown for export.
8
  The most well known fragrant varieties are Somaly, Neang Malis, Phka Romdul, and Domaly.	   They
are photoperiod sensitive. Recently, two non-photo period varieties have been introduced, Sen Pidao
and Sen Kra-ob. Production of fragrant rice has expanded sharply in the last several years as farmers
switch out of non-fragrant varieties during the rainy season and increasing acreage is being devoted to
Sen Kra-ob during the dry season.
9
  Wholesale harvest prices for fragrant paddy in northwest Cambodia were $305/ton in December 2010
(Riels 1,250/kg), while they averaged almost $445 in N.E. Thailand. Similarly, wholesale prices for IR
paddy in the eastern provinces averaged $237/ton in March 2011 (Riels 970/kg) compared to $263/ton
(VD 5,490/kg) in Vietnam's Mekong River Delta. Cambodian prices from provincial rice millers in
Battambang and Prey Veng, Thai values from USDA/Bangkok, and Vietnamese prices from Viet Food
Association.


                                                  1
This is due to the combination of improper drying of the paddy, mixing of the varieties
by paddy traders, out-of-date milling technology, high power costs to operate the rice
mills, inefficient milling technology, expensive transport costs, informal payments, high
costs for processing export documents, expensive port charges, and uncompetitive
ocean freight. “In Cambodia, the cost of rice milling is about $30-50/ton, compared to
$20-30/ton in Thailand and Vietnam. The cost of transporting rice to the harbor in
Cambodia is about $50-60/ton, which is double the internal transport costs in Thailand
($20-30).”10


1.1 Rice is not rice, is not rice


4.      The world rice market is a thin, segmented, and imperfect market in which
governments are key actors. World trade has averaged just over 30 million tons during
the last three years. Most of the rice moving in world commerce is fully milled and
shipped as bagged cargo on break bulk vessels, while Cambodia is only using containers.
There are very distinct markets based on different rice types, qualities, and methods of
processing which preclude perfect substitution.


5.      In the world market, considerable emphasis is placed on grain length and on
the percentage of brokens as criteria of quality. In addition, the kernel shape
(length/breadth), the chalkiness, and translucency are considered. The absence of
chalkiness and high translucency in the rice endosperm are quality characteristics
associated with good grain appearance. Uniformity of quality is also important to rice
buyers.


6.     There are basically four types of rice: glutinous, aromatic, Japonica, and
Indica. The tenderness and stickiness of cooked rice are inversely correlated with the
amylase content of the starch. Glutinous or sticky rice (a very low amylose rice) is
typically used in desserts and only about 300,000 tons is traded each year in the world
market. As described in further detail below, 5.7 million tons of aromatic rice were traded
internationally last year. Japonica type rice, having fairly low amylose content, is semi-
sticky and moist when cooked. Japonica is a round-shaped grain. The amount of Japonica
rice traded internationally varies widely. Usually, however, about 1.5 million tons of
Japonica is traded annually.


7. With an intermediate to high amylose content, Indica or long grain rice cooks
fluffy and shows high volume expansion as well as grain separation. Indica accounts
for all but about 6.5 million tons of the 30 million tons that enters international trade
channels. About 2.3 million tons of the 23.5 million tons of Indica rice traded is shipped as
rough rice or paddy. Broadly speaking, the world market for milled long grain can be
divided in to parboiled (a process where the rough rice is soaked and steamed before
milling) and regular milled or white rice. Just as there is only limited substitution between

                                                   2
Japonica and Indica rice, there is also very limited substitution between regular milled and
parboiled rice.


World trade in parboiled rice is typically about 5.5 million tons. The market for regular
milled rice is annually approximately 15 million tons. It can be sub-divided further into
high (less than 10% brokens), medium (10-20% brokens), and low (more than 20%
brokens) quality based on the brokens content. The volumes moving in each class can vary
dramatically from year to year depending on which countries have major crop shortfalls
and the relative price spreads between qualities.11



1.2 The competition


8.      Cambodia’s competitors vary based on the type of rice. For fragrant rice,
Thailand is its major competitor, followed by Vietnam. Thailand exported 2.65
million tons of aromatic rice last year (including brokens). This was more than ten times
the volume shipped overseas by Vietnam. For the non-aromatic white rice markets such
as the Philippines, Indonesia, and Africa, Vietnam is the principal competitor. Pakistan
and Burma also export major quantities of low grade white rice.


9.       After averaging less than 6,000 tons annually during the five years ending
in 2008, Cambodia’s formal exports have grown rapidly primarily due to duty
preferences, but also because of investments in modern rice mills and polishing
factories. Both the E.U. and Russia permit duty-free imports from Cambodia, but not
from its primary competitors. With the Everything But Arms import policy going into
effect for rice in late 2009, Cambodia’s recorded exports jumped to 16,000 tons and
rose three-fold last year to over 51,000 tons. Over 90% of last year’s recorded exports
went to the E.U. and Russia. With almost 61,000 tons shipped through June 12, this
year’s overseas sales appear destined to reach at least 175,000 tons. The rice exported to
the E.U. in 2011 is estimated to be evenly split between fragrant and non-fragrant white
rice, while virtually all of the material destined for Russia is non-fragrant. As indicated
earlier, all of Cambodia’s rice exports are via containers which are shipped from Phnom
Penh and Sihanoukville ports.


10.    The importance of the E.U. and Russia are primarily explained by the duty
preferences extended to Cambodian rice vis-à-vis its competitors.12 While
Cambodia's cost of paddy production is significantly below both Thailand and Vietnam,
higher milling costs and margins render its ex-mill prices – especially for IRRI rice –
uncompetitive. This is further exacerbated by high domestic tranport costs (both formal

“A Road Map for Cambodian Rice Exports,” a report prepared for the World Bank in June 2009. The
primer describes how the world rice market works, pricing relationships of the various types of rice,
and the key origins and destinations for the various rice.

   Imports of Cambodian rice into the E.U. currently enjoy a duty preference of $250 vis-à-vis Thai and
Vietnamese rice, while the duty preference is worth $129/ton in Russia.

and informal), expensive and time consuming export proceedures and port charges
(again including informal costs), and less competitive overseas freight costs. As a result,
Cambodian rice is generally unattractive to overseas buyers facing higher prices for a
rice with which they are unfamiliar and potentially suppliers of uncertain reliability.

1.3 Export proceedures and costs


11.     Exporters report a significant improvement during the last year in the
turn-around time involved in getting documents approved, but the exporters
interviewed all agreed that Cambodian export proceedures remain highly bureaucratic
and informal costs unacceptably high. They also note that the locations of the
competent authorities are distant from each other and contribute to difficulties in easily
completing the proceedures. The informal fees are negotiable and the increase in export
volumes has apparently allowed the unit costs incurred to decline. Combined official
and unofficial costs are reported to have to currently total about $17/ton on the larger
shipments.


12.     In addition to having either the provincial governor's office or the Phnom
Penh municipal office certify the company's location, an exporter must annually
register with the Ministry of Commerce's GFP office.13 When an exporter receives
an overseas order, it must be registered with MEF's GDCE to obtain an ASYCUDA
number (which takes three visits) and an export license (a fourth trip).
 In addition to GDCE's export license, the following certificates must be obtained:



13
  Ostensibly the location certification is a "one time" event, but exporters indicate that they find it
advisable to annually make "sentimental" payment to stay in good graces with the local officials.

1.4 The players


13.     A small number of firms have capitalized on the export opportunities
emerging during the last couple of years. The ten most active exporters have
accounted for 86% of all shipments since the end of 2009 and the largest five shipped
three out of every five tons sent overseas. It is a very dynamic market with the current
top players experiencing disimilar growth rates and having different business models.
As such, the relative rankings of the exporters are fluid. At the end of April, Mega
Green Imex Camodia was the largest exporter, followed by Khmer Foods, and Amru
Rice. Of note, both Mega Green and Amru do not own their own rice mills or polishing
factories. Amru relies on a small number of large modern rice mills for which it
provides financing for paddy. Its rice sales to the E.U. are primarily through Schepens,
a Belgian-based international broker which has spent many years helping to shepherd
Cambodian rice exports into the world market. Mega Green (and its affiliates) sources
its rice from a much larger pool millers which, by and larger, are smaller than those
supporting Amru. It, too, primarily relies on Schepens, but does not pre-finance the
paddy purchases of its suppliers.


14.     Khmer Foods owns a rice polishing factory from which its sources its
exports. Unlike Amru and Mega Green, its also is a major seller into the domestic rice
market which accounts for about 75% of its volume. Golden Rice, a JV with principals
from Reunion, is the only actual miller in the top five and it sells primarily fragrant rice
directly to its overseas clients. International Rice Trading is a rice polisher. Like Khmer
foods, it has both domestic and overseas customers. It exclusively is a seller of fragrant
rice and does not rely on brokers.


Fragrant Rice Markets


15.     Aromatic rice (also known as perfume or scented rice) typically accounts for
15% of total world trade, but exceeded 5.7 million tons last year. The three leading
exporters of aromatic rice are Thailand, Pakistan, and India. Basmati shipments out of
the Indian subcontinent totaled 2.85 million tons in 2010. It is overwhelmingly destined
for consumers in the Middle East and the overseas Indian and Pakistani communities. It
does not compete directly with the aromatic rice shipped by Thailand, Vietnam, and
Cambodia. Thailand exported over 2.65 million tons of perfumed rice last year - 1.8
million tons of Jasmine rice,14 almost 160,000 tons of Patum Thani 1,15 and nearly
700,000 tons of fragrant brokens. Vietnam is an up and coming rival, selling last year
over 220,000 tons of fragrant rice and 17,000 tons of aromatic brokens. Container
shipments account for two-thirds of the Jasmine shipments. The balance moves on
break bulk vessels, primarily to Africa.



14
   Kao Dawk Mali 105, which is photo-period sensitive, is the most prominent fragrant variety grown.
RD 15 is also classified as Thai Jasmine rice. In the Thai language, "jasmine" is "Hom Mali."
15
   Patum Thani 1 is a non-photoperiod sensitive fragrant HYV.


                                                 6
Thailand


16.     Increasing quantities of scented rice are being grown in Thailand. There are a
number of aromatic varieties grown, but official production efforts are focused on Khao
Dawk Mali or Jasmine rice. In recent years, about 5.0-5.5 million tons of Jasmine is
produced with 85% of the harvest originating in Thailand’s rain- fed Northeast. Thai
farmers in the Central Plains and lower North started cultivating Patum Thani 1
beginning in 2001. While no reliable official estimates exist as to the size of the crop,
industry estimates indicate that output approaches the size of the Jasmine harvest as
several harvests can be grown in a single year and field yields are very high compared
to Jasmine rice.16


17.     Thai fragrant rice is sold primarily to Asian markets. Jasmine exports
averaged nearly 1.8 million tons of in 2008-10, of which 1.6 million tons was
Jasmine 100% (which has fewer than 5% brokens). Almost 40% of the Jasmine 100%
is shipped to Asian markets. See Annex Table 1. Up until 2006, China was the largest
market. From a peak of 467,000 tons, Thai exports of Jasmine 100% to China declined
to only 125,000 tons each in 2009 and 2010 as high Thai price supports had prompted
many buyers to switch initially to Patum Thani and increasingly to local aromatic rice.
Other major markets include Hong Kong, Singapore, and, Malaysia. The U.S. is also a
growing market for Jasmine rice with the product starting to enjoy consumer acceptance
outside of the Southeast Asian immigrant community. Over 300,000 tons is annually
exported to Africa with the Ivory Coast and Ghana the leading markets - accounting for
two out of every three tons exported to the continent. Only about 5% of the Jasmine is
marketed in the Middle East.


18.     According to official Thai grade standards, rice exported as Jasmine is to
be 92% purity, but mixing with other varieties is very common. Some of this
mixing is done with the knowledge of the buyer to make the rice more affordable to the
end consumers. Each of the major international traders has its “own recipe” for Jasmine
purity, which can vary by market. According to the Thai Rice Exporters’ Association
(REA), current crop Jasmine 100% A is presently valued at $991/ton (and old crop at
$1,129).17




16
   The quality of the crop grown during the dry season is reported to be of better quality than that
grown during the wet season.
17
   Prices as of June 1, 2011, see http://www.thairiceexporters.or.th/price.htm. REA export prices are
almost always substantially higher than commercial quotations. According to the trade, African quality
Jasmine currently sells at a discount of almost $160.

19.      Patum Thani exports typically are not separately reported, but reached a
peak of almost 350,000 tons in 2007, before tumbling to a little more than 160,000
tons in 2010.18 Historically, China was the largest market, by far, but last year exports
to that destination contracted to only 22,000 tons. Asian buyers accounted for three out of
every five tons of Patum exported last year with Hong Kong the single largest market,
taking just under 40,000 tons. While Asian demand for Thai Patum is declining,
shipments to the E.U. are on the upswing - topping 33,000 tons in 2010. (See Annex
Table 2 for full details.) According to the Thai REA, Patum Thani as of June 1, 2011
traded at a discount of almost $300/ton to Jasmine 100% A.


20.    Here, too, high prices have taken a toll on consumer demand. Thai
Jasmine brokens averaged almost 725,000 tons during the three year period
ending last year, well under the record of more than 1.0 million tons shipped in
2007. About 85% of the shipments are destined for Africa, while the balance is almost
evenly split between Asian and European markets. Senegal and the Ivory Coast are
the leading markets for Thai Jasmine brokens, each taking almost 225,000 tons in
2010. See Annex Table 3. According to the Thai REA, fragrant brokens are currently
valued at $480/ton FOB.




18
  One leading Thai exporter attributes the decline in Patum exports to increased mixing with Jasmine
on rice destined for Africa. A more persuasive argument is that increasing quantities of Patum are
being consumed in the domestic Thai market.

Vietnam


21.      While Thailand pioneered the Jasmine export market, Vietnam only began
exporting fragrant rice in 2000 and the first observed shipments of fragrant
brokens occurred in 2005. Initial shipments were limited (with observed sailings
averaging only 13,000 tons in 2000-04), but have mushroomed during the last three
years. After averaging 80,000 tons during 2005-09, exports last year exceeded 160,000
tons.19 One-fourth of this rice was sold to buyers in Africa, while Asian customers
purchased 65% of all Viet fragrant exported in 2010. See Annex Table 6. Exports of
Vietnamese fragrant brokens, which are primarily shipped to Africa, averaged 21,000
tons during 2005-09. After peaking at just under 55,000 tons in 2008, exports tumbled
to less than 12,000 tons last year. See Annex Table 7. As of June 1, Viet fragrant rice is
being commercially quoted at $350/ton discount to Hom Mali, while fragrant brokens
are nominally trading at a $40/ton discount to Thai values.

Specific Markets


The EU


22.     The E.U. annually imports over 1.5 million tons, primarily brown regular
milled and parboiled rice (because of the progressive duty structure).20
Approximately one-fourth of its imports are Basmati rice. European purchases of Thai
Jasmine 100% averaged 155,000 tons during 2008-10, plus nearly 75,000 tons of
fragrant brokens and significant quantities of brown Jasmine (approximately 25-30,000
tons, including that shipped via Reunion). Benefiting from a zero import duty under the
EBA policy instituted in September 2009, imports from Cambodia climbed last year to
just under 39,000 tons - far above the 3,000 tons. averaged in the years leading up to the
policy change. Notwithstanding these gains, there remains considerable scope for
expanded Cambodian sales to the E.U. as recent sales include both fragrant and non-
fragrant rice as the import duty for milled rice, which is waived for Cambodia is €
175/ton ($250 at current exchange rates). It should be noted, however, that there is a
special safeguard that may be triggered when the imports under EBA exceed by 25%
the volume imported in the previous year under the scheme.21 Based on exports during
the first four months of 2011, E.U. imports will increase by more than 100% this year
and possibly by 200%. According to a USDA medium-term projection, E.U. imports
are expected to gradually increase between 2011 and 2015 – see Annex Table 10.22


Russia


23.    Faced with an increase in the import duty to € 120/ton ($172/ton), Russia’s
rice imports declined in 2010 to 240,000 tons, 14% below the nearly 280,000 tons
averaged in the five years ending in 2009 and less than half of the record 500,000 tons
achieved in 1999. USDA is forecasting a continuing decline in Russian imports to
200,000 tons in 2011. USDA’s medium term project for 2015 is for imports to be flat,
near recent historical levels. Rice imports from Thailand and Vietnam receive a duty
preference of 25%, thereby subject to an import tariff of € 90/ton ($129/ton). Imports of
Cambodian rice are duty free.

   Brown rice is a partially milled rice where the pericarp or hull has been removed, but the bran
remains.

China


24.     During the last decade, China experienced two years of unusually heavy
imports - recorded arrivals were over 760,000 tons in 2004 and reached nearly
720,000 tons in 2006. More typically, China has been a market for about 250-350,000
tons. After importing 366,000 tons in 2010, USDA is projecting this year's arrivals will
increase to 400,000 tons. This rice is primarily destined for urban markets in southern
China. Official trade numbers in both 2010 and 2011, however, do not appear to be
capturing a significant amount of border trade with Vietnam and Burma. According to a
leading importer, last year's imports of Vietnamese rice totaled approximately 150,000
tons or almost three times what is officially showing in the trade books. USDA's
medium-term forecast is for Chinese imports to gradually increase to 450,000 tons in
2015, before accelerating to 620,000 tons in 2021.

25.    Despite many Thai exporters hiring local agents and spending considerable
sums on marketing their brands (primarily in the southern coastal cities), Chinese
imports of Thai Jasmine rice peaked in 2006 and have since been in serious
decline. Sales of the much cheaper Patum initially cannibalized the Jasmine market, but
the combined volumes have been collapsing. In 2007 Thailand exported over 420,000
tons of both Jasmine and Patum milled rice, but the volume had declined to less than
150,000 tons by 2010.


26.     Thanks to rising local prices in China, private importers (and, to a lesser
extent, COFCo, the central government's food agency) have been buying
increasing quantities of mostly high quality white rice in both Vietnam and
Thailand during the last twelve months. With their existing connections with local
importers, Thai exporters and Singapore-based traders have played a significant role
selling the Vietnamese rice (primarily 5% brokens) to China. Reportedly some of the
white rice is being blended for industrial usage. According to the trade, import parities



                                            11
in early May were $475 CIF for Viet 5% or $465 FOB. Allowing margins and costings
for the traders, prices above $450 were unattractive.


Indonesia


27.     With domestic prices that are increasingly diverging from world price
levels,23 Indonesia seeks to tightly limit overall rice import volumes and timing.
This endeavor, however, is complicated by its nearly 55,000 km of coastline spread
over more than 17,500 islands in the archipelago. Rice imports require permits and are
subject to an import duty of $53/ton (Rp 450/kg). Food processors are granted a limited
number of import licenses for "specialty rice," e.g. glutinous rice, glutinous brokens,
and white brokens. Imports of ordinary rice are restricted to Bulog, a state-owned
enterprise (S.O.E.). As a matter of policy, Bulog is generally not allowed to import rice
during the period one month prior to the main harvest in March and April and in the two
months after the harvest. Bulog normally buys 15% brokens.


28.    Once consistently the world's largest importer, Indonesia's purchases
neared 6.1 million tons in 1998. Reflecting more restrictive policies, average imports
declined to 2.0 million tons during 2000-04 and further fell to some 690,000 tons of
average annual arrivals in the following five-year period. With subpar carryover stocks
and a poor harvest, imports rebounded to over 885,000 tons in 2010. (One of the food
agency's primary tasks is to source rice for the country's Raskin program where
subsidized rice is provided for the poor.) USDA's medium-term forecast is for
Indonesia to import over 1.1 million tons in 2015 and almost 1.6 million tons in 2021.

  Jakarta wholesale prices for IR 64 3rd Grade were $644/ton in early May, while FOB values for
Viet 15% were almost $200/ton cheaper.

29.      Bulog purchased 2.0 million tons under a Cabinet authorization issued in October
2010. Import duties were waived, but arrivals needed to be made by April 1. While Bulog
typically buys 15%, this time it purchased both 5% and 15%. Its purchases of Vietnamese rice
were made via Government to Government negotiations, while it tendered for its Thai rice -
although it limited participation to Bangkok-based firms. Because the imports needed to arrive
before the end of March, only 1.85 million tons were executed. This included 1.4 million tons
which arrived during the first three months of 2011. Because of a poor crop due to adverse
weather, Indonesian imports are forecast at 2.25-2.5 million tons in 2011.


30.     Notwithstanding the announced policy concerning the timing of imports, Bulog's
imports during periods of large imports are spread throughout the year. Generally, though,
imports primarily occur during the fourth quarter (33% of all imports during the five-year
period ending in 2009) and the first quarter (26%).


Philippines


31.     Like Indonesia, domestic rice prices in the Philippines are far above world levels,24
imports are restricted and smuggling is a problem. With consumption fueled by subsidized
prices vis-à-vis corn and a burgeoning population, the Philippines in 2008 emerged as the
world's largest importer, taking delivery of 2.6 million tons. The National Food Authority
(NFA), the Filipino food authority, is the primary importer. While its overall import totals are
decided by an inter-agency committee, NFA's decisions to buy via tender or through G-to-G
negotiations are subject to the approval by secretary (minister) of agriculture. Typically it buys
25% brokens, but during some campaigns it also buys 5% and 15%. To avoid criticism for the
seasonal decline in domestic prices, rice imports typically occur during the first six months of
the calendar year.


32.     The Philippines and Vietnam have a multi-year MOU whereby Hanoi agrees to
supply up to 1.5 million tons annually through 2013 and Vietnam is by far the largest
supplier to this market. (Manila is reported to be exploring an MOU with Bangkok for 1 million
tons.)


33.      Private sector imports are subject to a 40% tariff, but in recent years the licenses
have been awarded by NFA subject to the payment of a "service fee." Under the Arroyo
regime, the quantity of licensed imports by private firms was limited, but the new Aquino
administration has a 2011 policy of limiting NFA's import share to 200,000 tons out of a
planned 860,000 tons. The reduction in NFA's volume reflects the combination of very heavy
carryover stocks and huge debts resulting from recent heavy imports at very high prices and
sales domestically at heavily subsidized levels. "The Philippines operates two tiers of rice
prices: Commercial (free market) and NFA (subsidized). Commercial rice is more expensive
than NFA rice and typically sells for P 30-45 ($0.68-1.02) per kilo retail, depending on
quality… On December 2010, the NFA increased its retail selling price from P 25 ($0.57) to P
27 ($0.61).25

34.      According to USDA, the Philippines will be forced to import increasing quantities
of rice during the medium- and long-term. The Philippines is projected to import 3.3 million
tons in 2015 and over 4.2 million tons in 2021.

Take Away Points

   1. Given the size of the different segments of the world rice market, Cambodia
      cannot reach its 1.0 million ton export goal without exporting both fragrant and
      non-fragrant rice.

   2. Thailand is Cambodia's principal competitor for fragrant rice, while Vietnam is
      the key competitor for non-fragrant rice.

   3. Cambodia has significantly cheaper production costs than Thailand and
      Vietnam, but its prices for non-aromatic milled rice become increasingly
      uncompetitive ex-mill, FOB the port, and delivered to the overseas destination.

   4. The rapid growth in exports since 2009 is due to import duty preferences
      granted by the E.U. and, to a lesser extent, Russia. Lower prices will be needed
      to penetrate other key markets such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and China.

   5. While there has been a significant improvement during the last year in the turn-
      around time involved in getting documents approved, Cambodian export
      procedures remain highly bureaucratic and informal costs unacceptably high.
      Combined formal and informal costs add $17/ton to FOB prices.




                                              14
2. New Investments

35.     Due to attractive milling margins for modern, export-oriented rice mills,
Cambodia’s antiquated milling industry has been undergoing a renaissance during
the last three years. This has included the upgrading and expansion of existing mills,
but also investments in new large(er) rice mills. As summarized below, the number of
milling companies capable of processing at least 8 tons/hour of paddy has increased by
seven, adding 106 tons/hr of installed capacity or more than double that existing in
2009. Equally important, at least four new rice polishing factories have been built with
capacity to upgrade at least 10 tons/hour. These factories can upgrade the quality of
milled rice produced by the older, smaller rice mills.26


36.    Based on interviews with market participants, it would not be surprising if
an additional 100 tons/hour of milling capacity were to occur within the next 12-15
months and possibly another doubling of the installed capacity in the next two
years. New medium-sized mills, too, are being built and existing facilities upgraded.
While new interest in bank lending to rice mills is reported, most of the existing
expansion is self-financed.27


37.     Assuming the new rice mills coming on stream in the last two years are
working 12 hours/day, six days per week, and allowing for the equivalent of two
weeks of holidays, the new factories would be process a total of 380,000 tons per
year. This represents less than one-fourth of the estimated paddy exports occurring in
2009.28




26
   Ying & Yang Rice Head Quarterz is an upgrading factory with de-stoners and machinery to separate
the brokens. Unlike the rice polishing factories, it does not have whiteners and color sorters.
27
   The new mills, while large by local standards, are modest compared with mills in Thailand's Central
Plains which are typically twice as large.

3. Issues and Constraints


38.      Until very recently, rice market participants from the farmer through the
retailers have not been rewarded for quality. As a result, farmers have cared little
about the seed they used and properly drying the harvest, while the paddy traders failed
to keep different varieties that they purchased separate, contributing to uneven
appearance of the rice produced. Similarly, rice millers often do not take care about
their storage conditions and were not rewarded for careful milling and separating the
head rice from the brokens. This, however, is beginning to rapidly change in response to
the rising export opportunities and the demanding specifications of the overseas buyers.


3.1 Recognizing economics and geographic reality


39.     While the recent growth in exports is very impressive, this represents the
‘‘low-handing fruit’’ afforded by duty preferences in the E.U. and, to a lesser
extent, Russia. In order to have a chance of even reaching 500,000 tons of exports by
2015 or half of the announced target, the government must not only significantly
intensify its near-term efforts to reduce milling costs, simplify export proceedures and
cut port costs, but it must afford itself of the cheaper shipping alternatives afforded by
Vietnam’s deep water port in Saigon and, eventually, Thailand’s container port in Laem
Chabang.29 High electricity costs and limited availability have traditionally prompted
Cambodia's rice mills to depend on diesel for their power needs. Diesel, however, is not
inexpensive. Investments in rice hull burning equipment, however, can reduce diesel
expenses by 75%30 or almost $15/ton, but this in itself is not be enough in short run to
achieve the needed cost reductions to allow Cambodia to successfully compete in the
much larger world market. It, however, represents a major improvement. What are also
needed inter alia are bilateral transportation agreements to allow uncontainerized
Cambodian milled rice to be barged down the Mekong River to be loaded on
conventional break bulk vessels and/or trucked to Thai container ports.


40.     Where Cambodian exporters are facing costs of over $18/ton to stuff
containers and transport milled rice from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville, barging
costs of uncontainerized rice from the Cambodian border to Saigon, which vary by
season, are currently $6-7/ton.31 Opening up transport of milled rice down the
Mekong River should spark new investments (both private and foreign) in large modern
rice mills in the provinces bordering Vietnam. This would also produce additional


29
   Prior to the global recession, Laem Chabang handled 5.2 million teu in 2008, when it was operating
at about half of its installed capacity. That same year, the combined container throughput at Phnom
Penh and Sihanoukville ports was 306,000 teu. For a description of Laem Chabang Port, see

transport savings between the farmgate and the mills. With limited milling capacity in
the eastern provinces where most of the IRRI rice is grown, millers face added transport
costs to move the paddy to the Phnom Phen environs were it is milled. These costs
would be minimized by the building of rice mills in the rice production areas bordering
Vietnam.


41.     Effective June 2010, a bilateral accord between Cambodia and Vietnam
came into effect which provides a framework where Cambodian milled rice could
gain duty-free access to Vietnam’s downriver ports.32 The Vietnamese authorities
would need to agree to treat uncontainerized Cambodian milled rice as a ‘‘transit
good.’’ As there are significant vested interests in Vietnam to continue the current trade
relationship which largely relegates Cambodia as a raw material supplier to rice mills in
Vietnam (and Thailand), it is likely that Hanoi would only make such an agreement if
the issue was personally taken up as a priority issue at the highest level.


42.     Diplomatic relations with Thailand are presently very poor, but
presumably this will ameliorate after Bangkok’s July elections. Under the ASEAN
Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), Thailand is obliged to allow duty free imports of
Cambodian rice. Its policy, however, is to limit imports to brokens destined for
industrial use. These imports are to be restricted to only certain months and by approved
importers. Thailand’s trade posture is defensive in nature, but ignores the reality that
massive tonnages of Cambodian paddy already are informally imported. The Thai rice
industry at a recent meeting of exporters, millers, brokers, and farmers agreed to
pursue ‘‘free trade’’ in rice, or at least in paddy, but the outlook for this proposed policy
change is uncertain. More politically palatable to the general Thai public would be a
transport corridor agreement similar to one that Laos and Thailand have in place which
would obviate any political fallout that rice imports would depress Thai paddy and
milled rice prices.33 What is important to recognize is that there are influential domestic
interests in Thailand which want to promote Cambodian milled rice exports either by
purchasing this rice and shipping it to its overseas customers and/or investing in the
Cambodian rice milling sector.

    Thai imports of Cambodian paddy provide a sorely needed source of raw material for the grossly
overbuilt Thai rice milling industry. While this political support would presumably be lacking for a
“transit corridor” agreement, Thai rice exporters, which have recently started to trade Cambodian
milled rice, would be still benefit from the transit accord. Beginning in 2010, at least three Thai rice
exporters have started to buy containers of Cambodian milled rice to ship to their overseas customers
as products of Cambodia. Additionally, one of these three firms and two others have expressed interest
in joint ventures in the Cambodian rice sector along with partners from Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

3.2 Logistics – containers are not the final solution


43.    According to USDA, the world trade in rice has recently averaged almost
30.25 million tons. There are, however, no reliable estimates of the share of world trade
that moves via containers, but the vast majority of the international trade in rice is in
conventional vessels. While paddy and brown rice are typically moved in bulk, the vast
majority of the milled rice is shipped in bagged form in break bulk vessels.34 Data from
Thailand, for example, indicates that 38% of last year’s exports were shipped via
containers and the balance as bagged cargo on conventional vessels. Outside of Africa,
containers are the predominant mode for shipping Hom Mali.


44.     Like any other market, freight prices are set by supply and demand. At
times, container freight costs, including handling charges, to a specific destination can
be especially competitive vis-à-vis break bulk charges as the container shipping lines
attempt to distribute excess containers from one region or destination to another without
having to physically ship empty unwanted containers. Generally speaking, however, it
is not a convenient means for shipping large quantities of a commodity such as rice
because of the extra paper work and physical handling of the rice bags.



45.    Further complicating this mode of transport, not every container is suitable
for shipping rice. Containers come in two sizes – twenty and forty foot long boxes.
Because of its weight, rice can only be shipped in the smaller containers35 which can
accommodate 24 tons of rice. Also limiting which containers are suitable for rice, they
must be of “food quality,” i.e. suitable to ship rice or other food items. Depending on
what was last shipped in the box, it may be too dirty or have lingering odors which
would contaminate the rice.




34
   There are, of course, exceptions. Brown rice shipments to Japan, for example, are in bags, while
milled rice exports out of Mercosur are typically in bulk. Nonetheless, there is no overwhelming reason
why Cambodia should convert its rice logistics system to handle rice in bulk. Break bulk is non-
containerized cargo.
35
   The common measurement of containers is in twenty foot equivalent units or teu.

46.     Of the incoming laden containers last year, only 38% of the movement by
weight was in 20 ft containers. Exporters report that as the volume of rice shipments
has risen, there is an increasing problem in finding suitable containers. One of the
largest exporters, for example, advised that in April he could locate only one container
out of 50, which was food quality, resulting in his having to delay the shipment. Due to
the lack of suitable containers, he reports he must reduce his exports in June by over
35% from planned levels. 36 The lack of containers is prompting the shipping lines to
bring in increasing quantities of empty containers. Sihanoukville Port indicates that the
number of empty containers brought into the Kingdom during the first four months of
this year more than doubled to 10,582 teus. (Phnom Penh port also reports a significant
increase in empty boxes being imported.) This shortage not only is leading to delays,
but results in higher costs to the shipping lines which are ultimately reflected when
freight tariffs are reviewed.

   Port Authority of Sihanoukville officials indicate that they do not allow dirty containers to be off
loaded into their container yard. This problem is apparently occurring in Phnom Penh where virtually
all of the containers of rice are stuffed.


                                                  20
47.     As a small developing economy, the number of incoming containers in
Cambodia is relatively limited compared to Thailand and Vietnam. This has several
implications. First, Cambodia’s outgoing container freight rates will always tend to be
higher than its neighbors. Second, finding enough food quality containers in this smaller
national universe is increasingly a constraint.37 Finally, this results in a reluctance on
the part of shipping companies to allow empty containers to be transported upcountry
where most of the rice is produced and milled. As a result, virtually all bagged rice
intended for formal export is trucked to Phnom Penh were it is loaded (“stuffed”) into
containers and then shipped out of the country through the container ports located in
Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville. Notwithstanding the additional transport costs of
$15/ton to truck to Sihanoukville, most of the rice exports are shipped via this port and
the trend is accelerating. Container freight rates and sailing times to Europe are more
favorable via Sihanoukville. Traders also report export clearance times are shorter in
Sihanoukville as customs and Camcontrol officials in Phnom Penh port are reportedly
more difficult to deal with, and buyer and seller can constantly monitor the status of the
shipment which have departed via Sihanoukville, but cannot do the same ex-Phnom
Penh. According to Camcontrol data, 78% of this year’s containers of rice were shipped
via Sihanoukville, up from 67% last year.



48.      The sole reliance on containers will preclude reaching the 1 million ton
export target for 2015 for both logistics and marketing considerations. Because of
the entrenched trucking “network” in Phnom Penh, the large provincial trucks carrying
bagged rice from upcountry do not usually proceed directly to Sihanoukville to deliver
the rice for stuffing. First, there are insufficient warehouses in Sihanoukville where the
containers can be stuffed. Second, the freight forwarders in Sihanoukville are unlikely
to deal with provincial truckers that they do not know, resulting in a lack of cargo to be
transported from Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh and elsewhere. Some market
participants indicate that, if they directly ship the rice from Battambang, they will also
be denied backhaul cargo in Phnom Penh as their direct deliveries have harmed the
business interests of the shipping companies based in the capital. The denial of
backhaul cargo would raise the transport costs of those that ship direct to the port. This
creates a logistical constraint of insufficient semi-trailer trucks (vehicles which pull the
trailers that carry the containers). Exporting 1 million tons of rice via containers would
involve almost 42,000 teu or almost 3,475 teu/month. This is more than five times the
record April 2011 performance of 671 teu. It would also require roughly 375 additional
semi-trailer trucks or nearly doubling the reported current national fleet of about 400.38


49.    While the vast majority of the world trade in fragrant rice is shipped via
containers, the reverse is true for ordinary rice and fragrant brokens. This rice is
overwhelmingly transported as bagged cargo in conventional vessels. With the size of


37
   Surveying companies in Thailand indicate that approximately 80% of the twenty-foot containers in
that market are of “food quality.” Market participants in Cambodia indicated that it is generally
significantly lower (perhaps 20%).
38
   This is a “back of the envelope” calculation that assumes that Sihanoukville’s share of the rice
container traffic remains the same as in early 2011 and that none of the rice moves by rail from Phnom
Penh – an admittedly conservative assumption. Transport via rail, however, is unlikely to be available
before 2014.


                                                 21
the Cambodian container market, prospects are dim that container freight out from this
origin will generally be competitive with conventional freight out of competing origins.
Indeed, some buyers such as NFA are generally unwilling to import rice via containers.



3.3 Logistics – break bulk shipping is not yet ready for prime time


50.     As indicated above, all of Cambodia’s formal rice exports up to this point
have been via containers. Due to rocky outcrops in the channel, the entrance to
Sihanoukville is restricted to vessels with a draft (depth of water a ship draws when
loaded) of less than 8.0-8.5 meters. In practice, boats of up to about 10,000 dwt can
use the port – limiting break bulk cargoes carrying rice to Asia and East Africa.39 The
current lack of a deep water port precludes Cambodia from competing in the 5 million
ton West African market for fragrant and white rice even once its FOB costs have
been lowered to competitive levels unless transit access is obtained to Saigon Port.
Saigon Port, in contrast, can accommodate 32,000 dwt vessels alongside and 60,000
dwt at the lighterage area, Thieng Lieng buoy berths.40


51.    With Japanese financing, there are plans to deepen the channel for
Sihanoukville port to 13.5 meters by 2014, which will permit the loading of vessels
carrying 20,000 tons.41 In the interim, Cambodian exporters have thus far avoided
break bulk shipments via Sihanoukville for the following reasons:
     •   The size of the individual rice mills and their storage capacities;
     •   Lack of all-weather loading facilities for uncontainerized goods; and,
     •   Lack of affordable storage at the port.


52.     Given the current size of even the larger mills and rice polishers, it could
take months for a single exporter to assemble the necessary cargo to load even a
small vessel carrying 5,000 tons – assuming that the company has no other
domestic (or overseas) market obligations, and the financial resources. For a rice
polishing factory with 10 tons/hour processing capacity and dedicated only to export, it
would take about approximately two months to produce enough rice to fill a vessel
carrying 5,000 tons of 15% assuming a minimal number of holidays, working 12
hours/day, no power outages, and upgrading 25% brokens to 15% brokens. The largest
exporters, of course, can avoid this problem by working with a number of mills. The
uniformity of the cargo, however, can suffer if the number of sourcing mills becomes
too large. At present, the largest exporters are only shipping 1,000 to 1,500 tons/month.

53.     Aside from Sihanoukville, there are several private ports on the Gulf of
Siam. The deepest and largest is Oknha Mong Port (OMP). It has a depth of only
4.5 meters, limiting the vessels that can call to those lifting no more than 5,000 tons.
While there are no known natural deepwater port locations in Cambodia, one might
lighter milled rice to waiting vessels offshore. For this to be economically feasible,
however, a very large rice mill(s) would need to be constructed in the eastern provinces
neighboring Vietnam.

Take Away Points

   1. Rice husk burning equipment can reduce milling costs by almost $15/ton.

   2. Uncompetitive local and international freight costs and high port charges can be
      "solved" by negotiating transit agreements with Vietnam and Thailand. An
      existing accord with Vietnam provides a framework for the barging of
      uncontainerized milled rice down the Mekong River to waiting break bulk
      vessels. A bilateral agreement between Thailand and Laos, which allows the
      latter to use Thai ports, could be copied.

   3. Because of the size of the individual mills, Cambodia only exports rice via
      containers. The exclusive reliance on containers could result in exports stalling
      at about 250,000 tons per year. This is due to domestic logistical constraints and
      because major importers - in West Africa, the Philippines, and Indonesia -
      primarily import rice carried on break bulk vessels. The proposed bilateral
      transit accords provide a "work around" to these twin hurdles.

   4. Depth limitations currently preclude larger vessels from loading in
      Sihanoukville.

     5.          Recommendations

54.     A viable road map to increase Cambodia’s exports should take into account
the realities of where the surplus is located, its composition by type of rice, and the
competitiveness of the different varieties.42 Cambodia’s exportable surplus can be
divided into aromatic, native non-aromatic, and IRRI varieties. Broadly speaking, the
aromatic production is centered in the northwestern provinces that border Thailand,
while the IRRI varieties are grown during the dry season in southeastern Cambodia in
the provinces bordering Vietnam. Outside of the E.U. and Russia, the brightest export
prospects in the near term are for the fragrant rice and - once milling, transport, and
export costs are lowered - for IRRI rice. The export target, however, cannot be reached
by exporting only fragrant rice given the finite size of that market (less than 3 million
tons) and Thai Hom Mali's brand strength.43


55.     In the ten months since the ambitious 1 million ton export target was
established, only limited progress has been made in grappling with the complex,
inter-related issues which hamper Cambodia’s competitiveness of rice exports. It is
suggested that the following proposed measures be considered as a package if the
government desires to quickly replace a significant share of the paddy leaking into
Thailand and Vietnam with formal exports of milled rice. The planned rehabilitation of
the railroads and the modernization of Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville ports are
medium-term remedies which will only partially alleviate the Kingdom’s high logistics
costs and bottlenecks. According to several key exporters, these hurdles could result in
Cambodia’s exports stalling at less than 250,000 tons. Even with urgent and concerted
efforts, exports may only reach half of the export target by 2015 – albeit still a
significant achievement.


55.    The Cambodian government should give its highest priority to getting
Vietnam’s agreement to allow the barging of uncontainerized milled rice down the
Mekong River as a transit good to waiting conventional vessels in Saigon Port to
overcome the current problem that even Cambodia’s largest mills are too small to
individually supply coastal vessels carrying 5,000 tons on a timely basis. Initial
shipments could be made on barges carrying 250 tons to 1,000 tons where they could be
combined on the waiting ships with much larger tonnages of Vietnamese rice. As the
size and sophistication of Cambodia’s rice milling, processing, and exporting sector


42
   This makes its imperative that MAFF begin to monitor the breakdown of the rice crop area and
production by type.
43
   Some observers offer the view that exports of organic rice may offer an important outlet for
Cambodia's rice surplus. This notion, however, is incorrect. According to the leading exporter of
organic Thai rice, Thailand - the world's largest rice exporter - annually exports no more than 4,000
tons of organic rice. No formal studies of the size of world trade in organic rice are available, but he
estimates that only about 20-30,000 tons of organic rice are traded globally .


                                                  24
grows, the size of the export sales could be gradually increased until it reaches the point
where entire vessels of Cambodian rice are loaded. This “solution” lowers both
Cambodian transport and export costs not only for rice, but also for other Cambodian
exports. Also, it ensures that competitive FOB mill milled rice prices remain that way
on a CNF basis.


56.      Give priority to encourage private investments in larger mills and rice
polishing factories with capacities of at least 30 tons/hr.44 These facilities offer the
best opportunity for increasing rice exports in the near-term. The government could use
its tax incentives to encourage overseas or domestic investments in the milling sector,
which are able to meet export requirements. This could include a tax holiday of up to
five years for qualifying foreign and domestic firms.


57.     In order to continue to improve the competitiveness of Cambodian milled
rice the government would need to further remove bureaucratic hurdles and lower
export processing expenses. Exporters confirm that considerable progress has been
made in the last year in reducing the turnaround times for issuing Camcontrol, SPS, and
customs certificates. However, there is a scope for additional efficiency gains in this
area. This could be achieved through expansion of the “single stop service” for export
approvals in order to minimize the time currently spent getting documents approved. It
is suggested that centralized “single stop service” offices be opened in addition to
Phnom Penh, also in major milling centers of the country. Independent of this effort, it
is suggested that Camcontrol staff its office in Battambang and in the other major
milling centers with rice inspectors to facilitate the inspections upcountry. Further, its
inspectors should be increased so that they are routinely available outside of regular
office hours. In order to further streamline and simplify export processing functions, it
is suggested that Camcontrol take over the inspection duties currently performed by the
General Department of Customs and Excise and the issuance of SPS certificates for rice
from MAFF. The government has a scope to reduce export costs by reducing fees
charged for export documentation (rather than increasing official fees for SPS and
customs certificates), and equally important, further slash port costs.


58.     Rice Technical Working Group (RTWG) be reconstitued to consist of the
five largest rice exporters and that regular quarterly meetings be held to advise the
government to assist the government in identifying on going hurdles and overcoming
problems as they arise, it is recommended that the privte sector membership of the
Membership of the group could be based on recent export volumes as recorded by
either Camcontrol or GDCE. This RTWG would provide a cross section of the
Cambodian rice sector – millers, polishers, and exporters without factories. Every two
years the private sector membership could be changed based on the most recent export
performance records. SPS issues are increasingly likely to become a major constraint.
China, for example, will not allow Cambodian rice to be imported unless the


44
  As indicated in the appendix, the construction of rice polishing factories played a key role in Vietnam’s
relatively rapid advance from primarily an exporter of low quality rice to an origin that last year exported
2.5 million tons of high quality rice.

government can certify that the milled rice exported to China are free from the
following quarantine pests of Chinese concern: Leptochloa chinensis, Striga asiatica,
Apenlenchoides besseyi, Ditylenchus angustus. Each batch passing inspection will be
issued an official Phyotosanitary Certificate demonstrating that it has fulfilled the
Chinese requirements and specifying the origin of production.45 The E.U., Cambodia’s
largest export market is very sensitive about importing GMO-free food and there are no
labs in Cambodia to test the goods. Presently, the exporters must ship a sample to
Vietnam for testing which costs $150 per test and takes several days to perform.


59.     It is suggested that MAFF urgently undertake a series of scientific studies,
which prove the absence of above mentioned pests and GMO rice in the Kingdom.
After the these studies are reviewed and referenced in a recognized scientific
publications, MAFF can issue a blanket certification that the Cambodian rice crop is
pest and GMO free, eliminating additional testing requirements for exporters, although
continuous surveillance may need to be continued. It is suggested that MAFF also
redouble its efforts to eliminate insects and noxious weeds, which are of concern to
targeted export destinations such as China.

6. Appendixes
Appendix 1: The Vietnamese Export "Model"


In the aftermath of economic reform efforts ("doi moi"), Vietnam resumed being a net
rice exporter in 1987 after a quarter of a century's absence. It's exports that year totaled
only 153,000 tons, while it also imported nearly the same volume into the north -
150,000 tons. The following year imports improved to almost 100,000 tons, but the
quantity exported declined by over one-third. In 1989, Vietnam's exports surged to over
1.7 million tons as it began to export mostly low quality rice to Africa and selected
Asian destinations (especially China, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka).


Evolution of Exports. Virtually all of Vietnam's exports originate out of the Mekong
River Delta (MRD) where rice from the country’s rice mills and polishing factories is
mostly barged to the ports. While small vessels sail from provincial ports such as
Cantho and My Thoi, the over whelming volume departs from HCMC.


During its first five years of large scale exports ending in 1993, Vietnam's exports
averaged just under 1.8 million tons, with low quality rice (mostly 25% and 35%
brokens) accounting for at least 47% and possibly as much as 60% of all shipments.46
Observed shipments of high quality rice (less than 10% brokens) averaged only 176,000
tons, while the identified medium grades (10-20% brokens) averaged 281,000 tons.
(Average observed shipments of 100% brokens were 41,000 tons.)


With additional investments in improving existing rice mills, and later investments in
new rice mills and polishing factories, Vietnam stepped up its overall exports and also
sold increasing quantities of high quality rice. Vietnam's exports averaged almost 3.6
million tons during the second half of the 1990s with over half of the sales made to
other Asian markets. Indonesia was the single largest importer, taking on average
925,000 tons, while the Philippines was annually lifting over 400,000 tons.


Exports largely stabilized at that level during 2000-04, increasing only 2% to average
over 3.6 million tons. The composition of the exports, however, changed with identified
exports of high quality rice topping 1 million tons, an increase of over 150,00 tons.
This, of course, resulted in the generation of additional surplus brokens. Observed
annual exports of brokens averged almost 170,000 tons, up over 45,000 tons from the
preceding five-year period. Helping to fuel this change was the increase in sales to Iraq
(a buyer of 5% brokens) which rose by almost a quarter of a million tons to average


46
  This is based on author's contemporaneous estimates. Identified low grade exports averaged 841,000
tons, but there was also on average 230,000 tons of shipments for which the rice quality was not
identified.


                                                27
more than 540,000 tons p.a. Also noteworthy were the increasing sales of low quality
rice to Cuba (part of which was provided as debt repayment) and the Philippines.
Shipments to Cuba averaged over 290,000 tons, an increase of more than 110,000 tons
over that averaged during the late 1990s and more than 200,000 tons higher than the
88,000 shipped annually during 1990-94.


During the following five-year period, Vietnam annually exported over 5.0 million tons.
The sharp increase reflected higher sales to the Philippines, as well as a steep gain in
sales of high quality rice, which included rising quantities of fragrant rice.47 This
increase in high quality exports occurred despite reduced sales to Iraq where the buyer
became unhappy with the Vietnamese quality. More than taking up this slack were
larger sales of high quality rice to Africa resulting in part from uncompetitive price
supports in Thailand. Exports of Vietnamese high quality rice to Africa averaged over
875,000 tons annually or nearly three times that shipped during 2000-04.


While observed shipments out of Vietnam exceeded 6.4 million tons in 2010 (including
2.3 million tons of high quality white and fragrant rice), the Vietnamese Food
Association (VFA) reports that exports exceeded 6.75 million tons. Sales through the
two state-owned Vinafoods accounted for 80% of all exports, but only 3.2 million tons
were physically executed by these two entities. (The balance was shared with other
exporters.)


According to VFA, high quality shipments represent over one-third of last year's record
movement. Container shipments, which were primarily to Asian destinations,48
accounted for an estimated 20-30% of all exports, but demand can vary from year to
year.

   The first observed shipments of Vietnamese fragrant rice were in 2000. Exports of fragrant rice
exploded in 2004 with over 55,000 tons observed. During 2005-09, identified shipments of fragrant
rice averaged 80,000 tons or five times that shipped in the preceding period.
48
   Vietnam's shipments to NFA and Bulog, however, are exclusively in break bulk vessels.

Market Manipulation Is SOP. The rice market in Vietnam is both an opaque and
“directed” economy. With a goal of ensuring adequate local stocks, policy makers often
regulate the exports by setting export sales quotas and attempt to enforce minimum
export prices (MEP). In a typical year, the export sales quota has been reached by late
summer and a new quota is not issued until the eve of the harvest of the winter-spring
crop in the MRD, which typically begins in late February. During the intervening
months, the execution of previously approved contracts is allowed, but new sales are
not. The government further intervenes in the market by “reserving” certain export
markets for the two Vinafoods.

Policy makers in Hanoi attempt to control Vietnam’s rice economy via the VFA –
helping to partially shield the government from any unpopular decisions. VFA is an
"association" in name only. The VFA is actually an extended arm of Government
administering the rice export management regime (export quantities, MEPs, etc.) on
instructions received from the Rice Export Administration Committee. (The committee
includes the prime minister, the ministers of agriculture and trade, and the VFA.) The
head of Vinafood 2 is the chairman of the association and because of his power in
distributing contracts and because Vinafood 2 owns controlling interest in a number of
what were previously provincially-owned food companies (under the so called "mother-
daughter" system), it is a rare occurrence when he is over-ruled. Both Vinafood 1 and
Vinafood 2, though, are exempt from the administration of both the quotas and MEPs.
Thus, the Vinafoods are able to exploit the export quotas to garner a major share of the
sales in any one year. This year's recent sale to the Philippines, for example, was
concluded in March at $480 CNF (including 270 days credit) at a time when the MEP
for 25% was $480 FOB (basis sight).

The role of the MEP is both long-standing and dynamic. At times the MEP is indicative,
but periodically the authorities tighten the screws and in some period the screws are
tighter than others. In 2008, for example, VFA generally would not approve contracts
with prices below the MEP. (Reportedly, though, there were instances where firms that
were close to Vinafood 2 were allowed to execute contracts at prices below those
posted.) Sometimes decisions by VFA are made on an ad hoc basis and there are
periods (in 2008) when it was not clear what the MEP levels were and others when
MEPs were issued for only one or two grades of rice. Finally, there is no fixed schedule
of when new MEPs will be announced.49

A Look At The #3 Exporter. Kigitraco, which is owned by the People's Committee of
Kien Giang province, was the country's third largest exporter in 2010, exporting
166,000 tons. This provincial exporter has production capacity of 183,000 tons p.a.,
sourced from five factories. Only one of the facilties is a rice mill, the others are
polishing facilities.50 During the last three years, it covered 69% of its average annual
sales of nearly 150,000 tons from outsourcing to other millers and trading companies. It
reported last year that its inventory turnover was just under 49%.51


49
   VFA only episodically posts its MEPs on the internet and then in Vietnamese –
http://www.vietfood.org.vn/vn/default.aspx?c=74
50
   The mill can annually produce 15,000 tons of milled rice and polish 48,000 tons of semi-milled rice.
51
   This is taken from "Strategic Business Plan for Exporting Rice of Kigitraco (2010-2015," a MBA
thesis at Griggs University by Huynh Truc, Mac Kinh Hung, Le Vinh, Dong Thi Y Nhi, and Bui Hong
Thac. March 2011.

Rice Polishing Factories. When Vietnam began large-scale exports in the late 1980s,
virtually all of its rice mills were small, had antiquated machinery, and were S.O.E.s.
As a result, Vietnam was exporting mostly low quality rice. While many of the
provincial food companies invested in upgrading their existing mills and exporting was
generally reserved for the state-owned firms, a number of private businessmen invested
in rice polishing factories which were typically sited on the banks of the Mekong River
and its tributaries.52 Rice polishing factories did not require the extensive supply
networks necessary for rice mills, the rice could be stored longer, and the margins were
better because they could mix good and poorer quality rice. These facilities, which
usually have color sorting machines (and some have specialized packaging equipment),
played a key role in meeting the specifications of overseas buyers and facilitated the
rapid upgrading the quality of rice exported by Vietnam. Initially the factory owners
sold to the various S.O.E., but eventually some of them have begun to act as exporters.
This rice is shipped down the Mekong River on barges carrying up to 1,000 tons.

While accurate, detailed information of the rice polishing sector is limited and new
investments are booming,53 it is reported that the current capacity in the MRD is around
150-200,000 tons per day. Many of the rice polishing factories in the MRD are
clustered in three locations which form a "rice triangle" formed by the intersection of
the Song Tien and Song Hau branches of the Mekong River. The largest cluster is in
Sadec-Lapvo (Dong Thap province), followed by Long Xuyen-Phu Chau (two towns on
opposite river banks in An Giang province), and Thot Not (Cantho). In Thot Not, the
smallest of the three clusters, it is reported that there are some twenty large rice
polishers and another 10-20 smaller factories.54 (Room for expansion is said to be
limited in Thot Not, prompting construction across the Song Hau River in Dong Thap
and elsewhere.)


Hiep Thanh, established in 1989, is one of the larger polishing factories located in Thot
Not. The firm has been successively expanding and now claims to have a processing
capacity of 1 million tons/year, but annual production is reported at 300-350,000 tons.
Its output can be packaged in 10 kg, 25 kg, 30 kg, 45 kg, 50 kg, 25 lb. 50 lb, and 1 ton
jumbo bags.55 Hiep Thanh both sells to Vietnamese rice exporters, but it also is an
exporter in its own right. In 2010, for example, it is credited with exporting over 34,000
tons.




52
   Reflecting the poorly developed roads and the extensive river and canal networks in the MRD, most
rice mills, rice polishers, and traders' warehouses are located along the waterways.
53
   Under decree 119, licensed exporters will be required to have domestic processing facilities.
According to the trade, a single leading rice processing plant manufacturer has orders to build over 60
mills this year.
54
   This discussion of the rice polishing industry is based on interviews with two long-time Vietnamese
rice traders and USDA's office in HCMC.
55
   http://www.hiepthanhgroup.com. These corporate claims (like those in Cambodia) should be treated
with caution. One rice trader advised that these figures are inflated and estimated actual production was
closer to half of that indicated.


                                                   30
Another major rice polisher is Khiem Thanh, which has has factories in An Giang and
Kien Giang provinces.56 The owner of Khiem Thanh is understood to be a relative of the
managing director of Vinafood 2. According to the VFA, Khiem Thanh exported
55,000 tons last year. A direct exporter of 45,000 tons, Hiep Loi is another leading rice
polisher with factories in Thot Not, Sadec, Hau Giang, and An Giang. Others report that
Vinafood 1 has the largest rice polisher with a capacity of 1,000 t.p.d, followed by Hai
Thanh at 500 t.p.d.




56
  One trader, for example, estimated that its capacity was three times that of Hiep Thanh, but the other
claimed that it was one-third smaller.
