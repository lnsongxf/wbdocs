Meanwhile, government deposits reached 8.7
percent of GDP, or US$1.4 billion at the end of
June 2015. The accumulation of government
deposits provides a cushion that the government
can use at times of shocks. For instance,
Cambodia introduced a fiscal stimulus, amounting
to about 2 percent of GDP to mitigate negative
impacts of the global financial crisis. Fiscal policy
has been largely the sole policy instrument to
maintain macroeconomic stability and to mitigate
shocks as the country’s monetary policy is
constrained by its high level of dollarization.

shared prosperity. Market- and private-investment-friendly
policies and targeted public sector investments in irrigation,
agricultural extension, and other “public good” agricultural services, as feasible within the Government’s
total budget, can help to secure continued robust agricultural growth.
The past decade’s agricultural growth story is one of many successes…

     Over the past decade, Cambodia’s agriculture sector has undergone a significant structural
transformation, as reflected in the national accounts and observed in the field during the 2005 and
2013 World Bank surveys. Although it still plays a major role, the agriculture sector has become relatively
less “important” in overall GDP and the total labor force, but more “productive”, i.e., agricultural land and
labor productivity has increased. This transformation has been driven by vibrant and pro-poor agricultural
growth.
    Agricultural growth in Cambodia used to be high. In the period 2004-12, annual growth in gross
production was 8.7 percent. Agricultural GDP grew by an annual average of 5.3 percent during this period.
This exceptional growth rate—among the highest in the world—was driven by crop production, mainly of
paddy rice (annual average growth of 9 percent), but also maize (20 percent), cassava (51 percent), sugarcane
(22 percent), and vegetables (10 percent). Growth in livestock and fisheries, on the other hand, was modest.
    Agricultural growth was pro-poor. Cambodia’s poverty headcount declined from 50 percent in 2007
to 21 percent in 2011, with the    Poor people (million)         Key Drivers of Poverty Reduction 2004-2011

production, which in turn increased farm wages. Further poverty reduction will continue to depend on the
success of
agriculture for many years to come, due to the sector’s major role in the labor force, in value added, and in
exports, as well as the fact that many farmers are among Cambodia’s poorest and more vulnerable citizens.
    Agricultural wages are converging with nonagricultural wages. Agricultural wages grew by 265
percent between the World Bank surveys conducted in 2005 and 2013, while nonfarm wages increased by
60 percent. As a result, the ratio between per worker nonagricultural to agricultural valued-added at current
prices fell to 2.1 in 2012, down from 3.2 in 2004. Returns to farm labor have been increasing.

rice crops in terms of returns to labor but its expansion is
constrained by limited irrigation. The share of total area planted under paddy declined from 86 percent in
2002 to 74 percent in 2011, while the share of planted area for maize and cassava production increased
significantly.
    Even the paddy segment has started to diversify. Triggered by the demand from modernized rice
mills, more farmers are now growing more profitable aromatic paddy, estimated at 10 percent of the rice
cultivated area and 30 percent of total production. Further expansion of farmland under aromatic paddy is
possible with improvements in the quality of seed supply, agricultural extension, and irrigation.
    Yields increased for most crops. With annual growth in cultivated land areas at 4.7 percent and
agricultural gross production at 8.7 percent, average growth of yields was 4 percent during 2004-12. This
growth in yields was triggered by the widespread adoption of improved technologies, expanded (albeit still
limited) irrigation, greater use of modern inputs, and better access to mechanized services, pointing to
advances in commercialization. Farmers also have better access to markets.
    Cambodian farm products remain price competitive at the farm gate. A domestic resource cost
analysis of competitiveness shows that despite rising labor costs and prices of farm inputs, the value-added
generated by farmers exceeds the costs of domestic factors of production (land, labor, and capital). This high
competitiveness explains the significant increase in agricultural exports over the past decade. However, the
competitiveness of ordinary rice produced during the wet season has worsened in recent years and many
small farmers producing ordinary rice have started to lose their competitive edge.
    Past agricultural growth was driven by several factors. Among the major factors were open trade
and, in general, a market-oriented agricultural policy. Cambodia was one of the few developing countries
that did not overact to the 2008 global food price spike, but instead saw higher food prices as an opportunity
to leverage agricultural growth. Other net-exporting countries such as India and Vietnam used export
restrictions to limit transmission of the global food price spike into their markets. Higher agricultural prices
in Cambodia made farmland expansion profitable. In addition, the agriculture sector benefited from: (i)
improved access to overseas markets through the Everything-But-Arms Agreement with the European
Union and open cross-border trade with neighbors; (ii) better availability and wider use of mechanization

services triggered by the higher cost of rural labor; (iii) better farm access to finance; and (iv) private sector
investment in rice mills.
…but there are also challenges

    A large share of the past agricultural growth was driven by farmland expansion. The average
contribution (weighted by crop areas) of land expansion to the change in farm gross margins in real terms
between 2005 and 2013 was 60 percent (Table 1). Farmland expanded annually by 4.7 percent, with very
large increase (128 percent) for cassava.

                         gross margin includes rice, cassava, maize, and vegetables.
                                  Source: 2005 and 2013 World Bank surveys.
    The average increase in per hectare gross margin was solid, at 3.4 percent per year. But this
nonetheless varied between 2.1 percent for dry season rice to 44.5 percent for vegetables. Maize’s per hectare
margin even declined. In many cases, farmers who expanded their land areas received higher incomes, but
farmers with unchanged land areas were unable to substantially increase their incomes. The period of
relatively high food prices was largely used to expand land areas rather than to build a strong foundation
through productivity increases.
    While poverty reduced significantly, the number of vulnerable people also increased
significantly. Most people who escaped poverty did so only by a small margin. The loss of only CR 1,200
per day (the cost of two small water bottles) would cause Cambodia’s poverty rate to double to 40 percent.
This high rate of vulnerability is a sign of still modest agricultural productivity increases. Nutritional security
has also lagged behind the reduction in poverty: although the prevalence of stunting among children under
five declined by 7 percent between 2010 and 2014, it remained at the high rate of 33 percent.

    Vulnerability is greatest among the smallest farms. Small farmers, with land areas of less than one
hectare, reported difficulties in expanding and integrating into emerging modern food value chains. The
share of such farms in the total number of rural households owning land was 48 percent in 2011. Over the
past decade, there has been a trend in Cambodia for large farms (above 3 ha) to become larger and small
farms (less than 1 ha) to become smaller. The average size of the surveyed farms with less than 1 ha in land
declined from 0.99 ha in 2008 to 0.88 ha in 2012, while the average size of medium farms (between 1 and 3
ha) increased from 1.55 ha to 2.38 ha, while the larger farms (above 3 ha) increased from 3.61 ha to 7.03 ha.
Despite the productivity improvements of some small farms in recent years, the productivity of most small
traditional farms has remained low, as agricultural extension and other public services have not reached them
to any great extent. It appears that the income increases for this group of farmers over the past decade have
come largely from higher production values driven by high agricultural prices and the sale of their labor to
larger farms at higher wages, rather than higher land and labor productivity.
    Except for rice, the agro-processing industry has played a limited role in agricultural growth.
Almost all crops were exported to neighboring countries unprocessed. This indicates serious weaknesses in
the value chain, particularly in the post-harvest system of supply chain management (collection of raw
material, storage, finance, logistics, transportation, and information).
What worked in the past will no longer be sufficient in the future

     With global food prices declining and the land frontier diminishing, Cambodian agriculture is
losing its two major growth drivers. Moreover, agricultural labor is becoming scarcer and more expensive,
adding to production costs. Global agricultural prices are projected to decline over the next decade, and
selling low-quality ordinary rice on domestic and foreign markets will become less and less profitable. Relying
on higher domestic demand driven by the increase in GDP and higher global demand alone, without more
efficient use of resources, will not be enough to maintain the high rate of Cambodia’s past agricultural
growth. Cambodia will need to find new drivers to maintain agricultural growth at or close to 5 percent.
    The recent slowdown in agricultural growth in Cambodia may signal a potential longer-term
growth decline. As global food prices have gradually fallen and the global rice market has become more
competitive with the reentry of Thailand and Myanmar, so rice production in Cambodia has stalled. Along
with this, total crop value-added declined, from 4.9 percent in 2012 to 0.6 percent in 2013. Growth in

Cambodia Economic Update October 2015 >> 27
agricultural value-added slowed to 1.6 percent in 2013 after average growth of 5.3 percent in the period
2004-12.
     Returning to a high agricultural growth rate is important. Agriculture still accounts for a large share
of GDP, trade, and the labor force, which means that it will remain the key to further reductions in poverty
and vulnerability in the coming decade. If Cambodia’s structural transformation continues, with agricultural
growth averaging 5 percent, by 2030 Cambodia will have a relatively smaller but more productive agriculture
sector. Agriculture’s shares of GDP and the total labor force are projected to decline to 17 percent and 31
percent, respectively, in 2030, down from 26 percent and 51 percent in 2012. Meanwhile, land productivity
will increase from US$1,300/ha to US$2,700/ha and labor productivity will rise from US$1,200/person to
US$3,700/person in the same period (Table 2).
    By contrast, the cost of slow agricultural growth will be huge. If average agricultural growth is only
3 percent in the period 2012-30, agricultural value-added will be 29 percent lower by 2030 compared with a
5 percent growth scenario. This would have the effect of slicing overall GDP by 18 percent, keeping more
people in agriculture, reducing agricultural labor productivity by 34 percent, and slowing any further income
convergence between farmers and nonfarmers. Lower agricultural growth would also lead to a much slower
reduction in poverty.

     A long-term vision for Cambodian agriculture would need to encompass elements of
sustainability, productivity, competitiveness, and income growth, while shifting away from the still
strong focus on production. Simulation of different scenarios of future agricultural development reveals
that a rise in farm productivity would have the largest positive effect on farm incomes, especially if the shift
from traditional to modern technologies is accompanied by greater efficiencies in modern input use and
irrigation. Farmers producing fragrant rice, processing cassava into dry chips, and undertaking other value
addition activities can increase their incomes further, illustrating the importance of the agro-processing
industry. Lowering production costs through better use of existing resources (e.g., productivity increases)
and minimizing declines in farm output prices through lower logistics costs are key to maintaining farm
competitiveness. Continued land expansion also provides additional income but sustainability considerations
will limit large expansions in the future. This constraint makes agricultural productivity, commercialization,
and diversification even more critical in ensuring future agricultural growth that reduces poverty and boosts
shared prosperity in Cambodia.

Recommendations

a) Continued rapid agricultural growth and further structural transformation in the agriculture
   sector are possible in Cambodia. Four sets of policies together can help support such continued
   agricultural growth during the next five years. The first is maintaining a private-sector-friendly
   agricultural policy environment, with added attention to lowering the regulatory burden in farm input
   sectors. The second is strengthening the environmental sustainability of agricultural production. The
   third is improving the quality of agricultural public programs and, as feasible within Cambodia’s total
   government budget, increasing allocations to more effective programs. The fourth is helping to develop
   the agribusiness and agro-processing industry.


b) Maintaining a Private-Sector-Friendly Agricultural Policy Environment
     Cambodia’s market-oriented agricultural policy and open trade policy helped to achieve high
     past rates of agricultural growth. The private sector has benefited from minimal, if any, interventions
     in farm output and input pricing, from the strong commitment to open trade, including across the
     border, and from the reduction of export costs and time required for export processing. This has created
     conditions for farmers and other players to invest and generate profits. These open trade and market-
     oriented agricultural policies remain critical to future growth and need to be protected by all means
     possible.
     In addition to maintaining a non-distortive agricultural policy, reforms in the seed sector can
     make an important contribution to agricultural growth. Currently, only 10 percent of potential
     paddy seed demand is estimated to be met by the seed supply. Insufficient supply of seeds and their poor
     quality in Cambodia have been among the main reasons for relatively slow productivity improvements,
     placing significant constraints on future agricultural growth mainly because investments in fertilizers and
     machinery pay off only when combined with the use of improved seeds. Many policy distortions exist in
     the seed sector, ranging from a state monopoly in the supply of foundation seeds to the lack of clear and
     conducive regulations for trials, releases, production, and the import of seeds. The regulatory and
     legislative bottlenecks in the seed sector need to be addressed in the coming years.
     Regulations for inputs such as fertilizers can also be improved to reduce costs to farmers.
     Cambodia currently has burdensome requirements for importers of fertilizers to register products and
     apply for import licenses for each imported lot. The procedures should be simplified through the
     approval of import licenses on the basis of product suitability only, and once received all importers
     should be allowed to import any quantity of these registered inputs.


c) Strengthening Environmental Sustainability
     Embedding environmental sustainability in agricultural policy will become increasingly
     important. The rapid farm land expansion, by 4.7 percent annually during 2005-2013, often at the
     expense of forests, is not sustainable. There is a need for a more sustainable expansion of cultivated land,
     through better land-use planning, strengthened land-tenure security, and maintenance of soil fertility
     through better use of available land and promotion of sustainable land management practices.
     International experience shows that the most effective way to promote such practices is to combine
     the enforcement of natural resource protection with agricultural extension and other public programs
     that increase land users’ awareness of the longer-term costs and benefits, and promote the adoption of
     modern technologies.


Cambodia Economic Update October 2015 >> 29
   With more farmers using agricultural chemicals for vegetable and other crop production, the
   Government would need to strengthen public health regulations related to their safe use and
   promote alternative programs that ensure safe, effective and environmentally sound pest
   management. These alternative programs include integrated pest management, where the pest
   population is controlled through biological controls, cultural practices and the development and use of
   crop varieties that are pest resistant or tolerant.


d) Improving Agricultural “Public Goods” Investment
   Future agricultural growth will need to come from productivity improvements,
   commercialization, and diversification, all of which strongly depend on effective “public goods”
   investment in agriculture. The relatively small size of most farms in Cambodia and their large numbers
   (about 50 percent of farms in Cambodia are up to 1 ha) require more resources for service provisions
   than in countries with large farms and few farmers. Public programs proven worldwide to contribute to
   long-term agricultural growth include those for irrigation, research, extension, education, vocational
   training, food safety, and provision of market information. While these programs exist in Cambodia,
   they have little to show in terms of their contribution to past agricultural growth. The main reason for
   this is their low efficiency and effectiveness. Many programs are poorly designed and have a weak
   implementation record. Most expenditure goes towards capital and wages, with little spent on operations
   and maintenance. Relatively low funding levels are another reason for the weak record of some of these
   programs in Cambodia.
   Agricultural extension needs more attention. This program is critical to strengthen farmers’ skills
   and knowledge to adopt modern farm practices and diversify their rice-based farming systems. The
   recently adopted Agricultural Extension Policy creates the good enabling environment to pilot alternative
   approaches to deliver extension services, including through subcontracting of private sector for service
   provision. Moreover, extension needs to become more gender sensitive as female-headed households
   and women in male-headed households have different needs than men due to the different roles they
   play in agricultural production, and given women’s time constraints and limited mobility that affects their
   access to training.
   Irrigation investments deserve special attention. Without reliable access to affordable water in a
   tropical country such as Cambodia, it is hard to expect intensification and commercialization. Farmers’
   access to water in the dry season, when it is mostly needed, has improved only marginally. Irrigation
   coverage in Cambodia is among the lowest in Asia, despite the fact that most resources allocated to
   irrigation investments have been spent on primary infrastructure. While irrigation coverage needs to be
   further expanded, this expansion needs to go hand-in-hand with the extension of secondary canals, the
   rehabilitation and upgrading of the existing systems, investments in participatory management of
   irrigation and drainage infrastructure and better coordination of irrigation/flood management with the
   delivery of other agricultural public services.




                                                                         Cambodia Economic Update October 2015 >> 30
     Greater attention is also merited to the integrating of small farms into modern food value chains.
     Public extension services are especially important for these farms because they are unlikely to receive
     sufficient extension services from the private sector, while without improved farm management skills
     and information they will stay poor and vulnerable, disconnected from economic transformation
     processes. Small farms, including households participating in social land concessions, can be supported
     through public services to facilitate stronger links with the agribusiness and agro-processing industry,
     through productive partnerships (e.g., contract farming and farmer organizations), training in business
     and other skills, and the provision of market information.


e) Helping Develop the Agribusiness and Agro-processing Industry
     Although development of the agribusiness and agro-processing industry should be considered
     part of the improvement in the overall business environment in Cambodia, several areas with a
     strong impact on agribusiness development will involve government action. These include
     investments in: (i) increased access to and reduced costs of electricity (one kilowatt of electricity in
     Cambodia costs between US$0.16 and US$0.23 compared to US$0.13 in Thailand and US$0.08 in
     Vietnam), to increase profit margins in the processing industry and stimulate private investments; (ii)
     better food safety and sanitary and phytosanitary capacity, to help Cambodian firms meet importers’
     requirements and capture foreign markets and help them to compete with the increasing food imports
     triggered by Cambodians’ rising incomes and demand for more diversified diets; (iii) export logistics, to
     reduce transaction costs; and (iv) improved access to finance, including through warehouse receipts, to
     create new investment opportunities for the processing and trade industry.
     Future agricultural growth at the previous high rates and further structural transformation are
     possible in Cambodia. Slower agricultural growth cannot become the new normal. More attention to
     sustainability, the quality of agricultural services, an enabling policy environment, and implementation
     will be critical in turning these possibilities into reality. It is well worth trying.
