of power supply by reducing outages or improving voltage
conditions will boost customers’ willingness to pay the full
cost of service for electricity supply. Increases in tariffs will in

contribute to improved reliability of power supply.
•    An electricity tariff adjustment path to reach full
cost recovery in the next three to four years is critical
for sustainable power supply in Vietnam. If gradually

2012.

or LOLE). If one of the subsystems lacks the reserve capacity
to meet the load demand in a region, the amount of energy
and capacity required from the nearby subsystem will be
calculated. The LOLE criterion used in PMP7 was 24 hours
of expected blackouts per year, which is equivalent to a
99.7 percent reliability rate. A combination of hydrological
scenarios was built using a combination of four different rain
levels to ascertain what amount of reserve capacity could be
put aside.
The various generation capacity forecasts are shown in Table

In the EVNNPT’s latest investment plan, capital expenditures
in the transmission grid in the same period reach VND 135
trillion. Investments in transmission facilities are mainly
driven by the development of transmission facilities
connecting the northern region, where most generation is
located, with the southern area of the country. Moreover,
from 2018 onwards new investments are likely planned by
the EVNNPT with the aim of accommodating the power
output from a nuclear power plant, which is expected to be
commissioned after 2020.

2.5.3. Distribution
Investments in distribution networks are executed by the
PCs based on regional master plans. According to the latest
information provided by the PCs, total expenditures during
2014–20 will be around VND 180 trillion.

2.5.4. Summary
According to its CAPEX plan for 2014–20 for all subsidiaries,

would be tight and the company would need to draw on the
stabilization fund. This can be achieved most effectively with
support from a commercial bank, which would be committed
to providing EVN with the necessary short-term funding
in dry years. The government may need to make an initial
contribution to the fund, although ideally this would be
reimbursed relatively quickly.
The arrangements for the fund will require scrutiny by EVN’s
auditors, lawyers, and the regulator to ensure that they
comply fully with Vietnamese accounting and tax laws and
are consistent with regulatory directives. EVN must take the
initiative in putting forward proposals for the operation and
governance of the fund because it has by far the greatest
interest of any stakeholder in seeing the fund established.

The distribution companies have similar opportunities
as the EVNNPT in taking forward the restructuring plan
independently from EVN Corporate. While they are
slightly behind the EVNNPT in their readiness to operate
as independent companies, their position is broadly
similar and they can proceed along a similar path. The
distribution companies should also aim to appoint one
or more independent non-executive directors in the near
term, and they should take more of a lead in submission
to the ERAV (while recognizing that they are in a different
position from the EVNNPT). Because retail power prices
are set nationally, submissions and negotiations with the
distribution companies will have to be coordinated between
them and cannot be conducted independently. However, the
distribution companies as a group can take a more central
role in putting forward tariff proposals. They can follow a
similar approach to the EVNNPT’s in taking forward their
position as independent companies, and the proposals
suggested above are applicable to them. In addition, there

     •   The distribution companies are involved in a
     number of non-core activities, such as running guest
     houses. They should each develop a plan to withdraw
     from these activities so as to focus their investment
     programs on core activities in the power sector.
     •    The distribution companies all have very high
     levels of frequency and duration of power interruptions.

     hinder the actual unbundling of these companies.

changes in demand by adjusting its investment program—
increasing investment if demand grows faster than expected,
and reducing investment if demand grows more slowly. In
practice, EVN does make adjustments of this sort. However,
in principle, EVN is bound to the investment program set
out in the Power Master Plan (PMP). The PMP is a sound

updates. The separation of the planning of the system from
the management of the sector is unsound and it would be
preferable for the plan to be revised and updated regularly,
every one to two years, by key sector players such as MOIT
and EVNNPT. Otherwise, there is a risk of the plan becoming
increasingly separated from reality as demand grows faster
or slower than expected.

experts state that the government had decided to list some
SOEs (or part of them, because of a PM decision about

country is not investment grade as it was downgraded. The

in most cases, it requires collateral from investors. According
to some experts, bond issuance backed by the government
could be the simpler and faster way to move ahead.
Regarding equity, for not very large projects, local investors

industrial foreign companies have the ability and the

PERFORMANCE OF THE MOIT
Investors believe the MOIT is capable of negotiating
IPPs. However, they consider that there is considerable
scope for speeding up the approval process (that is, the

dealing with IPPs and, as a result, there are long intervals
between meetings with potential investors. The process
could be speeded up if the MOIT adopted standard contract
FQEWOGPVCVKQPTCVJGTVJCPPGIQVKCVKPIGCEJ+22HTQOƂTUV
principles.
Another criticism of the MOIT is that it seeks to progress
projects in every region rather than going with those projects
that are most ready to move. Also, they change staff too
often. High-level authorities push for the project to move
ahead but the mid-level bureaucracy delays because of the
details. However, according to some people involved in
negotiations, the main reason for these delays is that there
is no incentive for mid-level managers to sign off on projects
(and many signatures are needed) and they face a lot of
risks (being accused of corruption). Other developers have
a different view: they state that the context of negotiation of
old BOT projects was totally different in the past as BOT was
