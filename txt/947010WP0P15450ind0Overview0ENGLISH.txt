                         A successful decade with
                                challenges ahead


By most measures, the 2000s were one of the most impressive decades for economic
development in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). With the exception of 2009, the region’s
gross domestic product per capita grew consistently at an average rate of 2.5 percent between
2000 and 2012. During the same period, and despite being one of the most unequal regions in
the world, inequalities reduced substantially. The regional Gini coefficient for per capita income,
for instance, decreased by an unprecedented five percentage points, from 0.57 in 2000 to 0.52
in 2012.
    Sustained economic growth, joint with substantial reductions in income inequality, led
to remarkable increases in the incomes of those at the bottom of the income distribution.
                                                                                                         7
Accordingly, poverty in LAC decreased by more than 16 percentage points within a single
decade, from 41.6 percent in 2003 to 25.3 percent in 2012. Furthermore, extreme poverty was
cut in half, from 24.5 percent to 12.3 percent (Figure 1).1 Overall, a remarkable 70 million people
moved out of poverty: the strongest poverty reduction performance of the region in decades.
    Another facet of the dramatic reduction in poverty was the emergence of a large middle class,2
which increased from about 23 percent of the population in 2003 to 34 percent in 2012, and in
2010 for the first time exceeded the number of people living in poverty (Figure 1). Nevertheless,
LAC is not yet a middle class region: most people exiting poverty did not join the ranks of the
middle class, but the ranks of a “vulnerable” class that remains at risk of falling back into poverty.
The predominance of the vulnerable class in LAC is changing the social policy dialogue in the
region, where recent concerns have focused on how to establish more integrated safety nets for
people who have managed to exit poverty but still remain vulnerable (Ferreira et al 2012).
    In spite of these dramatic advances, one in four Latin Americans today remain poor. Those
who experience shocks that cause them to fall temporarily into poverty are considered to
be the “transitory poor”. However, many people are born into poverty and never escape their
poverty status: these are the “chronic poor”. The chronic poor have not benefitted much from
the impressive growth rates of the 2000’s and may have fallen into the cracks of the social
assistance system; they have been left behind. Furthermore, the prospects of them escaping
poverty in the near future are weak. GDP growth has slowed significantly, from about six percent
in 2010 to an estimated 0.8 percent in 2014. As a result, improved labor market prospects may
not prove to be sufficient for the chronic poor to escape poverty.

LEFT BEHIND
                                   A framework to study
                                         chronic poverty


Studying chronic poverty involves both conceptual and empirical challenges.
Conceptually, chronic poverty is a notion that involves both a welfare and a time dimension: it
is therefore complex in nature. In this book we use a simple conceptual framework to order our
thoughts of what characterizes and drives chronic poverty. The framework involves the close
interaction of two features: a set of inputs that influence the process of upward mobility. The
first concept draws from existing literature on poverty traps, while the second draws from Sen’s
capabilities approach (see also Carter and Barrett 2006, and Cord and Lopez-Calva 2012).
    Figure 2 summarizes our framework. We divide inputs into endowments, the enabling
context, and the state of mind. First, poverty exists and persists due to constraints which
                                                                                                       9
prohibit the optimal accumulation and use of existing endowments, such as skills and physical
assets. Second, an enabling context is also a necessary input: poverty chronicity may arise
not because endowments are low per se, but because of factors that affect the returns to those
endowments differentially. In other words, households with similar endowments that live in
different contexts may face different trajectories in life.
    The third input is the state of mind which plays a central driver of chronic poverty. An
emerging field of research studies the ways in which the state of mind may affect people’s
life trajectories and the resulting implications for social policies, and as such we give it special
attention (see also the 2015 World Bank’s World Development Report). Behavioral factors are
especially important in understanding chronic poverty, as it has been established that the
condition of poverty places additional and excessive pressure on people, influencing their state
of mind and decision making process in a more pronounced way than for wealthier people.
These constrained mental resources influence the process of decision making in a wide range
of ways, which may perpetuate poverty across generations. Constrained mental resources can
lead to placing greater focus on short-term rather than long-term problems, even if focusing on
long-term issues would lead to better outcomes over time (Banerjee and Mullainathan, 2010).
For example, the fact that people in poverty must devote much of their mental resources to
tackle survival - problems associated with their basic needs can lead to underinvestment in their
children’s upbringing.
    Another key aspect of the state of mind is the role of aspirations, or the presence of forward-
looking goals and a preference to attain them (Locke and Latham 2002). Sen’s capability
approach makes it clear that a weak capacity to aspire can reduce the capability to act in order
to achieve the desired outcomes. For instance, a weak capacity to aspire is associated with a
limited temporal horizon that could translate into low savings, opting out of good investments, or

                                                     such a process is therefore also important. The first step is to “engage in decision making.”

                                                     including: the person i) does not know that the option exists, ii) determines based that the
                                                     opportunity falls outside of his or her abilities, or iii) has low aspirations that cause him or her
                                                     to think that this endeavor is likely to fail, despite one’s best efforts. The context could also
                                                     amplify these effects via the presence of social norms: local peer effects may accentuate low

                                                         After considering an opportunity, there is a need to transform choices into “actions.” The

                                                     lengthy process in which an individual evaluates costs and benefits towards ultimately deciding
                                                     whether or not to take action. The decision to take action is also affected by endowments,
                                                     context, and the state of mind.
    The final part of the process of upward mobility is the conversion (the more traditional
part of the overall process), where again all three inputs play an important role. In general, the
productivity of the investment will depend on individual ability and effort; hence, endowments
such as skills and assets are central. An enabling context will also by design affect the returns:
for example, an uninsured weather shock may reduce yields by destroying part of the harvest.
Finally, the state of mind may also affect outcomes in this stage of the process: positive peer
effects and social norms (themselves partly driven by context) may improve motivation and
effort, which in turn enhance the likelihood of success (Macours and Vakis 2014).
    Note that the framework remains silent on the ways in which these various elements
interact with one another. There are many ways in which low levels of endowments, a disabling
context, or a suboptimal state of mind can affect the different stages of the process, giving rise
to a state of chronic poverty induced by different channels. This highlights the policy challenges
involved in both the identification of the chronic poor as well as the design of effective policies
for poverty reduction.

                                     absence of longitudinal data
In addition to conceptual challenges, studying chronic poverty in Latin America and the
Caribbean also presents an empirical challenge: the almost complete lack of longitudinal data
in the region. Thus, an important contribution of this book is its methodological approach to the
measurement of chronic poverty. In order to capture chronic poverty between 2004 and 2012 in
Latin America, we rely on an innovative technique originally proposed by Dang et al. (2014) and
improved by Dang and Lanjouw (2014), which uses information contained into repeated cross-
sectional data to construct “synthetic” panels. The book contains several validation exercises
that suggest that although synthetic panels are far from being a substitute to actual panels, they
are among the most accurate remedies in the absence of longitudinal data.

                                                     we discuss five stylized facts that largely characterize chronic poverty in the region. Together
                                                     with our conceptual framework, we then rely on these facts to structure the policy discussion.

                                                     By 2012, one in five Latin Americans had been chronically poor since 2004, representing more
                                                     than 130 million people (Table 1). The table also indicates that out of 100 poor people in 2004,
                                                     only half escaped poverty, while about eight percent of the non-poor also fell into poverty.
                                                        Chronic poverty and downward mobility both vary considerably across countries. Figure

                                                     became poor between 2004 and 2012 for each country. Uruguay, Argentina and Chile have the
                                                     lowest rates of chronic poverty, with rates around 10 percent. On the other extreme, Nicaragua,
                                                     Honduras, and Guatemala have rates of chronic poverty significantly higher than the regional
                                                     average of 21 percent, ranging from 37 percent in Nicaragua to a shocking 50 percent in

       PPP = purchasing power parity. Total poverty does not necessarily match country-specific poverty rates since
       these are estimated based on the synthetic panel approach which uses a sub-population of households with
       adult household heads (see section 2 for more details).

                                           geographically concentrated
Geographic context characterizes chronic poverty to a great extent. Figure 4 presents chronic
poverty rates at the level of subnational regions for every household survey that is representative
at that level of disaggregation (for a total of 168 regions). Chronic poverty appears to vary
considerably both across and within Latin American countries, with some regions showing
incidence rates higher than sixty percent, while others have rates of less than ten percent.
Taking Brazil as an example, Santa Catarina has a chronic poverty rate of about five percent,
which is lower than the national average of 20 percent and close to the average for Uruguay, the
best performing country in Latin America in terms of chronic poverty. By contrast, approximately
40 percent of the population in Ceara is chronically poor, which is twice the national average and
comparable to Honduras, a country with one of the highest chronic poverty rates in the region.
Finally, chronic poverty in Tocantins is similar to the regional average for Latin America and the
Caribbean.

                                                          However, looking exclusively at poverty rates only provides half of the picture, as a large

                                                     regions with the highest rates of chronic poverty: in Mexico, for instance, while the incidence of

                                                     implies that in absolute terms the Mexican capital hosts almost 3 percent of LAC’s chronic poor,

                                                     households in Latin America. In contrast, Baja California (Mexico) is home to only 0.2 percent

                                                          Fact 3: Chronic poverty is as much an
                                                                 issue in urban as in rural areas
    Residing in rural areas is often associated with higher poverty persistence (Figure 6a). For
    example, in Bolivia, with overall chronic poverty rates of around 20 percent, rural poverty
    chronicity is three times as large and more than 20 percentage points higher than in urban areas.
                            Nevertheless, despite the much higher rates of chronic poverty in rural areas, chronic
    poverty is as much an urban as a rural issue. Considering the absolute number of people, urban
    areas in many countries contain higher numbers of chronic poor between 2004 and 2012 than
    rural areas. Figure 6b presents the ratio of the absolute numbers of chronic poor in urban relative
    to rural areas (vertical axis) against the level of urbanization (horizontal axis). Numbers higher
    than one indicate more urban chronic poor compared to rural. The figure shows that in at least
    five countries (Chile, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and the Dominican Republic), the number of urban
    chronic poor surpasses the number of rural chronic poor, and the number of urban and rural
    chronic poor is approximately equal in many other countries. In Brazil, for example, for every one
    chronic poor household in rural areas, there are two that live in urban areas.

                                                     Additionally, chronic poor heads of households in urban areas have on average six years of
                                                     education, compared to less than four years of education on average for their rural counterparts.
                                Fact 4: Economic growth was not
                                      sufficient to lift the chronic
                                              poor out of poverty
The impressive economic growth of the 2000s had little positive impact on the lives of the
chronic poor for two main reasons. First, countries with the highest rates of chronic poverty
grew the least. For example, Guatemala grew less than one percent per year, with approximately
50 percent of the initial poor still mired in poverty in 2012. On the other hand, Panama grew 6
percent annually, with only 20 percent of the population trapped in poverty between 2004 and
2012.
   Second, chronic poor households tend to be poorer than originally poor households who
managed to escape poverty, rendering economic growth insufficient to lift them out of poverty.
Panel (a) in Figure 7 presents the initial and final income levels of those who exited poverty
between 2004 and 2012. Those who were initially poor in 2004 but escaped poverty by 2012
earned initially a per capita income of $3 a day in 2005 PPP terms, and their net increase was       17
almost $3, leading to a median income of $6 a day in 2012. These trends are generalized in
almost all of the 17 countries in this analysis. Meanwhile, panel (b) shows that although the
chronic poor also experienced income growth during this period, with median incomes growing
from $1.50 to $2.70 per day, this income growth was not sufficient to lift them out of poverty.
   Equally important, income growth for the chronic poor was systematically lower than for
those who escaped poverty. For the whole region, the chronic poor experienced an annualized
income growth rate of 7.9 percent, compared with 9 percent among those that escaped poverty.




                        Fact 5: The chronic poor have limited
                                        income opportunities
Labor income was by far the biggest driver behind the strong reduction in poverty observed
between 2004 and 2012 in the region. Unfortunately, it appears that the chronic poor face
stronger barriers to enter the labor force and rely relatively more on non-labor incomes. They are
also more active in low productivity or subsistence sectors.
   Figure 8 shows the number of labor income earners in a given household for 2012. A clear
pattern emerges: in every country there were fewer labor income earners among chronic
poor households, compared to poor households who escaped poverty as well as non-poor
households. On average, chronic poor households have 20 percent less human resources to
generate income relative to other households. In contrast, there does not appear to be a large
difference in the number of labor income earners between the never-poor and those that
managed to exit poverty.

              A similar story emerges when we look at female labor market participation. Gender equality
is crucial for poverty reduction, as higher economic opportunities for women can enhance
broader productivity gains and households’ economic perspectives (World Bank 2013).
However, although Latin America has been the region with the largest increase in female labor
force participation since the 1980s, with the entry of more than 70 million women into the labor
force, it does not appear that the chronic poor benefited greatly from these trends. In 2012,
female labor force participation was lagging significantly among chronic poor households in
almost every country, with participation rates 16 percentage points lower than for the non-poor.
              In addition to more limited labor force participation, the chronic poor also tend to work in
lower productivity sectors. For instance, an analysis of sectoral employment of the chronic poor
across subnational regions shows that regions with a high concentration of people employed in
agriculture also tend to have higher rates of chronic poverty, while high tech industry, services,
construction, and retail are more likely to employ more people in regions with lower rates of
chronic poverty.

                                                     In this section, we return to our conceptual framework and focus on certain key
                                                     drivers of chronic poverty. Particular attention is paid to interactions between endowments
                                                     and the enabling context, as well as to the role of the state of mind in limiting aspirations and
                                                     hampering the process of upward mobility.

                                                     during the decade and those that remained non-poor throughout the 2004 to 2012 period.
                                                     Interestingly, while the initial endowments of the chronic poor are markedly different from
                                                     those of the non-poor, they are similar to the initial endowments of those who escaped poverty.
                                                     Although the chronic poor were on average somewhat poorer than those who escaped poverty,
                                                     as mentioned above, Table 2 shows that other characteristics are fairly similar between the two
                                                     groups.
                                                        The primary difference between the chronic poor and those who escaped poverty is with

                                                     regards to access to services. In 2004, only 79 percent of the chronic poor had access to water,
                                                     compared to 89 and 95 percent for those that escaped poverty and the non-poor, respectively.
                                                     Similarly, only 58 percent of the chronic poor had a minimum level of assets,3 compared to 78
                                                     and 90 percent for the other two groups, respectively. Services, however, represent one aspect
                                                     of the context in which households live, which appears to play a large role in the chronicity of
                                                     poverty.

                                               The disabling context matters
                                                                 a great deal
The context in which people live has an impact on their opportunities as well as on the returns to
endowments and characteristics. Accordingly, we can observe a positive association between
higher rates of chronic poverty and availability of services. Figure 9 relates chronic poverty rates
with access to services, measured as the percentage of the population in each subnational
region across Latin America that had access to certain services in 2012. Regions with lower
rates of access to clean water, sewage systems, or sanitation facilities tend to have higher rates
of chronic poverty. Similarly, the chronic poor are more likely to reside in regions with lower
coverage of electricity or mobile communications (even though these correlations are weaker,
partly due to improvements in the accessibility of both services during the last decade). It also
appears that services complement one another as drivers of chronic poverty: as the last panel in
Figure 9 shows, households with no access to three or more basic services are also more likely
to reside in regions with higher levels of chronic poverty.

          The importance of both endowments and context as drivers of chronic poverty raises the
question of the relative importance of each factor. While the answer is necessarily context-
specific, a simple decomposition of differences in income between the chronic poor and those
who escaped poverty shows that returns to endowments (which are dependent on context)
matter at least as much, if not more than endowments (Figure 10).
          Supporting individuals is therefore necessary, but may not be sufficient if their context
does not provide them with the scope to embrace opportunities. Without an enabling context,
chronic poverty may prevail, as people will be unable to effectively utilize their endowments.
Thus, regional development efforts must be implemented in conjunction with social policies
focused on improving context. Thus far, we have associated context with services; in fact, all
external factors that influence returns to endowments and households’ decisions should be
considered aspects of the context in which households reside. While the universe of relevant
external factors is too numerous to be reviewed in its entirety, we next discuss two key factors:
institutions and uninsured risk.

The type and quality of national and local institutions have a strong impact on welfare in general
and chronic poverty in particular. It is easier for the poor to escape poverty if their voices are heard
                                                     and taken into consideration. Thus, the poor must be represented by leaders that understand
                                                     the challenges and the needs that they face. Local governments, services, and social programs
                                                     must also be staffed by qualified civil servants who discharge their duties so as to address the
                                                     needs of the poor, rather than posing as additional obstacles.
                                                         The foundation for such an institution is an inclusive social contract that recognizes every
                                                     citizen as equal and supports efforts to provide equal opportunities to all. Without such a solid
                                                     foundation, it is nearly impossible to eradicate poverty. Robinson (2014), for instance, looks
                                                     at the evolution of the social contract in Colombia – both over time and across regions – and
                                                     documents various channels through which poor governance and elite capture of the political
                                                     process pose significant obstacles to poverty.
                                                         However, a strong and inclusive social contract is in itself insufficient to guarantee strong
                                                     institutions. In order to operate effectively and support citizens, institutions must function well
                                                     at three levels: 1) there must be sufficient bureaucratic capacity to deliver good services, 2)
                                                     the state must have credibility in the enforcement of the legal framework and justice system,
       24                                            and 3) institutional processes must be transparent and follow clear accountability rules
                                                     (Fukuyama 2012).
                                                         The importance of bureaucratic capacity is often greatly underestimated. Social programs
                                                     often have low impact on the chronic poor because they reside in poorer regions where there
                                                     is lower capacity to effectively implement social programs. For example, Loayza, Rigolini and
                                                     Calvo-Gonzalez (2014) study the ability of Peruvian municipalities to spend additional budget
                                                     streams generated from mining revenues. They find that while poorer municipalities spend a
                                                     larger share of the additional budget allocated to them (signifying greater need), with all else held
                                                     equal, municipalities with lower average educational attainments have a lower ability to spend
                                                     the additional budget. In a similar vein, Galasso (2011) studies the impact of Chile Solidario,
                                                     a complex social intermediation service that aims at tailoring assistance to the needs of the
                                                     extreme poor, finding that the impacts of the program are significantly higher when extreme poor
                                                     families are assisted by social workers with positive performance assessments.

                                                     The chronic poor in the region also face disproportionately high levels of uninsured risk. For
                                                     example, there is a positive correlation between countries with higher chronic poverty and the
                                                     prevalence of natural disasters. In the absence of some form of insurance and savings, shocks
                                                     can have long-term implications and exacerbate chronic poverty, particularly if repeated. Shocks
                                                     can lead to reductions in welfare by directly depleting assets, triggering coping mechanisms

                                                     also lead to slow recovery or even poverty traps, with evidence increasingly establishing that
                                                     shocks can impact welfare on a long-term basis.

                         The depressed state of mind and lowered aspirations of the chronic poor can be a strong obstacle
                         to upward mobility. This relationship likely goes both ways: poverty leads to a depressed state
                         of mind, which in turn lowers aspirations and the chances for upward mobility, potentially
                         perpetuating a vicious cycle of poverty. Such a relation can be observed at various levels. At the
                         country level, expectations about the future are lower in those countries where the incidence of
                         chronic poverty is higher (see Figure 11). For example, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras, the
                         countries with the highest chronic poverty rates in the region, are also among those countries
                         with the lowest levels of positive expectations for the future.

                                                  Source: Chronic poverty comes from authors’ calculations using SEDLAC data (CEDLAS and the World Bank). Data
                                                     on expectations of wellbeing (“Do you think that in the next 12 months your economic situation will be better/
                                                     same/worse?”) come from LAPOP 2010.



                                                   Similar trends can also be observed at the regional level: people living in provinces where
                         the incidence of chronic poverty is higher tend to be more pessimistic about their economic
                         prospects, indicating that location and context may play a role in influencing not only returns to
                         endowments, but also attitudes and aspirations.
                                                   Differences in perceptions about the future across socioeconomic groups are also striking.
                         For example, the chronic poor in Latin America are the most pessimistic about their future
                         outlooks, with one out of every five expecting their economic situation to worsen in the next
                                                     year, a rate twice as high as the rate of those who exited poverty or who were never poor (Figure
                                                     12). The chronic poor are also half as likely to expect their situation to improve in the future
                                                     compared to those who exited poverty. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who exited poverty are
                                                     the most optimistic, even among those who were never poor, consistent with causal evidence on
                                                     how positive events can affect people’s outlook in life.

                                                         Social norms and peer effects also influence the state of mind, behaviors and aspirations.
                                                     Paraphrasing Appadurai (2004) and Ray (2006), “Aspirations are socially determined, and thus
                                                     the capacity to aspire is inherently unequal between rich and poor. This has the consequence
                                                     that the poor lack the aspirational resources (or capacity) to act and change the conditions of
                                                     their own poverty.” The poor might therefore choose not to invest in the future, in part because
                                                     of their own experiences, but also because those that are close to them may suggest that
                                                     escaping poverty is not a feasible option. Breaking such a transmission channel is essential.

                                                     Just as context matters for the physical aspects of chronic poverty, the behavioral context also
                                                     matters, and thus learning about the positive experiences of others can be beneficial to one’s
                                                     own aspirations.
                               Increasing the aspirations of poor children is of particular importance. Figure 13 plots the
educational aspirations of Peruvian children against those of their peers, defined as children
of a similar age residing in the same community. The relationship is strong: children living in
communities where the aspirations of their peers are high in terms of the level of educational
attainment also have higher aspirations (and vice versa), suggesting that social interactions can
offer a mechanism that can trigger positive changes in the decision making process.

Chronic poverty is also transmitted from parents to children. Morally, the context into which
children are born should not affect their chances of success in life or their ability to improve their
endowments. Nonetheless, children born into contexts of poverty are less likely to have access
to the opportunities available to non-poor children, which creates a channel for low mobility and
poverty persistence across generations.
                               Differences persist along the schooling ages. Figure 14 shows the 2012 incidence of
finishing primary and middle school grades between children from chronic poor families and
children from families that were never poor. In all countries, children from chronic poor families
are severely disadvantaged in schooling outcomes. For example, in the case of Peru, a child
from a chronic poor household has a 34 percent probability of finishing middle school on time,
compared to 60 percent for children from never poor families.

                                                     aspirations of their parents, which tend to be lower among the chronic poor.
LEFT BEHIND
                  From diagnosis to policies:
                 design elements supporting
                            the chronic poor


Chronic poverty is a complex phenomenon, and as such, there is no single approach
with which it can be eliminated. Moreover, policies must be consistent with a variety of country-
specific factors, including the social contract and political vision in society, existing budgets,
bureaucratic capacity, and the overall institutional setting (including existing social programs).
In recognition of the complexity and specificity of policy design, we refrain from presenting a
comprehensive review of all factors affecting chronic poverty or concrete recommendations for
the design of policies supporting the chronic poor. Instead, we offer elements of policy design        29
that should be collectively taken into consideration in the design of social protection programs.



                                                   Improving endowments
                                                  and the enabling context
We begin first by synthesizing findings on endowments and the enabling context that are
relevant for policy design. We then investigate an area of increasing relevance in the policy
arena: the coordination of poverty reduction efforts to build social protection systems that
effectively assist the poor.
    Supporting the chronic poor vs. improving the environment they live in. The environment
in which people live matters at least as much as their skills and characteristics, if not more:
for instance, the same chronically poor family living in a remote district of the Andean sierra or
Amazon selva might not be poor if they were to live in São Paulo, Bogota, or Lima. Returns to skills
and characteristics depend very much on local environment and available opportunities. Given
an equal level of skills, access to paved roads results in more trade and better opportunities
to sell one’s products. Industrialization brings manufacturing jobs, which generally offer higher
wages than the agricultural sector. Areas with universal health coverage are better able to help
people cope with one of the most damaging types of shocks. Better policing reduces crime rates
and improves the profitability of local businesses. Thus, an optimal social policy should balance
direct support to the chronic poor with broader investments that improve the environment in
which they reside.
    Address the intergenerational transmission of chronic poverty. The context where a child
is born should not affect her or his chances to succeed in life. Nonetheless, malnutrition, poor
stimulation, fragile health, absent parents, and a risky or violent environment are factors that
                                                     keep people mired in poverty and limit their ability to develop to their full potential. Furthermore,
                                                     these differences become amplified over time; thus, by the time that social programs finally
                                                     reach the adult population, some of the chronic poor may no longer have the skills and/or
                                                     mindset necessary to escape poverty. For policymakers, it is therefore both a challenge and
                                                     an opportunity to break the chronic poverty cycle early in the life cycle. The emerging policy
                                                     dialogue and integration of early childhood development into the social development agenda in
                                                     the region is therefore welcome and should be further expanded.
                                                         Limited labor income: both a cause and a consequence of chronic poverty. Boosting labor
                                                     income is among the few ways to sustainably lift people out of poverty. The limited and often sub-
                                                     optimal labor income opportunities of the chronic poor can pose a significant obstacle to chronic
                                                     poverty reduction. As such, comprehensive poverty reduction programs should include labor
                                                     income promotion strategies such as training and labor insertion programs. As the discussion
                                                     above indicates, large inequalities early in life can result in fewer skills and aspirations in
                                                     adulthood, severely weakening the potential impacts of income generation programs. Income

     30                                              promotion strategies alone cannot therefore be expected to eliminate chronic poverty.
                                                         Coverage and geography: focus on urban as well as rural areas. Many social programs base
                                                     geographic coverage decisions on the incidence of poverty; as a result, many programs operate
                                                     mostly in rural areas where poverty incidence is the highest. However, this report has shown
                                                     that in many instances, even if the incidence of chronic poverty is higher in rural areas, more
                                                     chronic poor families live in urban areas. Expanding programs to reach urban areas will require
                                                     addressing issues beyond coverage and identification: the urban poor are more mobile than
                                                     the rural poor, making them more difficult to identify and support. The rural and urban poor also
                                                     have different sources of income, in addition to facing different types of shocks and sources of
                                                     vulnerabilities that may keep them in poverty. Overall, supporting the urban poor may be more

                         Nevertheless, in addition to the generosity of the social assistance programs, better
alignment of policies and initiatives under a systematic and coordinated approach is needed
to address chronic poverty. Coordination implies that social assistance programs will not only
need to have clear and measurable goals, but will need to be included into a comprehensive
poverty reduction framework in which programs and initiatives are able to communicate and
collaborate with one another.
                         Coordination is needed at all levels. At the level of the state, there must be a broad agreement
that social programs are not populist initiatives but effective social inclusion tools. To achieve
such a consensus, the generosity of benefits and type of programs may need to be adjusted
to societal perceptions of the scope of mutual help and solidarity. At the level of the executive
branch, ministries and programs must be given adequate resources and technically competent
program staff that are shielded from political pressures should be appointed. Furthermore,
poverty reduction strategies should ensure that ministries and agencies are not only given clear
and measurable goals to which they are held accountable, but that they work towards these
goals in a coordinated manner.
                         Unfortunately, more often than not, programs, agencies, and ministries do not coordinate
with one another, substantially limiting the effectiveness of poverty reduction efforts. In order to
cope with these issues, many countries in LAC have established coordinating agencies. These
agencies take many forms: from supra-ministries (Ecuador) and ministries (Peru), to agencies
within a ministry or the presidency (ANSPE in Colombia). The extent to which they are effective
in the coordination of social policies depends greatly on the institutional and financial power
that they wield, as well as the extent to which they develop clear strategies and institutional
arrangements.
                                                         It is crucial to design policies with clear, specific and measurable objectives, as well as
                                                     define clear competencies and accountabilities in the implementation of each intervention.
                                                     It is also important to provide incentives to coordinate that go beyond goodwill, building an
                                                     accountability system that rewards performance. On the advocacy front, there is a need to show
                                                     strong evidence of the benefits of coordination for social policy in order to cease being perceived
                                                     as an inefficient expense and to become a central pillar of countries’ development efforts.
                                                     Finally, coordination must happen not only at the top, but also at the local level. Civil servants,
                                                     teachers, doctors, and suppliers must be rewarded and benchmarked against measurable
                                                     achievements (as opposed to inputs). Recognizing that coordination is costly, countries should
                                                     attempt to establish the degree of coordination that maximizes benefits while minimizing costs.

                                                     mainstreamed into policy design. If their state of mind remains unaddressed, the chronic poor
                                                     may easily fall through the cracks of the social safety net system by failing to register for social
                                                     programs or to comply with co-responsibilities.
                                                         Social programs have various strategies at their disposal to assist the poor in overcoming
                                                     low aspirations or a suboptimal state of mind. In Peru, for instance, the national tuberculosis
                                                     prevention and treatment program provides free treatment to patients with tuberculosis,
                                                     assists patients with health insurance registration, offers tuberculosis screenings, and
                                                     provides preventative vaccination shots to children. Despite the free provision of services,
                                                     early evaluations of the program showed low adherence to treatment (which generally requires
                                                     taking a daily pill of 6 months), which can increase the chances of recurrence or of developing
                                                     multi-drug resistance. The majority of the tuberculosis-affected population reside in the slums
                                                     of Lima, where chronic poverty, stress, and depressed aspirations are the norm. Qualitative
                                                     research also documents how members of tuberculosis-affected households were more likely

                                                     impact on behavior: tuberculosis patients who were depressed at the time of diagnosis had a 43
                                                     percent greater likelihood of abandoning treatment before they were cured.
                                                         In order to address these issues, the Innovative Socioeconomic Interventions against

                                                     a reduction in depression. In communities receiving the ISIAT intervention, rates of completion
                                                     of the 6-month treatment needed to prevent tuberculosis nearly doubled (see Figure 16).
                                                     Furthermore, the impact on the poorest households was the highest, even though treatment
                                               uptake rates were the same as for other affected families. While various underlying mechanisms
                                               of behavioral impact may have played a role, it is clear that integrating issues of stress and
                                               depression directly into the design of the program was instrumental in its success.

                                                    Considering the state of mind in social programs can also help the poor deal with stress and
                                               long-term planning. A pilot program conducted in the city of Bogota attempted to address the
                                               fact that stress can influence valuation of the future. In the pilot, beneficiaries of a conditional
                                               cash transfer program who received bi-monthly payments were randomly split into two groups:
                                               the first group received the full amount each payment day, while the second only received two
                                               thirds, with the last third put aside by the program team into a savings account. The total amount
                                               of savings was then given to beneficiaries as a lump sum in December, immediately prior to the
                                               due date for children’s school enrollment fees. This simple modification was found to be effective:
                                               while both payment schemes had similar impacts on school attendance, the “save for when you
                                               need it” approach paid off in terms of achieving higher re-enrollment rates for the children of the
                                               second group (Barrera-Osorio et al. 2011). Simply by changing the timing of the payments, the
                                               savings were made available to parents at the time when they would most be needed.
                                                    Social programs can positively also influence the state of mind and aspirations by
                                               promoting interactions with role models. A social program in Nicaragua, for instance, provided
                                               to the majority of households in each community either vocational training or business grants
                                               to start a business, and explicitly encouraged group formation, thereby creating a unique
                                               space for social interactions among beneficiaries. As local leaders were also included among
                                               the beneficiaries, the authors were able to measure both the overall impact of the program as
                                               well as the extent to which social interactions between leaders and other beneficiaries led to
                                               additional impacts. Macours and Vakis (2014) show that beneficiaries that interacted more with
                                                       local leaders invested more in their children. Social interactions also amplified program impacts
                                                       on the income generation side: income from non-agricultural activities among beneficiaries who
                                                       received the business grant and who lived in proximity to a local leader grew by an additional 40
                                                       percent (see Figure 17).

                                                       Simply incorporating aspects of process simplification, norms or social interactions into existing
                                                       interventions can deliver large returns. Natural leaders and role models living in close proximity
                                                       can also serve as important vehicles for behavioral change, both by motivating and encouraging
                                                       others and by providing examples that people aspire to follow. Finally, teachers, who already
                                                       serve as important role models, can help children change their attitudes toward learning and the
                                                       future. As seen in previous examples, it is not always necessary to develop brand new programs:
                                                       small modifications to existing programs that carefully explore pathways of behavioral change
                                                       are often a cost-effective way to improve the ability of programs to address chronic poverty.

                                                       themselves from the very same social programs designed to assist them (Galasso 2014). The

                                                       presence of numerous social programs that do not coordinate with one another, each with
                                                       its own eligibility rules, clearly does not help in reaching them. There is therefore a need to
                                                       go beyond the classical “passive” social assistance approach, where coverage is dictated by
budgetary considerations, poverty status, and the assumption that the poor will successfully
and pro-actively seek out and enroll in social programs, and to move towards “active” approaches
that seek out the extreme and chronic poor, assist them to efficiently use the existing social
protection system, and help them in identifying their own development goals.
    Efforts to offer a more systematic response to both behavioral and coordination constraints
have been emerging in various Latin American countries under the form of “social intermediation
services”, intended to support the poor to overcome access, information and other barriers, via
a holistic, systemic, and household-based approach (Camacho et al, 2014). This approach
deserves attention, as it represents a shift away from the traditional social assistance paradigm
of providing the poor with a broad range of services and goods, towards a more personalized
approach that aims at providing people with the building blocks needed for overcoming their
specific challenges. As opposed to the classical social protection approach, where chronic poor
families are required to apply for benefits, social intermediation services put families at the
center by actively identifying and approaching the chronic poor, and guaranteeing them priority
access to existing and newly created programs.
                                                                                                       35
    Camacho et al (2014) review two of these programs (Chile Solidario, the first such program
in the region, and Red Unidos in Colombia) and assess factors that can enhance or hinder their
effectiveness. The analysis of the two services reveals useful insights. Overall, the authors
argue that social intermediation services can be powerful and cost-effective new tools to
support poor and marginalized families, by facilitating the poor’s access to social programs,
improving their social and emotional well-being, and, if the right conditions are provided, raising
their employment perspectives. These services show that psychosocial constraints are not
insurmountable barriers, and that, at least along the access dimension, it is possible to reach
out to the chronic poor and ensure that they benefit from the assistance of the state.
    Social intermediation services do not directly bring material benefits to the families; instead,
they facilitate access to existing social programs. They must be therefore well integrated within
the social assistance system, have inter-operable information systems to track the supply of
social services and the population demand, and employ a staff of well-trained social workers to
actively work with the target population to match them to social programs that address family-
specific needs. A strong supply of existing social programs is also essential for the success of
social intermediation services: granting access to services of poor quality, or services that are
poorly tailored to the needs of the extreme and chronic poor, may lead to little or no impact.
    As social workers are the backbone of family support, they also need to be well-trained
and to satisfy minimum qualifications. Social workers not only need to be knowledgeable of
the eligibility rules and procedures of all social assistance programs, but they also need to be
familiar with the informational and psychosocial barriers faced by the chronic poor, in order to
understand how to work with families to help them overcome these barriers. Visits to families
must be conducted on a regular basis and must be tailored to individual needs; behavioral
barriers can only be overcome if families feel that their constraints are understood and that
social workers are willing and have the means to help them overcome these barriers.
                                                         Social intermediation services can also vary in sophistication. The ambition of an intervention
                                                     such as Chile Solidario goes beyond the mere access to social programs and includes
                                                     psychosocial support and programs to fill supply gaps. In a context of more limited resources
                                                     and capacity, simpler programs that primarily focus on access can also lead to positive impacts.
                                                         Coordinating among social programs and addressing the state of mind of the chronic poor
                                                     adds an additional layer of complexity to social assistance work. Nevertheless, it is imperative
                                                     to think about new ways to reach the chronic poor, and social intermediation services are a
                                                     promising avenue. Without such an active intervention, the chronic poor are likely to continue
                                                     falling through the cracks of social assistance systems, perpetuating the vicious cycle of poverty.

1	     Given the level of economic development of LAC, we use higher poverty lines compared
       to the rest of the world. A $2.50 a day extreme poverty line (based on an average of
       national extreme poverty lines) is considered more appropriate for LAC than the World
       Bank $1.25 a day global extreme poverty line. A $4 a day poverty line is used to measure
       total poverty in the region and is approximately equal to the average of moderate poverty
       lines in the region. All incomes and poverty lines in this study are expressed in 2005 PPP
       (purchasing power parity) terms.
2	     We follow Ferreira et al (2012) who define four economic classes based on the concept
       of economic security: (i) the poor for those with per capita income below $4 a day; (ii)
       vulnerable for people – those with high risk of falling back into poverty and have incomes
       between $4 to $10 a day; (iii) the middle class, whose income ranges between $10 and
       $50 a day; and (iv) the rich who are those with incomes above $50 (all in 2005 purchasing
       power parity).
                                                                                                     37
