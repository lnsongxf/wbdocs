II. Methodology
In March-April 2013, 353 stakeholders of the World Bank in West Bank and Gaza were invited
to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country
survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office
of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a
ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/ contractors working on
World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; academia/research
institutes/think tanks; and other organizations. A total of 119 stakeholders participated in the
survey (34% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires face to face, via email or telephone and returned them
accordingly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing West Bank and Gaza; their
overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s
knowledge work and activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in West
Bank and Gaza; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in West Bank and Gaza.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing West Bank and Gaza: Respondents were asked to indicate whether
   West Bank and Gaza is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three
   most important development priorities in the country, and which areas would contribute most
   to reducing poverty and generating economic growth in West Bank and Gaza.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in West Bank and Gaza, Bank staff
   preparedness to help West Bank and Gaza solve its development challenges, their agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to
   reduce poverty in West Bank and Gaza, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should
   collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in West Bank and Gaza, the extent to
   which the Bank meets West Bank and Gaza’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-six development areas, such
   as economic growth, job creation and employment, security/stabilization/reconstruction,
   domestic private sector development and education. .
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing West Bank and Gaza’s institutional
   capacity, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in West Bank and Gaza: Respondents were asked to rate
   how significant a role the Bank should play in West Bank and Gaza’s development in the
   near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in West Bank and Gaza, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 96 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2009 and the
62 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2003. Notations and/or charts are included
when these comparisons were possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in West Bank and Gaza, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in West Bank and Gaza. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Stabilization/reconstruction;
             Equality of opportunity; and
             Job creation/employment.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in West Bank and Gaza, suggesting
        that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key
        drivers from these analyses were:
                Stabilization/reconstruction;
                Rural development;
                Economic growth; and
                Job creation/employment.

      do compared to respondents in the FY’09 country survey (8.1) and in the FY’03 country
      survey (8.0). Respondents in this year’s country survey gave significantly lower ratings
      for the extent to which the Bank’s knowledge work and activities are adaptable to West
      Bank and Gaza’s specific development challenges and country circumstances compared
      to respondents in the FY’03 country survey (7.0).
    There were significant differences between stakeholder groups across two of these
      qualities of the World Bank’s knowledge and activities: relevance to West Bank and
      Gaza’s development priorities and providing feasible recommendations. Employees of
      ministries/ministerial departments/ implementation agencies gave the highest ratings
      regarding these two qualities of the Bank’s knowledge and research whereas respondents
      from the private sector/financial sector/private banks and the media gave significantly
      lower ratings.
    Respondents across all geographic locations gave statistically similar ratings for all the
      qualities of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities.
