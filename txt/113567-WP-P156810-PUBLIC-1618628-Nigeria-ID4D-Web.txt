Executive Summary


 Nigeria has long known the importance of identification, though it has wrestled with developing a robust identity
 program. In 1978, the Department of National Civil Registration (DNCR) was set up within the Federal Ministry
 of Interior (FMI). DNCR was tasked with issuing national identity cards. The program lasted 18 months. In 2001,
 DNCR contracted a private partner to enrol people, and issue national identity cards, at a fiscal cost of US$236.8
 million. The program ran for five years, issued national identity cards to 37.3 million people, and was shelved.
 The system developed was not re-used. In 2007, the government passed a law, the National Identity Manage-
 ment Commission (NIMC) Act, and set up NIMC as the government agency responsible for identification in Nige-
 ria. NIMC continues to operate today.

 Identity is a public good, and is necessary for modern development. In order for a government or a firm to offer
 services to people, it needs to know who is who. Without a reliable way of proving one’s identity, exercising basic
 rights, claiming entitlements, accessing a range of government services, and conducting many daily activities
 can be hampered. The advent of new technologies, including mobile phone, internet, social media, and digital
 applications, requires an electronic or digital form of identity. Digital identity serves as a “cross sector platform,”
 offering a unique identity for use across sectors.

 Identity comes in two varieties: foundational, or a national identity; and functional, or a use-specific identity. A
 foundational identity explains “who you are,” and a functional identity explains “whether you are eligible for a
 specific service.”



 Accelerating Development
 Digital identity can be instrumental in hastening the pace of progress in Nigeria. The program can help improve
 delivery of safety net services to the poor, advance financial inclusion, support agriculture development, and
 strengthen electoral voting. In India, for example, the use of digital identity, as part of the country’s Aadhaar pro-
 gram, supported financial inclusion by helping 125 million people complete know-your-customer processes and
 open bank accounts in a short time span of 12 months. The program also helped improve social service delivery,
 by initiating direct benefits transfers for social sector schemes to Aadhaar-linked bank accounts of beneficiaries.
 These applications showcase the transformative potential of identity in improving the efficiency and effectiveness
 of service delivery, strengthening governance, and supporting private sector development.



 A Fragmented Identity Landscape
 Nigeria operates a fragmented identity landscape. About 13 or more identity programs are run by different gov-
 ernment agencies. Most identity systems are not interlinked. Most identity programs are geared towards issuing
 an identity card. Citizens thus have to carry multiple identity cards, for different uses. No single identity registry
 has reached full scale.

 As the lead government agency, NIMC offers a foundation identity. Since being established in 2007, NIMC

identity card in August 2014. To date, NIMC has registered 6.1 million people, out of 173.6 million population, or
3.5% of the population. NIMC has issued 418,000 national identity cards. Thus punctuated by a time lag, NIMC
has faced early hurdles. It took over operations from the previous DNCR, downsized organization, upgraded
technology systems, and tried and stopped partnerships with two private firms.

Functional identities in Nigeria have grown since before 2007. A voter registry, operated by the Independent
National Election Commission (INEC), is the largest functional registry, with 69 million entries. A banker registry,
partly operated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), is a newer one, and has 6.75 million entries. New regis-
tries, covering health insurance beneficiaries, and the poor and vulnerable, are expected to be developed.

Civil registry is being automated. Currently, 38–42% of births are registered in Nigeria. The government has
worked to link civil registration with the national identity registry, in order to improve the integrity of information in
both systems, though further work is required.



A Supportive Enabling Environment
The policy and legal environment for identification is positive. The NIMC Act was passed in 2007 for the setup of
NIMC as the lead government agency. Several additional Acts support the development of civil registry and voter
registry, amongst others.

With the growth of digital applications and electronic data, legal safeguards are necessary for privacy and secu-
rity of information. Draft bills are being reviewed by the country’s Parliament. The reliability and availability of
electric power and high-speed internet are two additional challenges for digital identity in Nigeria, and cause high
annual operating costs.



Fiscal Burden
The duplication of work due to parallel identity registries in Nigeria creates significant inefficiencies. First, govern-
ment agencies duplicate biometric enrolment, to uniquely identify each individual. Second, government agencies
duplicate fiscal spending. Third, without a modern, integrated identity ecosystem, delivery and management of
services, both public and private, are affected. Finally, citizens and residents are inconvenienced to face multiple
biometric enrolments, and carry multiple identity cards.

An illustrative fiscal analysis can show the enormity of fiscal impact due to the inefficiency in the identity eco-
system of Nigeria. The analysis uses a given methodology and assumptions, including a projected unit cost of
US$5.0 per person for identity lifecycle, since actual financial data on identity systems in Nigeria is not readily
available. Based on the analysis, the total fiscal impact of identity programs in Nigeria is US$4.3 billion, of which
US$1.2 billion are spent, and another US$3.1 billion will need to be spent, following current trajectory.



International Experience
International experience puts a lower threshold on the unit cost of identity per person. The unit cost is an impor-
tant measure to benchmark the efficiency of an identity program, whether foundational or functional. In India,
the government has spent US$2.0 per person for a lifetime of national identity. At this rate, the government is
spending US$2.5 billion to set up a national identity system to serve 1.25 billion people. The program is already
showing results. Launched 4.5 years ago, India’s program has completed 840 million enrolments, or roughly 67%
of the population.

Scale Up, Integration, and Low Costs
A rapid scale-up of national identity, integration of parallel identity systems, and low cost of identity programs are
key challenges for the identity ecosystem of Nigeria.

To obtain full benefits from digital identity, the federal government needs to rapidly scale up its national identity
program. The objective should be to have an electronic registry with 173.6 million people, covering the total popu-
lation, on a fast timetable. NIMC will need to scale up enrolments at a rapid pace in order to realize this objective.

Integration of identity systems is necessary. Though a Harmonization Committee was conceived in 2006 and had
spearheaded the NIMC Act in 2007, harmonization remains unrealized. In fact, the number of parallel identity
systems has grown. A prerequisite for integration is a critical volume of entries in the national identity registry,
and an online identity verification facility. Both of these are works in progress. The government may consider a
simplified approach to integration, improving speed of execution, and allowing government agencies to serve
their beneficiary populations with a unique ID.

Lowering the cost of each identity program, both foundational and functional, will help make digital identity a
reality in Nigeria.

The government has attempted forging partnerships for its national identity program, but has faced challenges.
Given the magnitude of task of developing digital identity in Nigeria, partnerships may be necessary for rapid
scale-up, integration, and low cost, and may benefit from past experiences.



Future Roadmap
The government may consider further sharpening its vision for identification in Nigeria, keeping in view objectives
of rapid scale up, integration, and low cost of development. The vision would prompt strengthening the enabling
environment, with conducive policy and laws, including for information security and privacy, and with an upgrade
of technology and systems to scale up digital identity. Capacity building of key institutions, including NIMC, with
an updated business model, public-private partnerships, and expedited enrolments would be important. A tacti-
cal look at harmonization, with a view on linking key user agencies, and with civil registration, would help foster
a holistic ecosystem.

Based on a refined vision, an updated policy and legal environment, and an optimized business model of identi-
fication, the government should prioritize mobilizing sufficient resources to fund identification in Nigeria. Funding
may be sourced from fiscal budget, donors, or private sector partnerships.

Digital identity can be a game-changer for Nigeria’s economic, social, and political development, and in helping
deliver social benefits to the poor. A focused approach to driving the identity agenda of Nigeria will help trigger
enormous benefits, and help improve management and delivery of services.

1                      Introduction


In Nigeria, at present, several government agencies issue an identity credential to residents for specific uses.
National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) leads the identity agenda of Nigeria, and offers a “founda-
tional identity” or an “official identity.” Over the years, several government agencies have rolled out their own
“functional identity” programs. Currently, there is little or no interoperability across these identity systems. The
degree and nature of technology used in these identity systems varies. Currently, no identity system has fully
reached scale to serve the masses in Nigeria.

Since gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria has recognized the need to create a central system of national
identity management for citizens and legal residents. In 1978, Nigeria created the Department of National Civic
Registration (DNCR), within the Federal Ministry of Interior (FMI), as the organization responsible for civil regis-
tration, and made its first attempt to issue a national identity card to its citizens.1 Later, in 2001, DNCR launched
a renewed effort to create a national identity database, and contracted a consortium led by a private firm. The
Federal Government of Nigeria paid roughly $236.8 million for registering 52.6 million people, out of a planned
60 million, and issuing identity cards to 37.3 million Nigerian citizens.2 The project was later shelved in 2006, and
involved allegations of impropriety over the award of the bid to the firm.3

In 2005, with an objective of revitalising the Nigerian economy, the Government of Nigeria embarked on a pack-
age of economic reforms, as encapsulated by the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy
(NEEDS).4 As part of this effort, the Government wanted to develop a national policy and regulatory framework
on consumer credit aimed at enhancing access to consumer credit for Nigerians. Absence of a universal identity
management system and verification process was seen to lead to distorted growth and underdevelopment of the
consumer credit market in Nigeria.

The federal government recognized the need to create a national identity program, incorporating lessons from
past attempts of DNCR, and following leading practices of national identity programs in other countries. With an
aim to create a comprehensive identity system, Nigeria constituted “The Committee on the Harmonisation of
National Identity Cards” to create a national policy and institutional framework for an identity management system
in Nigeria. As per the recommendation of the Committee, and subsequent enactment of a law, the government
established NIMC as the agency responsible for developing a National Identity Management System (NIMS).

NIMC was set up in 2007, based on NIMC Act No. 23 of 2007, with several functions: (a) create, own, oper-
ate, maintain and manage the national identity database (or registry); (b) register citizens and legal residents;
(c) assign a unique national identification number (NIN) per enrolled person, based on a biometric check of
uniqueness; (d) issue a national identity (smart) card to each registered individual; (e) provide an identity verifica-
tion and authentication service infrastructure; and (f) harmonize and integrate existing identification databases in
Nigeria. In essence, NIMC’s mandate is to create a national identity management system that enables secure,
reliable and authentic verification of an individual’s identity anywhere in the country, and facilitates service deliv-
ery in government and the private sector.

Since 2007, at the same time, functional ID programs recognized the need for a unique identity for their functional
identity databases due to the presence of duplicates and fakes in their registries. Ideally, the desired uniqueness
could be achieved by linking with a national identity program that has national coverage. However, until 2012,
NIMC could not start on-ground enrolment of citizens of Nigeria to provide a unique identification based on a
biometric check of uniqueness. In the absence of a scaled-up national identity, government agencies started
biometric enrolment of their own for their target beneficiary population with an objective of cleaning up their
respective databases.

Thus, Nigeria currently has one national identity program, and several functional identity programs, run by vari-
ous government agencies, who conduct biometric enrolment of their target populations. The duplicated effort has
led to inefficiencies in public resource management, as these programs require significant amounts of funding
for enrolment, operations, and maintenance. Moreover, a resident of Nigeria has to provide biometrics to multiple
government agencies, and carry multiple identity cards for different uses. To minimize the duplication of effort,
reduce fiscal spending across identity programs, and streamline service delivery, the federal government is cur-
rently implementing harmonization5 of its functional identity programs with NIMC.



1.1 Scope of the Study
The objective of the study is to provide a rapid review of the identity landscape of Nigeria, in consultation with the
government, and identify bottlenecks in the identity ecosystem. The assessment is intended to inform the future
development needs of identification in Nigeria.

The preparation of this study is based on extensive in-country consultations, with the government and identity
stakeholders in Nigeria, and on desk research done over a period of two months.

Apart from the foundational identity program of NIMC,6 the project team studied select identity programs serving
the functional identity needs of government agencies. The team reviewed various identity services offered by
government and nongovernment agencies, including their coverage, enrolment approach, use of demographic
and biometric data, technology infrastructure, and institutional capacity. The team also studied the status of har-
monization of these ID programs with NIMC.

In addition to the identity programs given above, additional identity systems operate in Nigeria, including, but not
limited to, Joint Tax Board (JTB), Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Nigeria Police Force (NPF), and National
Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). These identity programs were not covered as a part of the assessment. More-
over, some state governments run their own identity programs, such as the Lagos state resident ID card program,
which were not covered for the purpose of this study.



1.2 Limitations of the Study
This report is based on information gathered from discussions held with representatives of NIMC and of identity
programs in Nigeria, and through rapid desk research, conducted over two months. The report presents the
current identity landscape of Nigeria, along with lessons learned on identity programs in other countries. The
rapid nature of the assessment limits the scope, coverage, and comprehensiveness of data collection. Given the
analytical approach, an in-depth review of functional identity programs was not conducted. The report should be
read accordingly with given constraints.

2                           The Role of Identity


Identity is a public good, and is necessary for modern development. In order for a government or a firm to deliver
services to people, it needs to know who is who. In developed countries, an official identity is established by
feeder documents, such as a birth certificate. In developing countries, reliable birth certificates are often lacking.
As an alternative, developing countries use biometric technologies to uniquely identify individuals, and establish
an official identity. The nomenclature of “official identity,” “national identity,” and “foundational identity” are used
interchangeably. Without a reliable way of proving one’s identity, exercising basic rights, claiming entitlements,
accessing a range of government services, and conducting many daily activities are hampered. Governments
play an important role in establishing identity programs and inculcating trust, primarily through regulation.7

The advent of new technologies—such as internet, mobile phones, social media, and applications—requires an
electronic or digital form of identity. When combined with mobile phones and the internet, identification allows
services to be delivered electronically, giving a boost to government efficiency, and leading to new online prod-
ucts and services. With over 7 billion mobile phone users in the world today,8 mobile phones and the internet are
the largest delivery channels for services.

publication of the World Bank.9



2.1 Accelerating Development
Digital identity offers developing countries an opportunity to hasten the pace of their national progress. It changes
the ways services are delivered, helps grow a country’s digital economy, and provides effective safety nets for
disadvantaged and impoverished populations. For some, digital identity is a “game changer” or a “poverty killer.”10
India’s Aadhaar and Estonia’s identity programs are examples in which digital identity has been effectively used
to promote economic and social development.

In India, for example, the use of the Aadhaar digital identity has produced the following outcomes:

        •	     Financial inclusion: The program has been used to rapidly complete know-your-customer (KYC)
               processes and open bank accounts for 125 million people within a short span of 12 months through
               the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, a government program of financial inclusion.11
        •	     Social benefits: The program has helped initiate direct benefits transfer (DBT) for several social sector
               schemes (e.g., mother and child benefits, cooking gas subsidies, pensions) directly to Aadhaar-linked

           ance programs under the Prime Minister’s schemes for labourers and workers who are outside of
           formal employment. This scheme was launched in April 2015 and will use the bank accounts opened
           under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana as the base.


2.2 A Cross-Sectoral Platform
A national identity registry is a cross-sectoral platform that offers a unique identity to each person, and on which
new products and services can be built by firms and government agencies (see Figure 2). For example, a govern-
ment offering safety net transfers to the country’s poor can use the national identity registry to uniquely identify
target populations and issue cash transfers electronically. A financial institution can use the national identity regis-
try to validate a person’s identity, thereby addressing a key aspect of KYC rules. Immigration authorities can track
who enters and exits the country, and link national passports with the unique national identity of each person.

    Impact of National ID in Service Delivery—The Case of India and Pakistan

    India’s national ID—Aadhaar—was created with an objective of not only providing a unique ID to each
    resident of India but also to act as a mechanism for plugging leakages in safety net programs. Aadhaar
    acts as a tool to remove ghost and duplicate beneficiaries. Government of India has started an effort to
    include Aadhaar numbers in databases of functional identity programs and transfer benefits using Aad-
    haar numbers to linked bank accounts. This mechanism is currently being used for transferring subsidies
    provided on cooking gas and is expected to save ~10% of $6.5 billion annually spent on subsidy. This
    savings is achieved through elimination of ghost and duplicate beneficiaries in the database. A study by
    India’s National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) estimates that use of Aadhaar for transfer
    of benefits will save roughly $4 billion each year for the Government of India and provide a rate of return
    of about 52% for implementation of the Aadhaar program.

   Pakistan was one of the first countries in the world to introduce a national ID program based on biometric
   de-duplication through National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). After successful registra-
   tion, NADRA issues a Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) along with a 13 digit ID number. This
   CNIC is used by multiple government agencies for identity establishment and eligibility confirmation. The
   most significant usage of CNIC was made in 2010 for providing relief to citizens of Pakistan affected by
   flash floods. The Government of Pakistan disbursed about Rs. 77 billion to 2.84 million families under Citi-
   zens Damage Compensation Program (CDCP) that were affected by flash floods in Pakistan. CNIC was
   used as a tool for establishing eligibility for receipt of benefits. Similarly, CNIC is currently being used in
   multiple social safety net programs including Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), a program aimed
   to advance financial inclusion and provide financial stimulus to women living below the poverty line.




2.3 Foundational and Functional Identities
A ubiquitous digital identity can be developed using two distinct pathways:

   1.	   A top-down approach by creating a universal foundational identity, and then adopting the identity for
         service delivery by government agencies and the private sector; or
   2.	   A bottom-up approach by creating a functional identity to address a specific need of a government
         agency, and evolving the identity over time for universal coverage.

Each approach has its pros and cons. While a foundational identity can provide economies of scale and spur
innovation, it requires intensive coordination amongst government agencies for adoption and use, and may face
a slow uptake in initial days. In contrast, a functional identity is easy to launch and has low initial cost; but, evolv-
ing to become a multi-sector identity is difficult and costly, and sometimes not feasible, given duplication of efforts
by multiple government agencies before any identity reaches scale.

A foundational identity hosted in a “neutral institution” has the benefit of serving government agencies and the
private sector, irrespective of sector, industry, or functional domain.



2.4 Building Blocks of National Identity
The building blocks of developing a national identity program include the following:

   •	    Collect: The national identity authority collects the unique identity of all people, using biometric tech-
         nologies, into electronic profiles, by mobilizing nationwide enrolment.
   •	    Store: The national identity authority stores information, and builds an electronic registry of unique
         identities of all people in the country. In addition, the authority establishes easy and standard inter-

3.1 Background
The Federal Government of Nigeria has long recognized the need to have a single national identity system for all
citizens in order to carry out its mandate—law enforcement, intelligence, social and economic development, and
political development. In 2005, as part of the National Economic Empowerment Development Strategy (NEEDS),
the government highlighted the need to develop a national identity management system, especially to promote
customer credit and drive economic development. It recognized that the absence of a central national identity
database, and accompanying systems of secure, reliable identity verification and authentication, make it easy for
an individual to acquire identity cards with different names, leading to a high incidence of identity fraud. The gov-
ernment also recognized that identity fraud is leading to high leakages and corruption in government programs,
and a unique identity is a powerful tool to help address these leakages.

Also in 2005, the government established the Harmonization Committee to get advice on how different identity
programs, being spearheaded by the government and the private sector, could be harmonized.13 The Committee
noted that countries are increasingly moving away from issuing a single purpose identity card to a more secure
multi-application smartcard. The Committee also observed that various government agencies maintain differ-
ent identity databases and issue identity credentials specific to their own statutory responsibilities. Even though
these agencies employ similar processes to collect resident identity data,14 there is no linkage amongst these dif-
ferent agencies to access or exchange related data. Also, these government agencies were at different levels of
maturity; some relied on automated processes for data capture, storage, and verification, while others employed
manual processes. This results in a high degree of duplication of work and has significant financial implications
for government.

The Committee recommended creating a new national identity database (or registry) that could serve as a central
repository of unique identity information of all people in Nigeria. All government agencies and the private sec-
tor firms could link with this central repository to verify people’s identities. The connectivity amongst the various
identity databases, government departments, and law enforcement agencies was proposed to be enhanced by
the use of a chip-based general multi-purpose identity card (GMIC), or a smartcard. The smartcard would allow
several applications to be based on one card.

To effect the recommendation of the Committee, the NIMC Act No. 23 of 2007, which repealed the National
Civic Registration Act of 1978, was enacted, and established NIMC as the lead government agency responsible
for identification in Nigeria. The government had set up a Presidential Committee to implement the recommen-
dations, including articulating a policy and establishing an institutional framework for identity management in
Nigeria. The work was carried out in line with the Constitution of Nigeria and included biometrics in the exclusive
legislative list schedule of the Constitution.

3.2 Policy Landscape
Original National Identity Card Program of 1978
The government conceived the notion of a national identity card for every Nigerian prior to 1977. In 1978, the
Department of National Civic Registration (DNCR), within the Federal Ministry of Interior (FMI), was established
by a decree and given the responsibility to enrol every Nigerian citizen of age 18 years or higher, and issue a
national identity card based on biographic data.15

Decree 51 of 1979 stipulated the main objectives of the programme:16

      •	    Register all citizens of Nigeria who, at the commencement of the Decree or subsequently, had attained
            the age of 18 years or higher;
      •	    Issue a national identity card to every person registered; and
      •	    Collate all information returned by the registrars, in pursuance of their duties under the Decree, and
            produce such information, as may be required from time to time.

The national identity program was thus focused on “issuing an identity card,” as a way to control illegal immigra-
tion, validate civic documents such as travel passports, and set up a reliable personal identity system for securing
commercial transactions with financial institutions.

The program reportedly failed after 18 months. Only a few government functionaries were issued a national
identity card.


Private Sector Program of 2001
In the early 2000s, the DNCR revived the program for creating and issuing the Nigerian national identity card,
contracted a private sector service provider, and pursued the following mandate:17

      •	    Deploy necessary IT infrastructure to register residents;
      •	    Use a biometric approach to confirm the unique identity of each registered person;18
      •	    Provide ICR form correction centre and 60,000 mobile registration workstation (MRWs); and
      •	    Issue 60 million national identity cards, using card personalisation equipment.19

The project focused on issuing identity cards based on barcode technology to citizens and separated databases
of female and male residents. The contracted firm completed enrolment of 52.6 million out of 60 million residents,
and issued 37.3 million identity cards before closing operations.20 The government paid out roughly $236.8 mil-
lion.21 The project was later shelved in 2006, and involved allegations of impropriety over the award of the bid to
the firm.22


NIMC Program of 2007
Learning from two unsuccessful attempts of creating a national identity registry, the NIMC Act was drafted with
a focus on not only creating a robust national identity platform, but also harmonization with other government

agencies for adoption and use. It separated the objective of creating a unique national identification scheme from
card issuance and provision of electronic verification services.

Following passage of the NIMC Act in 2007, NIMC was set up the same year as a new Commission under the
Presidency to serve as the government agency responsible for identification in Nigeria. NIMC took over the
assets and liabilities of DNCR. NIMC aimed to establish a “unique identity per person,” based on biometrics,
and issue a unique national identification number (NIN) to citizens. NIMC was given the mandate to design and
implement a new NIMS based on best practices worldwide. The work on the NIMS began in earnest in the third
quarter of 2009, after NIMC ascertained that it could not reuse most of the assets that it had inherited from the
former DNCR.



3.3 NIMC Act
The vision of NIMC is to establish and regulate a reliable and sustainable system of national identity manage-
ment that enables a citizen or legal resident to assert his or her identity. NIMC is working to achieve this vision by
creating and managing a secure national identity database, setting and maintaining identification standards, and
issuing an identity token and a secure means to irrefutably confirm the identity of an individual.23

According to the NIMC Act,24 the mandate of NIMC can be described as below:

      •	   Establish National Identity Database (NIDB) and issue General Multi-Purpose Identity Card
           (GMIC): The Act entrusts NIMC with the responsibility to create, manage, maintain and operate a
           national identity database. NIMC is required to carry out the registration of citizens and lawful resi-
           dents of Nigeria in the database using fingerprints and other biometric information as unique and
           unambiguous features of registerable persons. Persons who successfully register are to be assigned
           a unique national identification number and issued a general multi-purpose identity card.
      •	   Provide identity verification services: Upon creating the national identity database, NIMC is
           required to provide verification services based on information in its database.
      •	   Harmonize existing identity schemes in Nigeria: The Federal Government of Nigeria is focused on
           creating an interoperable system to achieve integration of identity infrastructure and a ‘change-over’
           to the new set of unique identifier requirements under the NIMC system. For the purpose of harmoni-
           zation, NIMC is empowered to establish and maintain secured communication links with any existing
           identity database or agency; and harmonize and integrate identity databases in government agencies
           to achieve resource optimization through a shared services platform.
      •	   Research and develop identity management: NIMC is expected to stay on top of trends in identity
           management and incorporate global practices of identity operations.

In addition, NIMC was also responsible to wind up and take over the assets and liabilities of the former DNCR,
including the personnel in both the state and local government offices nationwide.

The NIMC Act requires every Nigerian citizen and legal resident to enrol with NIMC, but does not confer a citizen-
ship status to the resident. The Act also mandates the use of NIN to obtain government services, and imposes
penal provisions for not using NIN.

3.4 Additional Acts
Several government agencies with functional identity or related programs operate under a specific legislation,
including, amongst others, the following:

     •	   Nigeria Immigration Act
     •	   National Population Commission Act
     •	   National Health Insurance Scheme Act
     •	   Federal Inland Revenue Service Act
     •	   Births and Deaths (Compulsory Registration) Act
     •	   Pension Reform Act

The mandate of functional identity programs is often limited to their specific service delivery domains and hence
do not require universal coverage of Nigerian population.



3.5 Security and Privacy
Digital identity requires enabling policies, including for data privacy, cyber security, electronic transactions, and
electronic communication.


Data Privacy
In 2013, NIMC prepared a privacy study, leading to a privacy policy that was adopted by the government. A pri-
vacy law is currently undergoing a third reading by the National Assembly. The privacy policy helps ensure that



12
NIMC meets its obligations under the NIMC Act in the management of data collected and held in its registry.25
The privacy policy is created with an objective of ensuring the protection of information by making reasonable
security arrangements against risks caused by unauthorized forms of access, collection, use, disclosure, storage
or disposal.

Key provisions of the privacy policy include:

      •	    NIMC will collect personal information directly from individuals in order to register for national identity,
            will not collect information about individuals through unlawful or unfair means, and will not unreason-
            ably intrude in the personal affairs of individuals concerned.
      •	    The purpose of collecting and storing data about residents in its registry include: facilitating identity
            authentication, boosting national security, assisting in economic planning and research, encouraging
            consumer credit, preventing identity theft, or assisting criminal investigation.
      •	    NIMC will establish and implement procedures to ensure that requests for lawfully authorized use of
            information by authorized persons and agencies is granted.
      •	    Unlawful access to or use of information of NIMC by any person, including employees of NIMC, is a
            criminal offence punishable by imprisonment for a term not less than ten years without the option of
            fine under the provision of section 28(1) and (2) of the NIMC Act.
      •	    NIMC will make reasonable efforts and establish measures, processes and procedures to ensure the
            protection of registered information. These include both physical and technological safeguards. NIMC
            will take reasonable efforts to also create and maintain firewalls, restricted access, and other appropri-
            ate safeguards to ensure that it controls registered information.
      •	    NIMC will not disclose or authorize the disclosure of any registered information except when con-
            sented by resident, required by a court order, or required for public interest or national security.

Cyber Security
The National Security Adviser (NSA) is given the mandate of cybersecurity in Nigeria. In May 2015, the govern-
ment passed a Cybercrime Act 2015 to provide a legal framework for the prohibition, prevention, detection, pros-
ecution, and punishment of cybercrimes in Nigeria.26 The Act also aims to enhance cyber security and protection
of information infrastructure, including computer systems and networks; electronic communications; data and
computer programs; and intellectual property and privacy rights.

Key provisions of the Act include:27

      •	    The Act criminalizes specific computer and computer-related offences, which include: unlawful access
            to a computer; unauthorized disclosure of access code; data forgery; computer fraud; system inter-
            ference; misuse of devices; denial of service; identity theft and impersonation; child pornography;
            records retention and preservation; unlawful interception; cybersquatting; cyber-terrorism; failure of
            service providers to perform certain duties; racist and xenophobic offences; attempt, conspiracy and
            abetment; and corporate liability.
      •	    The Act provides for the security and protection of critical information infrastructure. It further provides
            for the audit and inspection of critical information infrastructure, and punishment for offences against
            critical information infrastructure.
      •	    The Act deals with issues such as jurisdiction, powers of search and arrest, obstruction of law enforce-
            ment officers, prosecution, forfeiture of assets, compounding of offences, payment of compensation,
            and the power to make regulations.

           tions but can be checked through international cooperation. The issues covered include: extradition;
           mutual assistance requests; expedited preservation of data evidence pursuant to a request; and form
           of requests.

Electronic Transactions and Communications
Nigeria wishes to remove barriers to electronic commerce through a proposed legislation, the Electronic Com-
merce Bill 2011, under review by the National Assembly.28 The draft bill covers electronic transactions done com-
mercially or by federal and state governments in Nigeria. One of the objectives of the law on e-commerce is to
ensure that records and documents are not considered invalid because of being in an electronic form. The law
recognizes validity of an electronic signature for signing an electronic document.

Key provisions of the draft bill include:

      •	   The legal validity of information, communication, contract, record, signature, or transaction will not be
           denied because it is in electronic form.
      •	   Where any law requires information to be in writing, the requirement of the law is fulfilled if the infor-
           mation is contained in an electronic message that is accessible and intelligible so as to be usable for
           subsequent reference.
      •	   Where any law requires a seal to be affixed to a document, the requirement of the law is fulfilled if the
           document is in the form of an electronic message.
      •	   Where any law requires a document to be in original form, the requirement of the law is fulfilled by
           a document in the form of an electronic message if (a) there is reliable assurance to the integrity of
           information from the time it is first generated in its final form; and (b) the electronic message is acces-
           sible and intelligible to be usable for subsequent reference.


3.6 Technology Infrastructure
The use of digital identity relies on technology infrastructure and services, and related policies, regulations, and
standards, in the following ways:

      •	   For enrolment: The availability of high-speed internet connectivity is needed for enrolment data col-
           lected from centers throughout the country to be transmitted to the central office of NIMC in Abuja, and
           for checking the uniqueness of each new identity (via de-duplication).
      •	   For national identity registry: Data centers, and related applications, are needed to operate the
           national identity registry in electronic form at the central office of NIMC in Abuja, and the disaster
           recovery centers elsewhere.
      •	   For interoperability: Technology interfaces, standards, and protocols are needed for the national
           identity registry of NIMC to link with functional identity registries of other government agencies.
      •	   For identity verification: The availability of internet connectivity is needed for national identity to be
           electronically verified anywhere in the country by checking against the central office in Abuja.
      •	   For disaster recovery: Data centers, and related applications, are needed to back up information for
           the business continuity plan and do disaster recovery.

Technology systems also rely heavily on electric power, in the forms of national power supply, industrial-grade
electric power generators, solar panels, and uninterrupted power supply (UPS).

Mobile
Mobile phones are a growing phenomenon in Nigeria, as in the rest of Africa. By 2014, 136.2 million people, or
75.8% of the population, had a mobile phone, up from 53.9% five years ago in 2010, as shown in Figure 6. Mobile
phones offers a new platform of service delivery, and offers prospects of linkage with digital identity.

High-speed internet, or broadband, is a work in progress in Nigeria. By 2014, broadband penetration was at
6–7%, with mobile broadband reaching 12%. Prices of broadband remain high, and quality of service is mixed.
The lack of reliable high-speed internet poses a possible challenge for digital identity. Current identity systems,
such as of NIMC, spend high operating costs per month to pay for internet.

4                 Civil Registration


A national identity registry can be populated in two ways (as depicted in Figure 2 on page 6): (a) using civil
registration, with reliable birth and death certificates; or (b) by mass biometric enrolment of people throughout
the country. In developing countries, national identity registries are being populated biometrically in absence of
reliable birth and death certificates. In reality, following mass biometric enrolment, an electronic linkage with the
civil registry is important in order to maintain the integrity of information in the national identity registry and the
civil registry.



4.1 Legal Mandate
Following passage of the National Population Commission Act in 1988, and in line with the country’s Constitution,
the National Population Commission (NPopC) was established by the federal government of Nigeria. The agency
is responsible for census operations and civil registration in Nigeria. The Act sets out the following responsibilities
for NPopC:

   •	   Undertake enumeration of the population of Nigeria periodically, through census, sample surveys or
        otherwise;
   •	   Establish and maintain a machinery for continuous and universal registration of births and deaths,
        throughout the Federation;
   •	   Provide information and data on the population for purposes of facilitating national planning and eco-
        nomic development; and advise the President on population matters.


4.2  Current State
NPopC maintains a civil registry to retain documentary evidence of people’s legal identity, family relationships,
nationality, and ensuing rights, such as for social protection and inheritance. The registry is intended to help facili-
tate access to basic services, such as health, education, and social welfare, and contribute to activities, such as
gaining formal employment, exercising electoral rights, transferring property, and opening bank accounts.

NPopC has established 4,000 civil registration centres across the country, with more than five registration cen-
tres in each of the 774 local government areas (LGAs). It currently conducts registration of births, deaths, and
stillbirths (for analysis of mortality). It plans to expand operations by conducting registrations of marriage, divorce,
adoption, and other changes in civil status. Apart from conducting registration at its designated offices, NPopC
has tie-ups with major hospitals for birth registration, and runs a registration desk at these hospitals. NPopC also
has tie-ups with the National Primary Healthcare Agency to empower midwives for collection of birth registration
data. During birth registration, an NPopC official captures demographic details of the child at their center. The
registration can be done at any registration center irrespective of the location of birth.

NPopC maintains physical paper files of registration data, and later digitizes them. A monthly manual collation of
data occurs at levels of local government, state government, and NPopC headquarters in Abuja. Subsequently,


                                                                                                                     17
data entry operators at NPopC headquarters in Abuja digitize the data received from physical paper files. Officials
at the headquarters run analyses on the digitized data and publish reports periodically.

In 2012, NPopC received funding from the World Bank to digitize civil registration processes. It has since started
a digitized process for direct data capture in 144 centres in the country. Additionally, the United Nations (UN) has
provided funding for deployment of handheld devices (via Rapid SMS) to capture civil registration data. These
handheld devices are deployed at four centres in each state, and can be carried from place to place to capture
data. The data entered by direct data capture centres and through handheld devices is transmitted directly to
state level offices and to NPopC headquarters in Abuja.

Currently, birth registration is estimated at 38%–42% of total births in the country, and NPopC has been working
to increase the percentage of registration. In 2012, NPopC made an effort to clear the back-log of registrations
in the country. A drive was launched in coordination with state governments and with UNICEF at schools that
resulted in registration of 7–10 million children.

In Nigeria, it is legally mandatory for each citizen to register birth and death. As per regulations, a delay in registering
birth, past 60 days, and death, past 30 days, has a penalty. To date, NPopC has not charged any penalties to citizens.

                                                              Each Nigerian citizen

4.3 Linkage with National Identity
Linking a civil registry with the national identity registry is a substantial task, involving automation of manual pro-
cesses of civil registration, and requires several iterative steps:

     •	   Historic records: Digitizing historic records and electronically retaining in standard formats for easy
          search and access.
     •	   New records: Electronically capturing new records of birth and death (and other changes in civil sta-
          tus) by establishing electronic terminals and interfaces for registration at respective institutions and
          agencies responsible for birth and deaths (such as hospitals, maternity centers, and others), and in
          this way bypassing a manual process of data capture.
     •	   Electronic look-up: Electronically linking the civil registry with the national identity registry to cross-
          validate the uniqueness of information in the two systems.
Efforts on linking civil registration with the national identity registry have been made, and further work is needed
to achieve the integration.

5                      Foundational Identity: National
                       Identity Registry

Though the federal government of Nigeria has long recognized the need for a foundational identity, its attempts
to create a national identity in 1978 and in 2001 yielded mixed results. In 2007, the federal government decided
to revive the national identity program. Following passage of law, the National Identity Management Commission
was established in 2007.

NIMC was given the mandate to design and implement a revolutionary new national identity management system
based on best practices worldwide. NIMC is charged with responsibilities of registering every individual in Nige-
ria, issuing a unique national identification number, issuing a general multi-purpose identity card, establishing
and integrating with all identity registries, and verifying and authenticating unique identities.

At the time of its set-up in 2007, NIMC assumed assets and liabilities of DNCR that led the national identity card
project in 2001. As a result, NIMC started with a sizable organization, mostly outdated technology systems, an
oversized organization, capacity gaps, and financial liabilities. The handover of legacy systems from the private
sector partner was not smooth and not achieved, and NIMC could not re-use any of the systems developed.
NIMC thus faced a delay in starting operations. Moreover, NIMC wanted to focus only on back-end operations,
and rely on private sector partners for front-end operations based on a concessions arrangement. The approach
posed challenges, and added delay.

Today, NIMC serves as the lead government agency responsible for identification in Nigeria.



5.1 Mission
The vision of NIMC is to establish and regulate a reliable and sustainable system of “national identity manage-
ment” that enables a citizen or legal resident to assert his or her identity. NIMC plans to achieve this vision by
setting and maintaining identification standards, creating and managing a secure database, an identity token,
and a secure means by which to irrefutably confirm the identity of an individual to help promote national security
and enhance socioeconomic development.30



5.2  Governance
NIMC is set up as a federal government agency under the office of President of Nigeria. NIMC is headed by a
Director General and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who is appointed by the President.

With an objective of creating a universal identity program as well as harmonization of identities in Nigeria, NIMC
Act provides for a 19-member Governing Board as the highest decision making body in the Commission.31 The
Board comprises of a Chairman appointed by the President, Director General/Chief Executive Officer of NIMC,

one representative each from 14 government agencies and institutions, and 3 persons who are knowledgeable in
Information Communication Technology. The Board of NIMC is represented by government agencies operating
functional identity registries (as discussed in Section 6).



5.3 Organization
NIMC is organized into 9 departments, each headed by a General Manager (or Director). Apart from this, there
are 6 subdivisions under the office of Director General of NIMC.

At its inception, NIMC conceived the implementation of the unique identification as a system divided into two parts:

      •	    Front-end operations: NIMC’s approach to handling front-end operations has changed since con-
            ception. These operations are three: (a) enrolment, (b) printing and issuance of general multi-purpose
            identity cards, and (c) deployment of card acceptance devices. In the beginning, NIMC signed up
            two concessionaries as front-end partners, but the partnerships did not materialize. NIMC ended the
            concessions. Subsequently, NIMC began in-house handling of front-end operations,32 and is currently
            conducting enrolment, and printing and issuing general multi-purpose identity cards.
      •	    Back-end operations: NIMC has consistently run back-end operations. These operations are: (a) set-
            ting up, operating and managing the national identity database; (b) establishing and maintaining com-
            munication links with identity-related agencies and end users; and (c) providing identity verification
            services.

In 2007, after completing takeover of DNCR, NIMC realized that the national identity program had oversized
in-house manpower and an abundance of roles. With an objective of only handling back-end operations, NIMC
started rationalizing the organization structure. NIMC downsized from an organization of 10,231 staff. At an
aggregate level, NIMC has 3,400 staff today amongst all Departments and subdivisions.



5.4 Products and Services
At its core, NIMC offers three key products and services.

      •	    NIN: The national identification number (NIN) is an 11-digit random, unique identity number assigned
            to an individual upon successful enrolment following biometric capture of information. Enrolment con-
            sists of recording an individual’s demographic data, capturing 10 fingerprints, a head-to-shoulder
            facial picture, and a digital signature. The information is used to cross-check existing data in the
            national identity database to confirm that there is no previous entry of the same individual. Once this
            de-duplication process is completed, a unique NIN is assigned to the person. The NIN once issued
            to a person cannot be used again (that is, it cannot be issued to another person even if the previous
            person has passed away). It is the NIN that helps to tie all the records about a person in the database
            and is used to check the identity.
      •	    Multi-purpose identity card: The Nigerian National Identity Card is a microprocessor chip-based
            general multi-purpose identity card (GMIC) designed to handle multiple applications including identity
            verification and authentication and payment functionalities. All citizens and legal residents with age of
            16 years or older (whose biometrics are captured during enrolment) are issued a national identity card
            free of charge. The smartcard includes a payment functionality, currently provided by Mastercard, and
            in future by additional service providers.33 The card works as a prepaid debit card, and can be loaded
            with a monetary value for payment transactions.

 NIMC started front-end operations first as a pilot while the concessionaries were there. Following termination of concessions in August 2014, NIMC adapted to
32

capturing data by itself. The government issued a circular that enabled MDAs to align their data capture and to help populate the NIMC registry.
  In the future, two additional payment service providers are expected, namely Visa and Verve.

       •	   Authentication services: In the near future, NIMC plans to provide online, biometrics-based authen-
            tication services based on NIN. These services will be provided using an ecosystem of authentication
            user agencies and authentication service agencies.


5.5 Enrolment
Incorporating learning from national identity programs across the world, NIMC has defined a 4-step process for
enrolment of Nigerian citizens.34

Process of Enrolment
       •	   Pre-Enrolment (Optional): Pre-enrolment is an optional step whereby an applicant can fill out the
            demographic data required by NIMC at an online pre-enrolment portal—https://penrol.nimc.gov.ng/
            loginForm.tpl.html.php.35 This facility is provided to reduce the time required for enrolment, and reduce
            data entry errors made by the enrolment station operators. After completing the form, the applicant
            is required to print out a summary sheet that has a 2D barcode and carry it to an enrolment center.
       •	   Enrolment: The enrolment process is initiated by the citizen appearing at the designated enrolment
            center operated by NIMC to be enrolled (i.e. provide demographic data and permit his/her biometrics
            to be taken) with supporting document(s).36 In some geographic areas, NIMC dispatches a mobile
            enrolment unit to a community. If pre-enrolment form is not filled, the applicant is required to fill out
            the enrolment form.37 The enrolment form has more than 40 fields capturing demographic information
            such as name, address, name of parents and next of kin, details of birth, physical features, address
            of native place for self as well as parents, and address of next of kin.
            After ascertaining suitability for enrolment, the enrolment station operator accepts the application and
            captures demographic data for the applicant in the system (either by scanning the 2D barcode on the
            pre-enrolment summary sheet which automatically retrieves data from pre-enrolment, or manually

  Note that the process depicts enrolment of people and issuance of cards only. NIMS additionally includes verification and authentication of unique identities.

           entering data in the system provided in the enrolment form by the citizen). After demographic data
           capture, the operator captures scans of 10 fingerprints, a head to shoulder facial picture and a digital
           signature. This capture of biometrics is done for all applicants with age of 16 years or older. For all
           applicants below 16 years of age, biometrics are captured, a NIN is issued, and the NIN of his/her
           parents is captured for enrolment.
           After confirming correctness of data entered, the operator submits the citizen data for biometric de-
           duplication. A transaction slip is generated after successful submission of citizen data. This transaction
           slip carries a transaction reference number which can be used by the citizen for future communication
           with NIMC in case a NIN is not generated real-time. This process of enrolment, including capture of
           demographic and biometric data, takes an average of 20 minutes per person.38
      •	   Biometric de-duplication and NIN issuance: After submission of citizen data, a de-duplication
           check is run on the existing data in the national identity database in real-time to confirm that there
           is no previous enrolment by the same person. This check is done using ABIS L1 Solutions’ bimodal/
           multimodal biometric solution. If this de-duplication check is successful, a unique NIN is assigned to
           the person and data is stored in the national identity database. The NIN is a non-intelligent set of num-
           bers assigned to an individual upon successful enrolment and de-duplication check. After successful
           generation of NIN, a NIN slip is printed and handed over to the citizen.
           Currently, the process of de-duplication takes place live (in real-time), and a NIN slip is provided to the
           citizen on the spot. However, as the enrolment picks up and database size increases, de-duplication
           may not be done real-time and the citizen may be notified by text message that a NIN is generated in
           batch mode. The citizen will then need to come to an enrolment center to receive a NIN slip.
      •	   ► Issuance of National ID card: After issuing a NIN to a citizen, the process for card personalization
           kicks in. NIMC has a card personalization set-up which is used to issue a national identity card to each
           citizen. Currently, NIMC is activating five of the thirteen applets on the card, namely: match-on-card,
           ICAO, payment (in coordination with UPSL and MasterCard), e-ID and e-PKI (for digital signatures).
           The other applets are meant for post-activation in collaboration with each respective agency. Once a
           national identity card is ready, the citizen is notified through SMS and the card can be collected at the
           enrolment station where the citizen enrolment was done. NIMC currently does not mail the national
           identity card to an address provided by the citizen since each cardholder is expected to activate his or
           her identity card at the time of collection with a fingerprint verification.
           Due to limited capacity of infrastructure for card personalization (given a peak capacity of roughly
           16,000 cards per day),39 NIMC is currently not able to abide by a service-level agreement of issuing a
           national ID card in one month. NIMC has thus far issued 418,000 national identity cards. Since 2014,
           these card facilities have been audited by NCC Group UK, and are certified by ISO 27001:2005 and
           2013 by BSI. Mastercard has certified under its global vendor certification program (GVCP).

Enrolling Children
The NIMC Act empowers NIMC to biometrically enrol all citizens and legal residents, including children. NIMC
collects biometrics of children, though does not use it for de-duplication since the biometric information is not
mature. NIMC issues a NIN to each child, and links the child’s NIN with the parent’s NIN. The child is expected to
update his or her records every two years until reaching the age of 16. At that stage, NIMC can issue a national
eID card to the individual. In case the child fails to provide biometrics within a given timeframe, NIMC can sus-
pend the NIN issued to the child. NIMC is working with NPopC to help automate collection of vital registration
data at site locations of NPopC and obtain data relevant to NIMC.


Enrolment Capacity
NIMC operates 404 enrolment centers nationwide in Nigeria, with support of 2,500 enrolment staff, covering 332
of 774 LGAs. NIMC has enrolment centres in Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and in 34 states out of 36 states.

  The process reportedly takes less than 10 minutes when a 2D barcode is used.
38


 The current capacity of 16,000 per day reflects backup and security measures. The card issuance was previously contracted to two private sector firms. Due to
39

contractual issues, agreements were closed. NIMC has since begun conducting card personalization. NIMC has now contracted an expansion to 100,000 per day.

22
In the states of Yobe and Borno, NIMC has not set up enrolment centres due to a prevailing security situation. In
FCT, NIMC has also deployed mobile units for conducting enrolments, in the form of buses equipped with enrol-
ment stations.

At each enrolment center, NIMC operates multiple enrolment stations. Each enrolment station consists of tech-
nology systems to capture biometric information (fingerprints and facial picture; with upcoming iris) of people,
and computers to record information electronically using a locally developed enrolment software. An online pre-
enrolment portal is offered to encourage demographic data to be entered in advance to reduce the time spent
at enrolment centers. Over 2,500 enrolment systems (i.e. computers, biometric terminals, etc.) are being used
across the country.40 All enrolment systems are connected to a web application server located at a datacenter in
Abuja. Currently, NIMC reports a capacity of issuing 100,000 NINs per week.

NIMC is additionally working with NHIS to give access to data in helping establish the functional identity system
of NHIS. NHIS is supplying 5,000 units of mobile enrolment kits, in two separate batches, to allow NIMC to popu-
late the national identity database. NHIS plans to provide staff and space in offices nationwide for enrolment to
happen. The collaboration would create extra enrolment centres for the NIMS.

NIMC plans to increase the number of enrolment stations to 13,800 and capacity to >1,000,000 per day so that
enrolment of all Nigerian citizens can be completed within three years.

To improve the accuracy of de-duplication, NIMC plans to collect iris information, and use it for de-duplication.


Citizen Demand
With parallel identification systems, citizens can face insurmountable obstacles to enrolment. These obstacles
result from processes that pose unaffordable transaction or opportunity costs to citizens, or present untenable
requirements for enrolment. The poor and marginalized may thus be deterred from enrolling and from enjoy-
ing the benefits of digital identification. In India, for example, despite processes being automated for improving
access, applications for birth certificates incurred heavy transaction cost, such as to gather supporting docu-
ments, and resulted in a high rejection rate of 60%, since the issuance of a birth certificate had to be concurred
by three different officers.41 Mapping citizens’ journey through the bureaucratic process of enrolment and card
issuance across identity programs can help showcase the obstacles to achieving universal coverage, including
for the most destitute citizens. Factoring the cost of enrolment from the demand side helps develop a practical
approach to digital identification.



5.6 Technology Systems
Highlights of the technology systems of NIMC are as follows:

      •	   Biometric: NIMC collects two biometric features for now, 10 fingerprints and a facial image, of each
           person. The biometric information of each new person being enrolled is checked against a central
           repository of all biometric profiles of previously enrolled people. NIMC plans to incorporate iris de-
           duplication in future.
      •	   Automated biometric identification system (ABIS) for de-duplication: NIMC has implemented
           an L1 ABIS as a back-end system for biometric de-duplication. The ABIS provides the platform for
           processing enrolment, verification, and authentication services over the network.
      •	   Data centers and disaster recovery: NIMC maintains two types of servers. The primary servers are
           located at the main data center at NIMC headquarters in Abuja. The secondary servers are located

  Two concessionaries were previously expected to do enrolments. In August 2014, the NIMC Board approved termination of concessions once enrolments did
40

not happen. NIMC deployed 2,500 units with the need to prove concept, demonstrate technical viability, and pilot scheme. NIMC is now making a conscious effort
to conduct massive deployment. The timely collaboration with NHIS and FMARD is expected to give a boost to the data gathering scheme.

          at the disaster recovery sites outside of Abuja. The data center and disaster recovery are designed
          to meet the demand of 1:1 and 1:N biometric de-duplication and the verification and authentication
          service requests from end-users of the national identity database. The entire data center is currently
          run on diesel generators and significantly impacts the operational cost of NIMC.
     •	   Communications infrastructure: The communications network consists of several forms of connec-
          tivity, including VSAT, WAN, LAN, and fiber-network, linking NIMC’s data center with 14 government
          agencies. The network provides for two sets of functionality. First, enrolment centers can transmit
          massive data collected during enrolment, in a single or batched format, to the NIDB data center.
          Second, government agencies and end-users can send requests for identity verification as part of the
          harmonization with the NIDB.
          NIMC strives to achieve high-performance reliability and availability of its back-end systems. Cur-
          rently, NIMS availability stands at 99.999%. There are several redundancies and system monitoring
          equipment put in place to ensure the availability of NIMS at all times. There are daily back-up pro-
          cesses (tape-based backup) in addition to automatic replication facilities between primary and disas-
          ter recovery sites to further ensure the availability of relevant services at all times.
     •	   Security of information: There is a strong emphasis on the security design to secure the various
          components from logical and physical cyberattacks. The security design covers server security, includ-
          ing firewall, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS); network secu-
          rity; enrolment and end-user security, including with public-key infrastructure (PKI) and encryption.
          Also, there are adequate physical security measures put in place to protect the information assets on
          premise. In 2014, following an audit by the NCC Group, the British Standard Institute certified the data
          center facilities under the ISO 27001:2005. It again recertified in April 2015 under the ISO27001:2013.
          MasterCard certified the card personalization facility in 2014 and recertified in April 2015.


5.7 Authentication and Verification
Online authentication and verification services are currently not offered by NIMC to the public. It is currently being
used by the Department for State Security, and testing for the pilot started June 21, 2015. NIMC plans to launch
this service in upcoming months. As part of this work, NIMC plans to deploy an authentication and verification
interface, authentication and verification clearing house, authentication service agents, and card acceptance
devices.



5.8  Current Status
As of May 2015, NIMC has enrolled 6.1 million citizens and issued 418,000 national identity cards. Currently,
more than 404 enrolment centres (physical locations) with 2,500 enrolment stations are operational in the
country.

6                 Functional Identities


At present, 13 or more government agencies operate identity systems in Nigeria. Each government agency
requires a different set of resident data. Over time, each functional identity program has recognized the need
of unique identity, and has sought to collect biometric information to address issues of identity theft, duplicate
entries, and ghost individuals. As a result, identity systems operate in parallel in Nigeria, with little or no linkage
amongst one another.

This section provides a snapshot of the functional identity programs examined, based on a rapid review.



6.1 Voter Registry
Independent National Election Commission (INEC) is entrusted with compiling, maintaining and updating, on
a continuous basis, a national voter registry. The registry is intended to include names of all persons who are
entitled to vote in elections in any federal, state or local government area. For the purpose of establishing a
robust database of voters for the federal elections of 2015, INEC carried out biometric registration of voters from
2011 to 2015 at 120,000 polling booths. Valid voters were issued a voter’s identity card with 4 fingerprints data
embedded on the card (out of 10 fingerprints that were captured). INEC deployed card terminals for biometric
verification of voters before voting.

INEC has been able to optimize the national voter registry to retain 73.5 million records in 2011 and 69 million
records in 2015. De-duplication of the registry would further establish uniqueness of the people registered.

6.2  Census Registry
One of the primary objectives of NPopC is to periodically enumerate population of Nigeria, through census, sam-
ple surveys, or other mechanisms. Since census provides critical input to development plans of federal and state
governments, NPopC is required to provide reliable census information. However, historically, census operations
in Nigeria have been marred by controversies, and raised questions about reliability of figures in census.

To address these concerns, NPopC plans to collect biometric data of individuals using enumerating exercises for
Census 2016. This biometric data will be used for de-duplication to provide reliable information through census
operations.



6.3  Driver Registry
In February 1988, the government created the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC). The agency is respon-
sible for designing, producing, and issuing driver’s licenses for various categories of vehicles; and for designing
and producing vehicle number plates. FRSC was one of the first to introduce a biometric de-duplication system
in Nigeria. It started biometric enrolment for issuing driver’s licenses as early as December 2008. The coverage
of identification under this program is limited to individuals aged 18 years or higher who seek a driver’s license.
Exact data regarding the number of enrolees in FRSC’s drivers’ registry could not be determined in preparation
of this study.

After biometric de-duplication, each license holder is issued a driver’s license with advanced safety features and
a barcode at the back.

To read the information on the card, barcode scanners are available with each patrol officer on highways. The
history of violations or offences is recorded in a central system. Some patrol officers have tablets which provide
additional functionalities, such as location tagging, and capturing photographs of the incident site.



6.4 Mobile Phone Subscriber Registry
The unregulated use of mobile phones in a country is known to aid in robberies, kidnappings, internet banking
fraud, and terrorism. The National Communications Commission (NCC) has been working to adopt an identifica-
tion technology that requires civilians to register purchases of a subscriber identity module (SIM) in order to oper-
ate a mobile phone. The use of a mobile phone subscriber registry can thus be helpful to track SIM card usage,
prevent fraud, stop crime, and prevent sale of pre-activated SIM cards. To address these problems, NCC has
started biometric enrolment of subscribers in partnership with telecom service providers, namely mobile phone
operators.

Each civilian who purchases a SIM card is required to register with NCC through respective mobile service
provider. NCC currently has linkage with National Security Agency (NSA) and has helped the agency in crime
detection and control.

NCC started SIM registration in 2010, and continued until 2013. Over 110 million records were collected. The
data is currently being further validated. To date, about 38 million records are retained in the mobile phone
subscriber registry by NCC. Additional SIM registries are reportedly maintained by individual mobile operators.



6.5 Banker Registry
On February 14, 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), through the Bankers’ Committee and in collaboration
with all banks in Nigeria, launched a centralized biometric identification system, named Bank Verification Number
(BVN), for the banking industry. The purpose of the project is to use biometric information to, first, identify and
verify individuals who have an account(s) in any Nigerian financial institution, and, second, establish credit his-
tory of the individual. Use of biometrics is also envisaged to prevent identity theft, thus reducing non-performing
assets for Nigerian banks. Nigerian Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS), owned equally by all licensed banks
in Nigeria and by CBN, maintains the ID repository for BVN and provides verification services.

Since June 2015, CBN has mandated BVN for all banking transactions;42 any customer without BVN is deemed
non-compliant with KYC rules, and hence ineligible to carry out financial transactions.

The program started in February 2014, and began enrolments in August 2014. The program operates about
10,000 enrolment stations at 5,000 physical centers, and is enrolling at a pace of 400,000 people per week. The
program is fully funded by banks. By March 2015, about 6.75 million records are retained in the BVN registry.

6.6 Pension Registry
Pension Commission (PENCOM) was established following the pension reform in 2004. The reform brought
a paradigm shift in Nigeria’s pension system from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contributory pension
scheme. PENCOM issues a personal identification number (PIN) to each contributor of pensions. This PIN is
a unique number which can be used by the contributor for porting pension account after changing employer or
Pension Funds Administrators (PFAs).

Due to the absence of a robust de-duplication mechanism, PENCOM observed that there were instances of dupli-
cate enrolments by PFAs resulting in multiple PINs per individual, thus defeating the purpose of PIN issuance.

PENCOM is currently considering biometric enrolment of all contributors to de-duplicate PIN database. This
enrolment will be carried out by PFAs on behalf of PENCOM, and data will be transferred to a pension identity
repository maintained by PENCOM. PENCOM has a beneficiary population of roughly 6.4 million people, and
has 21 pension enrolment administrators for enrolment. The biometric-based registry of PIN is yet to start.



6.7 Social Registry of the Poor
The National Social Safety Net Program (NSSNP) is being planned by the federal government of Nigeria, with
support from various bi-lateral and multi-lateral development agencies. The program aims to develop necessary
systems for social safety nets, and provide support to the most poor and vulnerable households of society to help
alleviate poverty. The program is at conceptualization stage, and, amongst other steps, NSSNP is developing
criteria of eligibility for issuing benefits under the program.

As part of the program, NSSNP plans to operate a unified social registry of the poor and vulnerable in Nigeria.
The program’s vision is to maintain an electronic register of the poor, and use as a common reference for all
social development programs in the country, including safety net, health care, and education. NSSNP is at an
early stage of planning the social registry, and aims to link with the national identity registry of NIMC. The devel-
opment of the social registry of the poor is yet to start.



6.8 Farmer Registry
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), through its Growth Enhancement Support
Scheme (GESS) program, provides support directly to farmers to enable them to procure agricultural inputs at
affordable prices, and at the right time and place. Under this program, fertilizers and seeds are made available
to farmers at subsidized prices in order to encourage agricultural activity in the country.

FMARD started farmer registration under this program in 2012. By 2013, it built a database of 10.5 million farm-
ers. Subsequently, in 2014, it registered an additional 4.5 million farmers under the program. To prevent farmers
from registering multiple times to get program benefits, FMARD wants to de-duplicate the database by capturing
biometrics of beneficiaries. For this purpose, FMARD has started a pilot program in collaboration with NIMC in
Kogi, Zamfara and Kano states. After a successful pilot, the collaboration with NIMC is being expanded through-
out the country for farmer registration.



6.9  Challenge of Parallel Identities
The incidence of parallel identity systems, each doing biometric data capture, without integration of identity pro-
grams, poses two challenges:

   •	   Duplicated effort and inefficient use of public resources: Conducting biometric enrolment by
        each identity program leads to heavy duplication of effort, in terms of procuring similar computing
        hardware, software, and systems across government agencies; setting up parallel enrolment centers;
        conducting multiple resident enrolments; issuing multiple identity credentials; and maintaining multiple
        identity systems. These activities require significant fiscal spending, and create inefficiencies, as each
        government agency is trying to solve the same problem.
   •	   Inconvenience to residents: As each identity agency conducts separate enrolment, residents of
        Nigeria are required to provide biometric and biographical information multiple times to several gov-
        ernment agencies. Residents also have to provide different supporting documents to each govern-
        ment agency leading to potential confusion. Residents have to carry multiple identity cards for different
        uses. Information provided to different government agencies may vary, and, without integration of
        identity systems, is difficult to verify.




                                                                                                                     31
7                 Fiscal Impact


Parallel identity systems and duplicate biometric enrolment take a fiscal toll on the federal government, in addi-
tion to creating inefficiencies in the way government services are managed and delivered.

An illustrative fiscal analysis can help showcase the magnitude of fiscal impact caused by the plurality of digital
identity systems in Nigeria, in absence of effective interconnection.

The fiscal analysis, as presented here, is illustrative, based on a given methodology and assumptions, since
actual financial data of identity systems in Nigeria is not readily available. The availability of financial data can
further confirm this analysis, and validate the duplication in fiscal spending.

The analysis, as presented here, is based on experiences derived from several developing countries, and show-
cases the lower threshold of fiscal spending made by the federal government of Nigeria.



7.1 Methodology
The following methodology is used in preparing the fiscal analysis:

   •	   Unit cost of identity per person: Each identity program, whether foundational or functional, incurs
        a unit cost of identity per person for the life cycle of identity. This unit cost is cumulative of all capital
        expenses (CAPEX), incurred by setting up real estate and physical facilities, developing technology
        systems, and procuring simple cards; and all operating expenses (OPEX), incurred by paying staff
        salaries, conducting enrolment, paying for utilities (including electric power, and high-speed internet
        connectivity), printing cards, paying for transportation, and other expenses (marketing, communica-
        tions, cost of capital, insurances, depreciation, etc.). The unit cost projects a time horizon suitable for
        reaching full scale of enrolment, which can run 5–8 years. The unit cost varies based on the efficiency
        and effectiveness of the identity program. The unit cost can be offset by revenues, though revenues
        typically follow the setup of a full-fledged identity system.
   •	   Number of identities: Each identity program, whether foundational or functional, serves a target
        population of “unique residents” or “unique beneficiaries” to be captured and retained in its respective
        identity system. For national identity, this is the total population. For a functional identity, it is the total
        number of eligible beneficiaries to be targeted under its program.
   •	   Total life cycle cost of identity program: The total life cycle cost of an identity program, whether
        foundational or functional, is the product of the unit cost of identity per person and the number of
        identities that it plans to retain.




                                                                                                                       33
7.2 Assumptions
In conducting the illustrative fiscal analysis for Nigeria, the following assumptions are made:

      •	     As of 2013, there were 173.6 million people in Nigeria in total.43
      •	     As of 2013, there were 96.6 million adults in Nigeria, i.e. people of age 15 or higher.44
      •	     Each resident of Nigeria (whether citizen or legal resident) is expected to have a national identity, and
             each adult is to have a national identity card, currently a smartcard.
      •	     To date, 6.1 million people are already enrolled for national identity, and another 167.9 million are
             to be enrolled. 418,000 national identity cards are already issued, and another 96.4 million national
             identity cards are to be issued.
      •	     To date, 179 million are already enrolled by all functional identity programs, and another 385 million
             are to be enrolled across different functional identity programs.
      •	     The average unit cost of identity per person is assumed US$5.0 in Nigeria across all identity pro-
             grams in Nigeria, whether foundational or functional. This is a major assumption, and is derived based
             on the average unit cost of identity per person in other developing countries. This is likely a lower
             threshold of unit cost. Actual unit cost will vary by government agency, and will reflect the efficiency of
             identity operations of each agency. Since most government agencies in Nigeria are currently conduct-
             ing biometric enrolment, the unit cost, as assumed, is a reasonable estimate.
      •	     The average unit cost per smartcard is US$3.50, based on industry estimate, and is in addition to
             the unit cost of identity per person.
      •	     The federal government has already spent US$236.8 million for national identity registry during
             2001–2006, under a program run by DNCR, as discussed under Policy Landscape.


7.3 Analysis
Based on the methodology and assumptions, as given above, Nigeria has to date spent US$1.2 billion, and, fol-
lowing the current trajectory of parallel identity programs, is expected to spend another US$3.1 billion on dispa-
rate identity programs throughout the country. Following this analysis, the total fiscal impact of identity programs
for the federal government of Nigeria is US$4.3 billion.

Several observations are noteworthy:

   •	   Unit costs matter: The unit cost per identity per person denotes the operational efficiency of an iden-
        tity program, and is a key measure in the planning and operational oversight of the program.
   •	   An integrated identity program can offer significant cost savings and efficiency: An integrated
        identity program, where the national identity offers a unique identity per person, and functional identity
        programs keep a list of eligible beneficiaries linked with the national identity, can offer significant cost
        savings to the fiscal burden of the government. The integrated system can also create significant effi-
        ciencies in the management and delivery of government services.
   •	   The fiscal cost of a modern, well-developed and integrated identity program can be offset by
        savings in government efficiency: An assessment done by the Government of India showed that
        the government spent US$60 billion on welfare payments annually, within which there was 40% leak-
        age in the distribution of food grains, US$200 million of leakage in the distribution of cooking gas, and
        less than 20% of government-issued benefits actually reached intended beneficiaries. The cost sav-
        ings from using national identity to issue social services more than paid for the US$2.5 billion cost of
        the national identity program of India aimed for 1.25 billion people.

8                       Harmonization of Identity
                        Registries

Nigeria faces an urgent need to harmonize identity databases using NIN, remove duplicate identities, and achieve
universal coverage. Though identity programs undergo similar processes to collect identity data, the programs
are not linked. A coordinated approach for digital identity offers prospects of good governance, efficient service
delivery, and effective fiscal management.



8.1  Current Approach
According to law and a government policy on harmonization issued in 2014, NIMC is responsible for coordinating
harmonization of identity programs in Nigeria. Currently, NIMC offers the following components for harmoniza-
tion, as summarized in Figure 9.

      •	   Data capture: NIMC offers its enrolment centers as a resource to jointly capture data of residents with
           government agencies. As part of enrolment, NIMC collects its own data. With joint enrolment, NIMC
           is able to collect additional data as needed by other government agencies.45
      •	   Card design: NIMC offers a smartcard to each enrolled person in Nigeria. The smartcard offers mul-
           tiple applications spanning a range of functions for use by the public and private sectors. NIMC offers
           custom applets to government agencies to help make use of smartcard features. There is provision
           for post-issuance activation of applets for specific MDAs.
      •	   Network: NIMC operates a high-speed internet link with 14 government agencies, providing them
           with fast linkage with its data centers and technology systems in Abuja. The links are used for data
           submission, and for submission and verification of unique identity.
      •	   Co-location: NIMC offers co-location facilities at its data centers in Abuja to host functional registries
           or databases as needed by government agencies. The co-location is also offered for enrolment.
      •	   Policies, standards, and regulations: NIMC has published a host of policies, standards and regula-
           tions to help establish harmonization of different databases in Nigeria.




 NIMC provides an enrolment software that can capture data for issuance of NIN and eID cards, and for the specific data needed by the MDA. The MDAs can
45

also capture data for their own purposes and send mandatory data for issuance of NIN and eID cards to NIMC as given by the harmonization policy. Once an
MDA sends the required 10 data fields, including biometrics, a NIN and an eID card can be issued. It is when the individual comes forward to collect his or her
card that the rest of the demographic data is collected. In both cases, there is provision for pre-enrolment for demographic data only.

8.2  Current Status
NIMC is currently working with the following government agencies on harmonization:

     1.	   Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD)
           Until 2012, Nigeria did not have an electronic database of its farmers which made it difficult to effectively
           target them, especially smallholder farmers, with public support programs. The FMARD launched the
           first-ever registration and development of a manual farmer database for the country in 2012. A total
           of 11,000 enumerators were employed across all 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the country.
           About 14.5 million farmers were registered over a course of 3 years from 2012 to 2014. FMARD has now
           collaborated with NIMC to capture biometrics of the registered farmers and to de-duplicate the database
           to prevent possible leakages and corruption.
           Under this collaboration, NIMC, CBN and FMARD have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
           to integrate farmers’ database and the National Agricultural Payment Initiative (NAPI) with the NIMS
           deployed by the NIMC. FMARD has adopted the data capture equipment specified by NIMC. NIMC
           has also customized their enrolment software solution to capture additional fields. NIMC provides a
           procedure for registered farmers to be enrolled for their national identification number (NIN) under the
           MOU. This arrangement has been successfully piloted in Kogi, Zamfara and Kano States, and is being
           extended all over the country.
     2.	   National Social Safety Net Program (NSSNP)
           Through the NSSNP, the Federal Government is adopting a systems-based approach to social safety
           nets in Nigeria, and providing social benefits to the poor and vulnerable in the country. In this regard,
           NSSNP aims to establish a unified social registry of the poor and vulnerable in Nigeria to be used for
           delivering safety net services at federal, state, and local levels. The unified registry will be instrumental
           in ensuring that the beneficiaries being targeted under NSSNP, or other social development programs in
           Nigeria, are eligible beneficiaries.
           For the purpose of creating this unified social registry, NSSNP is collaborating with NIMC, and plans to
           link the social registry of NSSNP with the national registry of NIMC.

8.3  Considerations for Harmonization
Following are certain preconditions for achieving effective harmonization:

      •	   Scale of national identity registry: A necessary precondition for harmonization is having a critical
           volume of entries in the national identity registry. The larger the national database, the greater the
           incentive for government agencies not to duplicate biometric enrolment, and rely on the national iden-
           tity registry for unique identification. The rapid scale-up of the national identity registry is thus a high
           priority for the timely integration of identity registries in Nigeria.
      •	   NIN as common identifier: While functional identity programs can issue their own citizen identifier,
           there needs to be a single unique identifier across databases for sake of harmonization. Therefore,
           each functional ID agency needs to capture and provision for NIN as a part of resident information.46
      •	   Availability of identity authentication and verification services: Functional identity programs
           require the ability to biometrically verify the identity of a beneficiary before service delivery. NIMC
           plans to but has not yet launched an online authentication and verification service on a commercial
           basis.


8.4 Models of Harmonization
The federal government of Nigeria may consider alternative models for achieving harmonization:

      •	   Loosely coupled: Using NIN as a common reference or index in each database.
      •	   Tightly coupled: Achieving near live (or real-time) integration of all identity databases.
      •	   Single warehouse: Adopting a single warehouse of all identity information, both foundational and
           functional, with different windows (or interfaces) for different government agencies.

Loosely Coupled
The model is predicated on a “federated system” of identity registries and a “minimalist approach” to integration.
With a federated system, each identity registry, whether foundational or functional, holds separate information.
The national identity registry holds the unique identity of all individuals in Nigeria given by a NIN per person. The
functional identity registries hold additional information per person, as may be relevant to the individual being a
beneficiary, with NIN as a common reference. In the federated system, each registry does its own work. With a
minimalistic approach to integration, NIN serves as a common link amongst the various identity registries. The
national identity registry offers an easy and secure way for a NIN to be electronically looked up. The functional
identity registries use the look-up facility to validate the uniqueness of each of its beneficiaries.

A federated system and a minimalistic approach do not require joint data capture, dedicated high-speed links
amongst government agencies, co-location of identity registries, and shared functionality on identity credentials.
Standard formats for a minimal number of fields of information may be needed.

A federated system offers the benefit of greater security and privacy of people’s information, since data is distrib-
uted across different registries, though linked by a NIN.




 Moreover, NIMC may include a field for identifier issued by each functional ID so that an integrated view of a resident is available and a holistic view could be
46

used for developmental planning.

               Tightly Coupled
               The model is predicated on two concepts: (a) more information is retained by the national identity registry; and
               (b) a high-speed link exists between national identity registry and functional identity registries for fast informa-
               tion exchange. In this case, the national identity registry holds know your resident (KYR+) data (such as addi-
               tional demographic information, functional identity numbers, etc.) on each resident. As information is updated in
               the functional identity registry, it is quickly transmitted and retained in part by the national identity registry. The
               reverse may also happen, based on inter-agency agreements. Since the national identity registry thus holds
               KYR+ data, the government is able to run more complex queries to check beneficiary eligibility for specific ser-
               vices, or for development planning (such as, obtain a list of residents who receive social welfare benefits but also
               own an automobile).
9538_Nigeria_ID4D_Fig10.indd 1                                                                                                           6/16/16 9:57 AM

               A tightly coupled approach does benefit from or require joint data capture, dedicated high-speed links amongst
               government agencies, co-location of identity registries, and shared functionality on identity credentials. Detailed
               policies, standards, and data formats for information exchange are necessary.

               A tightly coupled approach raises higher risks for information security and privacy, and requires stronger legal
               safeguards to mitigate such risks.

Single Warehouse
The model is predicated on the notion that a single identity registry exists in the entire country, and all govern-
ment agencies reference the same registry. All data captured by all government agencies go to the same registry.
Each government agency has its own window to the same larger registry.

A single warehouse approach requires central or coordinated data capture, dedicated high-speed links amongst
government agencies, a single location for the identity registry, and a single multi-functional identity card. Detailed
policies, standards, and data formats are intrinsic to the entire warehouse.

A single warehouse approach raises high risks for information security and privacy, and requires sound legal
safeguards for security and privacy of people’s information.

     India’s Aadhaar Uses a Loosely Coupled Model

     India runs multiple G2P programs which involve establishing citizen identity before service delivery. For
     this purpose, government agencies have created functional identity programs (e.g., rural job guarantee
     scheme run by the government issues a job card which needs to be carried to demand work under the
     scheme). Registries of these functional identity programs have multiple duplicate/fake records, leading to
     leakage of government funds. To plug such leakages, Government of India initiated a drive to link registries
     of functional identity programs with Aadhaar. After Aadhaar is linked with citizen records in functional iden-
     tity registries, it can be used to run advanced analytics to identify areas of improvement for service delivery.

     In this model, the functional identity program maintains full operational independence and maintains its
     own registry in its own desired format. The harmonization is achieved only through linkage of the the func-
     tional identity registry with Aadhaar.

9                      International Experiences


Today, with Information and Communication Technology (ICT), it is possible to create large electronic registries,
which can each be searched; use biometrics to reliably enrol individuals; and check the unique biometric profile
of each person. In addition, with a greater part of the world’s population today using a mobile phone, it is becom-
ing easier to electronically verify the identity of a person.

Governments around the world are working to help establish a reliable, unique identity per person that can be
universally accepted within the country. The approaches taken by countries is different, based on the country’s
own economic, social, political, and development context.

This section examines the experiences of two countries, India and Pakistan, which have successfully deployed
and currently use digital identities for economic and social development.



9.1 India’s Aadhaar Program
India’s National ID program, Aadhaar, has been a success story in helping overcome the development challenges
of the country over six decades since its independence. Since inception in 2010, Aadhaar has cost-effectively
covered 840 million Indians, or over 67% of India’s population of 1.25 billion, and has become central to all
major public sector initiatives in the country. Aadhaar is being linked to India’s election identity system. It is central
to one of the world’s largest and fastest growing financial inclusion programs—the Jan Dhan Yojana. Under this
program, over 125.4 million bank accounts that are linked to Aadhaar have been opened since the program’s
launch in August 2014. Aadhaar is also central to the country’s rapidly expanding Direct Benefits Transfer (DBT)
scheme.

The program has managed to create a highly efficient business model. The unit cost of identity per person is
estimated to be as low as US$2.0. A key enabler for the program’s rapid rollout and cost reduction was the use
of no identity credential. The approach significantly reduced logistical challenges. The program uses a simple
12-digit number system and an easily downloadable e-Aadhaar concept. The enrolment form is less than a page
in length.

Government of India has long recognized that a weak identity system limits the power of the country’s residents
when it comes to claiming basic political and economic rights. Agencies in both the public and private sectors in
India usually require a clear proof of identity to provide services. Since the poor often lack such documentation,
they face enormous barriers in accessing benefits and subsidies.47

Before scaling up, the Aadhaar program experienced significant institutional and operational hurdles. The gov-
ernment initially decided to split enrolment responsibility amongst two different institutions, Ministry of Interior and
UIDAI. Each institution were to enrol half of the country’s population. Enrolment was slow at the start, though with
simplification and consolidation, reached a critical mass. Civil society organizations also pointed out the impor-
tance of citizen privacy in retaining biometric information.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), established under the Planning Commission in January
2009, is responsible to provide a unique identification number to every resident. The number can be used by the
resident to access a variety of services and benefits. UIDAI has the vision of empowering every resident of India
with a unique identity and providing a digital platform to authenticate the identity anytime or anywhere.

Legal Framework
To address the urgent need of a universal identity program, the UIDAI was constituted as an attached office
under the aegis of the Planning Commission on January 28, 2009. Through the Commission’s notification, UIDAI
was given authority to start biometric enrolment of residents and issue Aadhaar numbers.48 Another mandate for
UIDAI was to deploy Aadhaar-based services and promote usage of Aadhaar in service delivery through harmo-
nization with other government agencies.

The government drafted National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010,49 to provide legal backing to UIDAI.
The draft Act authorizes UIDAI to collect information from residents, establish a central identity data repository
(CIDR), and provide identity authentication and KYC services. The draft Act also defines provisions for data pri-
vacy and confidentiality to protect resident information in CIDR. The draft Act contains a list of offences and penal
provisions. To date, the draft Act is to be passed by the Indian Parliament. In the meantime, the program draws
its authority from the Indian equivalent of an executive order by the Government of India to establish the UIDAI
and roll out the Aadhaar program.


Ecosystem Approach
UIDAI adopted an innovative ecosystem approach to achieving scale of enrolments, as required to cover 1.25 bil-
lion residents under the program. As the apex body, UIDAI was responsible for maintaining the core identity infra-
structure and systems, while the task of conducting enrolments was managed through a network of “registrars”
(a government agency authorized by UIDAI for the purpose of enrolling individuals) and “enrolment agencies” (a
government or private agency that captures demographic and biometric data of residents at the enrolment sta-
tions). UIDAI also created a training and operator certification ecosystem to support the registrars and enrolment
agencies. Registrars are provided an incentive of roughly US$1 per successful enrolment. This incentive acts as
a catalyst for scaling up enrolment infrastructure and conducting genuine enrolments.

Using this approach, in a span of 4.5 years, UIDAI has thus been able to provide unique IDs to more than 840
million residents in India.

After the citizen data is collected by UIDAI and an Aadhaar is issued to a citizen, the mandate for UIDAI is to
develop a system that provides for a cost-effective, online interface for authentication or verification of citizen
identity. The aim was to support various authentication request types, such as demographic, biometric, simple,
or advanced. To enable this, UIDAI developed an authentication ecosystem using a network of authentication or
KYC service agencies (which have secure leased-line connectivity to the identity repository to transmit authenti-
cation or KYC requests), authentication or KYC user agencies (such as banks or telecom service providers that
use identity authentication or KYC to enable their services), and authentication devices (i.e. laptops, PCs, hand-
held devices that are connected to biometric devices) to prepare and transmit data packets and receive results
from the ID repository.

The ecosystem approach to authentication also develops further security for UIDAI’s identity registry, since all
access to the identity registry is channelled through two layers of intermediaries.

Platform Approach
Though UIDAI is the largest repository of identity data, it opted not to add all resident attributes in its registry, to
fulfil the mandate of easing citizen service delivery. Instead, UIDAI took the approach of “identity as a platform.”
The Aadhaar system collects minimal data, enough to provide unique identity, issue the Aadhaar number after
biometric de-duplication, manage lifecycle changes of that identity record, and provide an application program-
ming interface (API) for providing identity details (eKYC) and verifying the identity (i.e. with online authentica-
tion). Designing Aadhaar as a pure identity platform allowed clear separation of roles, leaving use of identity to
partners, with various partner applications built on top of the Aadhaar platform.

Apart from this, UIDAI has created a platform for payments in coordination with National Payments Corporation
of India. The Aadhaar number is used as a financial address for transactions with a bank account linked with
Aadhaar in the background.

Using these platforms, the Government of India has initiated harmonization of identities using Aadhaar. Like
Nigeria, India runs multiple G2P programs which involve establishing citizen identity before service delivery. For
this purpose, government agencies have created functional identity programs (e.g., rural job guarantee scheme
run by the government issues a job card which needs to be carried to demand work under the scheme). Reg-
istries of these functional identity programs have multiple duplicate/fake records, leading to leakage of govern-
ment funds. To plug such leakages, Government of India initiated a drive to link registries of functional identity
programs with Aadhaar. After Aadhaar is linked with citizen records in functional identity registries, it can be used
to run advanced analytics to identify areas of improvement for service delivery.



9.2 Pakistan’s NADRA Program
In Pakistan, efforts to create a national identity system started in 1973, with promulgation of Article 30 of the sec-
ond amendment of the Constitution of Pakistan to perform identification and maintain a statistical database of all
citizens of Pakistan.50 Registration under this program required a citizen to provide demographic data, address,
photograph, and thumb impressions, all of which were stored in physical paper files before issuing a national
identity card. Thus, the ability of the government to provide a unique identification to each citizen was limited, and
a paper-based identity card could not be used as a reliable document for identity verification.

In 1999, Pakistan’s military, charged with responsibility of conducting a door-to-door census, began contemplat-
ing to merge two institutions: the Directorate General of Registration (DGR) responsible for providing national
ID cards to citizens; and the National Database Organization (NDO), created in 1998, responsible for conduct-
ing census, computerizing census data collected, and issuing computerized cards. The “National Database and

Registration Authority (NADRA) Ordinance, 2000,” came into being on March 10, 2000, by merging the DGR and
NDO, and was introduced with the aim of reducing government interference in the process of registering people
and providing national ID cards.51 The ordinance lays out a blueprint for how to register individuals.

The Mandate
NADRA was created as an autonomous body to operate independently, and given the mandate to replace the
old DGR with a computerised system of registering all citizens of Pakistan. Specifically, the mandate of NADRA
is to develop and provide:52

      •	   National identity documents for all citizens and noncitizen residents of Pakistan.
      •	   A national data warehouse that draws together Pakistan’s main government databases.
      •	   A national information infrastructure for online, nationwide access to the national data warehouse.
      •	   A national spatial data warehouse infrastructure to establish a comprehensive geographic and land
           information system.

Enrolment Approach
NADRA took the approach of setting up and running enrolment centres throughout the country on its own with-
out notable partnerships. Due to limited technical capabilities, NADRA faced challenges in identification during
2001–2005.53 Many Pakistani citizens did not have identity cards, many non-nationals had national identity cards,
and there were many fake identities. In 2007, NADRA started using fingerprint de-duplication to issue national
identity cards, and, in 2008, the data architecture was further improved to include a full set of 10 fingerprints and
a digital photograph. This technology was powerful enough to enable full de-duplication of the national database,
and greatly reduced the prevalence of dual identities and identity theft. Using this organization and technology,
NADRA rapidly increased registration from 54 million in 2008 to 98 million in 2014, covering roughly 55 million
men and 43 million women.

Computerized National Identity Card
Since its inception in 2000, NADRA issues a computerized national identity card (CNIC) to Pakistani citizens
and an equivalent to Pakistani diaspora. The CNIC is issued at the age of 18, after capturing the biometrics of a
resident.62 The identity card has the following information on it: legal name, gender (male, female, or transgen-
der), father’s name (husband’s name for married females), identification mark, date of birth, national identity card
number, family tree identity number, current address, permanent address, date of issue, date of expiry, signature,
photo, and fingerprint (thumbprint).

In 2012, with the aim to enhance security features of the card, mitigate forgery, and expand usage in govern-
ment service delivery, NADRA introduced smart national identity card (SNIC). Pakistan’s SNIC contains a data
chip, 36 security features, and complies with ICAO standard 9303 and ISO standard 7816-4. The card contains
match-on-card applets, enabling remote verification of citizens. The card also has a QR code at the back, which
works as a security feature, as scanning the QR code provides the same information as on the front and back
of the card.


Service Delivery
The Government of Pakistan has recognized the need of uniquely identifying citizens to improve service delivery
and has made CNIC use mandatory for availing multiple government services. With about 98% coverage of Paki-
stani nationals above 18 years of age, NADRA offers an opportunity to reliably establish the identity of citizens at
the time of enrolment under a government programme and at the time of service delivery. Increasingly, NADRA’s
database is being used to validate eligibility of nominated beneficiaries at the time of their registration and identity
establishment for service delivery.

Under Pakistani law, it is not compulsory to carry CNIC. However, for Pakistani citizens, the CNIC is mandatory
for conducting transactions with the government such as:

      •	   Voting
      •	   Opening and operating bank accounts
      •	   Obtaining a passport

10                      Lessons Learned


The case studies of India and Pakistan illuminate lessons learned in developing digital identity systems. Nigeria’s
own experiences in setting up earlier identity platforms, and the recent work of NIMC, offer additional lessons. In
developing countries where well-built identity platforms exist, top-level government leadership serves as a com-
mon denominator, to help drive the agenda, financially support the identification program, and foster integration.
Several lessons learned are noteworthy.



Enrolment
Enrolment poses a central challenge for identity platforms to achieve nationwide coverage of data collection
about citizens. Partnerships are one way by which the task of enrolment can be managed. The approach worked
well in India, where the government took an “ecosystem approach” and an “incentive approach” to brokering part-
nerships. The government still required extra effort to coordinate partnerships and make them work. In contrast,
the government of Pakistan conducted enrolment centrally, under one institution, and spent greater time and
effort to reach nationwide coverage.



Citizen Demand
An understanding of citizen demand can help policymakers address challenges faced by citizens in being
enrolled. These challenges may be due to bureaucratic literacy, transaction cost, opportunity cost, vulnerability
to corruption, and lack of social capital. As a result, the poor may be unable to get registered or benefit from
services offered by the government or the private using digital identity. In India, for example, despite processes
being automated for enrolment, applications for birth certificates incurred heavy transaction cost, for gathering
supporting documents, and resulted in high rejection rate, since birth certificate issuance had to be concurred by
three different officers.63



Data
Digital identity platforms capture sensitive data about citizens. As a harmonized identity ecosystem becomes
more tightly coupled, or takes the form of a single warehouse, data about citizens gets clustered. The risks
associated with information security and privacy thus become higher in case information is misused or exploited.
Strong legal safeguards are necessary to mitigate the risks associated with data security and privacy.

Credential
The choice of credential poses several considerations: (a) a multi-functional identity credential offers new func-
tionality though has the potential to conflate the institutional roles of unique identity and service delivery; (b) a cre-
dential adds costs; and (c) supporting infrastructure for accepting multi-functional identity cards may be required.
In Pakistan, the government used a simple card in its first rollout of national identity, and a smartcard in sub-
sequent rollouts. In India, the government opted not to use a physical credential, and instead offered a unique
identity number (i.e., Aadhaar) on a piece of paper. In Ghana, the government offers a simple card free of charge,
and a smartcard for a fee.



Harmonization
Each country adopts a harmonization approach suitable to its country context. A federated and minimalist
approach to harmonization, in the form of a loosely coupled model, is a good way to start and can be powerful
in simplifying harmonization and bringing coordination amongst identity platforms with a unique identity number.
In India, the government used a loosely coupled model to harmonize different identity platforms throughout the
country. In Pakistan, the government used the single warehouse approach, and thus faced greater risks for infor-
mation security and privacy.

11               Considerations for a Roadmap


Nigeria has long recognized the need for national identity, and has made several attempts to establish a national
identity registry, albeit with mixed success. Today, the advent of electronic applications and services puts a
renewed emphasis on having a widely available digital identity in Nigeria. The need is acutely felt by government
agencies and the private sector that strive to offer services to their beneficiaries and consumers. In the absence
of a scaled-up national identity, multiple identities have mushroomed in Nigeria, creating a fiscal burden, and
causing public and private sector inefficiencies.

The federal government of Nigeria may consider the following steps in preparing a revised roadmap for a mod-
ern, well-developed, and integrated identity ecosystem in Nigeria.

   •	   Sharpen the vision of identification with an emphasis on rapid scale-up, full integration, and
        cost optimization: The federal government started out with a wholesome and clear vision for national
        identification, as given by the NIMC Act of 2007, and additional related Acts. The NIMC Act mandates
        NIMC to set up a national identity registry, issue national identity cards, provide identity verification
        services, interlink all identity registries, and stay on the cutting-edge of identity management. The
        related Acts provide for civil registration, legal residency, and electoral voting, amongst other areas.
        Yet, eight years later, though progress is made, the vision of a widely available national identity is not
        fully realized, due to known hurdles and challenges.
        Nigeria faces an urgent need of scaling up national identity, integrating identity systems, cutting fiscal
        costs, and achieving efficiency in service delivery and management by addressing challenges more
        rapidly dealing with identity management.
        In light of these, the country’s vision for identification may require further refinement, keeping in view
        longer-term objectives of a modern identity system that is financially and operationally practical.
   •	   Strengthen the policy and legal environment: A refined vision would dictate a re-examination of the
        policy and legal environment, with an eye towards scale-up, integration, and cost. Since 2007, new
        advances in identity management have emerged that may inform the policy and legal environment of
        identification in Nigeria. The proliferation of mobile phones, growing use of online and mobile applica-
        tions, and resulting surge of electronic data require a hard look at security and privacy of information.
        Strong legal safeguards are thus necessary for security and privacy.
        A robust assessment of the legal enabling environment is an important step; to review, among other
        things, the existing institutional and governance arrangements, and the robustness of any safeguards
        for individual privacy and data protection. The incidence of multiple identity programs, with little or
        no interoperability across the systems, can be symptomatic of weaknesses in the legal framework
        (and underlying policy imperatives). A critical step towards harmonizing institutional and governance
        arrangements, ensuring consistent technical standards and interoperability, and providing robust pri-
        vacy and data protection provisions, depends upon the development and implementation of a holistic
        and coherent legal enabling environment.
        A supportive enabling environment for digital identity can also pave the way for further innovations,
        including electronic commerce, mobile financial services, and modern transport, in Nigeria.

     •	   Drive integration of parallel identity systems: Despite notable steps taken by government, the
          identity systems of Nigeria remain mostly unintegrated. The government set up a Harmonization Com-
          mittee in 2005, a Presidential Implementation Committee in 2006–2007, a Cabinet Committee in 2011,
          and a Presidential Committee on Centralisation of biometric-linked databases in MDAs in 2013. NIMC
          has carried out work on harmonisation and integration since 2007 under its Implementation Commit-
          tee. Despite these efforts, the number of parallel identity systems in Nigeria has grown. A renewed
          focus on integration can be helped by a simplified approach to integration, and greater coordination
          amongst government agencies. The availability of identity verification is necessary for integration of
          identity systems, and needs to be expedited.
     •	   Optimize costs: Low cost of identity development in Nigeria is critical. Low cost can achieved in three
          ways: (a) by reducing the cost of each identity program; (b) by eliminating costs due to inefficiencies of
          parallel identity systems; and (c) by streamlining several aspects of identity programs to avoid duplica-
          tion of efforts and achieve synergy.
          In reducing the cost of each identity program, the unit cost of identity per person is a key measure. It
          defines the operational efficiency of an identity program. It drives planning of identity development. It
          serves as a benchmark to keep implementation on track. The unit cost of identity per person is derived
          by a detailed business model of the organization running the identity system.
          The unit cost of the foundational identity should be thoroughly checked and optimized, and be fully
          aligned with the organization and operations of the national identity registry. The unit cost of functional
          identity programs should be examined, in particular to minimize or eliminate any duplication in biomet-
          ric enrolment, and to allow seamless and rapid integration.
          In eliminating costs due to inefficiencies of a parallel identity system, the integration approach is key.
     •	   Support partnerships: Partnerships can be helpful for dividing large tasks, distributing responsi-
          bilities, and exploiting core competencies of diverse organizations. Yet, partnerships are tricky. They
          require heavy coordination amongst partnering parties. A weak partnership can at times be counter-
          productive, slowing down shared operations.
          The federal government of Nigeria has made several attempts to use partnerships in developing iden-
          tity programs, though with mixed results.
          Partnerships may still be necessary, both for enrolment and for bulk services. Scaling up enrolments,
          for example, is a difficult exercise without partnerships. Similarly, partnering with the private sector
          may be helpful in card infrastructure and services, including for printing and acceptance. Building new
          capacity to carry out these functions is a tall order.
     •	   Mobilize resources: The federal government should prioritize mobilizing sufficient resources for iden-
          tity development in Nigeria, once a well-developed plan is in place, an integration model is refined,
          and unit cost of identity per person is fully optimized. The government may consider fiscal appropria-
          tions, donor contributions, and private sector participation. A coordinated approach to funding across
          government for different identity systems can help achieve fiscal efficiency.
     •	   Scale up with speed: Since 2007, a lot of work has been done on identity in Nigeria. Though, rapid
          scale-up of enrolments remains a major hurdle. The speedy development of a national identity regis-
          try, with 173.6 million entries, reflecting the country’s total population, is necessary for Nigeria’s eco-
          nomic and social development, and for integrating the country’s different identity platforms.
