Executive Summary
Most commodity prices continued to rise in the third quarter from their lows in early 2016. Crude oil prices are forecast
to rise to $55 per barrel in 2017 from an average of $43/bbl this year as the market continues to rebalance and OPEC
is likely to limit output. Metals prices are projected to rise more sharply in 2017 than forecast in July, as a result of
faster-than-expected mine closures. Agricultural commodities prices are anticipated to rise slightly in 2017 after a
minimal decline this year but with wide variations in the outlook for different commodities depending on supply condi-
tions. This issue of the Commodity Markets Outlook analyzes OPEC’s recent decision to limit output by examining
earlier commodity agreements and assessing the implications of changing market forces over the past decades. It con-
cludes that commodity agreements have limited ability to influence global prices over extended periods of time and
eventually collapse, often with unintended consequences. The ability of OPEC, the only surviving commodity organiza-
tion seeking to influence markets, will be tested in the presence of unconventional oil suppliers, notably the U.S. shale
oil industry.

                  OPEC in historical context: Commodity
                  agreements and market fundamentals
On September 28, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to limit crude
oil output to 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day, effectively ending two years of unrestrained production. This marked
an important policy shift, especially for Saudi Arabia, the organization’s largest producer. The details of OPEC’s plan
are to be worked out and announced at the group’s meeting on November 30. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Libya, and
Nigeria, all OPEC members, are likely to be exempted from the production limits because of earlier production losses.
The plan, if implemented, would be the first production cut since 2008. OPEC is also preparing a framework for
consultations with non-OPEC producers. Against this background, this Special Focus section addresses the following
questions: (1) What does OPEC’s new plan entail? (2) How does OPEC compare with earlier formal commodity agree-
ments? (3) What do market forces over the past decade imply for OPEC’s ability to control prices? It concludes that
formal commodity agreements have limited ability to influence the market and eventually collapse, often with unin-
tended consequences. In the case of OPEC, the only surviving commodity organization seeking to influence markets,
guiding global oil prices will be challenging in the presence of unconventional oil producers, notably U.S. shale oil.

aggregate comprising sawlogs and veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood except wood fuel. Sawnwood, reported in cubic meters solid
volume, includes wood that has been produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds
6mm in thickness.

M     ost commodity prices rose in the third quarter from lows
earlier in the year, with gains in energy and metals partly offset
by declines in grains and fertilizers. Crude oil prices are forecast
to rise to $55 per barrel in 2017 from $43/bbl as OPEC limits
production. Energy prices, which also include coal and natural
gas, are seen jumping 24 percent next year. Metals prices are
forecast to rise next year. Agricultural prices are expected to
post a modest increase overall in 2017, including food prices.

A Special Focus analyzes OPEC’s plan to limit production.
Historically, agreements aimed at influencing the prices of
commodities such as tin and coffee have succeeded in swaying
markets for a time but eventually lost that ability and collapsed.
OPEC’s ability to affect oil prices is likely to be tested by the
expansion of oil supply from unconventional sources, especially
shale producers.

The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook is published
quarterly, in January, April, July, and October. The report
provides detailed market analysis for major commodity groups,
including energy, metals, agriculture, precious metals, and
fertilizers. Price forecasts to 2025 for 46 commodities are also
presented, together with historical price data. Commodity price
data updates are published separately at the beginning of each
month.
