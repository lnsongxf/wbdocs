An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets



Executive Summary

In the recent years, economic performance in Turkey has been praised due to its sustained
growth trends, stability and capacity to weather the global financial crisis. However, a number
of issues related to the labor market and unemployment trends continue to be the economic
and political underbelly to these positive trends. The conspicuously low labor force
participation among women over the years deserves special attention among these problems.
The objective of this report is to provide an institutional analysis of public policies and programs
targeting women’s access to labor markets and entrepreneurial activities. The report seeks to
provide a comprehensive inventory of public programs, targeting women’s employment and
entrepreneurship and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these programs with respect
to their sustainability, institutional commitment, and their ability to address barriers to
women’s labor force participation.

In Turkey, women’s participation in the labor force has historically been low. While 34 percent
of the women were in the labor force in 1990, the rate declined to 26 percent over the course
of the following decade and recovered up to 29 percent by 2012. Cross-country comparisons
show that women in Turkey participate in the labor force at a much smaller rate compared to
countries in all income groups. This is the case even in comparison with the lower-middle
income countries, where women’s labor participation rate is 40 percent. Currently, Turkey
outperforms only the MENA region where women’s labor force participation has consistently
been around 20 percent. However, it has to be noted that the gap between Turkey and the
region has narrowed down since 1990 because of the increasing share of women getting out of
the labor force in Turkey.

In Turkey, in the last few decades, there has been a distinct shift from agriculture to urban
industries and we have also witnessed a corollary migration from rural areas to the cities.
Women, who used to be employed in the agricultural sector, have not been able to easily find
employment in the urban areas due to a number of reasons. Export-led growth has been
unable to generate the kind of employment that could absorb rural labor supply of women
released from agriculture. In the 1980-2009 period, it was the service sector, rather than
manufacturing, which became the engine of increasing demand for female labor. However, jobs
in the service sector were accessible only for women with higher levels of education. This
finding has led some researchers to also draw attention to the lack of education and
marketable skills of the urban-to-rural migrant women as one of the reasons behind the
declining rates of female employment. Yet, the recent improvements in the educational
attainment of women after 1998, the resulting late entry to marriage, reduction in fertility and
the increase in the minimum legal age for retirement are believed to reverse the negative trend
in women participation. The workplace practices that can be considered to be discriminatory
against women are likely to appear throughout the cycle of hiring, wage determination,
promotional decisions and termination of work, or work-life balance. Many jobs that are
equally available to women and men, might present working conditions that are
unaccommodating of the needs of female workers, and as a result, for many women paid
employment ceases to be an attractive.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


With regard to the impact of existing social policy reforms on women’s employ ment,
discussions focus on the legal changes enacted, the quality and content of programs envisioned
as well as the contradictory impact these may have. Support for women’s employment has
been left to market-oriented measures, such as tax reduction for employers, who hire
additional women workers and legislative changes enabling flexible work arrangements. A final
focus in this study has been on the initiatives that aim to encourage women’s
entrepreneurship. Given that the percentages of women among entrepreneurs in Turkey are
even lower than that of women in the labor force, if the barriers to women’s entrepreneurial
activities are removed, it appears that there is substantial room for improvement.

Given the declining trends in Turkey, in the recent years the state has undertaken various
initiatives through legal changes and policy decisions. Gender equality in employment and
entrepreneurship has been part of public policy framework for the last two decades. This
attention has manifested itself especially with the beginning of the European Union accession
process in 1999 and the start of negotiations in 2005. The latest Commission Report issued in
2012 describes that Turkey has achieved “some, but uneven progress” in the area of women’s
labor force participation. To this end, the Turkish government has implemented several legal
reforms and has been working to build up public institutional capacity for gender equality in
economic life.

In 2004, an addendum to the constitution included the principle of gender equality, whose
enforcement was the responsibility of the state. In 2009, Committee on Equality of Opportunity
for Women and Men was established under the auspices of the Turkish Parliament. It has
enacted equal treatment in hiring, remuneration, promotion and termination of job contract.
These changes can be linked to the adoption of the new Labor Law, in 2003, which has made it
illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of gender.

In 2008, an employment package was issued exempting employers from paying social security
contributions when they hired women. The new legislation revised the Law on Unemployment
Insurance making it possible for the state to use it for the financing of new hires, women aged
above 18 for women and young men aged between 18 and 29.

On May 2010 Prime Ministry issued the circular “Increasing Female Employment and Ensuring
Equal Opportunities.” This circular is a comprehensive document issued for purposes of
women’s increased labor force participation.

In the National Employment Strategy, completed in 2014, women are classified under the
heading of vulnerable groups that need special treatment due to their low participation in the
labor market. The strategy has set the target for women’s labor force participation at 41% by
2023. The plan identified the Ministry of Family and Social Policies as the responsible
institution.

The 10th Development Plan, which was approved by the Parliament in July 2013, sets the target
for women’s labor force participation at 34.9 % by the year 2018. To reach this target,

                                                 8

alternative models of work-family reconciliation policies that will be implemented are listed as
the adoption of flexibility together with security, provision of sufficient and accessible childcare
services and parental leave. The development plan has also given priority to women’s
entrepreneurship together with youth entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship.

This report sets its goal as interrogating in a holistic manner, programs’ objectives, contents,
and ability to address problems standing in the way of women’s labor force participation. The
aim of the report is not to conduct an impact analysis of these public programs, but to provide
an extensive inventory of institutions and the specific departments and the programs that are
directly responsible to carry out the public policies on the issue of women’s employment and
entrepreneurship. Programs evaluated in this report were chosen on the basis of their scope
both in terms of their targets and funding schemes. Local programs with very narrow scopes
were not taken into the inventory. Only the programs, which target to create new employment
and entrepreneurship opportunities for women with a wide sphere of influence, were included.

The initial objective of this report was to lay out an inventory of the activities of various public
institutions which cater to women’s employment and entrepreneurship , separately. However,
upon analyzing firstly the standard policy documents, information available on official websites,
and very limited statistical information as part of the desk study, and secondly deciphering the
in-depth expert interviews with the officials, it became clear that employment and
entrepreneurship programs are in no way clearly delineated from each other in terms of their
aims, targets, selection criteria, managing official bodies, outcomes and monitoring activities.
Processes of identifying program priorities, the governance structure, specific measures taken
to address gender-specific barriers to employment and entrepreneurship, selection criteria
used for determining micro-scale grant projects, results of monitoring, impact evaluations and
beneficiary evaluations are not designed separately for specific requirements of employment
schemes and entrepreneurship activities. Most employment operations inherently encompass
variations of entrepreneurship goals deriving from a pool of similar budgets. Moreover, there is
a significant overlap between institutions in terms of their coverage of participants, and
program priorities, which make a separate analysis of their funding structures and outcomes
very difficult. Therefore, the inventory of programs that are outlined in this report is not strictly
categorized as employment and entrepreneurship projects.

We assess these programs according to their targeting procedures, included activities and
governance processes with respect to the issues that arise in the implementation. We analyze
whether these programs specify target groups of women with respect to demographic
characteristics, income criteria, and geographic location. We also describe sectoral choices with
an eye to their potential for creating labor force participation opportunities for women.

Public programs analyzed in this report can be divided into two groups according to the criteria
of target groups. The first group targets sections of the entire population out of labor force and
unemployed, without any gender specifications. The second group devises specific instruments
to boost women’s employment and entrepreneurship. This classification reveals that, in the
recent years, the state actors in cooperation with some stakeholders have been actively

                                                 9
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


running projects, catering specifically to increasing women’s employment and
entrepreneurship opportunities. The initiation of the targeted programs is an encouraging
trend. However, we have concerns about the fact that the initiatives that target women are
mostly temporary projects. They are funded by one-shot budget allocations. If these projects
continue to retain their temporary and addendum characteristics, this is disruptive to the goal
of reaching and preserving higher levels of women’s employment and entrepreneurship.

While the capabilities and needs of women vary by their socio-economic status and their
geographic location; most of the available programs focus on women, whose income and
education levels are low. The programs’ focus on women, with lower access to education,
should be commended. The trainings they offer are an important opportunity for women to
gain market-relevant skills. However, the low income levels of women (and their households)
always contribute to an inherent tension in the programs, between goals of immediate poverty
reduction / social inclusion and creating long-term patterns of employment and
entrepreneurship.

The public programs covered in this report can be also assessed based on the sectors of
economic activity in which women’s employment and entrepreneurship is promoted: Our
report shows that the programs carry the danger of repeating existing gendered divisions of
labor and the ensuing capacity to access the labor market. For long-term positive results in
changing existing horizontal and vertical segregations in the market, there should be more
focus on how to change gendered assumptions about divisions of labor within the programs’
design. Moreover, there could be more critical attention paid to actual market conditions. If, for
instance, women are routinely encapsulated in the production of niche local food and
souvenirs, market for which is precarious and in some cases already disappearing, this poses a
problem for the sustainability of the entrepreneurial activities. Our interpretation is that if the
programs can channel the gamut of activities and the officers’ extensive stock of exper ience
toward achieving a more gender-neutral sectoral distribution, then the programs can achieve
sustainable increases in percentages of women’s employment and entrepreneurship and can
make sure these increases also mean into less precarious income opportunities for women.

One of the most important impediments to women’s labor force participation is the unequal
distribution of care responsibility in the households. Given the significance of this barrier, it is
crucial to design policies and programs that directly aim at provision of affordable care services
or incentives for women with children to enter and survive in the labor market. Yet providing
consistent solution to this problem is beyond the reach of public programs that are
implemented on a temporary basis.

Provision of vocational trainings addresses the barriers of low education levels and lack of
occupational experience. These are the most widespread activities implemented in the
programs. Programs succeed providing equal opportunities for women and men in terms of
training. And in some programs, the number of women who participated in the trainings even
exceeds that of men. However, this equality in training does not translate directly to


                                                10

employment outcome despite the intensified mediating activity of several institutions in the
recent years.

A similar advancement is observed in the entrepreneurial training programs. This situation
should be assessed positively as it implies an increase in training opportunities for potential
women entrepreneurs. The widespread availability of trainings for employment and
entrepreneurship is an important opportunity for groups, whose previous access to marketable
skill development was negligible. Therefore these programs have significant potential for
addressing the problem of lack of education and skills. There are a number of ways in which
these efforts can be improved. First, there is a great deal of repetition and concentration in the
same areas. If programs can be revised to capture women’s heterogeneity, the degree of
successful transition from training to employment/entrepreneurship could be increased.
Moreover, there is a need for the content of the training programs to be redesigned in line with
market requirements. This outcome necessitates designing of stronger links between the
trainings and market conditions, especially for women. It is also necessary that existing
expertise in this area be turned into permanent programs, rather than remain as short-term
projects.

Women entrepreneurs are most vulnerable in the start-up and their access to mentors and
necessary business networks is of critical importance in this phase. Very few programs provide
institutional support to new entrepreneurs, yet their outreach is limited. Similarly, women’s
deficient access to finance is a major barrier to their entrepreneurial activities. Training is only
an initial step in fostering entrepreneurial potential. Programs that include focus on
mentorship, access to business networks and access to finance are vital for achieving increased
percentages of successful enterprises. We strongly recommend the designing and widespread
implementation of programs with such a holistic approach.

Many of the programs covered in this report engage in dissemination activity, which targets
vocational consultants at ISKUR, male workers and employers to address the cultural codes and
practices that prevent women from entering in the labor market. These cultural codes and
practices are important obstacles to women’s labor force participation, both on the demand
and the supply side. Their results will be apparent in the long run. We suggest that for these to
have the desired effect, they could be made permanent parts of state run programs, instead of
being project based.

This report has revealed that the state is actively involved in running a variety of programs that
aim to abolish some of the important barriers to women’s labor force participation. While these
efforts are very important, there are two issues with respect to institutional structure. First,
these are part of a terrain of more general programs, which aim to resolve problems of
unemployment for all sectors of society. However, while programs that target general
unemployment issues are permanently established, those aiming to target specifically women
are more on a project basis. For these programs to be sustainable and to have permanent
effect, they, too, should be included in the permanent budget of the state.

Second, even though these are issues regarding labor force participation, when the focus is on
women, the responsibility is allocated to the Ministry of Family and Social Policies (MoFSP).
However, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS) has to take responsibility embracing
the principles of gender mainstreaming in work life. A cooperation between these two
Ministries can only be possible when MoLSS prioritizes such principles in line with MoFSP and
they have binding protocols to work together to promote women’s employment and
entrepreneurship. This institutional arrangement also reinforces the tension between whether
these are programs targeting social inclusion or increased employment / entrepreneurial
opportunities for women. It goes without saying that labor force participation is an important
aspect of social inclusion. However encapsulating the two together for women results in a
situation where goals of women’s labor force participation become instrumental to household
poverty reduction and where only women are thought of in gendered terms.

A third, and serious problem we encountered during the research was the lack of available data
on various aspects of these programs: from the budgets to the target group specifications, from
the characteristics of the beneficiaries to the outcomes of the programs. Available data also
appears to be severely fragmented. In the absence of baseline data and with very limited
outcome figures, it is almost impossible to make an impact analysis for any of these programs.
There is a dire need for more structured and continuous data collection to be able to assess the
impact of the money spent. This is also crucial for achieving any sort of sustainability in these
programs.

The public programs discussed in this report predominantly address issues related to education
through the trainings they organize. However, in the absence of data to conduct impact
analysis, their effect on changing the existing labor market structures remains to be seen.
Existing figures reveal, however, there is weak transition from training to employment /
entrepreneurship unless they are bolstered with additional measures, such as employment
guarantees in the case of employment, or, for instance, mentorship, in the case of
entrepreneurship. A similar finding is true for all other programs: for all efforts and budget
spent to be successful and sustainable, there is need for holistic approaches, which take into
consideration the multifarious barriers that stand in front of women’s labor force participation.
While what is currently done produces an impressive array of experience and expertise in the
field, this needs to be translated into future models and program applications.

1. Introduction

In the recent years, economic performance in Turkey has been praised due to its sustained
growth trends, stability and capacity to weather the global financial crisis. However, a number
of issues related to the labor market and unemployment trends continue to be the underbelly
to these positive trends. The conspicuously low labor force participation among women over
the years deserves special attention among these problems. The objective of this report is to
provide an institutional analysis of public policies and programs targeting women’s access to
labor markets and entrepreneurial activities from a gender perspective. The report seeks to
undertake the following activities:

   Provide a comprehensive overview of public programs targeting women’s employment and
    entrepreneurship.
   Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of these programs with respect to their
    sustainability, institutions’ commitment, and their ability to address barriers to women’s
    labor force participation.

Women’s employment and entrepreneurship in Turkey has been the subject of various
economic and sociological studies. The main trends in this literature have been a distinct focus
on the factors behind women’s declining labor force participation before 2004 and the
currently low labor force participation as well as mechanisms to increase it. Accordingly factors
include structural changes in the economy, household care giving responsibilities that
disproportionately fall on the shoulders of women and the dominance of patriarchal culture.
Studies suggest the positive impact legal changes, improvement in work conditions for women,
education targeting cultural factors and the encouragement of women’s entrepreneurship
could play. These also critique existing public policies in these areas, especially questioning
their link with women’s empowerment. Below we outline these studies and then explain the
contribution we propose in this report.

In Turkey, women’s participation in the labor force has historically been low (Figure 1): While
34 percent of the women older than 15 were in the labor force in 1990, the rate declined to 26
percent over the course of the following decade and recovered up to 28.8 percent by 2011.
Within these percentages, 5.3% of the working population was employers. Only 6.9% of this
group was women. (TUIK, 2010) In this period, the labor force participation trends among men
and women largely followed each other. However, men’s labor force participation is less
volatile reflecting the higher sensitivity of women’s decisions and opportunities to work to
short-term economic fluctuations. The female unemployment rate is 3 percentage points
higher than the male unemployment rate, though male and female rates have tended to move
in tandem: While it was in the range of 6-9 percent in the 1990s, the decade following 2012
witnessed a moderate though persistent increase in the unemployment rates, which fluctuated
roughly between 9-12 percent.

Figures 2 and 3 show the women labor force participation in Turkey in comparison with the
rest of the world by regional and income categories, as defined in the World Bank statistics.
Figure 2 reveals that women in Turkey participate in the labor force at a much smaller rate
compared to countries in all income groups. This is the case even in comparison with the lower-
middle income group, where women’s labor participation rate is 40 percent. Figure 3 shows
that in the 1990s Turkey and Latin America were at similar points, but there has been a sizeable
divergence since then. In Latin America women’s labor force participation increased from 40%
in 1990 to 53% by 2012. This achievement places the region above EU and world averages.
Currently, Turkey outperforms only the MENA region where women’s labor force participation
has consistently been around 20 percent. However, in this particular case it has to be noted
that the gap between Turkey and the region has narrowed down since 1990 because of the
increasing share of women getting out of the labor force in Turkey.

In the literature until recently Turkey is categorized as “southern country” where the ‘male
bread-winner’ model is more prevalent, along with Spain, Greece, Italy and Mexico
(Karamessini, 2008). Common characteristics assigned to these countries are low female labor
force participation, high unemployment rate, a short working career in paid jobs, a low
incidence of part-time jobs and low levels of externalization of care giving responsibilities.
Including Mexico as well, Figure 4 clearly shows that while the four countries began from
almost identical points in 1990, there has been a visible divergence since then. Unlike Turkey,
                                               15
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


they all succeeded in increasing women’s participation in labor force. Spain is the most
successful case, where LFPR almost got to the world average and it is followed by Greece and
Mexico. Italy achieved a more moderate progress. Turkey’s performance was the lowest.

Given the declining trends in Turkey, in the recent years the state has undertaken various
initiatives through legal changes and policy decisions as well as through specific programs. The
objective of this report is to analyze how these top-level policy decisions transpire in the
activities of various public institutions, which cater to women’s labor force participation. The
report aims to contribute to existing literature and policy discussions by presenting a detailed
portrayal of the implementation of the programs. The report is organized as follows:

Following the introduction, Section 2 summarizes the literature on women’s employment and
entrepreneurship in Turkey in a comparative perspective. Section 3 presents the data sources
and the methodology, which informed this report. This section will include descriptions of all
public institutions that are part of policy making in the terrain of women’s employment and
entrepreneurship. Section 4 will look into the general legal and policy framework that shape
women’s labor force participation in Turkey. In section 5 we will provide an inventory of public
programs targeting women’s employment and entrepreneurship. In section 6 we will present
the assessment of these programs in terms of their content, coverage, funding, sustainability,
institutional commitment, and their ability to address barriers to women’s labor force
participation.

2. The State of Women’s Employment and Entrepreneurship in Turkey: A
Review of Existing Literature

One of the dominant questions in the literature has been why Turkey, despite its apparent
economic growth, continues to have such low percentages of women employed outside of
home. This question can be explored both in terms of domestic dynamics, and in terms of what
has happened in other cases around the world. For Turkey, macro-level structural changes in
the economy; demographic characteristics of women as well as cultural factors have been
considered. Internationally, structural changes in the economies of various different contexts as
well as the social policy environments have been discussed. Both discussions point to the
importance of designing policies to raise women’s employment and entrepreneurship within
the context of general objectives of women’s empowerment and gender equality.

In Turkey, in the last few decades, there has been a distinct shift from agriculture to urban
industries and the resulting migration from rural areas to the cities. Women, who used to be
employed in the agricultural sector, have not been able to easily find employment in the urban
areas due to a number of reasons (Özbay, 1994). Export-led growth has been unable to
generate the kind of employment that could absorb rural labor supply of women released from
agriculture (Çağatay and Berik, 1991, Başlevent and Onaran, 2004;, İlkkaracan, 2012). In the
1980-2009 period, it was the service sector, rather than manufacturing, that became the engine
of increasing demand for female labor (İlkkaracan, 2012). However, jobs in the service sector
were accessible only for women with higher levels of education (İlkkaracan, 2012). This finding
has led some researchers to also draw attention to the lack of education and marketable skills
of the rural-to-urban migrant women as one of the reasons behind the declining rates in the
female employment (Tansel, 2001; Tunalı and Gursel, 2007). Yet, the recent improvements in
the educational attainment of women after 1998, the resulting late entry to marriage,
reduction in fertility and the increase in the minimum legal age for retirement are believed to
reverse the negative trend in women participation (Tunalı and Başlevent, 2006).

Studies based on Turkish Statistical Institute and Turkish Demographic and Health Survey data
have found that in addition to education; age, marital status and number of children are also
important determinants of female labor force participation (Gündüz-Hoşgör and Smits, 2006;
Dayıoğlu and Kırdar, 2010). Dayıoğlu and Kırdar (2010) have drawn attention to the fact th at
having a university education more than doubles the chances for participation. İlkkaracan
(2012) argued that women predominantly participate in the labor force at younger ages, prior
to marriage and childbirth. In fact the number of children in the household (ages 0-14) is found
to decrease the participation of women (Dayıoğlu and Kırdar 2010).

A third line of research has focused on the effects of cultural values, pre-existing gender roles
and their concomitant reflections in poor working conditions f or women (Kardam and Toksöz,
2004; Buğra, 2013). Based on the findings of studies conducted as a part of the 1994 -98
Women's Employment Promotion Project, Toksöz and Kardam (2004) have argued that social
norms about the proper behavior and place of women in society play a hindering role in the
entrance of women to labor market. Buğra (2013) has gone further in arguing that
                                                17
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


conservatism in Turkey plays a big role in naturalizing and legitimizing gender-based
differences. In other words there are various discriminatory practices against women in the
workplaces, manifest throughout the cycle of hiring, wage determination, promotional
decisions and termination of work (Kardam and Toksöz, 2004). For most jobs available to
women, working conditions remain poor and unaccommodating of the needs of female
workers: as a result paid employment ceases to be an attractive option for women (Buğra,
2013). Similar findings are noted by İlkkaracan (2012), drawing attention to the weak labor
force attachment of women.

2.1 International Debates on Policy

There have also been various international studies assessing patterns of women’s labor force
participation. The literature takes into consideration, structural changes such as the emergence
of flexible productions systems, tertiarization in developed economies, relocation of industrial
production to developing countries and concomitant expansion of services to propose that
women’s labor force participation is likely to follow a U-shaped curve but that levels of
women’s labor force participation and experience depend ultimately as much on the policy
environment and the specific country contexts as structural changes in the economy and their
timing (Buğra, 2012). These debates point to the importance of thinking about women’s
increased levels of employment and entrepreneurship within the context of holistic approaches
that target women’s empowerment. Without policies that steer toward more equitable sharing
of household responsibilities and encourage a shift in cultural practices toward those favoring
gender equality, women’s increased participation in the labor force is likely to lead to double
burdens for them.

ILO (2004, p.6) emphasizes that increases in women’s labor force participation and
employment rates are strongly associated with declining fertility rates. In other words, child
bearing responsibility is a major factor behind women’s decisions to enter the labor market and
work. However, regardless of how low or high fertility rates are, within all welfare regimes,
employment continuity is highest in countries where states provide support for working
mothers (Stier et al., 2001). Evidence from OECD countries show that effective policies that
increase and sustain women’s labor force participation are more neutral tax treatment of
second earners, stronger tax incentives to share work between spouses, accessible childcare
services, paid maternity and parental leaves while child benefits seem to reduce the
percentages (Jaumotte, 2003). Access to collective childcare services improves the chances of
women with lower household income, who cannot afford private childcare, to enter the labor
market (OECD, 2007)

Studies have also offered increased availability of part-time work makes a difference for
reconciling professional work and family responsibilities, because it offers flexibility in time
management for women. However the evidence on part-time work is mixed (Jaumotte, 2003).
It is the quality of part time work that makes a difference. While those which provide working
conditions and social benefits comparable to full-time jobs do contribute to women’s increased
labor force participation and improved gender equality, when part-time employment is more of
                                                18
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


a tool to fight overall unemployment, it tends to result in worse working conditions and social
benefits (Salido and Moreno, 2012: 26). If the latter is the case, these jobs may increase
women’s labor force participation but do not contribute to their overall well being.

Another observation has to do with policies encouraging women’s access to higher levels of
education. In several cases, higher educational attainment has been recognized as having an
overall positive effect but in some others the labor force participation of women with tertiary
degrees has been more or less stable with the increased activity among women with lower
degrees pushing up the rates (Andreotti and Mingione, 2012). In southern economies, with
which women’s labor force participation in Turkey was comparable in the early 1990s (but
which showed dramatic improvements unlike Turkey), educational advances coupled with
structural changes in the market have been especially effective (Leon and Migliavacca, 2013).
Improved access to higher education has meant that women were able to meet the conditions
of changes in the labor market. Other policies affecting female employment decisions have
included various kinds of subsidies to employers when they hired women and promotion of
occupational training for women, though the effect of the latter remained modest (Salido and
Moreno, 2012). In addition to the above factors in Spain and Italy, the Greek case suggests the
importance of legal changes which prohibited discrimination against pregnant women,
extended the duration of maternity leave, improved policies regarding the leave and
introduced parental leaves (Karamessini, 2012).

There have been other factors, however, which can explain why in this group of countries
women’s labor force participation continues to remain lower than averages elsewhere in
Europe. For instance, in the cases of Spain and (northern) Italy, improvement in women’s
educational status and changes in the labor market dynamics has resulted in impressive
increases in labor force participation even though there has not been a major change in welfare
policies regarding care provisioning (Leon and Migliavacca, 2013). The fact that the welfare
system continued to assume and rely on familial networks for childcare has meant that women
without access to alternative childcare opportunities had to take on the double burden of
household and professional work (Salido and Moreno, 2012; Andreotti and Mingione, 2012) or
delay having children or opt out of work outside of the household if they could. This case has
been especially true for women of lower economic strata, who cannot afford private child care,
consolidating existing inequalities (Andreotti and Mingione, 2012: 58-59). These studies reveal
the importance of defamilialization of care responsibilities and a reorganization of gendered
division of labor in the household for sustained levels of women’s labor force participation. In
the recent decades, there has also been globalized attention to women’s entrepreneurship.
One motivation for this is the link between women’s entrepreneurship , economic growth and
poverty reduction, especially in developing contexts. Within management studies, there is
mixed evidence that women, who are looking to have flexible work life to manage familial
obligations, may see entrepreneurial work as a viable strategy (Moore and Buttner, 1997;
Weiler and Bernasek, 2001). Applying their suggestions to contexts where there is low labor
force participation among women, policy makers have promoted women’s entrepreneurship
with the goal of balancing family-work life. A second reason for focus on women’s
entrepreneurship has been the potential entrepreneurial activities can have for creating social
                                                19
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


change and promoting gender equality (Calas, Smircich and Bourne 2009; Rindova, Barry, and
Ketchen 2009). Accordingly, increased women’s entrepreneurship does not only contribute to
increased labor force participation by women, but can also result in context specific changes
that break cultural resistance to women’s employment.

The critical approach within the same studies has argued that it is important to pay attention to
gendered power structures of each context in order to ascertain whether women’s
entrepreneurship results in women’s empowerment or not (Ahl, 2006). For instance, in the
context of southern economies such as Italy, with which Turkey has been historically
comparable; in the 1990s, “family friendly” policies were devised to encourage female
entrepreneurship. Yet, these have not resulted in the expected outcomes: instead, thinking of
family-work life reconciliation, rather than equal sharing of the household burden, as a primary
goal is argued to discourage women from self-employment, because of the double burden this
will create for them (Reyneri, 2010 cited in Karamessini 2012). Furthermore, data on Italy
reveals high self-employment among women but these are mostly precarious businesses, often
temporary and/or dependent on the actions of single clients (Andreotti and Mingione, 2012:
51). In development circles, since the 1990s, microcredit programs have also been promoted
with the argument that if poor women had access to credit, they could start small businesses,
which would contribute to improved gender dynamics at home as well as poverty alleviation
(Hashemi, Schuler, Riler 1996; Osmani 1998; Pitt and Khandker, 1996; Rahman, 2010). In other
words, entrepreneurial activities by poor women were seen as a solution to simultaneous
problems of social exclusion, women’s empowerment, and women’s labor force participation.
However, critical studies of these development programs reveal that there could be a dilemma
between these goals especially if the patterns of self-employment remain precarious and
concentrated in the informal sector. They also reveal the risk of reinforcing existing cultural
codes that govern women’s inequality instead of challenging them unless there is sustained
focus on women’s empowerment (Rankin, 2002; Rahman, Junankar, Mallik 2009; Karim 2011).
These findings give impetus to the argument that social policies should target women’s access
to decent jobs, in the formal sector, in an environment where care responsibilities are
defamilialized. In a broader framework, these studies point to the need to devise policies to
increase women’s entrepreneurship in ways that contribute to the goal of gender equality in all
areas of life.

2.2 Policy Debates in Turkey

In the case of Turkey, the first set of suggestions focus on the need to conduct comprehensive
legal reform that would not only encourage business owners to hire women, but also make
gender based discrimination more strictly punishable (İlkkaracan, 2012; Dedeoğlu, 2012). They
also promote the implementation of changes that would recreate work places with more
women-friendly policies, ranging from child care facilities to flexibility of work hours. Buğra
(2013) and İlkkaracan (2012) draws attention to the need for transformative policies that
address cultural values and gender roles. Finally, Ercan et al. (2011) considers education of both
men and women to be a possible solution for women’s low participation rate, while they argu e

                                                20
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


that the provision of care opportunities can affect the low participation problem only in a few
big cities.

With regard to the impact of existing social policy reforms on women’s employment,
discussions focus on the legal changes enacted, the quality and content of programs envisioned
as well as the contradictory impact these may have. Many studies contrast the persistence of
the male breadwinner/female caregiver family model with the anticipated influence of the
European Union accession process and the relevant legal reforms in the area of gender equality
(Kılıç, 2008; Buğra, 2012; Dedeoğlu, 2012). In fact, Gökşen et al. (2012) argue that these legal
reforms are far from creating gender equality in the labor market because whereas
employment policies are piecemeal and of questionable effectiveness, familialism and
pronatalism are well on the way of being institutionalized in legislative and policy reforms.
Dedeoğlu (2012) argues that support for women’s employment has been left to market -
oriented measures, such as tax reduction for employers, who hire additional women workers
and legislative changes enabling flexible work arrangements.

A final focus has been on the initiatives, which aim to encourage women’s entrepreneurship.
Given that the percentages of women among entrepreneurs in Turkey are even lower than that
of women in the labor force, if the barriers to women’s entrepreneurial activities are removed,
it appears that there is substantial room for improvement here. Studies conducted among
women small business owners have shown that one of the most significant barriers to
entrepreneurship is access to finance (Özar 2007). The structure of the formal finance system
that requires collateral affects women entrepreneurs disproportionately; as a result they
borrow less frequently than men and the amount they borrow are lower (Cindoğlu, 2003).
Other dominant factors that entrepreneurs themselves voice include limits to demand creation
and capacity building (Özar 2007). These latter problems are also related to the fact that most
women who attempt to start businesses are likely to be without sufficient labor market
experience and education. Culture appears to play an ambiguous role: on the one hand, familial
networks are utilized for the credit that institutions are unlikely to extend. On the other hand,
expectations from women with respect to household responsibilities have an impact on the
businesses they choose. A significant number of women go into sectors which can be seen as
extensions of home based work (Özar 2007). These women are unlikely to develop business
plans that could enhance capacity, diversify activities and, as a result, boost demand. As a result
the businesses remain fragile.

Ecevit’s study on public and civil society initiatives on women’s entrepreneurship, written for
the ILO, remains the only broad overview of the terrain in Turkey (Ecevit, 2007). She has argued
that programs that were implemented from the 1990s onward have not been holistic and have
not been linked to general issues of women’s employment. She has also emphasized that
approaching women’s self-employment as an income generating activity for poor households
does not necessarily translate into women’s empowerment (Ecevit, 2007). In fact, 90% of
women who are self-employed are in the informal sector: their earnings place them in the
lowest income group within the labor market, just above the unpaid family workers in
agriculture (Ercan, 2011). Scholarship on the issue of women’s empowerment through
                                                21
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


entrepreneurship has argued that these programs have been functioning as a social safety net
for those families living under increasingly precarious conditions; and they have done so
without challenging existing gender norms or gendered divisions of labor (Buğra and Yakut-
Çakar, 2010; Altan-Olcay 2014). Furthermore, as long as the government policies provide
incentives for home-based work in order to boost women’s labor force participation, the
patriarchal culture that constrains women’s choices outside of home is likely to be consolidated
(Kılıç 2008, Buğra, 2012). Studies of microcredit programs elsewhere also reveal similar
critiques regarding the dilemma between women’s empowerment and household poverty
alleviation These studies show the risk of reinforcing existing cultural codes that govern
women’s inequality instead of challenging them unless there is sustained focus on women’s
empowerment (Rankin, 2002; Karim 2011).

This literature provides a useful guideline for grasping the obstacles that stand in the way of
women’s increased labor force participation, whether through employment or
entrepreneurship. It also provides a series of the shortcomings, which the public programs
might as well avoid for achieving success. We aim to contribute to this literature by assessing
the current public policy programs and projects undertaken with the purpose of increasing
women’s employment and entrepreneurship in Turkey. This report sets its goal as interrogating
in a holistic manner, programs’ objectives, contents, and ability to address problems standing in
the way of women’s labor force participation, by specifically focusing on what happens during
their implementation.

In the next section we will briefly mention the recent changes and the current state of policy
and regulatory framework and institutional arrangements on issues of women’s employment
and entrepreneurship.

3. Reforms in the Regulatory Framework and Institutional Arrangements

This section focuses on the state of policy and regulatory framework and institutional
arrangements on issues of women’s employment and entrepreneurship. It begins with the EU
accession process and the relevant changes adopted in the last decade, at the level of the
constitution and laws. It also states further regulation to foster the implementation of these
changes, such as government circulars, strategy and action documents. Through this overview,
we aim to provide a general contextualization of the public programs aiming specifically at
increasing women’s labor force participation and entrepreneurial opportunities.

Gender equality in employment and entrepreneurship has been part of public policy framework
for the last two decades. This attention has manifested itself especially with the beginning of
the European Union accession process in 1999 and the start of negotiations in 2005. One of the
primary principles of the EU accession process is gender equality in all areas of life. Chapter 19
on Social Policy and Employment takes up, among other things, specifically equality between
men and women in terms of employment issues and rights. The latest Commission Report
issued in 2012 describes that Turkey has achieved “some, but uneven progress” in the area of
employment and social policy. Together with the setbacks in the exercise of trade union rights
                                                22
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


for workers and public servants, enforcement of health and safety at work and large-scale
informal work, women’s low labor force participation is seen as a problem area (EC, 2012).
While Chapter 19 has not been opened to negotiation yet, various legal and policy changes are
being adopted to fulfill requirements for future membership. To this end, the Turkish
government has implemented several legal reforms and has been working to build up public
institutional capacity for gender equality in economic life.

In 2004, an addendum to the constitution included the principle of gender equality, whose
enforcement was the responsibility of the state. In 2009, Committee on Equality of Opportunity
for Women and Men was established under the auspices of the Turkish Parliament. The
committee is responsible for issuing periodic reports on the progress toward gender equality
and conducting relevant public awareness programs. Citizens have the right to issue individual
complaints to this committee on matters related to gender-based discrimination. Finally, the
constitutional amendments of September 12, 2010 have explicitly stated that measures
adopted to achieve this equality will not be interpreted as contrary to the principle of equality.

These changes can be linked to other legal reforms, in the area of women’s employment and
entrepreneurship, ongoing since the adoption of the Labor Law, in 2003. The Labor Law has
made it illegal for employers to discriminate among workers on the basis of gender. It has
enacted equal treatment in hiring, remuneration, promotion and termination of job contract. It
has also adopted specific measures for protecting pregnant and breastfeeding women from
dangerous and night work as well as shifting the burden of proof in cases of sexual harassment
to employers. Finally, it has extended paid maternity leave from 12 to 16 weeks, and gave
women the option to take additional six months of unpaid leave. The Law on Public Servants
was also amended in 2011, extending the unpaid maternity leave from 12 months to 24 months
for women in the public sector. Additionally, the new legislation has prolonged the paid
paternity leave from 3 days to 10 days and entitled men up to 24 months of unpaid leave. This
unpaid leave is also made valid for men and women, adopting children under the age of three.

In 2008, an employment package was issued exempting employers from paying social security
contributions when they hired women. The new legislation revised the Law on Unemployment
Insurance making it possible for the state to use it for the financing of new hires, women aged
above 18 for women and young men aged between 18 and 29. Accordingly, for women hired
between July 1, 2008 and July 1, 2009, the state was to undertake 100% of the social security
costs for the first year, and continue at incrementally decreased rates for five years. This
provision has subsidized female employment creation, by reducing the cost of employment of
newly hired women for the employers. In 2009 and 2011, new regulations gradually extended
the term of the employment package until December 2015.

During the reform process, the changes in the constitution and Civil Code strengthened
women’s position in society as independent citizens (Kılıç, 2008), however social security
legislation continued to entitle social benefits to particular groups of women out of labor force,
such as spouses, widows, and daughters on the basis of their dependency status (Dedeoğlu,
2012). In 2011, new regulation also introduced the opportunity for home-based working

                                                23

women to have access to social security with lower contributions. This regulation can be seen
as the extension of a 2007 provision added to the Income Tax Law, which defined the status of
women, working home based, to produce goods for sale, as independent own-account
producers and granted them tax exemption.

On May 2010 Prime Ministry issued the circular “Increasing Female Employment and Ensuring
Equal Opportunities” No. 2010/14 issued in May 2010. This circu lar is considered to be the
most comprehensive document issued for purposes of women’s increased labor force
participation. The circular proposed the foundation of a “National Monitoring and Coordination
Committee on Female Employment - Kadın İstihdamı Ulusal İzleme ve Koordinasyon Kurulu” to
be headed by the Undersecretary of Ministry of Labor and Social Security and comprised of
high-level representatives of the relevant ministries, trade unions, NGOs and academics. This
committee was given the task of monitoring, analyzing and reporting on the existing situation
of female employment and establishing partnerships in order to find solutions. In addition, the
circular also envisaged collecting gender statistics; deploying the principle of gender equality in
the preparation and revision of all policies and strategic plans; ensuring gender equality and
equal opportunities in employment procedures in public institutions; and reforming the
content of non-formal education and vocational training to include issues such as women’s
human rights, training and employment opportunities for and guidance and consultancy during
job seeking to women. The circular also proposed implementing and monitoring the articles of
labor laws on childcare facilities in public and private workplaces.

The efforts to align Turkey regulatory framework with the EU gender equality acquis continued
under the EU twinning project on “Promoting Gender Equality in Working Life.” The Turkish
Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS) was twinned with Germany. The budget of the
program, implemented between the years 2010-2012, was 1 million Euros. The Ludwig
Boltzman Institute of Human Rights (BIM) together with the German Federal Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs, made a gap analysis in the areas of labor law, civil servants law, social
security law and trade union law and provided comprehensive recommendations for alignment.
They also provided training to the staff of MoLSS and Social Security Institution (SGK) with the
goal of raising their institutional capacity in terms of gender equality policies. Additionally, the
project has initiated a “Gender Equality Award” to be given to Turkish companies when they
implement gender-sensitive policies in their workplaces. The goal of this award was to raise
public awareness on issues of gender equality in the workplace. In addition to a series of
changes to be implemented in the relevant laws, the final report emphasized the requirement
of establishing an independent Equality Body competent to deal with all grounds of
discrimination.

EU accession process has also reflections on the regulations that govern the entrepreneurship
framework. Turkey has fully participated in the EU Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program
and Enterprise Europe Network in 2009. In the same year, the law governing Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB) was amended to expand the pool of
beneficiaries to include enterprises in sectors other than manufacturing. Following this reform,
KOSGEB initiated Entrepreneur Support Program in 2010 and as a result, upgraded its support
                                                24
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


schemes for business start-ups in the form of loans and grants. Within this Program, KOSGEB
has begun to implement the principle of positive discrimination for potential women
entrepreneurs.

In 2010, Turkey participated in the EU project on the “Implementation and Follow-up of the
Small Business Act in the Pre-Accession Region” that aimed at improving the business
environment for small and medium enterprises. Accordingly, Turkey became a party to Small
Business Act for Europe (SBA), which sets the ten principles guiding the design and
implementation of entrepreneurship policies. KOSGEB is the National Coordinator, whose task
is to monitor and implement policies aiming at facilitating and rewarding entrepreneurship. The
Prime Ministry circular letter on “Principles of Small Business Act for Europe” No. 2011/6 issued
in 2011 aimed to step up policy reforms for aligning the Turkish framework with the EU.
Currently an Entrepreneurship Strategy and Action Plan is under draft for the first time, aiming
to foster entrepreneurial culture in Turkey. It also aims to respond to the results of the 2012
Small Business Act assessments, in which Turkey received the lowest score in the areas of
entrepreneurial learning and women’s entrepreneurship (OECD-SBA, 2012). The plan envisaged
four actions in the field of women’s entrepreneurship:

      There is already an activity, built into the EU Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program,
       called Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors, which aims to provide networking
       opportunities for women in Turkey with successful women entrepreneurs from Europe.
       The goal is to expand this activity.
      It plans to complete a needs assessment analysis for the purpose of designing
       entrepreneurial training specifically for women,
      It plans to conduct a study of relevant the legislation from the perspective of women’s
       entrepreneurship, in order to facilitate reform in the regulatory framework,
      It plans to expand mentor support schemes for the purpose of encouraging women’s
       entrepreneurship.

These action plans are not conceived as the responsibility of KOSGEB. Their implementation is
assigned to the responsibility of Ministry of Family and Social Policies together with The
Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey (KAGİDER) and Union o f Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) Women Entrepreneurs Committee.

The current version of the strategy document also refers to the Cooperative Strategy and
Action Plan 2012-2016, where the formation of women’s cooperatives is on the list o f the
Ministry of Customs and Trade’s (MoCT) strategic targets for supporting women’s
entrepreneurial ability and thereby raising their welfare. According to this plan, MoCT is to
undertake the establishment of at least 20 women’s cooperatives and will be expected to this
performance indicator by 2016. This is the only action in which MoFSP is a party to the
implementation of this action plan. Additionally, the plan also includes the amendment of the
Cooperative Law No.1163 in order to facilitate the formation of cooperatives in different
sectors. The current version of the law is based on the needs of housing cooperatives, only.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


In the National Employment Strategy, completed in 2014, women are classified under the
heading of groups that need special treatment due to their low participation in the labor
market. The strategy emphasizes that women’s lower levels of education, lack of flexible
working arrangements in the bulk of jobs available and the absence of mechanisms which could
reconciliate women’s gender specific roles and work life contribute significantly to the low
participation. The strategy has set the target for women’s labor force participation at 41% by
2023. The plan for the years of 2012-2014 outlined eleven measures on which action needs to
be taken and has identified responsible institutions as Ministry of Family and Social Policies (6
measures), Ministry of Labor and Social Security (4 measures), ISKUR (2 measures) and SGK (2
measures).1

Parliament approved the Ministry of Development’s 10th Development Plan in July 2013. The
plan groups implementation of policies targeting women’s employment and entrepreneurship
under the subheadings of “Family and Women,” “Employment and Working Life” and
“Entrepreneurship and SMEs.” This plan sets the target for women’s labor force participation at
34.9 % by the year 2018. To reach this target, alternative models of work-family reconciliation
policies that will be implemented are listed as the adoption of flexibility together with security,
provision of sufficient and accessible childcare services and parental leave. It is the first time
that a national development plan introduces an item on parental leave, moving beyond the
existing practice of maternity leave. The development plan has also given priority t o women’s
entrepreneurship together with youth entrepreneurship and social entrepreneurship.
Additionally, the plan has envisaged the improvement of follow-up and assessment processes
of the entrepreneurship support schemes to measure their contribution to the economy.
Promoting the formation of cooperatives is also on the list of entrepreneurship policies
covered. Finally, among its 25 priority transformation programs, two are directly related to
women’s labor force participation. The first program, coordinated by the MoLSS, aims to
increase the efficiency of the labor markets. It introduces incentives for employers to hire
women workers, to expand care services for children, sick and elderly and to introduce an
integrated support scheme for women entrepreneurs. The second program, to be coordinated
by MoFSP, is named “Program for the Protection of the Family and the Dynamic Population
Structure.” It identifies reconciliation between work and family life as a goal to be achieved for
purposes of desirable population growth. One of the performance measures of this program
will be the fertility rate among workingwomen.



1 Accordingly MoFSP is going to be responsible for devising measures to alleviate women’s care giving responsibilities, working
to remove bureaucratic barriers to the establishment of childcare facilities, supporting the economic and social inclusion of
various groups of women, deemed more vulnerable, and ensuring gender sensitivity in all policy, legislation and budgeting
processes on employment creation. MoLSS will introduce policies to encourage women’s continu ed labor market participation
after child birth and to prevent harassment at workplaces. The two will collaborate in the revision of the relevant body of
legislation to make it compatible with EU norms and in the preparation of activities to reduce cultura l barriers to women’s
employment. ISKUR will run programs to ease the labor force participation of rural-to-urban migrant women and utilizing local
labor market analyses, it will prioritize the conducting of vocational courses which the local labor market analyses signal as
having potential for increasing women’s employment. SGK will collaborate with MoFSP in devising measures to reduce
women’s care giving responsibilities and will also implement programs to encourage the registration of women who work in t he
largely informal markets of home services and home based work.

These reforms reflect the intensified activity of the government on the issues of women’s
employment and entrepreneurship. Various laws were revised with reference to the general
goal of increasing women’s labor force participation. Also circulars were issued to foster the
implementation of these legal changes by the ministries. Intra-ministry protocols were the
other means used in this process to foster cooperation between institutions. Again, this specific
goal of promoting employment and entrepreneurship among women was emphasized in the
strategy and action documents of relevant ministries and affiliated institutions.

4. Data and Methodology

To inform this report we conducted a desk study and a qualitative fieldwork which included in-
depth elite interviews with key personnel from several ministries, representatives of civil
society organizations and a local representative of an international agency. These major
institutions and the specific departments were chosen as data sources as they are directly
responsible to carry out the public policies on the issue of women’s employment and
entrepreneurship.

4.1 Desk Study

The desk study included the analysis of national and international policy documents, legal texts,
strategic plans, reports and publications related to the subject. Also a statistical analysis is
conducted based on the data taken from 2011 Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) to provide
a snapshot of the profiles of women according to their participation status in the labor market
(see Appendix A). Our analysis covered relevant programs implemented by a range of ministries
including the Ministry of Family and Social Policies, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security,
the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology, the Ministry of Development and the Ministry
of National Education, and affiliated institutions such as the Turkish Employment Agency
(ISKUR), Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB), and Development
Agencies. Since collaboration between public agencies and non-governmental organizations is
important in this field, reports and publications produced by these organizations such as the
Women Entrepreneurs Association of Turkey (KAGIDER) and Foundation for the Support of
Women’s Work (KEDV) were included in the analysis.

Under the light of the materials collected in the desk study, the related institutions and
departments to be included in the field study are selected. The list of institutions, related
departments/positions and relevant programs covered in the field research is provided below
in Table1. On the other hand, it is observed that a significant portion of businesses owned by
women in official records in Turkey are actually controlled by male relatives (i.e. husband,
brother, father, son) of women. Therefore, it should be noted that quality of studies prepared
on the subject can be negatively affected by the problem in properly identifying women
entrepreneurs.

4.2 Fieldwork

Qualitative fieldwork included field visits to the central offices of the ministries, institutions,
and civil society organizations in Ankara and their local branches in Istanbul and interviews with
their representatives. (See Table 1) Preliminary research on these institutions via websites and
program documents revealed that important information is available on the Internet. However,
most of the documents on the Internet are standard policy documents composed of short
memos on the programs. But often, there is no information available on official websites of the
relevant institutions about the process of identifying program priorities, the governance
structure, specific measures taken to address gender-specific barriers to employment and
entrepreneurship, selection criteria used for determining micro-scale grant projects, results of
monitoring, impact evaluations and beneficiary evaluations. Field visits and interviews provided
additional data and details on the available public programs.

In the next section we will provide a summary of the qualitative fieldwork which involved in-
depth elite interviews conducted between May 6-June 15, 2013. Summary below indicates only
the major actors of the public programs relevant to women’s entrepreneurship and access to
labor markets and rationale behind including these actors in our analysis.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


Our research team conducted elite/expert interviews with 28 officials in the related
departments of major public institutions and their beneficiaries directly or indirectly involved in
the implementation of programs on women’s employment and entrepreneurship. By doing so,
we aimed to gain access to private documents and data that were not available in the public
domain online and to acquire the officials’ views which would help us to better “understand the
networks of individuals and agencies involved in policymaking and relative influence exercised
by each” (Jupp, 2006).

Elite/expert interviews are frequently used methods by scholars who study policymaking
processes to comprehend how exactly the debates on the policymaking processes reflect on
the final draft and the practice (Philips, 1998). Elite interviews, though very informative by
nature, hold the risks of being inefficient due to the difficulties rooting from power relations
and confidentiality issues. Yet, overall we believe that we have mostly succeeded to get access
to private documents and it was mostly fruitful in terms of getting an insiders’ view of how the
process works and how much relative influence the actors have on the process (Jupp, 2006).
We will utilize the expert interviews to map the institutions involved in the programs regarding
women’s employment and entrepreneurship and to complement the information we have
gathered from the public domain.

The major institutions and the specific departments that are directly responsible to carry out
the public policies on the issue of women’s employment and entrepreneurship that we have
interviewed are listed below with short descriptions on their mission and vision. In this section,
we will provide the rationale for choosing these institutions in our fieldwork.

4.2.1 The Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS)

In the recent years, MoLSS has primarily taken the issues of the regional minimum wage,
unregistered work, severance pay and flexible work into its agenda. New regulations regarding
these issues have been reflected in the National Employment Strategy, which was completed in
2014.

The responsibilities of the Ministry include problems of disadvantaged populations, namely the
children, disabled and women in the work life under the Disadvantaged Department, which is
represented under General Directorate of Labor. The Disadvantaged Department includes a
Gender Branch that aims to address the gender aspect of employment.

The Ministry operates Human Resources Development Program (HRD), which is a component of
European Union’s Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA). A separate department under the
Ministry, European Union Coordination Department is assigned for this task. The first measure
of the Employment Priority Axes among the other three priority axes of HRD is ‘‘[t]o promote
women’s participation in Labor force and to increase female employment, including those
formerly employed in agriculture.” 2 In this framework, Promoting Women’s Employment

Operation has been implemented between 2010 and 2013 under the coordination and auditing
of European Union Coordination Department.

4.2.2 Turkish Employment Agency (ISKUR)

Within the body of Ministry of Labor and Social Security, Turkish Employment Agency serves
mainly as a portal to intermediate employers and jobseekers. ISKUR also aims to increase labor
market participation and the employability of the active population in Turkey. ISKUR conducts
annual Labor Market Analysis in all cities of Turkey and accordingly organizes routine trainings
programs on employment and entrepreneurship within Active Labor Market Programs. In
addition, ISKUR, having a widespread organizational structure, operates as the beneficiary
organ of Human Resources Development (HRD) Component of Instrument for Pre-Accession
(IPA-IV) in many EU Projects.

4.2.3 The Ministry of Family and Social Policy (MoFSP)

In 2011, with the decree in the provision of law no 633, the General Directorate of Women’s
Status was restructured as a main service general directorate of the Ministry of Family and
Social Policies. Women’s Status Department still functions in the Ministry for the consolidation
of gender equality and the promotion of women’s status in Turkey. The General Directorate is
working and forming policies on prevention of violence against women, increasing women’s
employment, promotion of women entrepreneurship, fighting women poverty and ensuring
that women are included in the social security system, with relevant foundations and
organizations. Another Department of concern is the Department of Social Assistance of
MoFSP, which is responsible for managing the Income Generating Projects of Social Assistance
and Solidarity Foundations all over Turkey.

4.2.4 Small and Middle Enterprises Development Organization (KOSGEB)

KOSGEB is organized under the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology (MoSIT) for the
purpose of increasing the share of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in the national
economy and in the global market. KOSGEB fulfills this mission by promoting entrepreneurship
in mainly in technology, engineering and manufacturing. In 2010, Entrepreneur Support
Program, which applies positive discrimination to women entrepreneurs by giving them %10
more support than men entrepreneurs, has been initiated.

4.2.5 Ministry of Development (MoD)

Still known as the State Planning Organization structured under the Prime Ministry, The
Ministry of Development (MoD) is restructured as an independent ministry in 2011. MoD, quite
differently from other Ministries, is entitled to “advise the government in social, economic and
cultural development policies” and prepare the main policy documents such as the national
strategies and programs in cooperation with Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the
Undersecretariat of Treasury (UofT). The strategies and plans prepared by the other ministries

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


and the programs funded by international organizations are also audited by MoD. Budgeting is
a main priority along with economic, social and cultural development targets. The Employment
and Working Life Department and the Income Distribution and Social Inclusion Department of
MoD are the units of our concern within the scope of this research.

4.2.6 Ministry of National Education (MoNE)

One of the responsibilities of Ministry of National Education (MoNE) is to manage non-formal
education. General Directorate of Lifelong Learning (GDoLLL) was established as a new unit in
the Ministry due to the necessity emerging from the need to increase the chances of those who
dropped out of the formal education system and lacking occupational skills to have a better
quality of life and work. Moreover, the vocational training courses applied by ISKUR are either
outsourced to institutions related to the MoNE, universities or other private providers. For
every other institutional provider, MoNE has to approve the content of the courses.

4.2.7 International Labor Organization (ILO)

The International Labor Organization (ILO) sets international labor standards regarding the
issues in labor life such as the basic rights at work life, the right to organize, collective
bargaining, prevention of forced labor, equality of opportunity and treatment through
Conventions and Recommendations. Main principle lying under ILO’s work is tripartism that is
bringing together the employers, workers and governments together to develop policies and
social dialogue in action. Within this framework, the primary goals of ILO Turkey Office are to
fight with child labor, to increase women’s and youngster’s employment and to prevent
informal labor. ILO Turkey Office embraces a gender mainstreaming perspective on the issue of
women’s employment. The office very actively follows the recent trends and shortcomings in
the social policy field regarding women’s employment through its ties with Women’s Studies
Departments at Middle East Technical University and Ankara University carrying out research
on women in and out of the labor market. Thus, the works of ILO Turkey Office is covered by
this research.

The following sections include the compilation of the information gathered in the desk study
and through in-depth interviews with the representatives of institutions and programs which
are directly responsible to carry out the public policies on the issue of women’s employment
and entrepreneurship, and provide a review of available public programs. The review includes
and analyzes available and relevant data about the public programs, particularly on coverage,
budget, targeting, year the program started and who manages the program. Finally the last
chapter presents an assessment of the programs based on their targeting procedures, activities,
and governance processes. The assessment also point at potential gaps in the available set of
programs, in terms of initiatives to tackle key gender issues in entrepreneurship and
employment.

5. Programs on Women’s Employment and Entrepreneurship

The initial objective of this report was to lay out an inventory of the activities of various public
institutions which cater to women’s employment and entrepreneurship separ ately. However,
upon analyzing firstly the standard policy documents, information available on official websites,
and very limited statistical information as part of the desk study, and secondly deciphering the
in-depth expert interviews with the officials we came to realize that employment and
entrepreneurship programs are in no way clearly delineated from each other in terms of their
aims, targets, selection criteria, managing official bodies, outcomes and monitoring activities.
Processes of identifying program priorities, the governance structure, specific measures taken
to address gender-specific barriers to employment and entrepreneurship, selection criteria
used for determining micro-scale grant projects, results of monitoring, impact evaluations and
beneficiary evaluations are not designed separately for specific requirements of employment
schemes and entrepreneurship activities. In most programs labor market participation and
entrepreneurship are used interchangeably utilizing the same resources and governance
structures. Most employment programs (operations) inherently encompass variations of
entrepreneurship goals deriving from a pool of similar budgets. Moreover, there is a significant
overlap between institutions in terms of their coverage of participants, and program priorities,
which lead to a confusion in separately analyzing their funding structures and outcomes.
Therefore, the inventory of programs, which will be presented, in this section will not be strictly
categorized as employment and entrepreneurship projects. It should be read with caution that
some of these programs are heavily intersected which has inevitably led to some repetitions.

In this section, we describe the public activities conducted by various ministries and institutions
of the state, which are designed to catalyze women’s access to labor market and
entrepreneurship. There are three criteria that guided the decision to include or exclude the
programs. First, all of the programs below are run, in majority, by public institutions. In some,
private institutions appear at the leading positions but in these programs public institutions
either act as beneficiaries or have a primary role in the implementation of the program.
Secondly, we included the programs, which target women who are either left out of the labor
market or unemployed, while we excluded the ones targeting already workingwomen. Hence,
we mainly concentrate on the programs that have the potential to create new employment and
new entrepreneurship opportunities. Lastly, we only included the programs that have widest
sphere of influence and impact in the last four years. That is chosen to exclude the programs,
whose scopes and targets were solely local. An inventory listing the details about the leading
institution, duration, source of funding, budget, geographical coverage, and availability of
impact evaluation of the programs included in this report are also provided in the Appendix B.

5.1 Active Labor Force Programs (ALFP) - Aktif İşgücü Programları

ISKUR is responsible for organizing various kinds of activities, all of which primarily aim to retain
and improve employment percentages in Turkey. Among these vocational trainings, on-the-job
trainings and entrepreneurship trainings make up the bulk of their Active Labor Force
Programs. Approximately 30% of the unemployment insurance fund is earmarked for active
                                                33

Labor force programs run by the state. The funding of these programs comes from this 30%. 3

The amendments in the Labor Law in 2008 enabled all unemployed to participate in the ALFP
regardless of their eligibility to unemployment insurance.4 In the same year, ISKUR increased its
vocational training capacity by including all ISKUR registered unemployed to its target recipients
with the initiation of ISKUR Labor Force Conformance Services Regulation. In 2009 on-the-job
trainings and in 2010 entrepreneurship trainings were included to the ALFP, which reflected as
an excessive increase in the budget allocated to ISKUR for these programs. (See Table 7 for
distribution of the budget in detail) Recently, ISKUR replaced the former regulation with Active
Labor Force Services Regulation, which brings some measures to strengthen the ties between
the trainings and employment. These details will be mentioned below under the related
headings.

5.1.1 Structure of Vocational Trainings

Vocational trainings constitute the largest component of the ISKUR activities. The primary
objective of the trainings is to upgrade jobseekers’ skills in order to improve their employment
chances. Courses offered and numbers targeted are designated with respect to ISKUR’s annual
labor market analysis. In the selection of courses, the primary determinants are available jobs
in local contexts and employer demands. The officers emphasized that they saw the utility of
their work in producing workers compatible with existing employer demands. Officially, the
Training Boards have the right to decide upon and specify the sectors or target groups in ways
that prioritize disadvantaged groups. However in practice this sort of filtering is not regularly
used.

Once the courses are announced, unemployed individuals apply through local ISKUR offices.
People who are unemployed, not retired, at least 15 years old and registered with ISKUR can
apply. For course applicants to be accepted into the course they are also evaluated with respect

to the skills required of the specific courses. Those who receive unemployment benefits are
required to attend when courses, which fit with their last jobs, career paths and occupation,
education and health status, open up.5 According to the regulation of ALFP, the local offices
have the right to apply positive discrimination when choosing participants. However, in practice
the eligibility criteria do not usually specify gender-based targets because the numbers of men
and women have historically been roughly equal to one another in the courses.

The training courses are either outsourced to institutions related to the Ministry of National
Education (MoNE), universities or other private providers. Nearly 50% of the trainings are
contracted out to MoNE.6 For every other institutional provider, MoNE has to approve the
content of the courses. The institutional provider authorizes a body for the exam, assessment
and evaluation. Those who are found successful are given a vocational qualification certificate.

The Table 3 below shows the numbers of men and women who received ISKUR vocational
training services throughout the years. These figures are not specific to trainings organized
directly by ISKUR. They reflect the total of courses and beneficiaries in all projects that utilized
ISKUR’s services. These include projects such as the aforementioned EU supported Promoting
Women’s Employment Grant Scheme and ILO’s Pilot Project for Decent Employment for
Women in Turkey. As indicated previously, the numbers have been equally distributed
throughout the years between men and women. In fact there is even a slight increase in
women’s share from 2012 onwards.

Vocational trainings last around three months and attendance is mandatory. Throughout the
duration of the courses, ISKUR pays for each trainee’s insurance premium and distributes a
daily stipend of 20TL (for the year 2013). According to a recently conducted World Bank survey,
the trainees anticipate that the courses will increase their employment chances. However, one-
third of the respondents indicated that the stipend distributed is an important incentive and
two-thirds revealed that if they had to pay for the course themselves, they would not have
taken it.7 Our interviews also suggest that this stipend may have performed as social aid,
especially during economic crises, such as in 2008. This practical function may be in

contradiction with the primary goal of training employable individuals and placing them in jobs.
Due to the recognition of this problem at ISKUR, some amendments were made in the Active
Labor Force Services Regulation in March 2013. While prior to this change, there were
employment guarantees only for the 20% of the trainees, after March 2013 the new rule
requires that upon the completion of the courses, at least 50% of the trainees have at least 120
days of relevant employment, starting within the thirty days following the last day of the
courses. The new regulation also states that if an individual arbitrarily quits the jobs where they
are placed or rejects three job offers in a row, they will not be able participate in a new ISKUR
training for the next 24 months. If an individual cannot be placed in a job, they will need to wait
at least 6 months between the trainings.8

In 2013, the World Bank conducted an impact analysis of ISKUR programs, at the request of
ISKUR. This is one of the rare impact analysis studies done of all relevant programs. The study
has found that the trainings make a small but significant impact on the quality of employment.
However, there appears to be no significant impact on the likelihood of working, number of
hours worked, and monthly income of the beneficiaries. Finally, the study has found little
variation of impact in groups in different age groups, genders and levels of education.9 It is
important to note that, there is an increasing participation of women to these trainings, even in
the absence of women’s prioritization. It is mentioned above that the stipend may have
performed as social aid, which in practice holds the risk that vocational trainings to serve the
functions of social inclusion rather than access to employment. The measures in the new
regulation aims at avoiding such possibilities and their practical implications will be clearer in
the future.

5.1.2 Structure of On-the-job Trainings

On-the-job trainings aim to enable the jobseekers to gain vocational experience in a profession
in which they have theoretical training but lack practical experiences. The ISKUR registered
employers apply to the ISKUR provincial offices with the demand for starting an on-the-job-
training. ISKUR matches these employers with IŞKUR registered jobseekers that have the
technical knowledge in the specific professions demanded by the employers. The only
additional criteria for being a candidate in these trainings is that the participants should not be
already working in the enterprises of the employers, who approach ISKUR with this demand.
Those candidates who have received their vocational training in these particular fields can
begin on-the-job training within a month of the completion of the former.

These trainings take place for up to 45 hours distributed between 6 days of the work week and
last at the most for 160 days. The trainees do not receive regular wages for their work during
this time. Instead ISKUR supplies a daily stipend of 25 TL (for 2013) and pays also the insurance
premiums of the trainees. In the first on-the-job trainings organized for a single employer, the

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


trainees are guaranteed to finish the training in these work places, but the employers are not
required to provide any additional employment guarantees.

If an employer applies for more than one on-the-job training, they have to document that they
or other enterprises have employed at least 20% of the participants of the former on-the-job
trainings organized, for at least 60 days of the previous year. The employer is also obliged to
document also the Social Security Institution records for these employees. This requirement
aims to boost employment guarantees and formal employment. On the other hand, if there is a
drop in the number of regular employees with social security and the number does not reach
its original level within a month, ISKUR withdraws the trainees in the facility. There are also
measures taken to penalize the enterprises if they neglect to inform ISKUR in a timely fashion of
such developments.

                            Women             5.919 (36%)     13.762 (43%) 307 (49.5%)

As can be seen in Table 4, the number of women who attend on-the-job trainings is much lower
than men whereas the numbers in vocational courses are more comparable. These trainings
have the additional advantage of providing participants with actual workplace experience. The
fact that women are less represented in these particular trainings is likely to impact the results
of their job searches. However, by 2013 the proportions of men and women trainees become
nearly equal.

In general, one of the successes of IŞKUR programs is the roughly equal access of women and
men to its training opportunities. This equality, however, does not translate directly to job
placement statistics. (See Table 5) First of all, as reflected by the concerns voiced in the
interviews with officers, women are less likely to apply for jobs after the courses. This could
also partly been observed in the fact that only 58 women per 100 men (new applicants
combined with the unemployed by the end of 2011) were looking for job through ISKUR in
2012. One should however note that the ratio was 51 women per 100 men in the earlier year,
implying a sizeable increase. Secondly, ISKUR makes offers to the firms in need of employees on
behalf of applicants and the average number of offers per employee increased from 0.82 to
0.88 for men and from 0.54 to 0.63 for women, which indicates the intensified mediating
activity of ISKUR.

Thirdly, the proportion of women and men, who are placed in a job, were roughly the same in
2012, 11% and 15% for women and men, respectively. So, once they apply for a job, the
probability of placement for men is slightly more than women. Lastly, it is true that the number
                                                     37
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


of women who found a job increased more than that of men between 2011-12 (from 39 to 42
percent), but this was due to relatively more women making applications rather than any
improvement in the differential placement rates of women and men.

5.1.3 Structure of Entrepreneurial Trainings

The final component of the ALFP is entrepreneurial trainings, which is included in this program
in 2010 after KOSGEB and ISKUR signed a protocol. 10 This protocol requires KOSGEB to endorse
the certificates received by the trainees and to evaluate the business proposals if they submit it
to the New Entrepreneur Support Program. After this protocol, ISKUR’s responsibility as the
only agent in the field of public employment services was expanded in order to include
provision of training support for the potential entrepreneurs.

The trainings serve as preliminary for those who want to become entrepreneurs but lack the
technical skills to realize the entrepreneurial idea. The content of the trainings include creativity
exercises for developing a business idea, market research, marketing plan, management plan,
financial plan and finally the preparation of the business plan.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


As displayed in Table 6, the proportions of women and men participated in entrepreneurial
trainings have balanced since 2011, with a slightly higher men participation in the trainings. As
of July 2013, there is no available information on the business activities initiated by the
participants of the trainings. However, in the same month, ISKUR and KOSGEB revised their
protocol and KOSGEB agreed to share information on the ISKUR trainees who were successful
in their grant applications to KOSGEB. The data is not yet public.

5.2 Entrepreneurship Support Program – Girişimcilik Destek Programı

KOSGEB initiated the Entrepreneurship Support Program in 2010, following the 2009
enlargement of the institution’s scope of activities. The primary goal of the program is to
promote entrepreneurial activities, disseminate the culture of entrepreneurship and improve
the chances of success in new enterprises, through training and finance. The program’s plan
includes training for potential entrepreneurs, delivery of financial support for new businesses,
funding of the establishment of local incubation centers for those who need office space in the

constitute a small portion of the category.

initial phases of their enterprises. There are three components of this program: Applied
Entrepreneurship Training, New Entrepreneur Support and Business Improvement Centre (BIM)
Support. An additional activity targets university students, who have taken entrepreneurship
classes. This is a competition that awards the best business plans with the goals of incentivizing
the young population. This program does not specifically target women. However, there are
some indicators to encourage women’s participation more, such as increased financial support
(by 10%) for women and the organization of additional training sessions targeting only women.
Data on the budget of this program and its components is impossible to disaggregate since the
funding comes from KOSGEB’s lump-sum budget allocated for all kind of supports provided for
small and medium size enterprises.

5.2.1 Applied Entrepreneurship Training

This program primarily aims at training potential entrepreneurs in the steps of designing a
successful work plan. Other institutions such as ISKUR, development agencies, TESK
(Confederation of Turkish Tradesmen and Craftsmen), TOSYÖV (Türkiye Küçük ve Orta Ölçekli
İşletmeler Serbest Meslek Mensupları ve Yöneticiler Vakfı-The Foundation for Small and
Medium Enterprise Owners and Managers), universities and non-governmental organizations
also utilize the same trainings curriculum by signing protocols with KOSGEB. These protocols
ensure that KOSGEB confirms the quality of the training and certificates received by the
trainees. Training sessions arranged and financed directly by KOSGEB is limited in comparison
to the overall number of sessions. In 2012, KOSGEB directly organized 146 sessions, while the
total number of sessions organized in corporation with other institutions is 1822. For the
women only training sessions, these numbers are equal to 9 and 57.12

The only condition of application for trainees is to have a business idea while the specific
institutions organizing the training can set further requirements. KOSGEB has to select and
accredit the trainers, either individual instructors or institutional service providers, based on
level of education, previous relevant trainings attended and their references of prior experience
in instructing the related subjects. The content of trainings is determined with reference to
KOSGEB’s specific regulation.13 The main content remains the same across the board and these
common modules give a technical business education and focus on the development of a
business plan. There can be additional modules on specific sectoral or local issues, depending
on the organizer’s choice. When the sessions target only women, there usually are modules on
women’s rights and gender equality. While the goal of the entire program is to provide
incentives for potential entrepreneurs, the officers also emphasize that the trainings are meant
to also encourage participants, whose skills and plans do not appear to have enough
entrepreneurial potential, to make realistic self-assessments.

Table 8 shows the numbers of women and men trainees who received certificates in applied
entrepreneurship training programs organized or coordinated by KOSGEB. Since 2010, 61,264
women have received certificates. For both women and men there is a sizeable increase in the
numbers, while women-men ratio remained stable nearly 44% over this time.

                     Source: Statistical information provided by KOSGEB on 22 July 2013.

KOSGEB data also provides breakdown of trainees based on the education level. Around one
fourth of the women participants are primary school graduates, while another one quarter are
college graduates and around one third of them are high school graduates.

There is no follow up activity to find out how many of the graduates establish enterprises. The
only available information can be extrapolated from the beneficiaries of the New Entrepreneur
Support. However it has to be kept in mind that the applicants to this support can be
participants in other relevant public programs as well, in addition to the graduates of the
Applied Entrepreneurship Training Program. Disaggregated data for this is not available.

5.2.2 New Entrepreneur Support

Entrepreneurship Support Program of KOSGEB enhances access to entrepreneurial training and,
to a lesser extent, provides financial support for the new entrepreneurs in the form of grants
and loans named as New Entrepreneur Support. The main goal of this support, the only one of
its kind and volume, is to financially aid potential entrepreneurs with viable ideas, but with
limited access to capital. Eligible applicants are graduates of the Applied Entrepreneurship
Training Program, individuals holding certificates from other entrepreneurial training programs
organized under or approved by KOSGEB and owners of new enterprises run in Business
Improvement Centres, again accredited by KOSGEB.

The enterprises that can apply must have been established in the two years preceding the
application. The application process starts when the applicants register their legally existing
enterprise in the KOSGEB database and submit a business plan. A specialized KOSGEB
committee evaluates the application documents based on criteria such as the qualifications of
the applicant, appropriateness of the marketing and financial plans, overall credibility and
consistency. The bylaw specifies that applications in innovative and export oriented sectors,
producing high value-added goods and services and those founded by individuals with
vocational education certificates in specialized sectors are to be prioritized.

                                                     41
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


For 2012, KOSGEB set the upper limit for grants and loans at 30,000 TL and 70,000 TL
respectively. According to the bylaw, business plans coming from 1 st and 2nd investment
incentive regions receive 60% of their proposed budget, the rest receive 70%. 14 When the
applicant is a woman or a disabled person, these percentages increase by 10%. For an
enterprise to receive these more advantageous rates, a woman has to hold at least 30% equity
stake in an enterprise. The grants are given to entrepreneurs on an ex post basis: the
entrepreneurs are required to demonstrate their expenses with official documents in order for
the funds to be released. For the loan scheme, KOSGEB requires letter of guarantee from a
bank. The enterprises start paying the loan back without interest, two years after they receive
it, and complete the payment in eight installments, every three months. If a woman
entrepreneur does not have enough capital or cannot provide collateral in the start-up, she
cannot benefit from the grants and loans provided under this program. These two procedural
requirements significantly limit women’s access to the grants and loans because the estimates
reveal women in Turkey hold ownership of only 9% of the assets in Turkey (Özar 2007).

The dataset provided by KOSGEB shows high fluctuations in the number of women’s
enterprises which benefited from the program: 342, 1435 and 168 over 2010-2012. Since 2010,
around one half of the support-holders are women and majority (63%) of those women is quite
well-educated, having high school or higher degrees, just as is in the case of men (68%). Yet,
these numbers are very low in comparison to the numbers of women who received
entrepreneurship certificates in the same years. This can be a result of the fact that the
documentation necessary to apply for support is not simple and operates as one of the
screening mechanism. Moreover, in the fieldwork it is revealed that this program has a strong
emphasis on competitiveness of the newly established enterprises. Officers emphasize that the
aim of this program must not be confused with other programs aiming at social inclusion and
providing access to credit for the poor.

This support largely goes to the projects in manufacturing and the wholesale and retail trade
(around two thirds). As for the geographical distribution of the new entrepreneurs, when the
combined data for 2010-2012 is classified at NUTS2 level, it turns out that the leading regions
are the two Black Sea regions, Samsun and Trabzon, which were followed by Kocaeli and
Manisa. All in all, these four regions host one third of the total support-holders. When looking
at the gender distribution in each region, an interesting fact appears: in all the eastern regions
and some central Anatolian and southern regions, women’s share in the total beneficiaries is
more than the national average.15 Among the latter group, the share of women is even bigger
than the national average plus one standard deviation in Mardin, Van and Kayseri.



14The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th regions are determined by “Cabinet Decree on State Aid to Investments” published in Resmi
Gazete no. 28328 dated 19 June, 2012. 1st region: İstanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Bursa Eskişehir, Bilecik, Kocaeli, Sakarya, Düz ce, Bolu,
Yalova, Tekirdağ, Edirne, Kırklareli. 2nd region: Adana, Mersin, Aydın, Denizli, Muğla, Antalya, Isparta, Burdur, Balıkesir,
Çanakkale (except Bozcaada and Gökçeada)
15Other regions are Kastamonu, Kayseri, Kırıkkale, Hatay, Konya, Ankara and Manisa, which is the only western city in this
group.

                                                                42
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


Discrepancies in the budget figures obtained from KOSGEB’s annual action reports severely
prevent us from suggesting further evaluation on the financial scope of the program. There is
no consistent information about the total amount of support women’s enterprises have
received. Also it does not provide a breakdown of support, i.e. the share of grants and loans.

The program does not have mentorship for the grant and credit recipients. In general, there is
no follow up activity, seeking to document how many of these newly established enterprises
remain above water. The bylaw plan for visits to credit recipients at the end of the first two
years and write a New Enterprises Follow Up report. However there is no aggregate
information about the success of these enterprises and our interviews revealed the severe
limitations the officers have in following up the outcomes of these grants and loans.

5.2.3 Business Improvement Centre (BIM) Support

The third component of the KOSGEB program is Business Improvement Centre Support. Its goal
is to provide grants to local public institutions and NGOs for them to start and manage business
incubators. Business incubators are spaces organized for the purpose of servicing new
entrepreneurs for the first five years of their establishment, by giving them training, providing
opportunities for networking and delivering affordable workshops, collective office equipment
and office services. Prior to this funding, business incubators in Turkey were established with
EU and World Bank funds, with minor contribution by KOSGEB. This particular program was
designed with the purpose of diminishing reliance on EU and World Bank funding. Currently,
KOSGEB continues to have control over 13 business incubators in Turkey.

In 2012, the maximum amounts of establishment support and management support were set at
750,000 TL and 100,000 TL, respectively. The rates of support are parallel to those in the New
Entrepreneur Support, standing at 60 percent of the proposed budget, for applications coming
from the 1st and 2nd regions and 70 percent for the rest.

2010 and 2011 KOSGEB action reports foresaw the establishment of three incubators (in Tokat,
Kastamonu, and Malatya) with the additional support of EU Instrument for Pre-Accession
Assistance (IPA) funds. In 2012 the incubator in Malatya was set up. According to the 2012
Action Report, 472,458 TL is provided as establishment support for business incubators from
the KOSGEB budget, while a total of 63,818 TL is given to already established incubators as
management support.

KOSGEB data on business incubators provides only the ratio of women’s enterprises benefiting
from the incubators. These figures stand at 32% in 2011 and 27% in 2012. 16 Within the
framework of Entrepreneur Support Program, there is no specific regulation that promotes the
establishment of business incubators for women entrepreneurs. However in a previous EU
project, called Women’s Entrepreneurship Support Project, KOSGEB built four business

incubators, to service only women entrepreneurs in the districts of Pendik, Hacıbektaş,
Kütahya, Çorum during the years 2007 and 2008. Although the incubator in Çorum was closed
in 2010, the others have serviced 42 women in 2011 and 2012.

As in the case of the previous two legs of the program, there is little information available on
what happens to businesses during and after their use of the incubators. As part of this
unavailability, even though we know how many of the beneficiaries were women, it is hard to
assess the impact of this support for women and the general objective of increasing women’s
entrepreneurial activities.

5.2.4 Business Plan Award

The last component of Entrepreneurship Support Program is Business Plan Award. It is planned
to be a competition, organized among university students, who have taken entrepreneurship
classes at their universities and have developed business plans as a result. The applicants are
required to have taken classes on entrepreneurship and they should have already officially
established their businesses with respect to their proposals. According to the procedures and
rules, top three business plans is awarded, 15,000, 10,000, and 5000 TL respectively. Even
though this award is included in the Entrepreneurship Support Program by design, it is not
implemented in the years 2011 and 2012.

5.3 Non-Formal Education Programs of MoNE - Yaygın Eğitim Programları

Non-formal education is in the responsibility of The General Directorate of Life Long Learning
(GDoLLL) of MoNE. The organizational structure of the Ministry was modernized by the decree
law on the Organization and Duties of MoNE issued on 14 September 2011. As a result, the
former General Directorates responsible for distance education, apprenticeship and vocational
trainings (for drop-outs and graduates) were merged. GDoLLL was established as a new unit in
the Ministry due to the necessity emerging from the need to increase the chances of those who
dropped out of the formal education system and lacking occupational skills to have a better
quality of life and work.

GDoLLL aims to contribute to individuals’ development of personal knowledge and occupational
skills. For these purposes, GDoLL provides distance education, vocational and technical
trainings alongside with literacy courses and other training courses; develops the curriculums,
contents and the equipment to be used in the trainings; and offers certified apprenticeship
trainings. The budget that MoNE allocated for GDoLLL is 572.664.555,97 TL and 889.375.546,00
TL for 2010 and 2011, respectively.17 The increase in the budget in 2011 may partly be due to
the merger of the directorates, but it can also be interpreted as the increasing significance
attached to lifelong learning activities. This program does not specifically target women, but as
can be seen in Table 9, majority of the participants of vocational trainings are women.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


The organization and the content of vocational and apprenticeship trainings are based on two
main principles; compatibility with the labor market demands and standardized curriculum and
content in the trainings. In order to satisfy these principles, the curriculums have been
standardized and transferred to a modular system in line with International Education
Standards Classification (ISCED 97)18 and with the national qualification principles determined
by MoNE . The certificates given to the trainees in apprenticeship trainings were accredited by
EU countries. By doing so, the access to labor market chances of those who benefit from these
modules either in formal or in non-formal education have been increased and balanced.

As for the capacity improvement and developing the perspective of lifelong learning, the most
recent efforts were manifested in Promoting Lifelong Learning Operation between 2009-2010.
The Operation is implemented within the framework of Human Resources Development
component of IPA, in order to establish an institutional framework and capacity compatible
with EU to support individuals’ access to education for increasing employment in the NUTSII
regions, plus Ankara with a budget of 12.7 million Euros.

The modular trainings are provided to those who are out of the formal education system and
with at least primary school diploma19 in the Central Training Centers or Public Training Centers
in 61 different fields of occupation.20 The trainings offered include general self-improvement
courses, and other vocational and technical trainings. However, different from ISKUR trainings,
the vocational and technical trainings provided in non-formal education neither offers
employment guarantee at the end and or pays daily stipend or social insurance.

The numbers of men and women who attended these trainings in 2010-2011 education year
are displayed in the Table 9. As the data reveals, participation rates of women to general
trainings (63.30%), literacy courses (76.51%) and other training activities (61.58%) are a lot
higher than men’s participation rates in these trainings. Data indicate that me n tend to utilize
trainings on self-improvement and recreation less than women. Data once again point at the
low literacy rates of women compared to men. But at the same time, participation rates of men
and women to vocational and technical trainings are relatively equal with a slightly higher
participation rates by women (53.68%). This demonstrates that both women and men are
equally interested in access to labor market, as it was in the case of ISKUR’s vocational
trainings.

The apprenticeship trainings offered in Central Training Centers are required in order to be fully
authorized to open a workplace. The trainees are required to have completed all the stages
starting with the acquisition of a basic certificate in apprenticeship. Women’s participation in
apprenticeship trainings (Table 10) is significantly lower than men. Women are represented
with approximately 19% in all stages from apprenticeship to starting a business as displayed in
Table 11. Since getting authorized for starting a business opens a door to entrepreneurial
activity, women’s rate of 18% at that stage shows their unwillingness for entrepreneurshi p or to
put it in another way, their problems in access to finance compared to men.

5.4 Support for Income Generating Projects – Gelir Getirici Proje Destekleri

The program for Support for Income Generating Projects is currently managed by MoFSP’s
General Directorate of Social Assistance. The program was initiated in 1986 as part of the
foundation of Social Assistance and Solidarity Promotion Fund (Sosyal Yardımlaşma ve
Dayanışmayı Teşfik Fonu-SASF) and its capacity was expanded during the implementation Social
Risk Mitigation Project funded by the World Bank between 2001 and 2007. From 2007
onwards, the program became a permanent part of activities funded by SASF, with the goal of
poverty alleviation. The program defines its mission of poverty alleviation in terms of social
inclusion of the poor, turning them into productive individuals capable of earning their
livelihood in the market, thereby eliminating their dependency on social aid. It has been
historically run as a social assistance program although the money disbursed is officially credit.
Since the establishment of MoFSP in 2011, the program has been run under the ministry’s
auspices.

The program targets the poorest 36 % of the population, who fits the criteria specified under
the Law on Social Assistance and Solidarity Fund (Law 3294), Additionally, they should be able
to work and prove they have the necessary skills for the businesses proposed. This program has
not historically targeted women’s entrepreneurship specifically. However, in 2012 after a
Funding Council decision, the rules of implementation were amended to apply positive
discrimination toward women. Furthermore, currently MoFSP has begun airing public spots
encouraging women to apply to the fund and disseminating information about the program in
various meetings with local stakeholders.

The partners of this project are Social Aid and Solidarity Promotion Fund Board (Sosyal Yardım
ve Dayanışmayı Teşvik Fon Kurulu), General Directorate of Social Assistance (GDoSA) and the
local foundations for social assistance and solidarity, all of which operate under MoFSP. GDoSA

is responsible for issuing the general rules of implementation and determining the budget to be
allocated to the local funds. Currently there are 973 foundations, all of which are affiliated with
the GDSA.

Local foundations are responsible for helping poor with the preparation of, collecting, and
selecting projects with respect to the budget allocated to them. These selected projects are
then sent to the GDoSA. GDoSA finalizes the decision. Because of recent emphasis on increasing
women’s participation in this project, when foundations present projects by women, they can
exceed their budget quotas by up to 30%.

The local foundation undertakes the purchasing of supplies and delivers them to the project
owner. Thus the program requires the project owner to establish their businesses. The criteria
for project selection are closely tied with the conditions in the local setting. This means the
projects should embark upon activities requiring a degree of specialized skills, fitting with local
market conditions, have potential for marketing and sales. For instance, various agricultural and
husbandry activities, hair salons, tailoring, turnery, plumbering, etc. figure predominantly in the
list of projects approved (GDoSA, 2009: 27; Odabaşı, 2009: 72; Güneş, 2008:7).The interviews
showed that one of the aims in project selection is to encourage activities that display
artisanship rather than mere service provisioning such as in the case of running small stores,
cafes, etc. however, they do not necessarily target employment creation and, instead,
emphasize that the goal of the program is social inclusion.

The project budgets range from 15,000 TL to 150,000 TL, with the larger budgets usually
allocated projects in agricultural production and husbandry. Officially, the project applicants are
not required to show either a co-signer or collateral in order to have the projects approved.
However in practice local foundations have been found to ask for such warranties from the
applicants.

Once the beneficiaries receive their supplies and initiate their businesses, they are not required
to make payments back to the local foundations for the cost of the supplies for two to five
years, depending on the project size and characteristics. After this grace period, officially they
are expected make interest-free payments in 6 annual installments. However for the first 14
years of the implementation of this program, there has not been an effective mechanism for
the collecting of these payments. In response to this problem, a new regulation passed in 2010
prevents local foundations, whose credit payment statistics are below national averages, from
issuing new applications. Again in order to implement positive discrimination for women, when
women pay back the first five of the installments in a timely manner, the GDSA foregoes the
last payment as a reward.

The Table 12 shows the number of projects, beneficiaries and the total allocated budget from
2007 onwards. It reveals a significant result of the 2010 decision to increase the efficiency of
collecting the debt payments. After this rule was passed, there is a significant decline in the
number of projects and beneficiaries.

Officers recognize that debt payment is a thorny issue, especially when it comes to the group
this program is targeting. There are follow up and legal enforcement mechanisms implemented
in the protocol. However it is not likely to result in the payment of debt given the economic
conditions of the group. The dilemma posed by this situation is that on the one hand, a project
of social inclusion can result in further precarization of the poor. On the other hand, the
program cannot be sustainable without repayment.

The most recent data available on women’s participation in the program indicates that the
participation of women in the projects have not exceeded 20% of the total participants due to
the fact that there is no specialized incentive. The same data reveals that on average 600-650
women have projects in the urban areas whereas this number declines to 250-300 in the rural
areas (Güneş, 2009). Considering women’s low participation, the effect of this support program
on women’s employment and entrepreneurship could be limited to social inclusion. There is a
plan to conduct impact analysis of this program to be completed in 2014 and the budget has
already been allocated for it. Then, we would have further information on the program’s
impacts.

5.5 Turkish Grameen Microcredit Program - Türkiye Grameen Mikrokredi Programı

This microcredit program was initiated by the partnership of the Grameen Bank and Turkish
Foundation for Waste Reduction (Türkiye İsrafı Önleme Vakfı- TISVA) in 2003 in Diyarbakır.
Similar to its counterparts elsewhere, the program continues to aim providing credit to the
poor without access to collateral with the purpose supporting them to start income generating
activities and get themselves out of poverty. By the end of 2012, there were 89 branches
located in 65 cities across Turkey.21 The legal framework of the program is defined by the
amendment in the Special Provincial Administration Law in 2005, which added ‘giving micro

                                                         49

credit’ to the responsibilities of the Provincial Administrations. This law was backed up with the
circulars issued by local administrations affiliated with the Ministry of Interior Affairs by the
initiative of General Directorate of Women’s Status,; and protocols with the governorates.
Regulation on Associations is also restructured accordingly.

The seed funding for the program originally came from the international Grameen Bank, but in
the current situation, a number of banks and businessmen as well as foundations and
associations fund the Türkiye Grameen Mikrofinans Programı (TGMP). Governorates also
contribute to funding in minimal amounts.22 These funds accrue to Entrepreneur pool-of-fund
and the local branches of TISVA Credit Center are given the authority to distribute the
microcredit and to collect the repayments. The legal framework under which TGMP operates
requires local branches to be inspected weekly and monthly by independent inspectors. These
independent inspectors write monthly reports to the city’s office of the governor.

The target group of the program is mainly poor women. The reason for prioritizing women
roots from the belief that women are caregiving and act more in the benefit of the family
compared to men. By ensuring their access, the aim is to strengthen the family. Second priority
is the disabled people, unemployed youth and peasants with no ownership of land. Each
woman receives the credits in solidarity groups of five. In principle, women are expected to
seek out the local branches themselves. However, in practice usually it is the local TISVA
Microcredit Center officers who find and encourage women to take on microcredit. Each
woman receives 100-1000 TL microcredit for the first time and each microcredit recipient is
obliged to attend weekly meetings in the local branches and make small payments on their
loan, again on a weekly basis starting from the first week. The payment plans extend to 46
weeks. If the recipient women can complete the repayment within the schedule, then micro
credit amounts are increased by 1000TL every year.

The program’s promotional materials emphasize the absence of interest rates as one of the
attractive features of the micro credit for the poor women, but all recipients are obliged to pay
20% annual service charges, which effectively work as interest rates. In fact, the service charges
exceed the interest rates pursued by the banking system (Güneş, 2009). In addition, in 2011 the
Ministry of Finance regulations have stipulated 5% surcharge payment for every banking
activity.23 This means when women make their payments, they pay an additional 5% on the
total as banking and insurance transaction tax.

The foundation reports indicate that microcredit repayment rate is 100%. All repayments turn
back to the pool-of- fund to be given out as microcredit unless the donor withdraws the
donation. Hence, the loan repayments constitute a large part of the source of funding for the
credits. The Table 13 displays the number of TGMP members, recipients and the amount of

The income generation activities started with microcredit by sector are illustrated both in the
webpages of TGMF and TISVA without any reference to time or geographical distribution.
According to the data given, the distribution of sectors are as follows: manufacture and
production 35%, shops 29%, business and trade 20%, animal husbandry 7%, services 4%,
hawking 3% and agriculture 2%.24

The obligation to start repayments in the first week is evaluated by scholars as a factor that
channel recipients toward unregistered short-term activities (Güneş, 2009; Al, 2011). Moreover,
it is also pointed out that the poor women do not always apply to microcredit for starting an
income generating activity but they see the micro credit more like an income that can cover the
previous debts or manage the household expenses, while they continue what they have always
been doing such as selling home-based hand work and pay the microcredit installments with
the income from handwork (Al, 2011). Furthermore, it is frequently the case that the micro
credit received by women is in many cases used by men for income generating activities
(Adaman and Bulut, 2007; Karim, 2011) Hence, the percentages given above may hold the risks
of concealing how and who actually utilize the microcredit.

The program officers evaluate TGMP as successful in reducing poverty with regard to regular
repayment rates. The assumption is that if women are able to make regular payments on their
loans, they must have had success in their income generating activities. However, scholars who
have researched this particular program have claimed that this repayment success is the result
of irrational market relations (Güneş, 2009) formed in the solidarity groups since each member
act as the guarantors of each other’s debt (Al, 2011). Based on her research on micro credit
practice in Bangladesh, Karim (2011) also found out that the community labels the indebted
women as bringing shame to their husband’s honor and due to this social pressure the
repayment success is high. Moreover, the high amounts of service charges and taxes extracted
from the recipients work as interest rate causing a burden for the poor.

5.6 Social Support Program - Sosyal Destek Programı

Social Support Program (SODES) is a social development program, which aims to respond to the
needs that emerged due to problems like migration, poverty and unemployment and changing
social structures in the disadvantaged regions of Turkey. Strengthening the human capital and
giving support through social inclusion are the strategies SODES comprises for social regional
development.25 The project is originally designed as complementary to Southeast Anatolia
Project (Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi-GAP) for regional economic development by the MoD and
later named as SODES.

SODES has been implemented firstly in 2008 with the funding from KOYDES26 (Köy Altyapısı
Destekleme Projesi- Support for Village Infrastructure Project) and Social Aid and Solidarity
Promotion Fund (Sosyal Yardım ve Dayanışmayı Teşvik Fonu -SASPF) in the SAP cities.27 Later, in
2010, DAP (Eastern Anatolia Project- Doğu Anadolu Projesi) cities28 and in 2011, 5 more pilot
cities29 were also included in the geographical coverage of SODES. As the implementation area
of the project expanded, an extra budget was allocated to MoD every year to finance SODES.

MoD is inspired by the management and implementation principles of HRD-OP projects of EU
Pre-accession and adopted a similar perspective in SODES. Grant projects on employment,
social inclusion and sports, culture and arts for children, young people and women are funded
in target cities in cooperation with the Governorships through SODES. Every year, MoD opens a
call for project grants. Public institutions, provincial administrations, municipalities, universities,
legal bodies and non-governmental organizations form various partnerships and design the
projects in line with the targets of SODES. They apply to the Governorships and later
independent assessors evaluate the applications in Ankara. The budget is disbursed to the
Governorships according to the number of projects selected to be financed under SODES in that
city. The Governorships monitor the process and inform MoD through SODES Information
Tracking System, online. 30 As the Table 14 demonstrates, between the years 2008-2012,
674.347.748TL were spent in total for the implementation of 5.792 projects. Among these
projects, 847 were employment projects, 2.526 were social inclusion projects and 2.429 were
culture, arts and sports projects. The employment projects constitute the smallest proportion
in SODES and refer mainly to the vocational training courses implemented in the scope of
SODES.

The targets of the SODES are mainly the disadvantaged children and young people, young and
adult women are also targeted in a number of projects. However, women’s social inclusion and
employment are not prioritized, unless the stakeholders of the local grant projects specify
women as the target. The activities that are carried out in SODES projects include, student
excursions, preparation courses for university exams and middle school exams, activities for
promoting girls’ schooling, activities for awareness raising, sports courses, arts courses, music
courses, pre-school education, concerts and festivals. Libraries, student centers, women’s
centers, vocational training centers, cultural centers, theatres, music and sports halls were built
in the scope of SODES. In addition, between 2008-2011, 6.792 ISKUR registered unemployed
people were employed during the implementation of these projects (except for the public
servants). 31

In the employment component of SODES, vocational training courses were organized by ISKUR.
The same amount of daily stipend was paid to the trainees and the trainees received ISKUR
certificates. However, these practices vary in the implementation of the projects.32 There is no
solid information that all trainees received stipend or ISKUR certificates. Different from ISKUR
trainings in SODES vocational trainings, social insurance of the trainees was not covered and
employment guarantee was not given. Between the years 2008 and 2012, 47.416 people
benefitted from the 1.842 vocational training courses in the scope of SODES. The project
supported the trainees who completed the trainings and want to start a business. 84 people
were given capital support in kind, which corresponds to 147.687TL. 33 Within the social
inclusion component, some minor micro credit projects were also implemented in similar

principles with TGMP. 2.818 people were given 1.653.224TL micro credit between these
years.34 Since the target of SODES is children, young people and adult women, we consider that
those who received capital support and micro credit were mainly women. However, gender
disaggregated data on the beneficiaries is not available.

SODES is mainly a social inclusion project for the regional social development of Southeastern
and Eastern Anatolia, to lessening the effects of unemployment, poverty and migration by
increasing the disadvantaged groups’ access to education, health, employment and social aid.
The project is not aiming at the reasons that created social exclusion; rather it deals more with
the results of social exclusion. Even so, SODES had positive results, such as the increase in girls’
schooling and awareness raising (Kurtipek, 2012). As to women, SODES contributed to their
socialization and economic freedom by enabling them to attend trainings and develop their
skills.35 In terms of women’s employment and entrepreneurship, in our opinion, SODES seems
to have more impact on women’s entrepreneurship than their employment since there is no
employment guarantee given, but support for starting a business is available. Yet, in both areas
the impacts are limited.

5.7 Employer Premium Incentive - İşveren Prim Teşviki

Employer premium incentive is a series of measures recently adopted to promote specifically
women’s and young people’s employment by supplying incentives to the employers. Since all
employment related incentives are funded from Unemployment Insurance Fund under
Unemployment Insurance Law no. 4447, the added articles to this specific law regulate the legal
framework of the employer premium incentive. This practice is the first of its kind that it is an
intervention directly linked to the Labor Law for immediate increase in women’s employment.

In June 2008, according to the temporary article 7 added to Law no. 5763: Law on Amendment
to Labor Law and Other Laws, the employer’s share of the insurance premiums of the women
from all ages and young people between the ages of 19-28, who are employed for the first
time, were to be paid by the state in an annually declining fashion.36 In February 2008, the
validity of the employer premium incentive has been prolonged to 2010.37

Following 2008, several other employer incentives were introduced. The temporary article (Law
no. 5921) added to Unemployment Insurance Law no. 4447 in August 2009 enabled the
employer’s share of the insurance premium of all the newly employed in the last six months to
be paid from the Unemployment Fund. The law no. 5951 issued in January 2009 prolonged the
incentives to December 2010. On the other hand, the regional incentive implemented in 49

provinces of Turkey since 2004 included employer incentives by the Law no. 5084. Accordingly,
the Undersecretariat of Treasury covered 100 percent of the employer’s share of premium in
the organized industrial zones and 80 percent of the other business branches with more than
12 employees. The regional incentives lasted until 2012. Both incentives were in effect
simultaneously with the employer premium incentive issued in 2008 and both did not have
limits by age or gender. In February 2011 by the amendments made in Law no 4447, as is
known in the public as the Omnibus Bill (Law no. 6111),38 the scope of the employer premium
incentive has been expanded to cover unemployed men over 29 year-old who are either
registered with ISKUR or have a vocational qualification certificate. Its validity has been
extended to 2015 for a second time. It has been voiced by social policy specialists in the Panel
on Gender Equality in Employment and Social Security organized by SGK in 2012 that the
inclusion of ISKUR registered unemployed men in the target of this incentive can unfavorably
affect the employment-facilitating impact of the incentive for women and cause the employers
to prefer male counterparts (Yavuz, 2013). Bahçeşehir University Economic and Social Research
Center’s (BETAM) report on employer premium incentives also suggest that considering the
timing of each amendment issued, it is probable that the premium incentives could only be
effective in terms of increasing women’s employment between 2008 and 2009 and in t he 32
other provinces that were not covered by the regional incentives only after the incentive in
2009 was abolished in December 2010. (Uysal, 2013)

According to SGK up until 2012, 13.060 women benefited from the employer premium
incentive as a result of the amendment made in 2008 in the Law 5763 and 105.347 women
benefited from the incentive as a result of the amendments in the Law 6111 in 2011. Further
data on the beneficiaries and the costs is not available. On the other hand, these numbers do
not speak for themselves; there is no way to compare or interpret these numbers without the
information regarding the beneficiaries of other incentives in effect in the same time period.

BETAM, as briefly mentioned above, has conducted a quantitative analysis based on the data
drawn from the Turkish Statistics Institute on the impact of the employer insurance incentive to
women’s employment in the absence of actual data on the beneficiaries .The scope of BETAM
report is limited to women between the ages 30-44. The results show that the incentive had a
positive impact on women’s registered employment. Women’s employment specifically
increased in the industrial jobs that require manual skills in relatively large firms. The analysis
also observed that employment of women who have less than high school education has
relatively increased. Another finding shows that there is betterment in the registered
employment of the married women in that age interval (Uysal, 2013).

One of the most important findings of the BETAM analysis is the vast decline in the increase of
women’s employment in August 2009. This result verifies the argument that due to the
enactment of Law no. 5921 in 2009, the positive impact of employer incentives in 2008 specific

to women and young people has disappeared in 2009. However, the increase in women’s
employment revived when this new incentive was abolished in December 2010. BETAM report
underlines the need of policy to consider the interaction between the incentives in the legal
regulations to avoid such conflict and to reach the targeted outcomes (Uysal, 2013).

5.8 Promoting Women’s Employment Operation - Kadın İstihdamının Desteklenmesi
Operasyonu

Women’s Employment Operation is the highest-budgeted (both in terms of coverage and
budget) employment and entrepreneurship program implemented in the recent years. EU’s
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance finances this program and therefore relevant disbursal
of funds is expected to comply with the priorities of the Human Resources Development (HRD)
specified by the IPA. These aim to increase levels of employment, education and social
inclusion, with the general objective of achieving sustainable economic growth and social
cohesion for the candidate countries.

The main actor responsible for the managing, implementing, monitoring, auditing and
evaluating the usage of these funds is the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS). Based
on the HRD, MoLSS, together with other stakeholders, has developed a Human Resources
Development Operational Program (HRD-OP), which identifies Turkey’s specific issue and
geographical priorities, conditions of release of funds, and the procedures for fund usage. HRD-
OP has four employment related objectives: increasing women’s participation in labor force
and employment, increasing employment among youth, promoting of registered employment
and improving quality of public employment services. Officially, the Central Finance and
Contracts Unit (whose responsibilities have been transferred to MoLSS’ EU Coordination
Department recently) define the criteria for and audits funds disbursal. The Turkish Labor
Agency (ISKUR) runs and monitors the programs of HRD-OP on behalf of the MoLSS.39

The total budget for the HRD-OP is 557,5 million Euros, including the 15% national contribution.
209 million Euros have been allocated for employment related activities. During the 2010-2012
period, the budget for Promoting Women’s Employment has been 26,8 million which was split
into 23.940 million Euros for the grant scheme and 2.9 million Euros for technical assistance
programs. 41 Under the grant scheme, projects targeting both entrepreneurship and
employment are funded. Since activities for fostering entrepreneurship and employment were
integral to most of the projects, the exact budget allocated to these particular aims is
unavailable.

5.8.1 The Grant Scheme

The grant scheme aims to fund grant projects (consisting mainly of vocational trainings) that
prioritize goals such as increasing the employability of women, supporting women’s
entrepreneurship and eliminating cultural barriers to women’s labor force participation. The
geographical target is the growth centers and hinterlands covered by 12 NUTS II regions, where
the income rate is lower than the 75 percent of the average of Turkey. In these areas, the grant
projects are expected to focus on women out of labor force due to either household care
responsibilities or rural-to-urban migration. The target group is held as wide as possible and the
only precondition for projects is to register participating women to ISKUR. There are few
examples of grant projects that specify the target depending on a local labor market analysis.
The grant scheme anticipated 35% of the beneficiaries to be employed and 30% to become
entrepreneurs in the medium term.42

Before an open call for proposals was published, ISKUR held information sessions in 13 of the
43 cities for the target groups. These sessions were also open to institutions interested in
submitting proposals (Samsun, Kastamonu, Diyarbakır, Elazığ, Trabzon, Kahramanmaraş,
Gaziantep, Erzurum, Kars, Batman, Van, Sivas, Şanlıurfa, Çankırı, Hatay). During these meetings,

ISKUR representatives identified and encouraged particular potential applicants. The call
announced on February 12, 2009;44 and the applications were accepted until May 25, 2009.

The eligible applicants were limited to non-profit making legal persons, such as non-
governmental organizations serving in public interest (chambers of commerce and industry,
chambers of artisans and craftsman, vocational organizations, technical and vocational training
institutions, organized industry zones, trade unions, universities, etc.), local authorities
(municipalities, provincial administrations, etc.), and not-for-profit cooperatives. These actors
were expected to work in areas related to empowering women or increasing women’s
employment and/or entrepreneurship. Projects were required to have at least one partner
active in the target cities. Those projects where partnerships included stakeholders from both
the labor demand and supply sides were preferred because of their expected sustainability. 45

The evaluation of the projects was not based on a base-line analysis in the targeted cities.
However, it took into consideration their clarity in identifying and filling the gaps in existing
occupational and entrepreneurial training and counseling services; capacity for involving local
employers who are likely to hire the final beneficiaries; and the measures they were going to
use to target increasing women’s employment and monitor progress toward it. In terms of the
content of the projects, those that included sessions targeting wome n’s rights and
empowerment; trainings on work safety and health and social security were to be favored.
Finally, projects were expected to plan for the provision of childcare throughout the duration of
the training sessions. At the end of the evaluation, Central Finance and Contracts Unit (CFCU)
finalized the decision to fund 131 projects out of 1058 applicants, that is 12% of the candidate
projects. (See Appendix C)

The officers aspired for greater degree of variation in project proposals, but this did not
materialize to the level of their expectations. At the same time, more project proposals than
expected concentrated on low skill requiring sectors. The trainings conducted had the following
sectoral distribution: 31 projects were on child/elderly care services; 28 were on traditional
handicraft manufacturing for touristic purposes, 25 were on local food and beverages
processing; 24 were on office work; 19 were on agricultural production; 18 were on tourism; 14
were on textile; 10 were on livestock production; and 9 were on design.46 Projects that catered
toward care services were almost always prioritized given the finding that women’s care
responsibilities withheld them from labor force participation. Several of projects targeted the
revival of local food production and traditional handicrafts for market purposes.

In 17 projects of these 131 projects, sessions on entrepreneurship were integral to vocational
trainings. In other words, the projects’ primary focus was on giving women training on a
particular vocation but they also included sessions on the basics of entrepreneurship. In the

trainings, there were also informational sessions on access to finance for women interested in
starting their own businesses. That is, in this program, activities on entrepreneurship were not
separated from vocational training.

9856 women participated in these trainings and 9557 completed them. Of these 9557 women,
780 women were present in the sessions on entrepreneurship and 118 women were present in
meetings where career guidance and counseling was provided. Except for the ages of
participants47, unfortunately, there is no further available information about the participant
women’s education levels, marital status, number of children, last job, household conditions
and income. The lack of this sort of data is a consistent problem across all programs and
projects, related to women’s employment and entrepreneurship, which will be discussed in
detail later.

The plan of Promoting Women’s Employment Operation envisaged that 35% of the women
who received certificates would be employed and 30% would become entrepreneurs.48 In the
end, 914 women were employed, corresponding 9 % of the 9557 women who received a

certificate. This low ratio can be a result of the fact that employment guarantee was not
provided in these projects. About the activities those can be considered as a form of
entrepreneurship, the promotional leaflet of the program indicates that 113 women started
their own businesses; 631 women started to work home-based, becoming suppliers to ateliers
and small businesses; and 321 women became members of cooperatives.49

Women who participated in the trainings received a daily stipend (15 TL in 2012), as required
by the rules of ISKUR. The officers evaluate that the stipend tended to function as a social aid,
also convincing women’s spouses for their participation in the trainings. Some of the projects
granted supplies to women to initiate production based on their training. However they were
not given funding. Several of these initiatives attempted to revive local food production and
traditional handicrafts for market purposes. In these cases, women were provided with
assistance in the form of consultancy on branding, and ways to market and sell the products.

There is not an explicit follow up mechanism written into the program of the Grant Scheme,
tracking what happens to women after the projects are over. Correspondingly, there is no
available information on the actual duration of the jobs women found and sustainability of the
enterprises and cooperatives established by women. Officer evaluations emphasize that
wherever employer involvement is high, the chances for women to find work and survive in
that job increase. Moreover, local civil society participation is mentioned to have positive
impact on the sustainability of the attempts to revive local food production and traditional
handicrafts for market purposes. Still, the entrepreneurship and employment results of the
projects ran in the grant scheme remain low, considering its scope and budget. This may be due
to the facts that the projects did not limit the profile of the women they aimed to reach, and
did not diversify the sectors suitable to these specific women’s skills and the Labor market
demand. The officers indicate that the biggest success of the trainings lied in the empowerment
effect they saw in the participants.

5.8.2 Technical Assistance

Technical assistance, aimed to improve the institutional capacities of ISKUR and other local
stakeholders in two interrelated ways: ensuring women’s access to more and better quality of
jobs and improving the public employment services with an eye to removing the barriers
standing in front of women’s labor force participation. The budget of this component was 2.9
million Euros.

For this purpose, ISKUR conducted labor market analysis in five pilot cities: Çorum, Erzurum,
Gaziantep, Trabzon, Van. This analysis aimed to identify women’s labor force participation
patterns as well as barriers and opportunities at the local level, from the supply and the
demand side. The actual research had two parts: meetings with local notables, representatives
from labor unions, chambers of commerce, business organizations as well local public officials

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


and statistical analysis of local labor market trends. The original intention was to conduct this
study prior to the grant scheme. However, it followed the disbursal of funding for the trainings.

The main consistent result of the research identified cultural barriers to women’s labor force
participation, both on the demand and the supply side. This finding formed the backbone of the
Communication Action Plan, which was turned into booklets on the language and
communication from the perspective of gender based discrimination, discrimination and
violence against women, legal rights and the place of women’s work in Islam. These booklets
were produced for the use of ISKUR vocational consultants in order to enhance their gender
sensitivities and contribute to institutional capacity.

The funds were also used to organize meetings in several cities50 targeting to change men’s
prejudicial views on women’s labor force participation, on the supply and the demand side. The
same booklets were used in these meetings, as well. Other dissemination activities included art
contest among children promoting mothers’ participation in the labor force and banners in
national soccer league games.

In principle, the technical assistance part of the operation should have been conducted before
the implementation of grant scheme as a base-line study. However, in this project the technical
assistance component was conducted after the grant scheme. The officers saw the activities in
technical assistance component as significant in targeting cultural barriers existing in front of
women’s labor force participation. They also emphasized that in the absence of the tools for a
formal impact analysis, these meetings allowed them to do limited follow up on the projects in
the cities they visited.

ILO Turkey Office and IŞKUR jointly executed this program between January 2009 and March
2010 in the pilot cities of Ankara, Konya and Gaziantep. While ILO Turkey Office was in charge
of technical and operational aspects of the project, IŞKUR ran the project with the technical
support from the ILO International Training Centre (ILO-ITC), ILO Gender Equality Bureau, Prime
Ministry Social Services and Child Protection Agency (SHCEK) and Women’s Human Rights: New
Solutions Association (KIHYÇD). The budget for the project, provided by the Norwegian
Government, stood at 398,748 US Dollars.


50The cities are Ağrı, Kars, Iğdır, Ardahan, Van, Muş, Bitlis, Hakkari, Mardin, Batman, Şırnak, Siirt, Erzurum, Erzincan, Bayburt,
Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Gaziantep, Adıyaman, Kilis, Kayseri, Sivas, Yozgat, Trabzon, Ordu, Rize, Giresun, Artvin, Gümüşhane,

The pilot project had the following objectives: improve ISKUR’s technical capacity; help ISKUR in
developing gender-sensitive active labor force policies and give women employment
guaranteed vocational trainings, with the goal of increasing their chance of reaching more
decent jobs. This pilot program also had the intention of developing a model to be used in
future programs and projects. It had three components: the program officers conducted labor
market analysis in the chosen cities; gave gender sensitive training to ISKUR personnel in these
locations; and gave trainings to women seeking to gain access to the labor market.

The selection of the pilot cities were based on women’s labor force participation rates in these
cities, taking into consideration a diversity in the relation between economic size, economic
growth rate and the percentage of women in the labor force. Ankara was selected because it
had a slightly higher labor force participation rates for women between the ages 14-25
compared to the country average.51 Gaziantep and Konya were included because they had high
economic growth rates but lower women’s labor force, again in the same age group,
participation than the country average. The target group of the project was unemployed and
preferably young women registered with the Turkish Employment Agency (IŞKUR). Once the
cities were selected, Prof Dr. Yıldız Ecevit, a professor in METU, wrote a report assessing the
labor market conditions in these cities, including the patterns of labor force participation for
women. This report laid the groundwork for the selection of professions for which trainings
were to be organized (Berber-Ağtaş, 2010).

ILO Ankara made this selection, choosing 13 trainings out of 40 offered by ISKUR. The vocations
were chosen on the basis of ILO’s criteria for decent work and quest for gender -based equality
in areas where women were less likely to be equally represented. An additional criteria used
was to make sure that women were channeled away from informal employment. The subjects
of the vocational trainings were as follows: TV assembling, aesthetician, sales advisor, child care
for the age group 0-6, computerized accounting, three-dimensional graphic design, sewing
operator, medical secretary, executive secretary, office management and secretarial work,
carpet designer, stylist and office management.

A total of 746 women completed the vocational trainings in 18 courses and received certificates
in these 13 different occupational branches. 73% of these were in the age group 15-29, and
82% were high school or higher education graduates. In this sense the program achieved the
objective of reaching the age group with the highest likelihood of labor force participation. The
table below shows the number of courses and trainees, and the expected and realized rates of
employment by provinces.

The significance of this project compared to its counterparts was the integration of an
additional module called Women’s Human Rights to the vocational trainings. Out of 746
women participating in vocational trainings, 731 women completed this module and received
additional certificates.

Furthermore, trainings on “job seeking techniques” were organized in Konya Selçuk and
Gaziantep Universities. 86 women benefited from these trainings. 35 ISKUR personnel received
training seminars on public employment services and women’s employment for the
improvement of technical capacity.

Gaziantep component of the program introduced activities targeting women’s
entrepreneurship specifically. Under the auspices of this program, ISKUR and the municipality
of Şahinbey organized an entrepreneurship course in December 2009. The total number of
women, participated in entrepreneurial trainings was 112. These women were selected from
the 590 participants of the courses on tailoring and baking previously organized by the same
institutions. The course duration was limited to fifteen hours and the content of the
entrepreneurial trainings was simplified. The training included sessions on the basics of
entrepreneurship such as building self-confidence, market assessment, business plans,
marketing, finance and legal obligations. In other words, this entrepreneurial training was not
compatible with KOSGEB’s trainings in terms of coverage and duration of the courses.

Apart from the trainings, on ILO Ankara’s request academics contributed to the project by
making the impact evaluation of global crises on the target provinces and women’s
employment (Toksöz, 2009) and conducting a qualitative research on Provincial Employment
and Vocational Training Boards, to further improve the capacity of stakeholders on their impact
on the local employment strategies and gender equality (Ercan, et al, 2010) The outcomes of
these studies were shared with stakeholders in various workshops in which over 400 people
participated. As part of these awareness activities, ILO Turkey also distributed Turkish
translations of brochures produced during ILO’s Gender Equality campaign in 2009, notebooks
and bags with logos in their meetings.

A new three-year project with the partnership of ISKUR and ILO began in March 2013 aiming to
develop a national action plan on women’s employment and gender equality; to organize

trainings to jobless women; to work for the integration of modules on gender equality and
women’s rights to all ISKUR trainings.

5.10 The First Step Credit – İlk Adım Kredisi

The First Step Credit is a program initiated and run by Halk Bank with the goal of alleviating
problems in women’s access to finance. Halk Bank is a joint public-private venture, whose
majority shares are owned by the state. It specializes in providing credit to Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs). The program began in December 2012 after the signing of a protocol
between the bank and the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF). The CGF was established in 1991 to
enable banks to share their risks with this institution when they provide credit to SMEs. One-
third of its shares are owned by KOSGEB, another one-third is owned by TOBB and the
remaining is distributed among a number of banks and other NGOs. Thus the program’s
difference from other programs we have discussed so far is that its ownership structure reflects
a partnership between public and private institutions. In addition to these institutions, MoFSP
has played an active role in the establishment of the program; and continued to promote it in
all platforms. The ministry officers see the program as a product of their intensive activities on
women’s entrepreneurship in 2012.

The program plans to distribute credit to 1000 women who have no access to bank credits due
to their lack of access to collateral or guarantors. The target group covers a wide range of
women from those with primary school to university diplomas, all of whom aspiring to become
entrepreneurs. The applicants need to be below the age of 50 and should have established
their businesses in the last one year. The program plan includes differential scale of credit
provisioning with respect to women’s level of education, kind and length of work experience,
and availability of vocational training certificates. Accordingly there are five groups, whose
credit disbursals range from 10,000 TL to 95,000 TL.

The program works as follows. Women present their business plans to the local branches of
Halk Bank. After the first screening in the local branches, the business plans, which make the
shortlist, are collected at the regional centers of the bank. At this stage, there is a second
screening and the successful plans are then sent to the CGF. CGF finalizes the selection. During
this three-stage selection process, the criteria used include feasibility of the business plan as
well as risk of moral hazard.

The primary objective of the program is to support potential women entrepreneurs by offering
them access to credit without high financial documentation and strict collateral / guarantor
requirements; with ease of application and low interest rates. In the spirit of the primary goal
of the program, the women access this credit by showing a collateral or a guarantor covering
only 20% of the credit. This guarantor has to have income above the minimum wage. The CGF is
to underwrite the remaining 80%. However, it is revealed in the fieldwork that in practice CGF
asks for a guarantor for this procedure as well.



                                                64

The interest rates charged are 30% lower than the current rate of interest. The credit
repayment should be completed in up to 60 months. The two additional advantages provided
by the program are that throughout the duration of the credit repayment, women are exempt
from costs of all banking transactions and Halk Bank gifts them with a one-year private health
insurance.

As of June 2013, the bank had received around 550 applications and evaluated positively 200.
Of this 200, CGF accepted to give credit to about 100 women. Of the total budget of 30 million
TL allocated for the year 2013, 3.890.000 TL has been distributed. If the targets are not reached
by the end of the year, the officers envisage the extension of the program’s duration. 52

The accepted business plans are mostly concentrated in services and trading sectors. The
examples the officers provided are catering, dry cleaning, clothing stores, cafes, and pre-
schools. Geographically, there is more concentration in economically developed regions and in
large urban centers. The officers point out that since this is not a microcredit program, special
attention was not paid to the eastern and the southeastern regions. However, this claim is not
relevant, as we have seen above in the example of Turkish Grameen Microcredit Program. From
the officer’s point of view, First Step Credit is a social aid mechanism pursued by the bank, since
there is too much paperwork for the bank and many advantages provided but less interest in
return. Moreover, despite the initial aim of giving out credit to women without collateral, in
practice CFC still asks for a guarantor.




52   The program was ongoing at the time of evaluation. The program was completed in June 2014.


                                                              65

6. Assessment

This section evaluates the findings emerging from the discussions of the individual programs
conducted for the purposes of increasing women’s employment and entrepreneurship. It has to
be emphasized that for the majority of the programs available data is restricted and it does not
deliver the base-line and follow up survey necessary for thorough evaluation. Therefore this
report does not provide an impact analysis, but rather it evaluates the programs according to
their targeting procedures, included activities and governance processes with respect to the
issues that arise in the implementation. We assess the programs in terms of the attention they
pay to women’s labor force participation and their potential for resolving existing issues.

First we summarize the trends with respect to the targeting procedure of the programs. We
study whether these programs specify target groups of women with respect to demographic
characteristics, income criteria, and geographic location. We also describe sectoral choices with
an eye to their potential for creating labor force participation opportunities for women.

Second, we focus on the scope of the activities covered within the programs and evaluate how
these activities address the specific barriers to women’s employment and entrepreneurship
opportunities. The literature on Turkey reveals absence of institutionalized care giving options;
low levels of education and lack of experience in the job market; problems related to access to
finance for business start-ups and women’s needs of mentoring and networking; lack of
incentives for and enforcement of fair gender practices in employers’ decisions to hire women;
and the ambiguous role cultural practices on both supply and demand sides. We evaluate the
activities covered in these programs in terms of their ability to address these shortcomings.

Third, we focus on the governance of these programs. We evaluate the institutional structure in
which the programs are implemented. We appraise process, addressing the ways in which the
everyday implementation may end up diverging from program objectives and rules. We also
assess how institutions monitor and analyze the impact of the programs and keep data on the
program activities. Finally, we discuss potentials for sustainability by assessing the budgeting
used in the programs and the effectiveness of institutional partnerships.

Overall we end with the discussions on the tensions the programs inherently have between
goals of social assistance and inclusion versus goals of creating employment and
entrepreneurship and the assumptions they make regarding women’s roles in society.

6.1 Targets: Who and in which sector?

6.1.1 Achieving sustained emphasis on women’s employment and entrepreneurship

Public programs analyzed in this report can be divided in two groups according to the criteria of
target groups. The first group targets sections of the entire population out of labor force and
unemployed, without any gender specifications. The second group devises specific instruments
to boost women’s employment and entrepreneurship.
                                                66
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


In the first group are programs, which either do not specify any target group or target certain
segments of the population based on income level. Programs that address the entire
population out of labor force and unemployed are: Active Labor Force Programs of ISKUR,
Entrepreneur Support Program of KOSGEB and non-formal education programs of MoNE.
Among these permanent public programs, only Entrepreneur Support Program of KOSGEB has
positive discrimination measures for women applicants. The current characteristics of the
Employer Premium Incentive align it with these three programs based on its changed criteria of
targeting. It was initially designed for women out of employment and young men aged between
18 and 29. In this sense, in its original design the program utilized an intervention making direct
use of the labor law to pursue an immediate increase in women’s employment. However this
prioritization is no longer valid since regulation was amended to include men over 29 year-old
who have a vocational qualification certificate. These four programs do not also specify target
groups within women out of employment based on demographics or any other criteria. The
program, which targets only certain segments of the population based on income level, is
Support for Income Generating Projects of MoFSP only. It focuses on the poorest 36% of the
population which corresponds to those fitting the criteria specified under the Law on Social
Assistance and Solidarity Fund (Law 3294). Support for Income Generating Projects also has
some measures to encourage women’s participation more.

The second group of programs target solely women out of employment. Some in this group also
specify certain segments within women, setting eligibility requirements based on criteria such
as age, care responsibilities and income level. Pilot Project of ILO, Promoting Women’s
Employment Operation of MoLSS-ISKUR, the First Step Credit of Halk Bank and Turkish
Grameen Microcredit Programme of TISVA are in this group. While ILO’s project targeted young
women, Halk Bank has set the upper limit of age as 50. The Operation prioritized the women
with care responsibilities, living in 12 NUTS regions, where the income rate is lower than the 75
percent of the average of Turkey. And the microcredit program, which is the only permanent
program in this group, uses the income criteria and specified poor women as the beneficiary.

This classification reveals that, in the recent years, the state actors in cooperation with some
stakeholders have been actively running projects, catering specifically to increasing women’s
employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. These are in addition to more general
programs, whose target groups are not gender-specific. The initiation of the targeted programs
is an encouraging trend. However, we have concerns about the fact that the initiatives that
target women are mostly temporary projects. They are funded by one-shot budget allocations.
If these projects continue to retain their temporary and addendum characteristics, this is
disruptive to the goal of reaching and preserving higher levels of women’s employment and
entrepreneurship. On the other hand, there is also an opportunity here. These projects provide
the necessary experience for designing more permanent programs, to be funded continuously
from the state budget. A second observation is that while the capabilities and needs of women
vary by their socio-economic status and their geographic location; most of the available
programs focus on women, whose income and education levels are low. The programs’ focus
on women, with lower access to education, should be commended. The trainings they offer are
an important opportunity for women to gain market-relevant skills. However, the low income
                                                67
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


levels of women (and their households) always contribute to an inherent tension in the
programs, between goals of immediate poverty reduction / social inclusion and creating long-
term patterns of employment and entrepreneurship.

6.1.2 Achieving sustainable increases in women’s participation in heterogeneous sectors

The public programs covered in this report can be also assessed based on the sectors of
economy activity in which women’s employment and entrepreneurship is promoted.

The permanent state programs such as Active Labor Force Program of ISKUR, non-formal
education of MoNE and Entrepreneur Support Program of KOSGEB and Social Support Program
of MoD do not target any sector by design. Similarly the procedures of Employer Premium
Incentive, the First Step Credit of Halk Bank and Turkish Grameen Microcredit Programme of
TISVA do not include any criteria about sectoral concentration of beneficiary women. Yet
interviews with officers revealed that implementation usually varies from the initial aims of the
programs because of both demand and supply side reasons. ISKUR does not have the authority
to enforce equal treatment in job placements; accordingly it does not have the capacity to
hinder employers discriminating on the basis of gender and preferring women jobseekers only
for limited vacant job positions. On the supply side, women benefiting from training programs
are mentioned to prefer fields which are close to be the extensions of home-based work and
occupations which have historically been seen as “women’s work”. For programs supporting
entrepreneurship, that is in the First Step Credit of Halk Bank and New Entrepreneur Support of
KOSGEB, the interviews have revealed that business plans proposed for credit support are
mostly concentrated in services and trading sectors. Examples given by officers are catering, dry
cleaning, clothing stores, cafes, and pre-schools. The microcredit program adds home-based
manufacturing to this list, albeit low skilled and informal.

The other programs covered in this report, by design, aim at promoting women’s employment
and entrepreneurship in certain sectors of economic activity. Promoting Women’s Employment
Operation of MoLSS-ISKUR prioritized grant projects, which gave trainings in care sector. It also
targeted the revival of local food production and traditional handicrafts for market purposes.
Support for Income Generating Projects of MoFSP requires the submission of business plans on
activities requiring a degree of specialized skills and artisanship, rather than mere service
provisioning such as in the case of running small stores, cafes, etc. The resulting examples
include hair salons, tailoring, etc. in the urban areas. For the rural areas, the business plans
should fit with local market conditions. The pilot project run by ILO is the only one of its kind,
which defined its aim as decent work for women. Consequently, it targeted training in sectors
in which women were less likely to be represented and where formal employment is routine.

Despite the fact that the various programs target a wide array of sectors and start with goals of
increasing women and men’s access to the labor market in creative ways, in the
implementation, we see a number of caveats, which if addressed, could increase the likelihood
of success. Once the programs are initiated, it appears that a gap grows between original goals
of sectoral variety and non-discrimination and the actual implementation. The programs carry

                                                68
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


the danger of repeating existing gendered divisions of labor and the ensuing capacity to access
the labor market. Some of the problems that create this situation are beyond the scope of the
programs, such as gendered divisions of labor at home, low degree of correspondence between
levels of education correspondence and market demands, etc. Nevertheless for long-term
positive results in changing existing horizontal and vertical segregations in the market, there
should be more focus on how to shift gendered assumptions about divisions of labor within the
programs’ design. Relevantly, the programs could enforce measures (such as degree of
variation in sectors, occupational position for women, etc) in order to ensure that the gap
between original targets and actual implementation is as narrow as possible. Second, since the
overall aim under discussion here is increasing the likelihood of labor market access and
success in employment and entrepreneurship, there could be more critical attention paid to
actual market conditions. If, for instance, women are routinely encapsulated in the production
of niche local food and souvenirs, market for which is precarious and in some cases already
disappearing, this poses a problem for the sustainability of the entrepreneurial activities.
Finally, there needs to be more statistical information across the programs on resulting
occupational distribution by gender. In this way there could be periodic assessments done for
the programs and to design mechanisms for improvement. Our interpretation is that if the
programs can channel the gamut of activities and the officers’ extensive stock of experience
toward achieving a more gender-neutral sectoral distribution, then the programs can achieve
sustainable increases in percentages of women’s employment and entrepreneurship and can
make sure these increases also mean into less precarious income opportunities for women.

6.2 Scope of Activities: Do they address barriers?

Here, we focus on the scope of the activities covered within the programs and evaluate how
these activities address the specific barriers to women’s employment and entrepreneurship
opportunities. The scholarship on women’s employment and entrepreneurship mentions
absence of affordable child and elderly care services; low education levels and lack of
experience in the job market; insufficiency in access to credit and financial services; lack of
mentoring and support in networking; lack of incentives for and enforcement of fair gender
practices in employers’ decisions to hire women; and the ambiguous role cultural practices on
both supply and demand sides as barriers to women’s success in employment and
entrepreneurship.

6.2.1 Provision of affordable child and elderly care services

The literature reveals that one of the most important impediments to women’s labor force
participation is the unequal distribution of care responsibility in the households. The programs
covered in this report are limited in addressing this barrier. Only the Operation managed by
ISKUR aimed at promoting employment of women out of labor market due to care
responsibilities. This goal was reflected in the prioritization of grant projects, proposing to
provide vocational training in the care sector. While this focus is important, it has to be noted
that ISKUR and MoNE already include trainings on care work as part of their permanent
activities. Given the significance of this barrier, it is crucial to design policies and programs that
                                                 69
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


directly aim at provision of affordable care services or incentives for women with children to
enter and survive in the labor market. Yet providing consistent solution to this problem is
beyond the reach of public programs that are implemented on temporary basis.

6.2.2 Access to training

Provision of vocational trainings addresses the barriers of low education levels and lack of
occupational experience. These are the most widespread activities implemented in the
programs. Active Labor Force Programs of ISKUR lead among others in this field, and MoNE is
the other consistent provider of vocational trainings within the non-formal education
programs. Officially, ISKUR programs aim at immediate employment outcome for the trainees,
since the courses offered and number of unemployed targeted is designated with respect to
local labor market analysis. ISKUR has not specified women as a priority group to be reached,
yet it succeeds providing equal opportunities for women and men in terms of training, as
reflected in the numbers of trainees. The number of women who participated in the trainings
even exceeds that of men since 2009. The problem here lies in the job placement. This equality
in training does not translate directly to job placement, despite the intensified mediating
activity of ISKUR in the recent years. The statistics are even lower for MoNE, both for men and
women because MoNE trainings are more loosely tied with employment outcome than ISKUR
trainings: for all trainees since vocational and technical trainings provided by MoNE neither
offers employment guarantee at the end, nor pays daily stipend or social insurance.

Vocational trainings are also included in the activities of the projects which are implemented on
a temporary basis. The Pilot Project of ILO and the Operation of ISKUR provided vocational
trainings for women. While ILO preferred to fund trainings in the sectors in which women were
less likely to be represented and formal employment is routine; the ISKUR Operation did not
have such a specific preference. Both projects included sessions on entrepreneurship in some
of the vocational trainings. Different than Operation, trainings in ILO project also included a
module on women’s human rights that aims at empowerment. Employment guarantee was
provided in some fields of trainings of ILO, while it did not exist in the Operation.

Entrepreneurial training provided by KOSGEB’s Entrepreneurship Support Program and ISKUR’s
Active Labor Force Programs are stand-alone courses, whereas in the two temporary projects
discussed above, entrepreneurial training were only an addendum to the vocational trainings.
The figures of KOSGEB about the number of entrepreneurship certificates received by women
reflect a sizeable increase from 4,581 to 25,029 over the 2010-2012 period. A similar
advancement is observable in the ISKUR figures from 3,599 to 12,348 over the same years. This
situation should be assessed positively as a success in increased access to training for potential
women entrepreneurs. There is not any impact evaluation conducted on entrepreneurial
trainings, therefore its outcome in the form of successful business start-ups by women cannot
be evaluated.

The widespread availability of trainings for employment and entrepreneurship is an important
opportunity for groups, whose previous access to marketable skill development was negligible.

                                                70
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


Therefore these programs have significant potential for addressing the problem of lack of
education and skills, discussed in the literature. There are a number of ways in which these
efforts can be improved. First, a bird’s eye view of the entire realm of programs catering to
women shows a great deal of repetition and concentration in the same areas. If the programs
can be revised to capture women’s heterogeneity, the degree of successful transition from
training to employment / entrepreneurship could be increased. Moreover, there is a need for
the content of the training programs to be redesigned according to market requirements.
Second, the transition from training to employment / entrepreneurship figures are low in
general and even lower for women. This outcome necessitates the designing of stronger links
between the trainings and market conditions, especially for women. Third, it is necessary that
existing expertise in this area be turned into permanent programs rather than remain as short-
term projects. Establishing permanent programs will not only reflect the public commitment to
women’s participation in the labor force. These programs will also be more effective in creating
sustainable changes in the long run. Forth, for the specific case of bolstering entrepreneurship,
trainings organized to foster entrepreneurial skills is important. These programs should also be
commended for encouraging participants to make a realistic assessment of their business ideas.
Yet, the officers reveal that more often than not, the business plans do not have sufficient
potential. For successful and long-term increases in women’s entrepreneurship, mentoring
programs could be helpful in creating and following through a good business idea and achieving
access to networks in the market. Finally, the literature reveals women’s deficient access to
finance as a major barrier to their entrepreneurial activities. Training is only an initial step in
fostering entrepreneurial potential. Programs that include focus on mentorship, access to
business networks and access to finance are vital for achieving increased percentages of
successful enterprises established by women. We strongly recommend the designing and
widespread implementation of programs with such a holistic approach.

6.2.3 Access to finance

Entrepreneurship programs covered in this report implement activities, which address the
financial barriers women face in their attempt to set up a business. Entrepreneurship Support
Program of KOSGEB provides grants and loans to women who hold entrepreneurship
certificates. Support for Income Generating Projects of MoFSP provides credits to applicants
who prove they have the necessary skills for the businesses proposed. The First Step Credit of
Halk Bank provides different amounts of credits to women based on the education level and
experience of women and characteristics of business proposals. The program undertaken by
MoFSP put the goal of social inclusion of women before the competitiveness of newly
established enterprises, thereby lends credits to be paid back in longer terms and without
interest rates. Its audience is the poor women without any social security. KOSGEB program
also do not implement interest rates, yet its rules on credit disbursals and payback is more
strictly defined. Halk Bank, on the other hand, both requires interest payments and starts
payback early, at most one year after the release of credit. Competitiveness is an important
eligibility criteria for this program and it implements a clear diversified scale for credit
disbursals.


                                                71
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


In addition, the Operation of ISKUR and SODES of MoD, covered in the previous chapter, offer
the option to provide capital support in kind to the trainees who want to start a business in the
related areas after completion of the trainings. Provision of supplies is an incentive mechanism
that would channel women to outside-home options in specifically manufacture sectors
without putting them into debt as in the microcredit programs. However, many of the trainings
focusing on manufacture and production mainly aim at reviving local food and traditional
handcraft, some of which have tailed off due to descending market demand. Thus, the capital
support in kind is not likely to result in successful businesses, not entirely because of the type of
support, but rather because of the limited market reception for the goods produced as a result
of the trainings.

The Entrepreneurship Support Program of KOSGEB, Support for Income Generating Projects of
MoFSP and Halk Bank’s First Step Credit aim to ease access to credit for potential women
entrepreneurs, who do not have enough capital or can not provide collateral or guarantor in
the start-up within the existing financial system. The documentation necessary to obtain
financial support encourages women toward registered income-generating activities. These
requirements also push applicants to make realistic calculations, and therefore act as a
screening mechanism for proposals without potential. While these are all important, it has to
be kept in mind that the procedural requirements of the programs or issues that arise during
implementation weaken the possible contribution they can make to women’s
entrepreneurship. These programs, either by design or during implementation, require a kind
of guarantee mechanism to release credits, therefore these only marginally reduce women’s
reliance on regular financial sources. More attention should be paid on providing effective
institutional solutions to credit guarantee mechanism in order to remove financial barriers
potential women entrepreneurs face.

6.2.4 Access to mentorship and business networks

Women entrepreneurs are most vulnerable in the start-up and their access to mentors and
necessary business networks is of critical importance in this phase. Only Entrepreneurship
Support Program of KOSGEB provides institutional support to new entrepreneurs, yet its
outreach is limited. KOSGEB program does not plan for the provision mentorship for the grant
and credit recipients, however it includes funding for establishment of new business incubators
and support for already existing ones. These incubators aim to serve new entrepreneurs in the
fields of training and networking and provide affordable workshops, collective office equipment
and office services. Yet only one incubator is established since the start of the program in 2010,
therefore it is the least utilized activity of the program. According to the action reports of
KOSGEB, the ratio of women’s enterprises benefiting from the already existing incubators is
32% in 2011 and 27% in 2012. There are also incubators for only women entrepreneurs’
benefit, yet they service only 42 enterprises owned by women in the same years. The function
of business incubators is important for supporting the sustainability of new enterprises built up
by women, therefore public programs should pay more attention on this kind of institutional
support if sustainability is aimed.


                                                 72
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


There were also some efforts to provide consultancy and networking in the Operation managed
by ISKUR, for women who are incentivized to take part in the production of local food and
traditional handicrafts. Yet these were far from being institutionalized and remained to be
individual endeavors. In these cases, women were provided with assistance in the form of
consultancy on branding, ways to market and sell the products. Since these are not continuous
institutional supports, women were again left to their own capacities and networks after the
Operation finished.

These projects can serve as pilots for more permanent mentorship schemes with more
widespread coverage. The accessibility of mentorship networks would be tremendously helpful
in fostering entrepreneurship among women.

6.2.5 Incentives for employers

Providing incentives for employers is the unique public program activity that includes a direct
intervention to the labor law for immediate increase in women’s employment. In the initial
phase, this program aimed at benefiting the individuals who have limited access to jobs in the
labor markets, accordingly targeted women from all ages and young men between the ages of
18-29. However, the target group later enlarged in 2011, to include also men from all ages who
have vocational training certificates. Due to the enlargement in the groups targeted, women
are no longer a priority in this particular incentive. There should be other mechanisms to
encourage employers to practice positive discrimination toward women if the goal is to
increase women’s employment rates.

6.2.6 Dissemination: Addressing Cultural Barriers

Many of the programs covered in this report engage in dissemination activity, yet especially the
Operation of ISKUR targeted vocational consultants at ISKUR, male workers and employers to
address the cultural codes and practices that prevent women from entering in the labor
market. The research conducted in five pilot cities on opportunities and barriers for women in
the labor market determined that cultural codes and practices to be important obstacles to
women’s labor force participation, both on the demand and the supply side. Accordingly, the
officers planned for a communication action and prepared booklets on the issues such as
gender based discrimination, violence against women, legal rights, the uses of discrimination in
language and daily communications and the place of working women in Islam. These booklets
were produced for the use of İŞKUR vocational consultants in order to enhance their gender
sensitivities and contribute to institutional capacity. Also meetings to change men’s prejudicial
views on women’s place in economy and society were organized. Other dissemination activities
included art contest among children promoting mothers’ participation in the labor force and
banners displayed in national soccer league games. The officers saw these activities as
significant in addressing cultural barriers existing in front of women’s labor force participation.

An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


These are all important activities, whose results will be apparent in the long run. We suggest
that for these to have the desired effect, they could be made permanent parts of state run
programs, instead of being project based.

6.3 Governance

In this final section, we would like to refocus on the main themes that emerge from a number
of the programs discussed. These are the sustainability of the programs; the relationship
between official goals and actual implementation procedures; data requirements for
monitoring and impact assessment and the continuous tension between social
inclusion/poverty alleviation and employment/entrepreneurship objectives. We would also like
to discuss the institutional structure of the implementation of these programs and the tensions
they create.

This report has revealed that the state is actively involved in running a variety of programs that
cater to some of the important barriers to women’s labor force participation. While these
efforts are very important, there are two issues with respect to institutional structure. First,
these are part of a terrain of more general programs, which aim to resolve problems of
unemployment for all sectors of society. However, while programs that target general
unemployment issues are permanently established, those aiming to target specifically women
are more on a project basis. For these programs to be sustainable and to have permanent
effect, they, too, should be included in the permanent budget of the state.

Second, because these are issues regarding labor force participation, employment and
entrepreneurship, the responsibility is allocated to the MoLSS, and it is important that they
cooperate with relevant institutions and organizations to promote women employment and
entrepreneurship.

A third and serious problem we encountered during the research was the lack of available data
on various aspects of these programs: from the budgets to the target group specifications, from
the characteristics of the beneficiaries to what happens to them after the programs are over.
Available data also appears to be severely fragmented. This makes it very difficult to monitor
the programs during implementation. In the absence of baseline data and with very limited,
and in some cases nonexistent outcome figures, it is unfortunately impossible to make an
impact analysis for any of these programs. There is a dire need for more structured and
continuous data collection to be able to assess the impact of the money spent. This is also
crucial for achieving any sort of sustainability in these, now somewhat patchy, programs.

Fourth, systemic monitoring of the projects and programs could be useful. This monitoring
should investigate divergences from program design. While it is to be expected that actual
implementation can never completely reflect the desk-design, the monitoring should be
sensitive to changes that can nullify the goals of the program. The same comparison can also
give important clues about what is possible in the field and how the programs should be revised
accordingly.

6.4 Conclusion

In the recent decades, various public bodies have recognized women’s low labor force
participation rates as a problem. This recognition has tallied the attention literature has
devoted to the issue, looking into the causes of the percentages as well as possible social
policies that could be devised to remedy the situation. This report has aimed to provide an
extensive inventory of existing public programs, which cater to women’s employment and
entrepreneurship. Our objective has been to assess these in terms of their targeting
procedures, activities and actual governance on the ground.

In this final section, we summarize our findings and conclude with policy suggestions. For this
purpose, we combine a summary discussion of existing programs with findings from
international experience. We emphasize that evidence from other contexts suggests the
importance of retaining the link between goals of gender equality, women’s empowerment,
and women’s increased employment and entrepreneurship percentages. We make four sets of
suggestions.

   First, we note an absence of social welfare policies targeting care provisioning outside of
    family networks. Given the importance of this for promoting women’s employment and
    entrepreneurship in more gender equitable terms, we propose that state policies in Turkey
                                              76
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


    should begin by playing a specific role in reorganizing care work and a more general role in
    giving impetus to challenging existing patriarchal norms.
   Second, we discuss educational attainment as a factor, again based on evidence from
    contexts where women’s labor force participation is higher. Since within the existing stock
    of programs, vocational training programs have a dominant role, we make suggestions that
    could lead to their more effective utilization both for creating increased women’s lab or
    force participation and contributing to changing existing gender dynamics.
   Third, we evaluate credit disbursal mechanisms and how these can be improved in ways
    that lead to women’s sustainable and diversified entrepreneurial activities.
   Finally, we make observations on the existing configuration and governance of the
    initiatives and suggest ways to improve their organization within the state, data collection
    mechanisms and everyday implementation in order to effectively address the
    aforementioned barriers.

Both domestic and international policy debates emphasize that social policies, which target
women’s increased levels of employment and entrepreneurship, should be part of holistic
approaches that target women’s empowerment. As elsewhere, in the Turkis h context, there is
need for policies that ensure more equitable sharing of household responsibilities, encourage a
shift in cultural practices toward those favoring gender equality, and support these with the
necessary legal changes. In their absence even if women’s participation in the labor force
increases, this is likely to lead to double burdens for women in and outside of home; while
contributing to their clustering in the informal economy and more precarious jobs. In the recent
decades, changes to the constitution, labor law and social policy have addressed some aspects
of gender inequality. Regarding this issue, we believe there are three interrelated areas of
progress. First, we think that the responsibility of the National Monitoring and Coordination
Committee on Female Employment as well as the Parliament’s Committee on Equality of
Opportunity for Women and Men especially to be very high. These committees should work
effectively to promote gender equality in all areas of life, not just the labor market. Second, in
addition to the work of the aforementioned committees, we strongly suggest that policies
devised and implemented for increasing women’s labor force participation be made permanent
part of the responsibilities of Ministry of Labor and Social Security.

It is also necessary to not take for granted the existing gendered distribution of labor, in the
household and outside; but instead devising ways to equalize opportunities for men and
women. Relevantly, international studies indicate a two-way relationship between existing
cultural practices and women’s labor force participation, to the extent that regions where
women’s labor force participation are lower are argued to display more patriarchal
characteristics. These cultural practices have an immediate effect on the way care burden is
shared between the genders, falling disproportionately on the shoulders women. Studies
focusing on ways to remedy the situation emphasize the importance of welfare policies
designed to unburden women of care responsibilities. This means the organization of collective
care facilities, accessible to families, who cannot otherwise afford private provisioning. These

                                                77
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


supports can include the subsidization of alternative care services, organization of wide
network of collective care facilities, as well as legal changes that work toward neutralizing care
giving, such as equal parental leaves with pay and enforcement of care facilities in all
businesses (not just those where there is a certain number of women employees). Given the
high reliance on women for care giving in Turkey, we strongly suggest the devising of long-term
solutions to this impediment. These can utilize existing training programs on care giving run by
ISKUR to expand the network of accessible care giving possibilities, but cannot be limited to
them.

Studies of women’s entrepreneurship in Turkey reveal that many women start their businesses
in the informal sector, as an add-on to assumed familial obligations, severely limiting their
ability to long-term success. Literature on women’s entrepreneurship in other contexts warns
us to the need to pay attention to the fields in which self-employed women cluster to ascertain
whether women’s entrepreneurship can result in their improved well -being. Given these
findings, expansion of accessible care work for women will not only improve women’s chances
of employment outside of home, but will also expand the range of entrepreneurial activities
they can undertake and successfully sustain without being doubly burdened.

International experience shows that increased educational attainment of women have
responded to structural changes in the economy and the kinds of jobs created as a result. In
many contexts where there has been a significant improvement in women’s labor force
participation, there has also been a coeval increase in their access to higher levels of education.
In some contexts, however, literature and accordingly our observations made in the process of
writing this report reveal an ambivalent link between vocational training and women’s access
to employment. In the Turkish context, a variety of vocational training programs have formed
the backbone of existing interventions aiming to boost employment and entrepreneurship.
Both ISKUR and KOSGEB programs have been quite successful in attracting relatively equal
numbers of women and men despite the fact that they do not have universalized positive
discrimination measures. Yet, in the light of limited data, we have noted a weaker transition
from training to employment for women than men. We have also observed in KOSGEB trainings
that women with high school or higher education levels were more likely to receive certificates
and achieve an implementable work plan. For women with lower education levels, there is a
higher risk of not being able to complete the training and their work plans were more likely to
cluster in areas, which reinforced traditional gender roles or did not have sufficient market
demand.

In the light of these findings, we have three proposals for improving existing network of
educational activities. First, vocational trainings should enforce strict positive discrimination
especially in areas where women are underrepresented. This approach could both serve to
alleviate gendered divisions in the labor market and to ensure women’s greater access to
sectors, where the likelihood of decent jobs is higher. Second, currently there is weak transition
from training to employment / entrepreneurship unless they are bolstered with additional
measures, such as employment guarantees. These guarantees can be expanded or made part of
the positive discrimination packages for women. Third while some programs employ
                                                78
An Analysis of Public Programs Related to Women’s Entrepreneurship and Access to Labor Markets


educational modules on gender equality and women, at the moment these mostly target
women. We propose for a thorough revision of the existing network of trainings and
dissemination efforts and the place of modules on gender equality and women’s right within
them. These modules should be made part of all training activities for a more holistic approach.
The coverage needs to be expanded to cover everyone for actual change in the long run. In
addition to trainings, there have also been some efforts to address general patriarchal modes
of behavior through pamphlets, meetings, and conferences in projects. However, these, too,
cannot be one shot for long run success. Not only should there be persistence in these
activities, but they should be part of a rethinking of gender norms on the part of the state.

Literature on women’s entrepreneurship emphasizes that successful raises in women’s
entrepreneurial activities requires a combination of access to finance and effective mentorship
in addition to training. In the stock of existing initiatives, there are several programs for credit
disbursal and mentorship. While some of the credit programs aim to reach women who have
feasible business plans for a start-up, others engage with women from poorer socioeconomic
backgrounds. The programs that aim to reach women with solid business plans are not
effective in creating positive discrimination for women’s access to credit, above existing market
conditions. In other words, especially during their implementation, potential applicants
continue to face the kinds of barriers that discourage them from utilizing outside finance. This
situation should be remedied by at least making sure that the desk-plan of the programs and
implementation do not diverge significantly from one another. In the case of poor women’s
access to credit, there is a problematic overlap between goals of social inclusion and credit
disbursal, to the extent that in the majority of the working programs, credit ends up being
utilized for immediate poverty relief. While working toward social inclusion is not the issue in
and of itself, it becomes problematic when the programs are also promoted for their work with
women. This is because the kinds of income generating activities that emerge are often very
precarious, located in the informal sector, and unlikely to change existing gendered divisions of
labor in the household. In this sense, effectiveness of initiating entrepreneurial activities for the
purposes of social inclusion of the poor women should be reconsidered and the programs of
social inclusion should also be revised to address these concerns. In addition to improvements
in credit disbursal mechanisms, for women to establish sustainable businesses, accessibility of
domestic and international mentorship should also be systematically expanded.

In conclusion, we would like to repeat our suggestions for the configuration and governance of
these programs. First, there has to be systematic and reliable data collection on the activities
undertaken. In the absence of data to conduct impact analysis, their effect on changing the
existing labor market structures remains to be seen. Second, barriers to women’s labor force
participation are mostly of the structural kind and need sustained commitment for resolution.
This requires, programs, which are permanently part of state budgets, beyond activities
conducted on a project basis. Third, there has to be close follow up of program implementation
to check for divergences from original plans and for evaluation of whether goals of
achievements in women’s employment and entrepreneurship are moving in tandem with
women’s empowerment. All of these are important for success in raising the percentages of
women in employment or engaged in entrepreneurial activities; improving their access to
                                                 79

higher quality jobs; and sustaining the results while contributing to gender equality. For all
efforts and budget spent to be successful and sustainable, there is need for holistic approaches,
which take into consideration the multifarious barriers that stand in front of women’s labor
force participation. While what is currently done produces an impressive array of experience
and expertise in the field, this needs to be translated into future models and program
applications.

Appendix A: Women in and out of labor force: A snapshot

This section provides a snapshot of the profiles of women according to their participation status
in the labor market. The analysis is conducted based on the data taken from Household Labor
Force Survey (HLFS, 2011). Table A1 aims at presenting a brief description of the profile of
women between the ages of 15-64 according to labor force status. There is only a slight
difference in the average ages for women who are in and out of the labor force. However,
women participated in the labor force remarkably differ from others in terms of educational
status: while 39% of the women in the labor force have high school or higher degrees, only 19%
of non-participant women have high school or higher degree. More than 6 out of 10 women
outside of the labor force are primary school graduates or have not finished any school, the same
figure is less than 5 for the women in the labor force. It is clear that education is an important
parameter signaling the labor force activity of women in Turkey.

                                                                   Out of labor force      In the labor force

Furthermore, the HFLS 2011 reveals that the women in the labor force are more rural in
character than the women out of labor force.54 Yet this is not a striking phenomenon as it is
generally accepted that the agricultural sector provide women with more employment
opportunities. Similarly, it is not unexpected to see that the number of children younger than 15,
which reflects the need for childcare in households, are more, even though not by a large margin,
in the families of the women who are out of the labor force.

Table A2 focuses on the characteristics of women out of labor force. The primary reason for
being out of labor force turns actually out to be housework (68%), and only 5% of women are
not in the labor force due to childcare or the elderly in their families who need care at home.
Among this group, only 6 percent are willing to work if offered a job.

Data also suggests that 42% of the non-participant women were employed at some point in their
life. Thirty eight percent of those who lost their last job between 2001-2011 (in total around one
fifth of all the women out of labor force) did so because the work they were doing was
temporary or seasonal. Combined with those who were fired or their firms went bankrupt, this
figure reaches almost half of the total group. Twenty-three percent of women left their jobs due

to marriage and husband’s request or the presence of children and elderly in need of care. Only 7
percent of them were working as employers or on their own account in their last jobs.55
