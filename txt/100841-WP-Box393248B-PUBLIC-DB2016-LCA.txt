THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark pu ts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the

       Registration with the Commercial Registry

       When registering the company with the Commercial Registry, the
       promoters pay an administrative fee of XCD 850 when presenting the
       documents for registration. The Registry issues a certification of

        Before applying for an electricity connection, the internal wiring should
        be inspected by an inspector from the Electrical Department of the
        Ministry of Infrastructure, Transport and Port Services. To apply for this
        certificate, the customer's licensed electrician (the licenses are issued by
        the Ministry) would need to submit a standard application form (which
        can be obtained at the Ministry free of charge).

      whether a transformer is needed. During the visit, nobody from the
      applicant’s side needs to be on site. If a pole has to be planted on
      applicant’s property to support a transformer bank or for whatever
      reason, the customer or his representative would have to agree on its
      locations. After some time LUCELEC will issue to the customer an

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       The Land Registry requires that the Certificate of Good Standing be
       produced upon presentation of the Deed for registration. The certificate
       is requested by the parties' lawyers (for both, seller and buyer
       companies) upon written request to the Registrar of Companies. The
       purpose of this requirement is to certify that the company is a validly
       existing company . The Certificate states the Company’s name and                    5-7 days

       * Obtain compliance certificate from the National Insurance
       Corporation (NIC)

       According to the National Insurance Corporation Act of Saint Lucia it is
       mandatory for employers to deduct from the wages of                          1-3 days

       An unpaid contribution to NIC ranks as a privileged debt on the same
       level as state taxes without the necessity for registration and therefore

      takes priority over the rights of other secured creditors such as
      registered mortgagees. Therefore, if an employer has not remitted
      contributions to NIC and that employer’s property is sold for example by
      a secured creditor who has put the property into receivership, NIC’s
      claim will rank above that of the secured creditor.



      The compliance form can be obtained online at the website however it
      will have to be faxed or brought in in person.

      * Obtain tax clearance certificate from the Inland Revenue
      Department

      In order for the execution of the deed to proceed, both the seller and
      purchaser must have paid all outstanding income taxes and property
      taxes. Therefore, clearance from the Inland Revenue Department must be
      granted. This usually takes a few days because the Revenue Authority
      scans all documents. The land Registry will accept the document for
      registration once the Inland Revenue's stamp is on it indicating that all         1-3 days
      stamp duties have been paid.                                                  (simultaneous

      The public can now also submit a request for tax clearance via email and
      fax. However, the tax clearance is collected at one of the Inland Revenue
      Department offices.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                              According to Section 287 of the Companies Act, debenture holders are entitled
                             to realize any security interest vested in them if the company fails to pay within 1

                                       difficulty to sell the business as a going concern in the market.

                              The receivership proceeding will take approximate 2 years until BizBank is repaid
                                 some or all of the money owed to it. After one month since Mirage's default,
                              BizBank would apply to the Court to appoint an identified receiver to enforce its
                                security interest as the debenture holder. The Court will notify relevant parties
                                and hold a hearing in 9 months. Then within half a year, the Court will make a

very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
