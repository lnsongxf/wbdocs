This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       and filing the company incorporation and tax number (GST)

       The Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) is the
       national regulator of businesses and public accountants in Singapore.
       Incorporation is done through Bizfile, an electronic filing system. An
       application for the approval and reservation of a company name is to
       be submitted online via Bizfile. Since 2007, Bizfile has been providing
       one-stop business facilitation services to customers at the point of
       registration. These services include reserving domain names, goods and
       services tax (GST) registration, subscribing for the relevant e-newsletter
       and registering for e-service alerts on latest government procurement
       opportunities, activating Customs Account and application for a
       corporate bank account. An application fee of SGD 15 is payable for
       each approved company name. It can generally be completed within           Less than one day
   1   an hour after payment online. Once a name has been approved, it will                               SGD 315

       be reserved for 60 days. A one-time application for the extension of the
       reservation period by a further 60 days can be made before the expiry
       date.

       Entrepreneurs registering a new business can purchase the Business
       Profile on line at the same time of registration, when filling up the
       incorporation forms. The processing time is about 15 minutes from the
       time of successful submission of all documents and all information, and
       the registration fee payable is SGD 300. The ACRA will issue a notice of
       incorporation via electronic mail to the law firm or professional firm
       engaged for the purposes of incorporation upon the successful
       incorporation of the company together with the registration number of
       the company.

        Agency: Private Firm



        Obtain written permission from the Urban Redevelopment
        Authority

        The application for permission from the Urban Redevelopment
        Authority (URA) can be done electronically by a Qualified
        Professional (QP) through the CORENET Electronic Development
        Applications (EDA) system. The company must submit a digital
        EDA form, along with the following:
        • Proposal and sketch plans for the development
        • Survey plans for sloping or undulating sites

        Companies can apply to URA via two schemes: Normal and Plan
   2    Lodgment Scheme. Launched in 1995, the Plan Lodgment                       14 days               SGD 2,680
        Scheme allows for projects that fulfill the qualifying criteria (see
        http://www.ura.gov.sg/dc/lodgment/dc-lodgment-hdb_jtc.htm)
        to be submitted and approved online immediately. The
        application is made either through JTC system or through URA's
        EDA system. The fees for a plan lodgment are SGD 800.00 plus
        7% GST. The Plan Lodgment Scheme is applicable to industrial
        and warehouse development on land owned by JTC and the
        HDB, which forms about 90% of industrial land in Singapore. All
        Qualified Persons (i.e. Architects or Engineers) are allowed to
        submit their development proposals under the Plan Lodgment
        Scheme. There is no restriction on the size or type of the
        industrial developments or the QP’s firms. In 2007, nearly 70%

      (562 out of 830) of the industrial and warehouse development
      proposals were eligible for approval under the Plan Lodgment
      Scheme. However, if the land is not under either JTC or Housing
      and Development Board scheme (HDB is for residential
      developments), and under freehold ownership the application
      would go through a normal clearance process.

      Although the application submitted under the normal scheme
      itself takes 1 day, it takes on average about 14 days for the URA
      to process it and grant permission. URA does not have a time
      limit, but rather operates under a targeted threshold. According
      to that target 90% of cases must be cleared in 4 weeks. The
      written permission is valid for 2 years, during which time the
      work must be completed.

      The application fee for normal process is SGD 2,500.00 for the
      first 1,000 sq. m. and SGD 60.00 for each additional 100 sq. m.
      (plus 7% general service tax which is not included in the case
      study).

      The case considered here assumes a commercial warehouse for
      storing books, which would be classified as a Group 3 land-
      intensive development.

      http://www.ura.gov.sg/forms/doc/dc-fee2007.pdf.

      Obtain structural and architectural plan approvals and
      building commencement permit, building fire plan approval
      from FSSD, environmental clearance from NEA and clearance
      of parking proposal from the Land Transport Authority

      Qualified Professionals submit the structural plans through
      CORENET system operated by the Building and Construction
      Authority (BCA). The permit will not be issued without the
      written or provisional permission from the Urban Redevelopment
      Authority (URA) and payment of any development charges, if
      applicable. Most companies submit their application to URA and
      BCA for structural approval at the same time. They can time it in
      a way that the structural approval is granted a day after the URA   14 days      SGD 6,113

      issues planning permission. Construction work must commence
      within 24 months from the approval date.

      The structural plan approval can be granted along with the
      building commencement permit that gives the right to physically
      begin the construction.

      Since 2008 the BCA runs a data management module in its
      application processing system to monitor its performance
      standard. It also introduced mobile phone short message and e-
      mail notification to inform the applicants of their applications

      gross floor area (SGFA)
      • SGD 200.00 for each subsequent 100 sq. m. of SGFA

      Hence, in this case, the total fee charged for 1,300 sq. m. is 13 x

      Safety and Health

      Before March 2010, the Workplace Safety & Health (Registration
      of Factories) Regulations required all factories engaged in higher
      risk activities including construction worksites, shipyards,
      metalworking companies, wafer fabrication, petrochemical,
      chemical and pharmaceutical plants to be registered before they
      can commence operations. Registration was valid for only one
      year. An annual fee depending on the number of persons
      employed at the premise ranging from SGD 90 (5 or less workers
      in premise) to SGD 2340 (more than 500 workers in premise) was
      payable upon registration and renewal.

      Ministry of Manpower has reviewed the factory registration
      system for higher risk factories which includes construction

      factories under this scheme are required to register and pay
      once for their license with the Ministry without the need to
      renew their license.

      Qualifying factories were only required to do two things prior to
      the commencement of operations: To register once with the
      Commissioner for Workplace Safety and Health of their
      operations via the On-line Business Licensing System (OBLS) at

        The customer has to engage and appoint an Electrical Worker licensed
        (LEW) with the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to design the internal
        electrical installation, a LEW for the electrical installation works, and a
        LEW to operate on the installation. The client however, can appoint the
        same LEW for all three duties.

        The licensed electrical worker acts as the client's agent for the
        connection to the grid system.

   1    There are three classes of LEW, namely licensed electrician (load <           9 calendar days             SGD 0
        45kVA), licensed electrical technician (load design < 150kVA) and
        licensed electrical engineer (no limit on load). Based on the case study's
        electrical load of 140kVA, the customer needs to appoint either a
        licensed electrical technician or licensed electrical engineer.

        SP Services Ltd serves as a one-stop customer centre for electricity
        connections. SP Services Ltd receives electricity supply applications,
        receives payment of connection fee, opens electricity account and makes
        turn-on appointment with the customer.

      to the grid system, along with 2 copies of the site plan. SP Services Ltd
      advises the appointed LEW and the client on the approval of the
      application and provides them with a quotation within 7 calendar days
      for premises receiving direct service connection from streets mains.

      Direct service connection from SP PowerGrid's LV network to the client's
      installation is available for a small load requirement not exceeding
      280kVA (400A) in commercial or industrial areas.

      Agency: SP Services Ltd



      Open electricity account, pay connection fee and receive external
      works

      The customer’s appointed LEW only liaises with one single external party
      which is SP Services Ltd for opening of account and making payment of
      connection fee which are done on the same day and same place. External
      work from SP PowerGrid Ltd commences automatically upon payment
      for connection fee. No further action is required from the customer.

      The documents required for opening of account are:
      - Completed and signed application form;
      - Copy of business/company registration certificate;
      - Copy of NRIC/FIN (National Registration Identity Card / Foreign
      Identification Number) for the authorised signatory of company
      representative or a letter of authorisation issued by the company
      indicating the company representative’s name and NRIC/FIN, proof of
      ownership or tenancy agreement;
      - Letter from the Authority (Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore)
      confirming the official address of the premises, and
2     - Initial security deposit in cash (which is refundable when the customer     21 calendar days   SGD 17,794.08
      terminates the account) or by the form of banker Guarantee (BG) at the
      point of application;

      For the warehouse, direct connection is applicable as the applied load is
      140 kVA. Services for the provision of electricity supply from the existing
      overground box to industrial premises in built up area with load demand
      between 76 kVA and 140 kVA will be managed as follows by SP Services
      Ltd and SP PowerGrid Ltd:

      a. a.     Upon receipt of connection fee payment by SP Services Ltd, SP
      PowerGrid Ltd will commence work and inform the appointed LEW and
      the client about the date for fixing meter and turn-on of electricity
      supply. The customer’s appointed LEW has to submit the document
      required for turn-on of supply before the turn-on date.

      b. The service provided is underground. Thus an excavation permit is
      needed before SP PowerGrid Ltd can start laying cables. For pragmatic
      reasons, SP PowerGrid will only apply for the permit after the client has
      made the connection fee payment and had their intake point ready for

      The appointed licensed electrical worker (LEW) submits and obtains an
      electrical installation license from the Energy Market Authority (EMA) on
      behalf of the customer.

      For safety reasons, an electrical installation license issued by EMA is
      required for the use or operation of an electrical installation with an
      approved load exceeding 45kVA in a non-domestic premises.

      The customer has to engage and appoint a LEW who will inspect and
      certify fitness of the electrical installation. Thereafter the LEW will submit
      an application for the electrical installation license online through the
      EMA's ELISE portal at www.ema.gov.sg. The license fee of SGD100/= (for
      a 12-month license) is to be paid online together with the application.          2 calendar days      SGD 100

      The EMA will check the completeness of the application before issuing
      the electrical installation license.

      Application for license may be submitted well in advance of the
      electricity supply connection date. The LEW may also arrange for the
      license commencement date to coincide with the electricity supply
      connection date.

      Upon approval of the license application, connection of electricity supply
      can be made anytime when the customer's switchgear and service cable
      are ready.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

regulation are available on the Doing Business website

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
