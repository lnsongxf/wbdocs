The Project Development Objectives are to (i) contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve
access, ease of transit, and road safety along the central part of Georgia’s East -West corridor, and (ii) strengthen the capacity
of the Government, the Roads Department, and other relevant government entities to plan and manage the road network and
improve traffic safety. The project builds on the Bank’s past projects and addresses some of the remaining policy and
investment gaps in the road sector. Specifically, the project envisages an upgrade of the 15-kilometer segment of the E60 East-
West Highway from Sveneti to Ruisi to a dual carriageway. The East-West Highway will be selected to implement a holistic
approach to traffic safety along part of the E60 corridor, which will integrate ambulance services, police, first aid training, and
other safety measures under the corridor safety management plan. As a result of the project, road users will get a better road
quality and level of service, avoid costly congestion, experience better road safety, and save on travel time. With the Additional
Financing in the amount of US$43 million, the existing Ruisi-Agara road section will be upgraded and the Agara Bypass will be
constructed as a dual carriageway road. Overall 34 kilometers of road will be upgraded.

Results achieved to date:

       Construction work for a 15-kilometer segment of the E60 Highway from Sveneti to Ruisi is complete. The road, two
        tunnels, and the bridge over Liakhvi River are open for traffic.
    Institutional strengthening and road safety components have begun to be implemented, and road safety audits have
        been conducted. Monitoring and evaluation outputs have recently improved.
    Transit time from Sveneti to Ruisi has decreased from 12 to 8.1 minutes.
    Vehicle operating costs from Sveneti to Ruisi have decreased to US$0.17 per kilometer for cars and to US$0.71 per
        kilometer for trucks—target overachieved.
    Transit time from Sveneti to the Agara Bypass has decreased from 27 to 23.2 minutes.
    Vehicle operating costs from Sveneti to the Agara Bypass have decreased to US$0.19 per kilometer for cars and to
        US$0.74 per kilometer for trucks.
    Road fatalities on the East-West Highway from Senaki to Tbilisi have been reduced by 43 percent.
    Around 50 percent of works are completed on the Ruisi to Agara Bypass financed under the Additional Financing.

The Project Development Objectives are to (i) contribute to the gradual reduction of road transport costs and improve
road safety along the section upgraded under the project; and (ii) strengthen the capacity of the Roads Department (RD) and
the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) to plan and manage the road network and improve road
traffic safety. The project development objectives are similar to those used in the current East-West Highway projects
supporting the improvements to the E60 highway since they contribute to the achievement of the overall objective of
improving the E60 East-West Highway Corridor westward from Tbilisi.

The project is designed to upgrade the existing East-West Highway through the construction of a two-lane dual carriageway
from Agara to Zemo Osiauri. The length of the section of the E60 to be upgraded is about 12 kilometers and contains two
interchanges, two bridges, several overpasses and underpasses, and approximately 3.4 kilometers of riverbank protection. The
project will also finance maintenance of the E60 two-lane dual carriageway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (approximately 67
kilometers) through a multiyear maintenance contract to assure the continued serviceability of this section of the E60.

Results to be achieved:

        Transit time from Agara to Zemo Osiauri will be reduced by three minutes, or 30 percent
        Vehicle Operating Costs from Agara to Zemo Osiauri (cars) will be reduced by 10 percent to US$0.18/kilometer
        Vehicle Operating Costs from Agara to Zemo Osiauri (trucks) will be reduced by 5 percent to US$0.72/kilometer
        Number of road fatalities will be reduced by 25 percent

To boost the country’s economy and diversify sources of growth, Georgia is focusing on developing selected sectors, including
infrastructure, agriculture and agro-industries, and tourism, with the expectation that this would create jobs. Rehabilitating
secondary and local roads and improving local connections are also known to stimulate agricultural development. Further,
reduced transport costs would lower agriculture sector costs, thus making agricultural products more competitive.
The Project Development Objective is to improve local connectivity and travel time for selected secondary and local roads
and to strengthen the capacity of the Roads Department (RD) to manage the road network. The project envisages
rehabilitating and improving up to 200 kilometers of various sections of the secondary and local road network throughout
Georgia. As a result of the project, travel time will be reduced by 20 percent on the targeted road sections. A Performance-
Based Contract (PBC)/Output- and Performance-based Rehabilitation Contract (OPRC) will be piloted.


Out of 225 kilometers of secondary and local roads to be rehabilitated under the project, about 182 kilometers of roads have
been rehabilitated.

Results achieved to date:

     Travel time on rehabilitated sections has decreased on average by 44 percent, affecting over 150,000 direct beneficiaries

The Secondary and Local Roads Projects (SLRP) have contributed to improving the condition of roads and building the
technical and management capacity of the Roads Department. A total of 1,054 kilometers of secondary and local roads were
rehabilitated by 2012 under SLRP I and 225 kilometers will be rehabilitated by 2017 under the ongoing SLRP II. This has
contributed to bridging the road rehabilitation backlog and increasing the share of secondary and local roads in good and fair
condition from 45 to 49 percent and from 16 to 17 percent, respectively.
The Project Development Objective is to reduce transport costs on project roads and improve the sustainability of road
asset management in the secondary and local project road network. The Third SRLP will improve 200 kilometers of key
regional and local road sections, which will provide better access to three major towns (Telavi, Samtredia, and Tsalenjikha),
126 villages, and around 45,600 households, totaling a population of roughly 138,000 inhabitants.


Expected Results:

     Travel time on rehabilitated sections will decrease: average speed will increase by 20 kilometers per hour
     Vehicle operating costs will decrease on average by 22 percent for cars and 27 percent for trucks
     Improved condition of project roads (as measured by international roughness index - IRI) from 12 to 3
     Roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads will improve by 2.4 percentage points

Results achieved to date:

     All 10 road sections of the first-year program have been contracted out.

Roads are a lifeline for the economic activities of most Georgians, and even in the main foreign trade road corridors, up to 90
percent of the traffic is local users. In the Kakheti region, the main activities are the wine industry and tourism. A reliable
transport network is essential to stimulating both of these activities as well as to reducing poverty in rural areas.
The Project Development Objective is to reduce transport costs and improve access and traffic safety for Kakheti regional
roads. The project entails (a) rehabilitating the 65-kilometer Vaziani-Gombori-Telavi (VGT) road, mainly along its existing
alignment; (b) rehabilitating the 17 kilometer Sasadilo-Sioni road under a design-build contract; (c) implementing traffic safety
improvement measures on the VGT road and along the existing alignment of the Vaziani-Sagarejo-Bakurtsikhe-Gurjaani-
Telavi road; (d) strengthening the operational effectiveness of the Sagarejo Regional Office of the Roads Department; and (e)
conducting the Roads Safety Awareness and Education Campaign in the Kakheti region.

Results achieved to date:

     75 kilometers of roads have been rehabilitated
     Traffic volume for trucks between Vaziani and Telavi via Gombori has increased about five times
     Travel time to Vaziani and Telavi via Gombori has decreased from 120 to 50 minutes
     Vehicle operating costs have decreased significantly, from US$0.36 to US$0.25 for cars and from US$1.05 to US$0.72
      for trucks
     The number of road crashes with fatalities along the Vaziani-Sagarejo-Bakurtsikhe-Gurjaani-Telavi road has declined by
      52 percent.

In response to global economic uncertainties, the Government of Georgia is trying to ensure that its economic reform program
is also backed by a strong public investment program. The Government has therefore launched several regional development
initiatives to attract private sector investors to various areas. Georgia, however, has not yet fully tapped its potential to promote
sustainable tourism in promising regions, such as Kakheti, which has long been at the heart of Georgia’s ancie nt culture and
economy. The tourism strategy proposes to develop Kakheti as a high-quality destination year-round. It seeks to attract both
domestic and international tourists, building on its cultural heritage and biodiversity.

The Project Development Objective is to improve infrastructure services and institutional capacity to support the
development of a tourism-based economy and cultural heritage circuits in the Kakheti region. The activities envisaged under
the project are expected to bring benefits to the residents and tourists in Kakheti. The implementation of the project is
expected to improve access to, and the quality and reliability of, public infrastructure; increase the volume of private sector
investment in the region; and increase points of sales in renovated cultural heritage sites and cities. The Government will
benefit from the improved institutional capacity of selected agencies and LSGs. Overall, the population is expected to see
improved welfare and revenues.
Results achieved to date:
 210 building facades have been rehabilitated in Telavi and Kvareli
 Water supply, sewage networks, 71,613 square meters (m2) of asphalt road/sidewalks, 20,824 m2 of cobblestone paving,
   530 lighting posts, and three public parks rehabilitated in central Telavi and Kvareli
 Volume of private sector investments has reached US$10 million (end-of-project target: US$50 million)
 40,400 people in urban areas provided with access to all-season roads within a 500-meter range under the project
 Weighted average number of hours per day of piped water services in project areas increased from eight hours/day to
   12 (end target: 24 hours/day)
 Weighted average vehicle operating costs due to improved urban roads have been reduced by 10 percent (end target: 25
   percent)
 Number of hotel beds in circuit route increased by 69 percent from 1,610 to 2,719, well above the target of 1,932 beds
 Number of points of sales in renovated cultural heritage sites and cities increased by 21 percent from 248 to 300 (end
   target: 323)
 About 3,500 new jobs have been created.

Georgia intends to fully tap into its potential to promote sustainable tourism in attractive regions such as Kakheti and Imereti.
Bank involvement under the proposed programmatic approach to regional development will ensure continued support to (a)
growth in the tourism sector, (b) growth of underdeveloped areas, and (c) the leveraging of public and private investment.
The Imereti spatial economic analysis 2 and Imereti Regional Development Strategy 3 have identified tourism, industry, and
trade as the main drivers of economic growth in the region. Imereti is home to several cultural heritage sites, as well as to
significant natural and protected areas.

The Project Development Objective is to improve infrastructure services and institutional capacity to support the increased
contribution of tourism to the local economy of the Imereti region. Project activities are expected to benefit Imereti’s residents
and tourists. They are also expected to improve access to, and the quality and reliability of, public infrastructure; increase the
volume of private sector investment in the region; and increase small and micro enterprises in renovated cultural heritage sites
and cities. The Government will benefit from the improved institutional capacity of selected agencies and the improved
capacity to operate and maintain assets.
Results achieved to date:
 Number of hotel beds in circuit route areas increased by 48 percent (from 2,661 to 3,943)
 Number of hours per day of piped water services in Tskaltubo increased from eight to 12 (end target is 18)
 Number of household water connections that are benefiting from rehabilitation works: 2,000 (end target is 5,000)
 Energy efficiency of street lights has improved by 20 percent

Expected Results:
 Volume of private sector investments will increase by US$20 million
 Revenues from tickets sold at Vani museum will increase from US$10,500 to US$89,000 per annum

Agriculture remains an important sector in Georgia, given that over 50 percent of the population works in agriculture, which
constitutes about 25 percent of exports. Subsistence agriculture accounts for 75 percent of rural employment and 45 percent
of rural income. However, the share of agriculture to GDP has significantly declined (from 25 percent in 1999 to about 8
percent in 2012), though it has started to increase again due to the Government’s focus on the sector, recording 8.2 percent
in the first six months in 2013. The Government’s draft Socioeconomic Development Strategy 2020 recognizes the poor
condition of agriculture and focuses strongly on rebuilding services for small farmers, promoting cooperative development,
and restoring infrastructure. The Government is increasing public funding to agriculture, either through specific funds (to
promote private sector participation) or subsidies to small-holder farmers. Two key constraints to investment in agriculture
are poor irrigation and weak land markets. During the past 25 years, the irrigated area has declined from 386,000 hectares in
1988 to 25,000 hectares in 2013 due to weak investment in irrigation infrastructure and institutions. While Georgia has a
modern national registration agency, it is estimated that only 15–20 percent of land titles are registered.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the delivery of irrigation and drainage services in selected areas and
develop improved policies and procedures as a basis for a national program of land registration.

Expected Results:

About 31,000 farming households cultivating approximately 26,000 hectares of agricultural land on which irrigation and
drainage services will be improved will benefit directly from increased agricultural productivity under the project. Up to 10
percent of these households are headed by a female and about 78 percent of all households were employed in agriculture in
2012. Additionally, about 19,000 households holding unregistered agricultural land plots in pilot areas for land registration
will benefit from the improved policies and procedures generated under the project and the opportunity to register their
land. In the longer term, all rural households in Georgia holding unregistered agricultural land plots (approximately 640,000
households) will similarly benefit.

Key results expected:
    50,000 farmers will benefit from the project
    26,000 hectares will be provided with improved irrigation and drainage services
    31,000 water users will be provided with new or improved irrigation and drainage services
    A national irrigation and drainage strategy will be prepared and endorsed
    Recommended policies and procedures for a national program of land registration will be submitted to the
       Government

Affordable and reliable clean energy is essential for Georgia’s private sector to compete, grow, and contribute to the kind of
job creation necessary for boosting shared prosperity. Although Georgia has no overall shortage of supply, it is highly
dependent on imported power to meet seasonal demand, raising concerns over the security of supply. Without major
investments in domestic seasonal generation, the security of the power supply will diminish even further as Georgia’s economy
grows. Even with a major increase in power generation capacity, the weak parts of the transmission grid will impede the
security of supply. The proposed Transmission Grid Strengthening Project (TGSP) will address the following key issues: (i)
the lack of a hydropower development plan optimized for enhancing the security of supply, realizing the economic benefits
of hydropower assets, and minimizing adverse environmental and social impacts; and (ii) inadequate infrastructure for a major
increase in the power trade.
The Project Development Objective is to provide reliable power transmission to the southwestern part of the grid, upgrade
electricity exchange systems, and provide economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable electricity sector
planning.

Expected Results:
All power consumers of Georgia will benefit either directly or indirectly from an adequate and more reliable electricity supply
transmitted from a cleaner source of power. The power consumers in the Ajara region will be direct beneficiaries of an
improved quality of power supply, particularly Batumi. The power from new hydropower stations on the Adjaristsqali river
will provide an important additional flow of revenues to Georgia’s economy.

Key results expected:
 142 kilometers of transmission lines will be constructed or rehabilitated
 Total duration of outages in Batumi will decrease from 136 hours to 0.5 hours per annum
 Total electricity evacuated from the newly developed power generation stations in southwestern Georgia through the
   grid will reach 400 gigawatt hours (GWh) by the end of the project.

The Challenge

The fact that many financial institutions in emerging markets do not tailor financial products and services to women
entrepreneurs represents a missed opportunity and constrains private sector development. Providing women with access to
finance from the Georgian finance sector represents a largely untapped market opportunity.

IFC supports female entrepreneurship as an important part of its mission to foster sustainable private sector growth in
developing countries. IFC works with financial institutions to expand financial services to women entrepreneurs through
specialized credit lines, market analyses, and capacity building. IFC launched its Banking on Women program in Europe
and Central Asia in 2011 to support lending to women through financial intermediaries.

The Project Development Objective

IFC has provided the Bank of Georgia, its long-term partner, with a US$25 million loan to expand lending to smaller
businesses, especially those owned by women, supporting financial inclusion and improving the competitiveness of
Georgia’s economy. The IFC loan is supporting the lender in reaching out to female entrepreneurs, who face more
challenges accessing credit than their male counterparts. Through the bank’s network of 164 branches, the program is
expected to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) inside and outside the capital expand and modernize.

This is IFC’s first loan in Georgia under its Banking on Women program, which helps women to play a greater role in the
economy.


Key Expected Results:
The project is expected to:
       Support SMEs in Georgia by providing them with much-needed long-term financing, boosting economic growth
       Encourage lending to women-owned businesses, helping improve the lives of many
       Have a strong demonstration effect, leading to increased international funding for the Georgian market

    Donor Partners: Austria’s Federal Ministry of Finance, BP and its Oil and Gas Co-venturers, and the Norwegian
    Trust Fund for Private Sector and Infrastructure.

    The Challenge
    Georgia has undertaken sweeping economic reforms in recent years, improving the investment climate. The
    Government’s priorities are now focused on further improving the investment climate and strengthening
    investor confidence to attract more foreign investment and boost economic growth. Reforms in the tax system,
    investment policy, and trade logistics are expected to contribute to increased transparency and investor
    confidence. These are crucial for growth in a small, open economy like Georgia and are high on the
    Government’s agenda.

    The World Bank Group Approach
    The IFC Georgia Investment Climate Project aims to improve the investment climate in Georgia by increasing
    the efficiency of regulations in three key areas: tax, trade logistics, and investment policy.
    The project will work on:

           Taxation:
               o Improving the legal framework and efficiency of administration of international taxation
                   procedures, with a focus on transfer pricing1
               o Aligning Georgian tax legislation and implementation practices with global standards
                   following the guidelines of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of
                   Information2
               o Simplifying value added tax (VAT)–related administrative procedures and harmonizing them
                   with the legislation of European Union
           Trade logistics:
               o Supporting an upgrade of customs automation system
               o Supporting the simplification of import and export procedures
           Investment policy:
               o Enhancing the legal and regulatory framework for investment in Georgia

    The IFC Georgia Investment Climate Project is implemented by the World Bank Group Trade and
    Competitiveness Global Practice.

    Results achieved to date:
        Transfer pricing legislation has been adopted, which will help increase revenues from transfer pricing
            audits
        Customs automation system has been upgraded, which will help reduce the administrative burden for
            businesses

  Transfer pricing occurs when two related companies —a parent company and a subsidiary, or two subsidiaries controlled by a
common parent—trade with each other.

  The Global Forum is the multilateral framework within which work in the area of transparency and exchange of information has
been carried out by both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD economies since
2000. Georgia became a member of the Global Forum in 2011.

                     IFC ADVISORY SERVICES PROJECTS IN GEORGIA


  Agribusiness Standards Advisory Program in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (2013–16)


Donor partner: The Ministry of Finance of Austria

The Challenge
The agribusiness industry is a vital contributor to the economies of Europe and Central Asia. However,
inadequate food safety standards keep the region’s agribusiness industry from advancing, while food companies
are shut out of the modern food value chains, potentially aggravating global food security.

The IFC Approach
The IFC program assists local companies in applying food safety standards throughout the agribusiness value
chain while also strengthening the capacity of local consultants. Improved standards will help agribusiness firms
meet regional and export market requirements while building a foundation to mobilize investments and help
the agribusiness industry realize its full potential.

Expected Results
The IFC program is expected to:
    increase the number of companies with food safety management systems in place, boosting their
       competitiveness, investment attractiveness, and export opportunities;
    facilitate an increase in domestic and export sales by client companies;
    facilitate investments as a result of improved food safety management;
    build capacity among local consultants and firms;
    create a demonstration effect for how to do business more sustainably, across the region and globally.


              Corporate Governance Program in Europe and Central Asia (2012–15)

Donor partners: the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and the Development Bank of
Austria (OeEB).

The Challenge
Good corporate governance helps companies and financial institutions to enhance their sustainability, access
capital, and improve their performance. Yet many companies and financial institutions in Europe and Central
Asia lack the knowledge and experience necessary to strengthen their governance practices so as to realize the
real benefits such practices can bring. Local consultants and institutions also lack the skills needed to help
businesses improve their corporate governance. In addition, the corporate governance framework in many
countries is in need of further enhancement.

The IFC Approach
The program provides in-depth advice to companies and financial institutions on implementing good corporate
governance practices, strengthens the capacity of local partner institutions to deliver director-focused training
and corporate governance services, and contributes advice on the corporate governance aspects of laws, codes,
regulations, and other tools.

Expected Results
The program aims to help its partners in Europe and Central Asia raise US$180,000 in sales revenue through
corporate governance work in order to improve the performance of 32 companies through corporate
governance improvements and to help 24 companies access financing totaling US$100 million.

               Resource Efficiency Program in Europe and Central Asia (2010–15)

Donor partner: the Ministry of Finance of Austria

The Challenge
The efficient use of energy, raw materials, and water along a company’s value chain not only helps conserve
resources and reduce waste, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, but also reduces operating costs. Yet
many firms in Europe and Central Asia remain unaware of the potential cost savings and environmental
benefits. As a result, firms are reluctant to invest the upfront costs needed to identify and take advantage of
resource-efficiency opportunities.

The IFC Approach
The program works at the firm and sector levels to stimulate investment in resource-efficient technologies and
best practices, improve management and operational practices across industries, raise awareness among policy
makers and financial institutions, and drive market transformation through sector studies, such as
benchmarking and assessment tools.

Expected Results
The program aims to facilitate the investment of US$90 million and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 120,000
tons of CO2 annually in Europe and Central Asia.


                  Bank Advisory Program in Europe and Central Asia (2009–15)

Donor partners: the Development Bank of Austria, the Government of Luxemburg, and the Swiss State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs

The Challenge
The Europe and Central Asia region was among the hardest hit by the global financial crisis, and many financial
institutions remain vulnerable to further instability and lack the confidence to restart lending to the SME sector
in particular. That is a byproduct of insufficient knowledge about how to manage risk, best practice SME
lending skills, and the high rates of nonperforming loans (NPLs).

The IFC Approach
The program provides in-depth advice to help financial institutions strengthen their NPL and risk management
capabilities and increase lending to SMEs. It also supports the development of a market for distressed assets,
increases awareness of best international practices in risk and NPL management, and supports the development
of SME banking with a focus on gender finance.

Results to Date
The project has helped clients in Europe and Central Asia release more than US$51 million for new lending
and facilitated a further US$17 million in new financing to clients.

                                                  GeoCapital, Georgia

Key Project Data:

Project name: GeoCapital, Georgia
Fiscal year: 2013
Status: Active
Guarantee holder: Principals of a microfinance organization operating in Georgia
Investor country: United States
Sector: Banking
Project Board date: May 28, 2013
Gross exposure: US$1.8 million
Project type: SIP
Strategic priority area: IDA



Project Description

On May 29, 2013, MIGA issued guarantees totaling US$1.8 million covering equity investments and shareholder loans by
two individual American investors in GeoCapital, Georgia. The coverage is for a period of up to three years against the risks
of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.
The project involves investment in the creation and subsequent expansion of operations of GeoCapital Microfinance
Organization LLC (GC), a fast-growing microfinance institution in Kutaisi (Imereti region), Georgia. GC offers small loans
primarily to individuals but also to micro and small businesses. The purpose of the loans is to provide working capital for
small businesses, house remodeling/repairs, education and medical expenses, and other general purposes. These loans are
extended to the large population of households and businesses that have had no or only limited access to credit.
In Georgia, access to finance is one of the main constraints for both companies and individuals. GC is helping a part of the
“unbankable” population gain access to credit and loans for purposes ranging from home equity loans to medi cal,
educational, and income-generation loans. As a large portion of these loans are extended to individuals, they enhance
Georgians’ capacity to pay for social services.
GC’s loans carry a lower interest rate than other microfinance institutions operating in the country. This competition has
resulted in other institutions reducing their rates by an annual average of 20 percent—to the benefit of low-income
consumers.
Since its establishment in 2011, GC has opened three branches and employs 30 people. The company has plans to open 17
new branches within the next three years.
The World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy for Georgia recognizes that credit constraints are severe in the country,
and the project addresses this concern. MIGA’s support for this investment is also aligned with the agency’s strategy of
supporting investments in countries eligible for concessional lending from the International Development Association.
The project is underwritten through MIGA’s Small Investment Program.

Key Project Data:

Project name: ProCredit Group Central Bank Mandatory Reserves Coverage
Fiscal year: 2011
Status: Active
Guarantee holder: ProCredit Holding
Investor country: Germany
Sector: Banking
Project Board date: November 23, 2010
Gross exposure: US$9 million
Project type: non-SIP



Project Description

On December 22, 2010, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$9 million to ProCredit Holding (PCH) covering its investment in
its subsidiary in Georgia. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of expropriation of funds for
mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.
This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the parent company
of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some 750,000 micro, small, and medium-
sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and Africa. Throughout the world, banks are
required to maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of their respective jurisdictions. The ProCredit group’s capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according to the German Banking Act. Under this act, at a consolidated level, reserves
deposited at the various central banks can attract a risk weighting of 100 or even 150 percent, depending on the country.
This risk weighting determines the amount of equity required to maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the German
Banking Act.
The guarantee issued by MIGA will help PCH obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining MIGA’s
insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at the central bank can
be reduced. A lower risk weighting will allow PCH to free up equity currently tied up for CAR maintenance purposes, thereby
allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn will allow PCH’s emerging market subsidiary banks
across its network to increase their lending activities.
MIGA’s support will help PCH optimize its capital management across its 21 banks, allowing PCH to direct equity to
subsidiaries with the greatest need. These banks will be able to offer additional financial services to MSMEs at a time of
macroeconomic challenges. Supporting productive small businesses will help stimulate growth, generate employment, and
reduce poverty.
MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s microfinance strategy, which includes improving
the supply of microfinance in large but underserved markets; enhancing deposit capacity by assisting microfinance
institutions in savings mobilization; promoting capacity building; creating and shaping markets; and fostering innovation.

Project Description

On December 22, 2011, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$13.5 million to cover an investment by ProCredit Holding AG &
Co. KGaA in its subsidiary in Georgia. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of expropriation of
funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.
MIGA provided coverage of US$9 million under the project in FY11. This additional coverage brings MIGA’s exposure
under the project to US$22.9 million.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA is headquartered in
Germany and is the parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some
750,000 MSMEs in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and Africa. Throughout the world, banks are required to
maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of their respective jurisdictions. Currently, the ProCredit group’s capital
adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according to Basel II, but in the future it will also be calculated according to the German
Banking Act. Under this act, at a consolidated level, reserves deposited at the various central banks can attract a risk weighting
of 100 or even 150 percent, depending on the country. This risk weighting determines the amount of equity required to
maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the German Banking Act.
ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA approached MIGA to obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining
MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at the central
bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting would allow ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA to free up equity currently
tied up for CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn
will allow ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA’s emerging market subsidiary banks across its ne twork to increase their

MIGA’s support will allow ProCredit Holding AG & Co. KGaA to direct equity to subsidiaries with the greatest need. The
additional services these banks will be able to offer will help stimulate growth, generate employment, and reduce poverty.
