                 This report is the result of collaboration between the World Bank Group and Vietnam’s Institute for Policy and
                 Strategy for Agriculture and Rural Development (IPSARD). Elements of this report were prepared as part of a
                 background paper on agriculture for the Vietnam 2035 study. Hence, the attention given to benchmarking Vietnam’s
                 performance against that of peers, to providing a vision for the agricultural sector’s development over the coming
                 one to two decades, and the emphasis given to nearer-term policy and institutional reforms needed to put the
                 sector more clearly on the trajectory toward realizing this vision. While Vietnam’s circumstances are distinctive in
                 some dimensions, the country has much to learn from the experiences of other countries which have undergone (or
                 are now also undergoing) signiﬁcant structural changes in their agro-food systems. These experiences are widely
                 referenced in this report.

                 The preparation of this report did not involve new primary research. Rather, it represents a synthesis of pertinent
                 recent analyses, some further use of Vietnamese and comparative international statistics, and the harvesting of
                 pertinent international experiences from many sources. The report beneﬁtted greatly from the recently completed
                 OECD study on agricultural policies in Vietnam.

                 This report was prepared by a team led by Steven Jaffee and consisting of Dang Kim Son, Nguyen Do Anh Tuan,
                 Emilie Cassou, Truong Thi Thu Trang, Nguyen Thi Thuy, Mateo Ambrosio, and Donald Larson. Material on structural
                 transformation in Southeast Asian agriculture and food systems was drawn from a collaborative research project
                 involving Patrick Labaste, David Dawe, Francesco Goletti, Nelissa Jamora, John Lamb and others.

                 Others who made contributions included Dang Kim Khoi, Kim Van Chinh, Nguyen Thi Cam Nhung, Pham Kim Dung,
                 and Nguyen Van Lam (all from IPSARD), Nguyen Huu Dung (VASEP), Le Duc Thinh (Department of Cooperatives &
                 RD, MARD), Vu Trong Khai (College of Management for ARD, MARD), Pham Van Du (Department of Crop Production,
                 MARD), Nguyen Van Ngai (Nong Lam University), Nguyen Phuong Vy (PHANO), Tran Kim Lien (VinaSeed), Dao The
                 Anh (CASRAD), Nguyen Van Sanh (Can Tho University), and Le Canh Dung (Can Tho University).

                 The team would like to thank Andrzej Kwiecinski, Chris Jackson, Binh Thang Cao, Son Thanh Vo, Lan Van Nguyen,
                 and Sergiy Zorya as well as the many experts and private sector representatives who participated in roundtable
                 discussions in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in December 2014 and March 2015. For their guidance throughout the
                 preparation of this work, the team wishes to thank Victoria Kwakwa, Nathan Belete, and Sandeep Mahajan. It also
                 wishes to thank Laurent Msellati, Dina Umali-Deininger, Madhur Gautam, Holger Kray, and Michael Morris for their
                 advice. Administrative support was provided by Tam Thi Do and document formatting support was provided by Budy

            Over the past few decades, Vietnam’s farmers have successfully fed the nation, helped expand trade and have
            provided a reliable supply of labor and raw materials to industry. The entire agriculture sector has had a key role to
            play in poverty reduction and social stability.

            But demographic, economic, climatic and other changes are now altering the playing ﬁeld for the sector, which
            must adjust to face emerging challenges and opportunities. As highlighted in the government’s 2014 Agricultural
            Restructuring Plan, there is a need to modify the sector’s strategic orientation, strengthen key institutions, and
            adjust the roles and support instruments used by government.

            This Vietnam Development Report elaborates on these themes, advocating for a strategy to achieve “more from less”
            (i.e. greater farmer, consumer and societal welfare using less resources and having a lower environmental footprint).
            This can be done through a structural change in which the government “leads less and facilitates more”, particularly
            in relation to farmer and private sector investment, productivity and market development.

            In several technical areas and in multiple locations, shifts in strategic focus are already occurring and different
            approaches for agro-food system support are being piloted. In the coming years, there will be opportunities for
            further experimentation and to replicate and scale-up those innovations which have proven to be effective.

                  Vietnamese Agriculture at a Crossroads

                  Over the past quarter century, Vietnam’s agricultural sector has made enormous progress. Steady advances
                  in smallholder rice productivity and intensiﬁcation through the 1990s and beyond have played a central role in
                  Vietnam’s successes in poverty reduction, national food security, and social stability. Vietnam once experienced
                  hunger yet its per capita food availability now ranks among the top tier of middle-income countries. Many countries
                  are trying to learn from Vietnam’s food security success. Vietnam’s average rice yields now trail only those of China
                  among Asia’s emerging economies. The country has also achieved explosive growth in agricultural exports and now
                  ranks among the top ﬁve global exporters in products as diverse as shrimp, coffee, cashews, rice, and pepper.

                  Vietnam’s performance in terms of agricultural yields, output, and exports, however, has been more impressive
                  than its gains in efﬁciency, farmer welfare, and product quality. Vietnam lags behind regional peers in relation
                  to agricultural land, labor, and water productivity and has seen its once robust growth in total factor productivity
                  decline in recent years. A chasm is forming between farm and non-farm incomes, and income inequality is rising
                  within rural areas. Most of Vietnam’s agricultural trade is in the form of raw commodities, typically sold at prices
                  lower than those of leading competitors due to quality or other differences. At home, there are growing concerns
                  about food safety.

                  More output has come from more and more inputs, at increasing environmental cost. A large proportion of
                  Vietnam’s agricultural growth has stemmed from expanded or more intensive use of land and other natural resources,
                  and relatively heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals. As a result, aspects of Vietnam’s agricultural success
                  have come at the expense of the environment. Environmental consequences of Vietnam’s agricultural success have
                  ranged from deforestation and ﬁshery resource depletion, to a growing incidence of land degradation and water
                  pollution. Hence, Vietnam’s agricultural growth has relied very heavily on human, natural, and chemical factors of
                  production.

                  Vietnamese agriculture now sits at a turning point. The agricultural sector now faces growing domestic
                  competition—from cities, industry, and services—for labor, land and water. Rising labor costs are beginning
                  to inhibit the sector’s ability to compete globally as a low cost producer of bulk undifferentiated commodities.
                  The consequences of over-intensive input- and natural resource-use—both for the environment and for farmer
                  proﬁtability—are increasingly coming into view. Some environmental problems are now adversely impacting both
                  productivity and the international position of Vietnam’s commodities. Vietnam faces bright opportunities in both
                  domestic and international markets, yet effectively competing in these will depend upon the ability of farmers
                  and ﬁrms to deliver (food and other) products with reliability, and with assurances relating to quality, safety, and
                  sustainability.

                  Going forward, Vietnam’s agricultural sector needs to generate “more from less.” That is, it must generate
                  more economic value—and farmer and consumer welfare—using less natural and human capital and less harmful
                  intermediate inputs. Future growth can rely primarily on increased efﬁciency, innovation, diversiﬁcation, and value-
                  addition. This strategic shift was highlighted in the government’s Agricultural Restructuring Plan (ARP), approved

            by the Prime Minister in June 2014. The ARP deﬁnes sector goals in terms of the triple bottom line of economically,
            socially, and environmentally sustainable development. It lays out expected changes in the roles and spending
            patterns of the government in the sector and discusses the need to work with other stakeholders, including in
            the private sector. There are currently many initiatives aiming in these directions. Yet achieving the shift these
            represent on a large, sector-wide scale, will require important changes in certain economy-wide and sector-speciﬁc
            policies and, over time, major changes and additions to the core institutions servicing agriculture. It calls for an
            ambitious and ongoing process of learning and experimentation, and several potential directions are offered below
            for consideration.

            in which Vietnam’s agriculture will need to compete. Vietnam will experience further urbanization (to some
            50 percent by 2025) and a large expansion in its middle class. The dietary patterns and food expenditures of
            domestic consumers will continue to change with reduced consumption of rice and increased consumption of animal
            products, fruits and vegetables, and processed foods. Climate change is expected to give rise to more erratic weather
            patterns. Recent agreements should lead Vietnam’s economy to become increasingly integrated, both regionally
            and internationally. During this period, Vietnamese agriculture is expected to continue along a path of structural
            transformation with the following characteristics:

            The share of primary agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP) will decline, yet the share of the broader
            agro-food complex will not. This would be consistent with patterns observed in other formerly agrarian (and non-
            oil exporting) countries. The GDP share of primary agriculture is expected to decline over the coming two decades,
            perhaps by 0.5 percent per annum. By the early 2030s, primary agriculture will then account for some 8–9 percent
            of Vietnam’s GDP. However, agro-industry, together with food distribution and logistical (and other) services could
            account for nearly double this share (15 percent of GDP). This means that the agro-food complex will still account
            for one-fourth of total GDP.

            The agro-food sector will continue to play a very important role in employment and livelihoods. Primary
            agriculture (including ﬁsheries and forestry) could remain the major livelihood or source of employment for between
            25 and 30 percent of the population, though this is less than the current 47 percent. The share of employment in
            agro-industry and agro-food services will likely be just below its share of GDP. Hence, the overall agro-food complex
            will still account for 35 to 40 percent of employment in the early 2030s. The importance of seasonal and full time
            (or near-full time) employment in agriculture will vary markedly, remaining very strong in the Mekong Delta, Central
            Highlands, and the Southeast, but of declining in importance in the Red River Delta, Central Coast and parts of the
            Northern Mountains area.

            Signiﬁcant changes will occur in terms of agricultural land-use, and the organization of production and value
            chains. For example, one can anticipate that market, environmental, and other factors will contribute to upward of
            one-third of the current paddy-land being shifted by 2030 to alternative agricultural land-uses or ecosystem services.
            Paddy-land affected by saline intrusion will be converted to aquaculture, involving more diverse species than at

                  present. Much of the paddy-land in peri-urban areas will be used for vegetable or ornamental plant production.
                  Paddy-land near the coast and near ecologically sensitive sites will take on greater multi-functional roles, seeking
                  to maintain or revive biodiversity and support eco-tourism. Where drainage services are improved, some paddy-
                  land will be converted to maize production. Rice-based production systems will also change, incorporating more
                  rotation crops to improve soils and manage pests, and moving toward greater specialization—including in fragrant
                  varieties and organic or other eco-safe production systems. Despite the decline in the rice-growing area, Vietnam
                  will continue to experience production levels providing a signiﬁcant exportable surplus with a larger share consisting
                  of high quality and specialty variety products which will provide higher proﬁts for farmers and enterprises. Rice and
                  other product value chains will feature a higher level of farmer organization and more direct linkages between these
                  entities and processors or food distributors (or exporters).

                  Against the backdrop of these shifts, the following represent a set of ambitious yet realistic outcomes that
                  Vietnamese agriculture can achieve in the 2025–2030 time range. While not exhaustive, these illustrate the
                  range of accomplishments that are within Vietnam’s reach, taking into account expected conditions in international
                  commodity markets, changes in domestic food demand, climate change impacts, and past performance.

                  Sustainable Agricultural Productivity and Growth

                    x The agricultural growth rate will cease its ten-year decline and revert to the pace experienced in years just
                      after the turn of the millennium at an annual average of between 3.0 and 3.5 percent.

                    x This acceleration of growth will come primarily from growth in total factor productivity (TFP) and the reversal
                      of its recent decline. Mirroring patterns observed in other high-performing middle-income countries, more than
                      80 percent of growth will be due to TFP growth. Agricultural labor productivity will increase substantially, and
                      this will close the gap which currently exists between Vietnam, Thailand, and China. It will also close the gap
                      between Vietnam’s agricultural sector and its labor-intensive manufacturing subsectors.

                    x The current gap in water productivity in Vietnam’s large irrigation schemes (vis-à-vis those in China and other
                      middle-income Asian countries) will be closed as a result of land-use changes and improved water management
                      and irrigation services.

                    x The reality and reputation of Vietnamese agriculture as eco-unfriendly will fundamentally change. In large
                      portions of the sector, the monitoring of agronomic practices against sustainability standards, natural resource
                      management, waste management, and energy efﬁcient methods will have been mainstreamed. Vietnam will be
                      among the leading developing countries in the effective utilization of agricultural wastes—for energy, feed,
                      composting, and other purposes. Dimensions of Vietnamese agriculture will be domestically and internationally
                      recognized for their multi-functionality—including their protection of landscapes and contribution to eco-
                      tourism.

                    x The sector will continue to play a major role in meeting national food security, servicing increasingly diverse
                      food demands and meeting domestic consumer expectations for safety, quality, and price. Vietnam will meet or
                      exceed all of the World Health Assembly nutrition targets for 2025, including those related to under-nutrition
                      (i.e., child stunting), micro-nutrient deﬁciencies, and obesity. While this is a multi-sector challenge, the
                      agricultural sector will help promote a healthy and diverse diet.

            Competitiveness in Domestic and International Markets

                  x Vietnam will rank in the top 10–20 percent of developing countries in terms of the proportion of its agricultural
                    commodity export volume which is derived from production areas which are either internationally certiﬁed or
                    otherwise recognized for compliance with a broad range of environmental and social standards.

                  x More than 50 percent of Vietnam’s agro-food exports will consist of processed and other value-added products,
                    more than double the current proportion. More than two dozen brands of Vietnamese companies that make
                    agro-food products will be well-recognized in major regional and international markets. In the process of
                    this recognition, the current discrepancy between the high international regard for Vietnamese cuisine and the
                    invisibility of most Vietnamese foods and raw materials abroad will be resolved.




            Getting from Here to There: Directions of Policy and Institutional Reform

            Realizing this vision will rest on important policy reforms and institutional arrangements that help to
            drive innovation and efﬁciency. Particular potential lies in reforms relating to agricultural land, irrigation,
            agricultural research and extension, and food safety. In these and other areas, much can be learned from the
            policies and institutional arrangements that have helped other countries sustain a high level of sector or subsector
            competitiveness, or improve their sustainability, and the report provides many examples of these.

            The modernization of the Vietnamese agro-food system will occur more smoothly if the government’s approach
            involves leading less and facilitating more. Administrative controls on land, and direct state involvement in
            both input and output markets were important factors in the sector’s stability and inclusive growth over recent
            decades. However, maintaining these policies and certain legacy institutions could delay the agricultural sector’s
            transformation in directions needed for it to remain in step with a modernizing, middle-income country. Demographic
            and other domestic changes, as well as changes in the external environment, will deepen the pressures and raise the
            stakes for the modernization of the sector. Micro-managing these change processes would be exceedingly difﬁcult
            and ultimately constrain the inherent energy and resilience of Vietnamese farmers, as well as deter investment
            throughout the agro-food system.

            The following are examples of promising directions and steps that can be taken.


            Sustainable Agricultural Productivity and Growth

            Enable (small) farms to achieve economies of scale. Land consolidation, in various forms, will be critical for
            upgrading production systems and product quality, reducing transaction costs within value chains, and enabling
            households to gain and maintain a middle living standard based at least partly on agriculture. Land consolidation
            will also enable further mechanization, a process which will become increasingly important as labor costs rise.
            Vietnam has already demonstrated that the development of land rental markets can offer an important pathway
            to land consolidation—if not in title, then in practice. In this respect, much will be gained from improved land
            services (e.g., information, recording, dispute settlement) and other interventions that improve the efﬁciency of

                  land rental markets. By the same token, there could be signiﬁcant gains from interventions that bolster farmers’
                  embrace of collective action, or that enable entrepreneurs to develop the shared economy on a commercial basis,
                  enabling economies of scale to emerge on the basis of pooled resources.

                  Continue to facilitate agricultural diversiﬁcation to respond to emerging food demand and improve income and
                  employment opportunities. Among other things, this will require giving farmers more land-use choices by further
                  loosening restrictions on uses of rice-land, improving irrigation services, and developing more ﬂexible irrigation
                  infrastructure suited to growing various crops. Other examples of supportive measures include strengthening
                  animal health and pest surveillance services, better enforcing regulations relating to the use of agro-chemicals and
                  antibiotics, and facilitating farmers’ and small enterprises’ access to ﬁnance.

                  Support and broker broad-based innovation across the agricultural and food sectors. Shifting from resource-
                  intensive to knowledge-based growth will require major changes in the ways in which farmers and other actors in
                  the food system learn and gain access to technical and commercial information. While the government has initiated
                  a shift away from top-down, supply-driven approaches to agricultural research and extension, a deeper rethink
                  is needed with respect to public sector objectives, approaches, and roles. For example, public sector extension
                  services may still have an important role to play, though less as the main provider of centralized advisory services
                  and more as a broker, mobilizer, and funder of services provided by others. For many agencies, moving into these
                  roles will rest on an embrace of structural and cultural changes, both internal and external to their organization. In
                  particular, integrating brokerage functions into traditional extension services will often require these institutions
                  to build new skillsets, reframe their mission, and modify staff incentives by changing performance measurement
                  criteria. Brokering requires speciﬁc facilitation skills for managing group processes and building trust; and it cannot
                  be judged by traditional performance indicators such as publications or numbers of trainings. In parallel, the heavy
                  focus on improving yields and output suggests room for rebalancing investments to ensure their alignment with the
                  realities and aspirations of a modernizing food system.

                  Support environmental stewards to compete on quality. Some legacy agricultural promotion policies seemingly
                  conﬂict with environmental protection goals. This liability can be converted into an asset. Increasingly,
                  environmental protection is becoming central to suppliers’ ability to enter markets and command higher prices.
                  Recognizing the need to prioritize and improve environmental performance, government can enable and encourage
                  private actors to invest in environmental protection through incentives and information. International experience
                  offers examples of how, through procurement, research and development, extension, quality systems, or payment
                  for ecosystem service schemes, government can enable and encourage private actors to invest in environmental
                  protection. More generally, experience highlights the need for pro-active agro-environmental strategies which
                  anticipate and prevent degradation from occurring in the ﬁrst place. In practice, this can involve strengthening
                  capabilities and infrastructure to monitor, learn, and do things differently, through investments in anything from
                  testing laboratories and data collection, to training in areas of technical specialization and facilitation skills. It can
                  also involve mobilizing multiple stakeholders, developing public-private partnerships, and intervening at multiple
                  levels, from farm, to landscape, to region. These principles could for instance be used to develop sustainable agro-
                  based ecosystems around industrial crops and agro-forestry in the Central Highlands.

                  Manage climate risk adaptively. Vietnamese agriculture’s potential vulnerability to climate change risks such as
                  shifting rainfall patterns and temperature, and sea level rise, together with the fundamental uncertainty that is
                  intrinsic to climate change, suggest at least three orientations when it comes to planning adaptation strategies and

            shaping a public sector response to climate change. These are to embrace the tenets of adaptive management, to
            cultivate resilience by strengthening capacity for innovation at every level of society and throughout the economy,
            and to privilege no-regrets strategies. Improved water resources management will be critical. With increasing
            competition around land-use, water, and budgetary resources, irrigation will need to become more efﬁcient and
            accountable. For this, Vietnam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) can work with provincial and
            user agencies to promote and facilitate a more service-oriented approach to irrigation based on modiﬁed incentive
            structures and a less top-down approach to communication that favors joint problem solving among management
            and user organizations.


            Competitiveness in Domestic and International Markets

            Strengthen collective action to build competitive and inclusive value chains. The emergence of more competitive
            and inclusive value chains will be made possible by stronger collective action. The government can support this
            in producer and industry organizations (and commodity boards) in two broad ways, by investing in organizational
            strengthening, and through legal and regulatory means. Many such entities currently perform government (program)
            liaison functions, but in the future will need to play more important technical and/or commercial roles. While
            contract farming is primarily private-sector led, government support for such arrangements is not uncommon on
            the grounds that these can contribute to meeting broader policy objectives such as inclusive growth, food security,
            or the protection of natural resources (though this approach has its pitfalls). In a number of Vietnamese contexts
            such as in aquaculture, specialty rice, and horticulture/ﬂoriculture, agricultural cluster development may be an
            appropriate strategy and lends itself to incremental forms of public sector support.

            Strengthen public and private sector capacities to ensure safe food. In response to food safety challenges,
            Vietnam has already revamped its food safety regulations, invested in laboratories, and streamlined institutional
            structures by reducing the number of ministries in charge of food safety from six to three. It is also redirecting
            capacity developed to ensure export food safety to focus on the domestic market. To bolster these changes, the
            government will need to address ﬁnancial and human resource pressures creatively, and may consider models such
            as co-regulation, which rely on greater private sector involvement, to manage the constraints it is encountering. In
            any case, technical and other forms of support may be needed to enable private food operators (and especially SME
            food processors and informal sector food distributors) to improve their food safety management practices. Adopting
            a risk-based approach will help to provide a set of clear foci for public interventions.

            Reposition and rebrand Vietnam’s offerings to enhance its commercial performance in the food and other
            sectors. Noting the low visibility and perceived value of many Vietnamese exports overseas, Vietnam could consider
            any number of repositioning and rebranding strategies that draw on the rich experience of other countries in this
            domain. In a number of countries, such strategies, together with competitive pressures and market opportunities,
            have stimulated shifts to differentiated commodities or value-added product development. Indeed, the national or
            regional branding of a product—combining elements of marketing, legal protection, and quality management—
            can have a transformative effect on both domestic and international markets. Enhancing Vietnam’s national brand
            in certain industries could help in attracting foreign direct investment and tourism, and more generally promote
            exports and domestic sales.

                  In general, what emerges in considering promising ways forward is ﬁrst, that overcoming the long-term
                  competitiveness and sustainability challenges of the agricultural sector will call for broad government
                  involvement and joint-ministerial action. Many key reforms, such as those related to land, state-owned enterprises,
                  science and technology, government decentralization and coordination, and others needed to support the business of
                  agriculture, cannot be undertaken single-handedly by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Second, to
                  achieve its aspirations, the government will need to invest more selectively in core public goods and services, while
                  encouraging much greater investment and initiative by farmers and the private sector. In short, the government will
                  need to lead less and facilitate considerably more.

                  highlighting recent structural changes in Chapter 1, and benchmarking these and various indications of performance
                  against the patterns observed in Asia’s other emerging economies in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the report lays out a
                  scenario and set of goals for how Vietnam’s agricultural sector could evolve over the coming 10 to 15 years, along
                  with some of the key policy and institutional challenges the country will need to address along the way. Chapter
                  4 then draws on international experience to present multiple examples of policy instruments and programmatic
                  approaches from which Vietnam can learn as it steers its way through the changes of the coming decades. While
                  drawing on these concepts, Vietnam will need to blaze its own path—building on the economic, social, and
                  ecological dynamics that are playing out in the agricultural sector and beyond—to realize its national vision of a
                  modern food system.

            handling, transportation, processing, conversion, distribution, and marketing of food and other agricultural
            products. Systems once featuring many small, loosely connected players selling generic goods give way to or are
            supplemented by more integrated, consolidated, and differentiated value chains characterized by higher levels
            of investment (e.g., in cold chains to maintain the quality and safety of high value perishable foods) (Reardon
            et al. 2014). Modern agro-food systems emerge which combine primary production, manufacturing and an array
            of services. Such food systems are also increasingly integrated into the world market, through trade, inward and

                  situation in which agriculture as an economic activity and various forms of agribusiness differ little from other
                  sectors in terms of the productivity of labor and capital.

                  The World Development Report 2008 classiﬁed different countries into ﬁve categories based on the share of
                  agriculture in national GDP and employment: “ag-based, pre-transition, transition, urbanizing, and mature.”
                  For ag-based countries, the focus of policy attention has tended to be improving basic rural infrastructure; and
                  raising output and productivity through opening up new agricultural areas and increasing the use of so-called modern
                  inputs. Primary goals tend to relate to assuring food security, reducing rural poverty, and contributing to a country’s
                  trade balance. For pre-transition countries, these goals are supplemented with efforts to support agricultural
                  diversiﬁcation and increase private investment. For transition and urbanizing countries, greater attention is given
                  to multi-sectoral concerns or opportunities, including nutritional outcomes, food safety, competitiveness, and
                  reducing agriculture’s environmental footprint. Safety nets tend to replace the physical supply of food to the poor.

                  (World Development Indicators). How rapidly this
                  trend continues will mostly be determined outside the agricultural sector—notably by the growth of services, and
                  by the growth and labor-intensiveness of manufacturing. The contrasting experiences of other countries in the
                  region is instructive. In China, the agricultural sector accounted for a similar share of employment (47 percent) in
                  2004, yet by 2011, its share in employment had fallen to 35 percent. In contrast, it took two decades (from 1993
                  to 2012) for agriculture’s share in employment to fall from 46 to 32 percent in the Philippines. Slow change is also
                  evident in Thailand where the share of agriculture in employment fell only from 46 to 40 percent between 2001 and
                  2012. Outside of the region, Turkey nearly halved its agricultural employment share (from 47 to 24 percent) over the
                  two decade period from 1990 to 2010.

                  As shown in Figure 4, the share of agriculture in Vietnamese GDP and trade has been relatively ﬂat since the
                  mid-2000s. In 2005–2006 the sector’s GDP share was 19 percent while over the 2011–2013 period, it averaged
                  19.4 percent. Within East and Southeast Asia, the only other country which experienced an increase in agriculture’s
                  share of GDP during this period was Thailand (from 10.6 to 12.9 percent). For Vietnam, agriculture’s steady share

            Changes in Agricultural Employment and Rural Incomes

            The share of agriculture in employment is declining. The transformation from farm to non-farm activities at
            the household level is reﬂected in households’ income structure. The share of income from agriculture (including
            forestry and ﬁshery) in household income nationally country declined from 28.6 percent in 2002 to 19.9 percent in
            2012. For rural households only, primary agriculture’s income share fell from 43.4 percent in 2002 to 31.8 percent
            in 2012, having been overtaken in proportion by
            “salaries and wages” in 2010. These shares are drawn       Table 1: Proportion of Income Earned from Different

            patterns of rural income diversiﬁcation over the past
            decade.

            The pace of this shift in income sources has, however, varied substantially across the country. The most
            signiﬁcant declines have occurred in the Red River Delta, the northern mountainous areas, and the North Central
            Coast. There has been much less change elsewhere, with agriculture remaining the leading income source in the
            Mekong Delta and Central Highlands, both in rural and in urban households (Figure 5). The degree of change in the
            structure of rural households’ income reﬂects factors such as landholding size, education, and proximity to urban
            centers.

            The role of agriculture is thus taking on a different and changing shape in different parts of the country. In
            much of the Central Highlands, agriculture continues to account for the largest share of GDP and employment and

                     Box 1: Diversiﬁcation of Rural Livelihoods

                     Vietnamese households are increasingly relying on non-farm and even non-agricultural sources of income. A striking
                     statistic is that nearly 50 percent of households involved only in agriculture in 2008 had diversiﬁed into another
                     economic activity in 2010. These activities included waged labor and non-farm enterprise (Table 2). Between 2008 and
                     2014, waged employment grew as a source of household income, even as agricultural activities declined. Enterprise

                     suggests that this phenomenon (of diversiﬁcation) is primarily being driven by income opportunities. Low household
                     income, and having experienced an income shock, appear to be the strongest predictors of transition out of agriculture

                  Elsewhere the picture is more diverse, even within regions. In the Mekong Delta, for example, fewer and fewer
                  households can continue to earn a livelihood from intensive rice monoculture—even though yields have continued
                  to improve over time. A 2009 survey found that in traditionally rice-growing areas, households with landholdings of
                  less than 1 hectare earned the largest proportion of their income from non-farm (and especially non-agricultural)
                  sources (Table 3). Households with between 1 and 3 hectares relied evenly on paddy sales, animal product sales,

                  Survey data also reveal that, on average, diversiﬁcation away from agriculture has been welfare enhancing, and that
                  household enterprise activities have been among the most economically beneﬁcial to households. Non-farm work has,
                  according to several studies, been associated with higher per capita consumption as well as lower vulnerability to
                  shocks, especially for those participating in skilled employment (Imai et al. 2015, Hoang et al. 2014). A reduction in
                  farm-work due to an increase in non-farm work, interestingly, has not translated into less agricultural income (Hoang et
                  al. 2014). At the same time, non-farm employment has seemingly widened the non-farm income gap between rich and
                  poor households (Development Analysis Network 2003).
                  These ﬁndings are generally consistent with the literature on income diversiﬁcation, which shows that it is positively
                  correlated with income and wealth, but can be associated with greater inequality. This is generally explained by the
                  fact that better-off families are generally better able to engage in high return activities than those that are worse off.
                  And this pattern tends to be more pronounced when diversiﬁcation is spurred by push factors such as shocks or survival
                  (Newman and Kinghan 2015).

            two has remained relatively steady (Table 4). The household income gap is also widening within rural areas. In

                        Box 2: Migration and Remittances

                        A very high percentage of Vietnam’s population is made up of domestic migrants, deﬁned as people who have moved
                        within or between provinces. Vietnam’s 2009 census found that 8.5 percent of the population met this deﬁnition (split
                        almost evenly between inter- and intra-provincial migrants), and the government expected the percentage of migrants
                        to continue rising (this and the remainder of the box is based on Narciso 2015). This trend has been ongoing since Doi
                        Moi took effect in the late 1980s, prompting many Vietnamese to seek economic opportunity in cities or faster growing
                        areas of the country. More recent data from the 2012 and 2014 Vietnam Access to Resources Household Survey (VARHS),
                        a rural household survey covering 12 provinces, also provide evidence of signiﬁcant domestic migration.
                        Around 20 percent of surveyed households counted at least one migrant, and 48 percent of those migrants had left to
                        work (while others left for education, family reuniﬁcation, or military duty). In certain provinces, the percentage of
                        migrant households with at least one person living elsewhere (permanently or temporarily) was a good deal higher, at
                        47 percent in Nghe An, and 27–28 percent in Quang Nam, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, and Lam Dong (though a smaller portion of
                        these migrants left these provinces for work purposes). Overall, 73 percent of the migrants in the 2014 sample moved to
                        a different province, 47 percent headed to the heavily urban provinces of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh, and 10 percent moved
                        abroad (a large increase from less than 1 percent crossing national borders in 2012).
                        On average, migrant households, and particularly working migrant households, seem to be better-off than other
                        households, judging from 2014 food expenditure and net income levels reported in the VARHS survey—whether this
                        is a cause or effect of migration, or both. Remittances may offer a partial explanation, as migration is often but not
                        systematically a source of remittances for the members of the household that stayed behind. In 2012 and 2014, for
                        example, 26 percent and 45 percent of surveyed migrant households received remittances respectively.
                        Remittance-receiving households, according to the VARHS, use most of their remittance money for daily consumption and
                        bills (45–55 percent on average), over 10 percent for savings (11–15 percent), and the remainder for special occasions
                        and medical and educational expenses. Of note, a portion of working migrants are also recipients of transfers—7 and
                        14 percent in 2012 and 2014 respectively—highlighting their possible vulnerability.
                        Migration is not strongly correlated with natural or economic shocks (exposure to these did not consistently differ
                        between migrant and non-migrant households at a statistically signiﬁcant level, though there was a signiﬁcant difference
                                                                                                                                                               Continued to next page.

                  in exposure to natural shocks in 2012). However, migration does seem to help households cope with shocks—speciﬁcally
                  to maintain per capita food expenditures—at least when the purpose of migration is to work. This is consistent with
                  recent literature on migration that has found it to correspond most closely, at times, to a strategy of income risk
                  diversiﬁcation within households, particularly when it involves household members moving to another labor market.
                  Earlier literature on migration attributed domestic, rural to urban migration primarily to wage differentials between the
                  place of origin and the destination (Harris and Todaro 1970), and to factors such as income uncertainty and relative
                  deprivation (Stark 1991).




            Changes in Agricultural Land-use and the Structure of Production

            Vietnam’s agricultural land-use reﬂects the historical importance of and dominant policy and public investment
            attention to rice, together with the agricultural sector’s response to international market opportunities
            from the mid-1990s onward. Despite the conversion of an estimated 700,000 hectares from agricultural to non-
            agricultural uses (i.e., industry, hydropower, urban development), the total area under agriculture has grown nearly
            15 percent since 2000. Over the 2001–2003 period, this land area averaged 8.9 million hectares, while over the
            2011–2013 period it averaged 10.2 million hectares (GSO statistics).

            During this period, the area under paddy rice changed very little, remaining in a range between 4 and
            4.2 million hectares. Even so, due to double or even triple cropping in some areas, the total harvested area for
            rice increased by an average of 1.7 percent per year between 2000 and 2010.1 The harvested area for rice has thus
            exceeded 7.5 million hectares in some years. The area under other annual crops grew little in the period up through
            the mid-2000s, but increased plantings have occurred in recent years, especially for maize and cassava. Other
            annual crops went from covering around 2 million hectares in the early 2000s to occupying around 2.3 million
            hectares in the 2011–2013 period.

            Still, the biggest change in land-use has had little to do with changes in the domestic market. The planted
            area for perennial crops has increased by about 7 percent per year, from 2.2 million hectares in the early 2000s to
            3.8 million hectares in 2011–2013. This category includes many crops and the most sizeable expansion has occurred
            for coffee and rubber. The area under aquaculture grew rapidly during the 1990s and until the mid-2000s, and has
            since stabilized near 1 million hectares. As further discussed below, this agricultural expansion—mostly geared
            toward exports—has come at considerable environmental cost. In upland areas for example, the expansion of coffee
            plantings, and more recently of rubber and cassava, has cut into natural forest and contributed to biodiversity
            loss and land degradation. The major expansion in shrimp aquaculture in the 1990s and early 2000s both replaced
            paddy-land and contributed to the destruction of nearly half of the Mekong Delta’s mangrove forests (Nair 2015).

            At a macro level, food crop diversiﬁcation has just begun in Vietnam. Rice remains completely dominant even
            though, as we will see later, signiﬁcant changes have already begun in food consumption and expenditure patterns.

            1      In the Mekong Delta, the average crop intensity rose from 1.6 in 1990 to 1.91 in 2000 to 2.10 in 2010. While only 11 percent of the paddy-land was triple cropped in 2000,
                   by 2010, this was 27 percent. While certainly increasing aggregate production, the expansion of the ‘third rice crop’ has had severe environmental implications. Disrupting the
                   natural ﬂood restricts the transfer of nutrients and normal cleansing effects, leading farmers to use even more fertilizers and pesticides.

                  Crop diversiﬁcation has been constrained by land-use policies—whereby much of the irrigated lowland areas have
                  been designated as rice-land, with restrictions placed on alternative uses. Nationally, some 90 percent of paddy
                  cultivation takes place on such designated land (Gisseke et al. 2013). Most of Vietnam’s expansion of irrigation and
                  a high proportion of its public research and advisory service resources have, over the years, been geared toward
                  maximizing national or provincial rice output.

                  Figure 7 contrasts the patterns of land-use since 1990 for food crops between China and Vietnam. Chinese
                  production has greatly shifted in response to market opportunities, at home and abroad. Between 1990 and 2010,
                  the area there under fruits and vegetables grew from 15 to 40 million hectares. Since 2000, the area harvested
                  for maize has gone from 22 to 33 million hectares. Vietnam is at a much earlier stage in this process of food crop
                  diversiﬁcation. It has only recently recognized the need and opportunity, and begun to shift public resources to
                  support the production and marketing of other food crops.

                  Agricultural production in Vietnam is undertaken by different types of production units. The agricultural
                  census recognizes the following categories.

                       x “Agricultural” households which numbered 8.9 million in 2011, down from 10.1 million in 2001.2
                       x “Farms” which number 126,000 in 2011, up from 61,000 in 2001.
                       x “Agricultural Enterprises” which numbered 2,536 in 2011, up from 2,136 in 2001. While most of these enter-
                         prises are private sector,nearly two-thirds of the capital invested is accounted for by majority or wholly state-
                         owned entities. Production cooperatives, numbering 6065 in 2011, down from 7,237 in 2001.
                       x Other entities, including farms managed by Commune People’s Committee, other domestic agencies, and foreign
                         individuals/companies.

                  Nearly 90 percent of agricultural land falls under either agricultural households or farms, about 6 percent
                  under the enterprises, and the balance is held by other entities. The agricultural household segment is
                  2        There are also ﬁshery households (which numbered 617,000 in 2011) and forestry households which numbered 52,000.

            dominated by very small farms. Figure 8, based on agricultural census data, suggests only minor changes over time
            in this agrarian structure. The smallest size category—less than 0.2 hectares—applied to 26 percent of households
            in 2001 and 35 percent in 2011. This was likely due to further sub-division of holdings in the next category
            up—0.2–0.5 hectares—whose share declined from 41 percent to 34 percent. The share of the largest category of
            holdings-above 2 hectares—increased only slightly from 5 to just over 6 percent.

            In many contexts, researchers have found very small farms to be highly efﬁcient—in terms of obtaining high
            levels out output per units of land and other resources. For some crops, research has found either an inverse
            relationship between farm size and efﬁciency or some type of inverted U-curve whereby efﬁciency is improved over
            some (often small) farm-size increment but then declines thereafter. However, this notion that small is beautiful
            doesn’t take into account the capacity of farm operators to manage risks, the livelihood viability of households
            dependent for income on very small landholdings, and the transaction costs associated with aggregating the supply
            of large numbers of very small farmers for sale to the market.

            In Vietnam’s case, small farms are often rendered less efﬁcient by the fragmented nature of their landholdings,
            or in other words, the fact that they are often made up of non-contiguous plots. In many locations, farmland was
            allocated to community members in an egalitarian way. The highest quality land was allocated among households
            as was the land of lesser or even marginal quality. As a result, small household landholdings often consist of three,
            four, or many more tiny plots, sometimes separated by considerable distance. This has affected the efﬁciency of
            household farm labor and management. The degree of land fragmentation has differed among areas due to particular
            features of terrain, population density, land allocation, and historical and cultural factors. In general, fragmentation
            has been much greater in the Red River Delta and northern mountainous areas than elsewhere. Fragmentation is
            greater for annual crop land rather than land used for forestry, perennial crops or aquaculture.

            The government of Vietnam has aimed to reduce land fragmentation by implementing land consolidation
            programs in many communes. Such programs have generally tried to facilitate plot exchanges between households,
            although there have also been efforts to promote cooperative farming. In some cases, households have leased out
            their land to companies and arranged for certain household members to continue working on these professionally

                  managed farms. These programs have had some effect, especially in the Red River Delta.3 Nationally, the average
                  number of plots per household has fallen from 4.27 in 2004 to 2.83 in 2014 (Brandt 2015). Still, land fragmentation
                  remains a considerable constraint on agricultural modernization. In most parts of the country, a land rental market
                  remains underdeveloped due to limits or restrictions on land holding sizes and uses, high transaction costs in land
                  transfers, and the administrative setting of land price values by provincial bodies. Nevertheless, the recent experience
                  of China suggest that a more concerted policy drive can, in fact, accelerate processes of land consolidation in a
                  farming system akin to that of Vietnam (see Box 3).



                      Box 3: Recent Land Consolidation in China

                      From the 1980s to the mid-2000s, China experienced a decline in the average farmland holding size as a result of rural
                      population growth and the conversion of a considerable amount of farmland to urban and industrial uses. Since then,
                      however, a process of land consolidation has occurred in several parts of the country. This has been driven by rising labor
                      costs and out-migration and been facilitated by: (i) the emergence of local government land transfer services (providing
                      information, contract design, and dispute settlement services); (ii) policy support in the forms of loan guarantees and
                      subsidies for larger farm investments; and (iii) the emergence of an active market in mechanization services.
                      Huang and Ding (2015) report that in 2013, some 53 million rural households (23 percent of the total) had rented out
                      some agricultural land. Their survey in Northeast and Northern China points to a remarkable increase in the average farm
                      holding from 1.03 hectares in 2008 to 1.73 hectares in 2013. In parallel with this expansion in the size of household
                      farms, a growing number of land cooperatives and company run farms have emerged. These have an average of around
                      200 hectares and 100 hectares respectively and accounted for an estimated 20 percent of the total agricultural land area
                      in these regions in 2013, up from a negligible share only six years earlier.




                  How does Vietnam’s agrarian structure compare with that of other Southeast Asian countries? Vietnam has
                  only 0.34 hectares of arable per member of its agriculturally active population. This is about half (0.6 to 0.8 times)
                  that in Cambodia, Myanmar, or Philippines. The agrarian structure of Vietnam is most like that of Indonesia. There,
                  about 30 percent of farm households have less than 0.2 hectares, 26 percent have between 0.2 and 0.5 hectares,
                  18 percent between 0.5 and 1 hectares, 15 percent between 1 and 2 ha and 12 percent more than 2 hectares.
                  Large plantations account for the majority of Indonesia’s oil palm and rubber production. At the national level,
                  Thailand has seen little change in the proportion of farms in different size categories and has many more medium-
                  sized smallholdings. In 2013, about 25 percent of farms were less than 1 hectare, 40 percent were between 1 and
                  3 hectares, and 35 percent were larger than 3 hectares. The latter accounted for some 70 percent of the total farmed
                  area. Myanmar has an unusual agrarian structure as 40 percent or more of rural households there are landless. Of the
                  households which do have land, the average holding is 1.6 hectares and the distribution is more or less evenly split
                  between farms of less than 1 hectare, farms of 1–2 hectares, and farms that are larger than 2 hectares.

                  This national picture of Vietnam’s agrarian structure masks some signiﬁcant regional contrasts. In the Red
                  River Delta for example, 97 percent of holdings in 2011 were under 0.5 hectares, and these holdings typically
                  consisted of multiple (3 to 7) plots of roughly similar size or quality under management. Only 0.1 percent of
                  agricultural holdings are larger than 2 hectares in the Red River Delta. Contrast this situation with that of the
                  3    Since 2008, some 15 percent of all plots in the Red River Delta were consolidated. Elsewhere, this process has been negligible, affecting 7 percent of plots in the North and
                       Central Coastal areas and less than 1 percent elsewhere.

Central Highlands where 23 percent of households have more than 2 hectares—and more holdings are of this size
than under 0.5 hectares (21 percent)—although these land holdings vary in quality (i.e., due to differences in
soil, elevation, and access to water). In the Mekong Delta, more than 10 percent of land holdings are larger than
2 hectares in the Mekong Delta, and 23 percent fall in this category in the Southeast.

Across Vietnam the number of households producing paddy has changed little since the mid-2000s. Strangely,
this number, 9.3 million, is greater than the number of households classiﬁed as agricultural households. This implies
that at least some non-agricultural households grow at least small plots of paddy. Nationally, the average size of a
paddy holding is only 0.44 hectares, yet in the Mekong Delta the average paddy holding is 1.2 hectares with more
than 13 percent of these being above 2 hectares in size.

Rice production in Vietnam appears to be highly                                       Figure 9: Concentration of Rice Surplus in Six Mekong Delta

commercial production. Since 2000, the Mekong
Delta has accounted for two-thirds of the growth in
national rice production, and most of this growth
has taken place in some 20 districts—what might be
called “the core rice belt” (see Figure 9). While some
1.4 million households grew paddy in 2008, two-thirds
of the net surplus (i.e., paddy sales minus purchases
of rice in paddy equivalents) were produced by the top
20 percent of growers4 (whose average landholding
was 2.74 hectares). Some 85 percent of the surplus
was accounted for by the top two quintiles. These
statistics reﬂect a trend toward greater concentration
in commercial rice production. Of the 9 million rice-
growing households, about 300,000 households
account for most of the country’s exports. This makes
the challenge of promoting competitiveness and value-                                 Source: Jaffee et al. 2012 b.

The national-level picture when it comes to livestock
production is also one of fragmentation, yet there are
initial signs here too of a move toward consolidation. The number of pig producing households declined from
7.7 million in 2001 to 4.1 million in 2011, in part due to government efforts to move livestock production and
slaughter away from cities to reduce disease (livestock and human), improve food safety, and mitigate environmental
risks.5 More than half of the remaining producers only have one or two pigs and essentially keep these for their own
consumption on important events or to sell them in case of a cash emergency.

                  Commercial production looks different. Since the mid-2000s, the number of households raising fewer than 10 pigs
                  has declined by 39 percent while the number raising 50 or more pigs has increased by 80 percent.6 A similar pattern
                  is being observed in the poultry sector: a continued predominance of small, backyard growers (in number), yet an
                  emergence of more medium- and large-size operations, some of which involve contract farming arrangements with
                  feed-production-processing integrators.

                  Most of the expansion of livestock production is occurring in medium- and large-size farms. The number of
                  such farms active in livestock production rose from under 2000 in 2001 to 23,500 in 2011. In that latter year, nearly
                  half of these farms were raising more than 200 pigs, whereas only 11 percent were raising that many ﬁve years
                  earlier. Milk production in Vietnam has tended to involve farmers—with a few to maybe a dozen cows—working
                  together as a group to interface with buyers. In the past ﬁve years however multiple very large investments have
                  gone into integrated feed production, dairy cow operations, and modern milk processing facilities. These operations
                  are managing from 10,000 to 40,000 cows. While some successful smallholder dairy groups remain, the bulk of
                  Vietnam’s milk production is likely to come from these large, vertically integrated operations located in the Central
                  Coast and some midland areas.

                  A similar process of consolidation has occurred over the past few years in parts of the aquaculture sector and
                  especially in the production of Pangasius. There were tens of thousands of aquaculture producers in the mid-to-
                  late 2000s, but problems with water quality management and disease, and adverse movements in the ﬁsh-to-feed
                  price ratio, have driven many small growers out of the sector—some by leasing their land and ponds to larger
                  producers. Today, an estimated 70 percent of Pangasius is raised by processing companies with vertically integrated
                  operations (up from only 10 percent ﬁve years prior).

                  Consolidation is also under way though has been less pronounced in other parts of the aquaculture sector.
                  There were still 1.7 million households raising ﬁsh in 2011, although 75 percent of these were producing for
                  themselves or their community on 0.2 hectares or less. An estimated 320,000 households and farms remain active in
                  the Mekong Delta shrimp aquaculture industry, either on an intensive or extensive basis. That said, shrimp-growing
                  and processing are becoming increasingly integrated there. Overall, the number of farms now active in shrimp
                  aquaculture has remained relatively ﬂat, but most are moving to scale: at the time of writing, only 10 percent of
                  these having less than 3 hectares.

                  Most perennial crop production is dominated by smallholder households. In many parts of the country,
                  households raise small clusters of fruit and special purpose trees (e.g., for incense and medicinal uses). Export-
                  oriented production of coffee, black pepper, and cashews is most prominent in the Southeast and the Central
                  Highlands, where some 20 percent of growers have more than 2 hectares planted and the average planting is
                  one hectare-wide. The 2011 agricultural census recorded more than 640,000 smallholder coffee growers and some
                  430,000 cashew growers. Some 25,000 medium or large farms grow perennial crops, the production of which exhibits
                  a clear trend toward concentration. While in 2006 some 31 percent of these had plantings of less 3 hectares and
                  only 14 percent had plantings of more than 10 hectares, by 2011 less than 5 percent farms were in the small-size
                  category and 37 percent had more than 10 hectares. Vietnamese rubber production is now more or less evenly split
                  between several thousand smallholders on the one hand, and a small number of state-owned enterprises on the
                  other.
                  6   According to the 2011 Agrocensus, 50 percent of pork is from farms with <20 pigs, 23 percent from farms that have 20–100 pigs and 17 percent from farms with >100 pigs.
                      Thus, nearly one-ﬁfth of pork production is supplied by <1 percent of the farms.

                  in which rice consumption continues to decline before leveling off—by around 2030—in the range of 90 to 110 kg
                  per capita.9

                  Vietnam is now in the early stages of major changes in the structure of food consumption, and in both food
                  spending and food shopping patterns. The past decade has seen very high levels of growth in the consumption
                  of meat (especially pork), milk, and eggs—growth rates higher than those experienced by any country in the
                  region. Signiﬁcant growth has also occurred in the consumption of ﬁsh and of certain processed foods. Somewhat
                  surprisingly for an emerging, middle-income country, Vietnam has seen little change in the consumption of fruits
                  and vegetables. Dietary diversity is growing, although Vietnam still has a way to go to catch up with some of its
                  peers.10

                  Changing consumption is translating into big changes in food spending patterns. And differences in this respect
                  have been more pronounced between urban and rural populations than between rich and poor. Between 2002 and
                  2012, Vietnamese household expenditures on food rose by 51 percent in real terms; and whereas the growth in
                  food expenditures differed little across income quintiles, food expenditures by rural households rose by 53 percent
                  while those for urban households rose by 41 percent. More interesting is the changing composition of expenditures.
                  Comparing these two years, absolute spending on rice declined (by 4 percent) and household spending on animal
                  products—meat and dairy products—doubled.

                  Figure 10, based on analysis by Vietnam’s Institute for Policy and Strategy for Agriculture and Rural
                  Development (IPSARD), illustrates the changing shares of different food categories in the food expenditures
                  of urban and rural households. Among urban households, the share of rice fell from 25 percent in 2002 to
                  17.2 percent in 2012, while that of animal products went from 32.7 percent to 37.8 percent. Among rural households,
                  the share of rice fell from 38.9 percent to 25.4 percent while the share of animal products rose from 23.4 percent

            spending on these increased. This shift in spending from (staple) cereals to high protein, higher-value, and more
            processed foods is a pattern that is being observed more broadly across much of East and Southeast Asia (Jamora
            and Labaste 2015). For example, amongst Indonesia’s urban population, between 2001 and 2013 for example,
            Indonesia’s urban population went from spending 17 percent to 31 percent of its food budget on processed foods,
            while its spending on cereals fell from 18 percent to 12 percent. The region’s long-term shift from a diet dominated
            by cereals to one that is far more diversiﬁed is illustrated in Figure 11.

            Why are the shifts in food consumption and
            expenditure patterns so signiﬁcant? These have
            multiple implications.

            These consumption shifts alter the food security equation and policy agenda. These have long been focused
            on rice and especially on the expansion of national, regional, and provincial rice production.11 Today’s situation is
            now one of a food secure nation, with spatial and household pockets of food insecurity associated primarily with
            poverty (or losses from extreme weather events). While a signiﬁcant number of households will continue to grow
            paddy for their own consumption rice will remain a very important food staple, the affordability of food for most
            households will increasingly become a function of the price of other foods. In the coming years for example, food
            security concerns are likely to be increasingly tied to the cost and availability of animal feed and the performance of
            a livestock sector now going through a major restructuring. “Feed security” may become an increasingly important
            issue (see Figure 13). Vietnamese food policy will need to become more multi-dimensional and incorporate greater
            consideration for goals associated with nutritional outcomes rather than agricultural outputs.12




            11    While the 2009 Decree adopted the FAO’s very broad deﬁnition of food security to embrace goals related to dietary diversity, nutrition, and food quality, the listed ‘solutions’
                  were largely related to rice production.
            12    Over the past two decades Vietnam has made remarkable gains in reducing malnutrition, among children and among the population as a whole. Still, rates of chronic child
                  malnutrition remain high (>30 percent) in many upland ethnic minority communities and nutritional imbalances are found in other segments of the population. Solutions to
                  the existing nutritional challenges do not rest on producing more rice. Rather, they require multi-sectoral approaches to raise incomes, improve maternal health, improve water
                  and sanitation, and foster a more ‘nutrition-sensitive’ agriculture (World Bank 2013).

                  Vietnam has a policy of protecting rice-land that places restrictions on its agricultural uses and its conversion
                  to alternative uses. Farmers holding rice-land have been required to grow at least one rice crop during the year,
                  and many irrigation systems have been designed and managed to support second and third rice crops. In the
                  absence of effective drainage, farmers have faced difﬁculties introducing rotation crops which otherwise might be
                  more proﬁtable, help to maintain soil fertility, and interrupt cycles of pest and disease. To the extent that food
                  security (and improved nutrition) now calls for crop diversiﬁcation or different forms of specialization, the rice-land
                  designation and associated restrictions are becoming as much a barrier to food security as a basis for its protection.
                  Recognizing this, Vietnam’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has called for the conversion of
                  some 200,000 hectares of land from paddy production to maize and other crops. And Decree 35, released in February
                  2015, enhanced the ﬂexibility of rice-land with a provision rice-land under which it can more easily be put to
                  alternative agricultural uses, including the cultivation of other seasonal crops and aquaculture. This is likely just the
                  beginning of a major reform to come with respect to the governance of agricultural land-use.

                  A joint IPSARD/World Bank analysis in 2010 (Jaffee et al. 2010) modeled a range of scenarios for Vietnam’s rice
                  consumption and production to 2030 (see Box 4). It found that even if the dedicated paddy-land were to decline
                  by 20 to 25 percent (from 4.0 million hectares to 3.0–3.2 million hectares), there would still remain a comfortable
                  exportable surplus of between three and six million tons. Figure 14 shows that, even under pessimistic assumptions,
                  Vietnam would generate a rice surplus—or in other words, it would produce more domestically than is consumed as
                  food or feed, or used for seed—even if rice plantings fell to 2.5 million hectares.

                  The shifts in consumption put a premium on improving food safety management and managing animal health
                  risks. These will become increasingly important not only to protect consumers but also to ensure the competitiveness
                  of the domestic agro-food system. With urbanization come longer supply chains. With increasing consumption of
                  high-value perishables come greater risks associated with food contamination, chemical and antibiotic residues,
                  and the transmission of zoonotic diseases. With processed foods, it is often not possible to judge quality and
                  safety by taste or other sensory tools, and so consumers tend to focus on certain brands that they come to trust.

                  Box 4: A Robust Rice Surplus

                  In 2010, IPSARD together with the World Bank carried out a detailed analysis examining how Vietnam’s rice surplus would
                  fare under alternative scenarios through 2030. The study looked speciﬁcally at different scenarios for rice production,
                  rice consumption, and the resulting “rice balance,” (i.e., rice deﬁcit or surplus) with consideration for a wide range of
                  variables. These included population growth and composition, per capita rice consumption, demand for rice for seed,
                  feed, and industrial uses, rice-land use and cropping intensity (i.e., number of crops per year), productivity, and both
                  harvest-related and post-harvest losses. National time series data on these and other selected variables were gathered
                  for the years 1990 through 2010.
                  Scenarios were then developed for the next two decades. Given the large number of variables and possible combinations
                  of these, some simplifying assumptions were made and a more limited set of scenarios were generated. For example, only
                  one (United Nations) estimate of future population growth (1.2 percent per annum) was used. For cropping intensity,
                  the conservative estimate of 1.8 was used based on the expectation that more crop or rice-aquaculture rotations will
                  be introduced over time in the Mekong Delta. (Cropping intensity has increased over the years and in 2010 was 1.82
                  nationally and 2.09 in the Mekong Delta.) Recent estimates of seed- and feed-use were retained even though, in future
                  years, one would expect some decline as farmers make increasingly efﬁcient use of increasingly high quality seed, and
                  feed conversion efﬁciency improves.
                  With regard to productivity, three scenarios were considered.
                    x The ﬁrst is a “business-as-usual” scenario in which rice yields continue to improve at the recently (slower) pace of
                      1.5 percent between now and 2030. This would bring the average national yield to 7 tons per hectare at the end of
                      the period. The other two productivity scenarios are pessimistic in relation to the historical trend.
                                                                                                                          Continued to next page.




            If consumers, with rising incomes, come to distrust the safety of domestic fresh products or processed foods, then
            they will turn to imported products. Once domestic supply chains have lost out to imports, inertia in consumer
            behavior can make it very difﬁcult for domestic retailers to build backward linkages and substitute imports.

            Vietnam has recognized these emerging challenges. Its new Food Safety Law of 2010 introduced the concept of
            risk-based control. Public laboratories have since been upgraded, and the country now has the capacity to test for
            most foodborne pathogens. The law streamlined institutional structures by reducing the number of ministries in
            charge of food safety from the previous six to the current three. However, the most control and testing is focused
            on ﬁnal products and very little testing occurs higher up in the value chain with a focus on raw materials, soil, or
            water for instance. It is also not clear yet how testing and inspection results are used in decision-making. The public
            ﬁnancial and human resources devoted to food safety matters are still limited. Major capacity strengthening needs
            remain, and greater collaboration with the private sector and with consumers to “co-manage” food safety could pay
            off.

            Vietnam has experienced many signiﬁcant animal disease outbreaks in recent years, affecting farm
            productivity, consumer prices for animal products, and overall consumer conﬁdence—as one of the responses
            to disease outbreaks has been to increase the use of antibiotics in production. Signiﬁcant losses have occurred
            due to disease in poultry and pig operations, and in shrimp aquaculture. While emergency responses have sometimes
            been effective (e.g., in controlling the spread avian inﬂuenza), greater attention and resources need to be devoted
            to promoting good practices in animal husbandry and aquaculture, and to improving disease surveillance and early
            warning systems.

                     Box 4 continued.

                        x Under one of these, the “middle yield” scenario, yield growth slows progressively throughout the studied period,
                          bringing the average rice yield to 6.3 tons per hectare by 2030. While in the past, yields tended to increase by
                          1 ton per hectare per decade, this projection has the 1 ton increment occurring only over two decades. Some of the
                          leading rice-growing areas in the Mekong Delta already have yields exceeding this longer-term projection.
                        x The most pessimistic, “low yield” scenario features slowing yield growth followed by an actual decline in yields from
                          2025 onward. This might occur if the actual adverse impacts of climate change were to exceed current expectations,
                          resulting perhaps in more rainfall or temperature variation and unusually severe pest or disease problems. Under
                          this scenario, average national yields are 5.8 tons per hectare in 2030. This level of productivity is below the
                          current productivity of the ﬁve to six provinces which now account for the bulk of paddy production in the Mekong
                          Delta. It is thus quite a pessimistic picture and essentially assumes that near-term efforts to improve irrigation
                          management, to promote the use of higher quality seed, and to develop and spread the use of seed varieties more
                          resistant to water stresses and pests, collectively fail. This scenario is also far worse than any predicted by recent
                          climate change-impact modeling exercises.
                     Figure 14 shows the national rice surplus that can be expected under this worst case (“low yield”) scenario according
                     to how much land is devoted to rice production. In recent years, the actual amount of land used to produce rice was
                     just over 4 million hectares. On the consumption side, the chart reﬂects a scenario in which annual per capita rice
                     consumption falls to 100 kg. What this set of results demonstrates is Vietnam’s very strong “rice balance” position going
                     forward. Vietnam can expect to generate a comfortable and exportable rice surplus even if the land-area dedicated to
                     paddy falls by 25 percent to 3 million hectares, and very pessimistic scenarios play out in relation to average rice yields.



                  Changing consumer demand will open up greater opportunities in the non-farm segments of the food system.
                  Demand will grow for safer and better performing agricultural inputs, for more specialized agricultural advisory and
                  conformity assessment services, for machinery which increases post-harvest productivity, for effective cold chain
                  services, and for improved food distribution and consumer services. A more diversiﬁed primary agriculture allows for
                  greater variations in processed and prepared foods and in a range of other agro-industries.

                  Elsewhere in Asia, rising incomes, urbanization, and shifting consumer tastes have given rise to the emergence
                  of supermarkets and other mass-retail, grocery store formats. A number of changes in product sourcing have
                  accompanied this process to better ensure reliable delivery and compliance with quality and food safety standards.
                  Modern retail distribution has emerged only quite recently in Vietnam due to a combination of reasons which help
                  to explain the relatively high costs and risks associated with developing multi-chain operations in Vietnam (i.e.,
                  fragmented primary and secondary production, logistical constraints, overall business environment uncertainties,
                  and so forth) (see Figure 15). Most Vietnamese consumers continue to make the bulk of their purchases in open air
                  wet markets, yet, at least in major cities, shopping patterns are beginning to change. Mass-market grocery sales—
                  through a combination of hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores—are estimated to have doubled
                  from VND 64 trillion in 2005 to VND 138 trillion in 2013, bringing the latter to account for an estimated 15 percent
                  of total food sales. Both international and domestic companies are increasing investment in one or a combination
                  of different retail formats and extending this retail modernization beyond Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to the center
                  of the country.

                  Changes in demand will lead to a broader change in the structural composition of agriculture-related GDP. As
                  seen in many other middle-income countries as food consumption and expenditures shift to higher-value and more
                  processed foods, the GDP share of the post-farm segments of the agro-food system may increase and come to account

            for a higher proportion of GDP than primary agriculture. We might call this the agro-industrial or agribusiness
            transition. This transition has begun to happen in Vietnam, yet as Figure 16 shows, we might expect agro-industrial
            and other agribusiness services to come to account for double or more of a (declining) primary agricultural GDP
            in the coming decade as incomes continue to grow and food consumption patterns change further. Since the mid-
            2000s, growth in domestic sales of snacks, processed foods, and even ready-to-eat foods has accelerated. With
            the domestic food processing sector consisting mainly of very small companies, a signiﬁcant part of the recent
            growth has corresponded to sales of imported goods and locally-produced foreign brands which are perceived to
            be of higher quality.13 One recent study (BMI 2015) ranked Vietnam 8th out of 14 Asian countries in terms of its
            overall attractiveness for food and beverage investment, yet ranked the country 1st in terms of the near-term upside
            potential given expected consumption patterns and existing opportunities for food industry consolidation.

            The shifts in consumption will inﬂuence Vietnam’s agro-food trade patterns and related attitudes. Recent
            national agricultural strategies have emphasized the role of exports as a driver of agricultural growth. Yet the
            growing domestic middle class and changing dietary preferences offer very signiﬁcant opportunities for Vietnamese
            farmers and SMEs. At the same time, the shift toward higher-value foods will likely result in increased agro-food
            imports by Vietnam. The rapid development of the animal protein sector has been fundamentally connected to
            imports—ﬁrst of powdered milk, now of dairy cows; and of a growing volume of animal (and aquaculture) feed
            and feed ingredients. Domestic dairy production is rising quickly, yet imported powdered milk still accounts for
            more than 60 percent of the product underwriting the explosive growth in domestic milk (and milk product)
            consumption. Some import substitution will be possible—especially in maize—yet it is unlikely to keep pace with
            domestic demand for animal feed. Nevertheless, all successful agro-food exporters are also food (and raw material)
            importers—a phenomenon that reﬂects the concentration of resources in areas where a country has a comparative
            advantage. Overall, Vietnam should maintain a very healthy food-trade balance longer-term. While some subsectors
            might face intense competitive pressures as Vietnam engages in trade liberalization as part of ASEAN and the Trans-
            Paciﬁc Partnership, an open trading environment will ultimately beneﬁt Vietnamese agriculture and food consumers.


            13        Industrial statistics show that in 2011, the respective shares of food product manufacturing was 10, 58, and 32 percent for SOEs, domestic companies, and foreign owned
                      companies, respectively. The share of beverages was more or less equally split among the three, with SOEs having a slightly larger share (Nguyen et al. 2014).

            Vietnam’s agricultural value-added grew at an average rate of 3.7 percent

With most of Vietnam’s best agricultural land being reserved, ofﬁcially, for paddy production, and with the
bulk of its irrigation capacity designed to support food security, the steady expansion of rice output (per
annum)—even in the face of weather variability—has served as the sector’s core stabilizing force. Between
1990 and 2010, national paddy production increased from 19.2 to 40 million tons. Two-thirds of this expansion took
place in the Mekong Delta. With advances in irrigation supporting a shift to double and triple cropping—Mekong
Delta paddy-land is now fully irrigated—the region experienced extremely low, year-on-year volatility in rice output,
and its growing surplus was exported (Jaffee et al. 2012b).

An important beneﬁt of the long-term expansion of Vietnam’s rice output has been the lower price that
Vietnamese consumers have faced for this staple compared to other consumers in the region (Figure 18).
Currently, Vietnamese consumers pay some of the lowest prices in the world for rice. Of the 47 locations around the
world covered by FAO’s Food Rice Market Monitor, Vietnam’s representative site, Dong Thap, had the second lowest
prices in the world (at $0.36/kg) in November 2014, trailing only Yangon, Myanmar. In that month, the average
national price in China ($0.98/kg) and the Philippines ($0.96/kg) were two and a half times higher while those in
South Korea ($2.11/kg) were nearly six times higher.

The stabilizing role of the agricultural sector, generally, and of the rice subsector in particular, has not
come without cost. It was and is not necessary for Vietnam to generate a rice surplus equivalent to 30 percent
of its production in order to achieve or maintain national food security.14 By the mid-2000s, a very comfortable
structural surplus had been achieved as a result of the sustained advance in production and a leveling off of con-
sumption— as a population with growing incomes began to turn to a more diverse diet. Nearly all of the 2000s’
increment in rice production from the Mekong Delta has gone for export, primarily in the lower-quality/lower-
price segment of the international market. Despite this, a policy of restricting alternative uses of designated rice-
land and focusing irrigation services on rice has persisted until very recently. The evidence suggests that this
continued concentration of resources has come at a high cost—to the sector, to many farming communities, and
to the country as whole.

In some ways, Vietnam has been a victim of its own success in achieving its food security targets. This has
been a drag on recent sector growth and has inhibited a more rapid process of structural transformation—both
within the sector and beyond. As Vietnam’s national level food security has gone from strength to strength, the
country’s agricultural growth rate has been decelerating. Between 1994 and 2000 the average rate of growth was
an impressive 4.5 percent per annum. Between 2001 and 2007 the average growth rate fell to 3.3 percent per
annum, and between 2008 and 2013 it fell further to 2.6 percent. In hindsight, an earlier pivoting of the coun-
try’s food security strategy toward a more diversiﬁed cropping and resource-use pattern would have been more
beneﬁcial for farmers, consumers, and agricultural workers. This has now been recognized and efforts have begun
to achieve a more balanced and efﬁcient use of resources. Decree 35, released in April 2015, eases the restric-
tions on paddy-land use, especially conversions to other short-term crops, and provides a stronger framework for
provincial and local initiatives to promote such conversions.



14   For 2010, Jaffee et al (2012) estimated that the level of rice exports was equivalent to 31.5 percent of the ‘rice available’, taking into account national paddy production,
     provisions for seed and feed, post-harvest losses, and rice grain out-turns from processing. Another 8 percent of the available rice was carried over as stock into the subsequent

            Within Vietnam’s agricultural sector, the pace and pattern of growth has varied considerably among different
            8.8 percent per annum, although as Figure 19 illustrates, the bulk of this growth took place in the period up through
            2007. Since then, capture ﬁsheries have had to contend with a partially depleted near-shore ﬁsheries resource-base
            (CIEM 2010), while the shrimp aquaculture industry has faced large losses of production, as it in 2012 and 2013,
            due to disease. The forestry subsector, featuring a mix of state-owned and private farms and processors, has long
            been an underperformer—both in terms
            of commercial development and natural         Figure 19: Annual Growth of Vietnamese Agricultural Subsectors,

            Livestock production also grew at an

            very small share of livestock value-added.
            Pork production accounts for some 70 percent of this subsector. That industry has recently experienced problems
            of disease, consumer concerns about feed additives and food safety, and a declining ratio of farm-gate prices to
            feed costs. While efforts are being made to relocate major elements of the livestock industry away from residen-
            tial areas to lower the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases, this relocation will take considerable time. Waste
            from a growing livestock sector represents a signiﬁcant human health risk. Some 80 million tons of livestock
            waste are discharged directly and indirectly into the environment every year, according to the Livestock Research
            Institute’s estimates.

            In statistical terms, the crops subsector has weighed down the overall growth of Vietnamese agriculture.
            The subsector grew at an average of only 2 percent per annum between 2010 and 2013. This is rather remarkable
            as this period coincided with a continuous expansion in national rice production and a very large increase in the
            volume of exports for a diverse range of crops. Much of the explanation for this seems to relate to rice. This has
            remained the dominant food crop. While output growth has been impressive, the value-addition to this crop has
            remained low, both at primary and secondary levels, and both in absolute and relative terms. Table 6 illustrates
            the value-addition that occurs at the farm level in the Mekong Delta.15 In 2011, the value added in primary pro-
            cessing was estimated to be 12 percent for rice, compared with 17 percent for ﬁsh and more than 25 percent for
            sugar and fruits and vegetables. In that same year, Vietnam’s rice sector overall experienced physical and quality
            losses of a value that exceeded the value-added of the entire rice export industry.


            15    Although land, water, and climatic conditions (and the existing infrastructure) limit the scope for conversion over to other ﬁeld crops in some locations. In the rainy season,
                  rice-ﬁsh rotations have good potential, although shifts to specialized forms of aquaculture may entail high investment costs and various production risks. Switching paddy-
                  land to fruit trees or most industrial crops often requires physical changes in the height and protection of the land.

            Table 9 highlights some regional differences in the pace of recent agricultural growth within Vietnam. Several
            regions, including the Red River Delta and the two Central Coast regions, have seen their rates of growth lag over
            most of the period since 2000. The Red River Delta, for instance, has seen an absolute decline in agricultural gross
            value-added in four of the past ﬁve years. Urbanization and industrialization are the main drivers of economic
            development there. The Central Highlands region has witnessed the most robust rates of agricultural growth, as these
            have not tailed off as they have tended to, recently, in most of the country. The Southeast has also seen higher-
            than-average growth. Commercial tree crop development has underpinned this growth in both regions, together
            with expanding livestock development in the Southeast. The Mekong Delta region, which accounts for about one-
            third of agricultural gross value-added (AGVA), saw growth taper off between 2009 and 2013 due to some disruptive
            events in the aquaculture subsector and declining rates of growth in rice value-added. Among regions, Vietnam’s
            two rice bowls—the Mekong and Red River Deltas—have experienced the slowest pace of agricultural growth since
            2009. Three regions, the Mekong Delta, the Southeast, and the Central Highlands, now account for about 60 percent
            of Vietnam’s gross agricultural output and more than 80 percent of its agricultural exports.

                  Changes (and Shortfalls) in Productivity

                  The picture with regard to agricultural productivity has been a mixed one. This section considers land
                  productivity, labor productivity, water productivity, the efﬁciency of input use, and total factor productivity.


                  Land Productivity

                  Vietnam’s impressive gains in land productivity compared to those of regional peers appear in Figure 21,
                  depicting changes in land productivity since 1990 (OECD 2015). A closer look, however, reveals that if Vietnam
                  outperformed its neighbors in terms of land productivity growth during the 1990s, it actually fell back into the pack
                  in the subsequent decade, and the land productivity gap widened between China and Vietnam.

            hybrid varieties. Within Vietnam, growth in paddy yields has varied enormously by location and season. Yet it is
            important to note that Vietnam’s rice yields are growing at a slowing pace. Rice yields grew at an average rate of
            3.1 percent per annum from 1990 to 1995, at a rate of 2.9 percent from 1996 to 2005, and at a rate of 1.6 percent
            from 2006 to 2013. Agro-chemical and seed use is already high, if not excessive. Climate change and pesticide
            resistance are also hurting yields in some areas.

            Vietnam’s coffee yields are well above international norms, yet these have progressed little over the past
            decade as a result of the aging of the tree stock, the considerable spread of coffee plantings onto less-
            suitable or un-suitable land16, and various episodes of drought (1999, 2005, 2013). Vietnam’s average
            coffee yields peaked as far back as in 1997. Vietnam’s maize yields, at 4.4 tons per hectare, are similar to those
            of other Southeast Asian countries, yet well below those of China. Maize yields improved during the late 2000s
            but have leveled off since then. Productivity in the sugar sector, both in primary production and in milling, is
            comparatively low within the region.

            Signiﬁcant increases in milk productivity have occurred in recent years, yet Vietnam’s livestock productivity
            otherwise lags well behind that of regional and global peers. For example, the average amount of feed used to
            generate 1 kg of pork meat is higher in Vietnam (4.4 kg) than in China (3.5) or Brazil (2.8). Factors contributing
            to this difference include the quality
            of the feed and breeding stock that are      Figure 22: Declining Productivity in Vietnamese Fisheries

            Aggregate patterns of change in agricultural labor productivity do not paint a favorable picture for an
            emerging, middle-income country. Table 11 compares the growth rate in this indicator among nine medium and
            large Asian countries including Vietnam. The productivity of labor in Vietnamese agriculture has grown at a faster

            (2014) found labor use to be as low as 20 person-days in areas where many processes have been mechanized (Figure
            25). In the latter areas, agricultural labor productivity has certainly increased.

            The productivity gap between agricultural and non-agricultural labor is certainly growing, although ofﬁcial
            estimates may exaggerate its size. In some parts of the country agricultural work is now primarily a part-time or
            seasonal activity. Yet, people without formal employment in rural areas are deemed to be “working in agriculture.”
            They may only be working in agriculture for 60, 90 or 120 days, while working in other activities for much of the
            remainder of the year. In the Red River Delta and greater Ho Chi Minh City area, many people either commute to or
            temporarily migrate to (part-time or extended) jobs in industrial zones, in construction, and in informal service-
            sector activities. Often, they remain formally registered in their (rural) place of origin. Reforms in the household
            registration system and better (union and other) protections for seasonal or migrant workers would contribute to a
            more efﬁcient release of surplus agricultural labor, both in reality and statistically.

            Agricultural labor productivity in Vietnam probably varies greatly by location and farming system; but
            labor productivity has not been systematically analyzed for this sector, taking into account actual levels of
            agricultural effort rather than the ofﬁcial tally of ”agricultural workers.” The issue is that the ofﬁcial count
            of agricultural workers in the census almost certainly represents an overestimation of actual time spent working
            in agriculture, as informal employment outside of agriculture sometimes gets reported as agricultural work. This
            residual labor is most likely skewing estimates of agricultural labor productivity. This can be shown for 2006,
            as labor statistics for that year include actual data on the
            number of person-days spent working on speciﬁc crops and in     Table 12: Low Labor Productivity in Agriculture:
            aquaculture. Based on these numbers, value-added per (full-     Both Fact and Statistical Artifact, 2006

            sectors overall.

            This makes sense. The value-added in Vietnamese shrimp production is very high; the value-added in parts of the
            garment and footwear industries is comparatively low due to the very high import content of products. Although
            data aren’t readily available for these, the productivity of labor in parts of Vietnam’s horticultural and ﬂoricultural
            industries almost certainly matches or exceeds that observed in some manufacturing and service subsectors. More
            analysis is needed to differentiate the productivity of agricultural (and other sectoral) labor by area of specializa-
            tion and location.

                  Water Productivity

                  Until recently, some 80 percent of total freshwater withdrawals in Vietnam were for agriculture. Since the
                  mid-1970s, it is estimated that $6 billion (present value) have been invested in irrigation—representing about
                  80 percent of the government’s capital investment in the agricultural sector. While freshwater resources available
                  to Vietnam are relatively abundant, some 60 percent of Vietnam’s available water originates upstream in other
                  countries. Water ﬂow is highly uneven during the year, with nearly three-quarters of the annual run-off occurring
                  during a three-to-four month period. Irrigation has been critical in offsetting water shortages during the dry season
                  and for protecting ﬂood-prone areas during the wet season. Some 4.5 million hectares are serviced by a variety of
                  small, medium, and large irrigation schemes, with about two-thirds of these being in either the Red River or Mekong
                  River Deltas (FAO Aquastat, accessed 2015).

                  While irrigation coverage is high, with most amenable areas equipped, the current irrigation systems were
                  designed primarily for rice and several factors impede increases in water productivity (World Bank 2013).
                  From a design perspective, schemes typically do not have structures for accurate ﬂow measurement and control,
                  and low canal-density results in high dependency on ﬁeld-to-ﬁeld conveyance. This makes it difﬁcult to deliver
                  water ﬂexibly and reliably. Fields are also inadequately equipped for both ﬁeld and storm drainage, constraining
                  the timing of harvesting operations. Further, most irrigation schemes were developed 30–40 years ago with less
                  than adequate attention to maintenance. Incomplete structures and water losses during operations have many
                  schemes operating at only 60–70 percent of their capacity.19 And in some areas there have been problems in
                  managing water quality, especially in relation to the polluting effects of fertilizer and agro-chemical run-off.

                  The larger irrigation schemes are managed by state-owned Irrigation and Drainage Management Companies
                  (IDMCs), the operating revenues of which come from a combination of public subsidies and water-use
                  charges collected from industry and municipalities. Since 2008, most farmers have been exempt from paying
                  fees for services provided by IDMCs. Although this measure was adopted to improve farmer welfare, it has weakened
                  the accountability of IDMCs to local water-user organizations. There is now ﬁscal pressure to reduce the level of
                  central government subsidies and to set IDMCs on a path of greater commercial autonomy, where favorable market
                  conditions exist. This will involve planning a set of transitions for managing assets and generating revenues to
                  cover operation and maintenance and MARD are currently piloting performance contracts with Provinces and IDMCs
                  to assess continued disbursement of this central subsidy,

                  At present, under a strict measure of average water productivity, the performance of Vietnamese irrigation
                  schemes would appear to be low, especially the performance of those entirely dedicated to rice production.
                  This is illustrated in Table 13 which compares from the water productivity of four large-scale irrigation schemes
                  in Vietnam, China, and India. The introduction of a rotation crop or the act of supporting a different crop pattern
                  raises the average productivity in Vietnamese schemes considerably. The output per unit of water is ten times higher
                  in one Vietnamese scheme involving a rice-sugar rotation compared to one involving rice monoculture. Similar
                  patterns are observed in the other two countries, China having much higher productivity rates per unit of water.



                  19   In other words, an irrigation scheme might be designed to provide irrigation services so that rice can be double-cropped on 100 hectares, but may only be serving farmers on
                       60 to 70 hectares with reliable irrigation service. All the needed canals and other structures may not be completed, and these may experience water losses due to leaks and
                       evaporation.

            where opportunity costs in competing uses are higher. Existing infrastructure will need to deliver a range of multi-
            functional water services—not just irrigation and drainage. Water supply to municipalities, rural centers, industry
            and maintenance of ﬂows for aquaculture, ﬂuvial transport, and environmental services are becoming increasingly
            important.

            Away from lowland rice and cereal production, the application of deﬁcit irrigation can improve coffee
            yields and reduce pressure on otherwise stressed groundwater resources (Amarasinghe et al. 2015).20 All
            these examples point to a future where smarter crop-water management and better adapted planning and infra-
            structure investment will have to catch up with the rate of transformation and declining access to land and water
            resources. Matching these irrigation and drainage services to improved agronomy and value chain development is
            likely to be the critical area of transition rather than a focus on notional measures of water productivity.

            Improved water productivity is also needed in coffee production, a sector where there is heavy reliance on
            irrigation drawn from surface and especially from groundwater (Amarasinghe et al. 2015). Irrigation is crucial
            for growth of the coffee crop during the dry season between January and April. For years, the public extension
            service has advised farmers to irrigate with 650 liters per plant per round in three rounds. In practice, many
            farmers have been using twice as much water based on the belief that this is beneﬁcial to crop yields. Farmers
            don’t pay for water, although they do incur irrigation-related expenses (labor, diesel or electricity for pumping,
            and so forth). Farmer water-use is not monitored. And, the most common ‘sustainability’ standard being applied
            in Vietnam’s coffee sector, 4C, has very lax conditions provisions in relation to water management. Field experi-
            ments have highlighted that in years of average rainfall, the optimal irrigation level would be only 364 or 456
            liters per plant per round in 3 rounds per year, a level which is only 70 percent of what is locally recommended
            and between one-third and one-half of the common practice. Moving toward more appropriate levels of water-use
            will be critical for avoiding water shortages in the Central Highlands where it is expected that climate change will
            result in more variable and seasonally concentrated rainfall patterns in the future. Already, excessive groundwater
            pumping has contributed to a declining water table (D’haeze et al. 2003).
            20    In the Central Highlands, the average annual water-use among urban and rural households is 137 tons and 144 tons, respectively. For comparison, the average household use
                  for coffee irrigation is 2,822 tons (Technoserve 2014).

                  around 180 kg per hectare of paddy, the
                  application rate in Vietnam is about 30–200 percent higher than that observed in other Southeast Asian countries
                  (Figure 26). Within the region, only China, Malaysia, Korea, and Japan have higher uses. Soil testing in Vietnam
                  is rare and farmers often do not apply fertilizer with the optimal composition or at the optimal time. Between
                  one-half and two-thirds of fertilizer nutrients are not taken up by crops. Excess fertilizer use, together with water
                  management practices, leads a large proportion of fertilizer to either run off into streams or groundwater or be
                  emitted as nitrous oxide.22 Vietnam needs to be careful to avoid the very serious land degradation and water
                  pollution effects of very heavy fertilizer use which China has experienced.

                  Vietnam is also a relatively heavy user of pesticides, despite various programs over the years to promote
                  integrated pest management. There has been growing use, both of newer, less toxic products as well as less ex-
                  pensive generic (and sometimes inaccurately labeled) products, some of which are no longer permitted for use in
                  many of the destination markets for Vietnam’s agricultural exports. Pesticide use seems to have increased sharply
                  since the mid-2000s, perhaps due to increased pest pressure from more intensive production and the develop-
                  ment of pesticide resistance. Frequent and late chemical spraying of crops has contributed to growing concerns
                  about pesticide residues, in rice, tea, and fruits and vegetables, although systematic data are not available on
                  the breadth and seriousness of the problem. Based on past violations, various Vietnamese products entering the
                  EU are subject to more frequent sampling and testing (EU Food and Veterinary Ofﬁce 2014). Relatively strong
                  national legislation is in place, yet the capacities to advise on and to monitor agro-chemical use are limited,
                  both within government and among food distribution and trading companies. Perhaps even more serious have
                  been the health risks to farmers and to community members drawing water from streams where pesticide run-off
                  is pronounced. One study (Dasgupta 2005) found that among the surveyed Mekong Delta rice farmers who were
                  medically tested, 35 percent showed signs of poisoning—from organophosphates and carbamates—with 21 per-
                  cent having symptoms of chronic poisoning.

                  21   Domestic production is supported through subsidized pricing for natural gas, electricity and coal, made available to the state-owned companies who account for the bulk of
                       domestic fertilizer production.
                  22   FAO estimates that some 80 percent of the nitrous oxide emissions in Vietnam derive from agriculture.

            Total Factor Productivity

            Vietnam’s total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture has grown at a relatively rapid pace over the past
            two decades, although, as with the trend in agricultural GDP and for the yields in major crops, the rate of
            growth has been declining. Table 14 shows that the pace of TFP growth in Vietnam has fallen behind that of
            many regional peers since the mid-2000s. And the share of Vietnam’s agricultural growth accounted for by TFP has
            been lower than that of the regional peers. Dawe (2015) reports that over the 2001–2010 period, TFP accounted
            for 57 percent of Vietnam’s agricultural growth. The comparative shares for Thailand, China, and Malaysia were
            83 percent, 86 percent, and 92 percent, respectively. In the past three years, TFP has accounted for an average of
            only 40 percent of Vietnam’s agricultural growth, according to IPSARD. These are not encouraging trends.

            One contributing factor to a slowdown in productivity gains in the sector has been underinvestment in
            agricultural research and an overall sub-optimum performance of the agricultural innovation system. This
            system played an important role in the earlier take off of the sector, especially the introduction of improved crop
            varieties.23 Yet, Vietnam’s current research and innovation capacity is limited by various factors, including: the
            relatively small proportion of university lecturers and researchers qualiﬁed at PhD level; a shortage of world-class
            scientists; the bureaucratically fragmented and cumbersome mechanisms used to allocate research funds; the
            fragmented provision of research services; a lack of co-operation between leading scientists in research institutes
            and universities; and continued separation between research and teaching. Despite recent steps to reform it,
            Vietnam’s agricultural innovation system tends to be supply-driven, insufﬁciently responsive to farmers’ demand,
            and still rather weak in collaborating with other institutions and the private sector (see more on recent and
            needed reforms in Chapter 4).




            The Environmental Footprint of Vietnamese Agriculture

            The expansion and intensiﬁcation of Vietnam’s agriculture over recent decades has signiﬁcantly broadened its
            environmental footprint.24 Part of this relates to the over-intensive use of inputs and the inefﬁcient use of water
            noted above. Multiple forms of environmental degradation have been associated with several of the most dynamic
            areas of Vietnamese agriculture. For example, the expansion of shrimp aquaculture in the Mekong Delta has resulted
            in large-scale destruction of mangroves and has also been a major source of water pollution. Under so-called
            intensive systems, shrimp farmers often use large amounts of chemicals and antibiotics to keep the overcrowded

            23    This discussion is based primarily upon OECD (2015) and a rapid assessment of the agricultural innovation system in 2010 by the World Bank.

                  surrounding freshwater and coastal waters. The expansion of coffee and rubber production in the Central Highlands
                  has been an important contributor to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and groundwater depletion. Production of
                  livestock products is growing swiftly as is the livestock sector’s contributions to water pollution and greenhouse
                  gas (GHG) emissions. The intensiﬁcation of rice production has contributed to land degradation, water pollution,
                  biodiversity loss, and the growth of GHG emissions. Table 15 summarizes Vietnam’s agro-environmental hotspots—
                  commodities and locations or landscapes where environmental problems are either moderate or severe.

                  Multiple factors have contributed to the agricultural sector’s increasing effect on the environment. These can
                  be classiﬁed under three categories: (i) policy and administrative failures, (ii) market failures, and (iii) knowledge
                  and information gaps.

                    x Policy and administrative failures. Agricultural policies in Vietnam have been primarily geared toward
                      expanding output in order to meet food security, economic growth, and trade targets. This policy orientation has
                      encouraged land expansion and intensiﬁcation, more intensive use of agricultural inputs and all other means to
                      raise production capacity. While the government has sought to protect farmers, protecting the environment has
                      not, until recently, been a pillar of agricultural policy. Even where national policies have favored conservation,
                      provincial governments have often maintained the course of expansion and intensiﬁcation to live up to growth
                      and revenue imperatives. Inter-sectoral coordination has also been problematic in translating green agriculture
                      aspirations into practice.

                    x Market failures. Generally in Vietnam, agricultural producers neither pay the actual costs of the scarce

                      Groundwater or controlled irrigation water is either underpriced or not priced. For many farmers, “dirty”
                      production may be temporarily more proﬁtable, although the costs are borne by local communities or downstream
                      farmers. The fragmented production structure of Vietnamese agriculture results in very high transaction costs,
                      both in providing technical advice on more sustainable practices and in monitoring farmer compliance (or
                      otherwise) with regulatory or private standards. With only some exceptions, downstream distribution channels
                      or consumers have not punished or rewarded bad and good practices in Vietnamese agriculture. Consumers are
                      still generally agnostic or unaware of environmental impacts of commodities, so consumer pressure for farmers

                    to change their practices has been low. Much of Vietnam’s agricultural exports are raw commodities which are
                    invisible to ﬁnal users.

                  x Knowledge gaps. The knowledge-base for green agriculture in Vietnam is growing yet it is still limited.
                    Knowledge about the underlying resource vulnerabilities is lacking in some areas—e.g., groundwater stock and
                    ﬂows in the Central Highlands. Farm-level awareness of technical options and their ﬁnancial implications is
                    uneven especially where extension services are inadequate and farmers’ primary source of information is input
                    stockists. Vietnam’s agricultural research system has, over the years, prioritized yield-enhancing measures
                    rather than practices and technologies to lower agriculture’s environmental footprint.

            In Vietnam, it is not uncommon to ﬁnd a combination of policy failures, market failures, and knowledge gaps
            affecting environmental management for individual subsectors and landscapes. This is illustrated in Table 16 in
            relation to coffee. For the most part, the environmental costs associated with the intensiﬁcation or extensiﬁcation

                  of Vietnamese agriculture have not been quantiﬁed. As a result the true value-addition of Vietnamese agriculture
                  has been over-estimated.

                  Various programs have been initiated in Vietnam to promote more sustainable production and natural resource
                  management practices, with some oriented around either national (VietGAP, “three gains, three reductions”)
                  or international standards. Statistics on adoption rates of national standards are not readily available. Provincial
                  departments of agriculture in the Mekong Delta have estimated the proportion of rice producers who are applying
                  techniques involving much lower use of fertilizer, pesticides, and water. For tea and coffee, Vietnam’s move toward
                  (certiﬁed) sustainable practices appears to still lag behind that of important peers. For example, in 2013, less
                  than 3 percent of Vietnam’s tea production was Rain Forest Alliance-certiﬁed. A much larger share of production
                  was certiﬁed in the four countries tea exports of which exceed those of Vietnam—India (34 percent), Sri Lanka
                  (10 percent), Kenya (88 percent), and Indonesia (34 percent). The comparison is somewhat better for coffee. Some
                  30 percent of Vietnamese coffee is certiﬁed under one or another international standard—compared with 41 percent
                  for Brazil, 60 percent for Colombia, and 11 percent for Indonesia. Vietnam has the largest number of sustainability-
                  certiﬁed aquaculture farms in the world, although in the case of shrimp, a large majority of the growing area is not
                  yet monitored (or certiﬁed) for environmental management practices.

            in recent years (Table 17).25 Vietnam’s agro-food imports have also grown signiﬁcantly in the past few years, with
            these consisting of:

                  x Commodities and raw materials that Vietnam is not able to produce (i.e. wheat) or in which it is not a very
                    competitive producer (i.e. cotton, soybeans, sugar, and beef);

                  x Raw materials for which domestic supply has fallen well short of processing capacity (for wood, increasingly so
                    for cashew nuts, and signiﬁcantly for shrimp during recent years’ disease outbreaks);

                  x Products for which domestic production lags behind surging domestic demand (i.e. milk and animal feed and
                    feed ingredients); and
                                                                                    Figure 28: Vietnam’s Agro-food Trade Balance, 2000–2013

                  sugar industries can effectively restructure to stave off the much higher competition which will come as a result of
                  the ASEAN and Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership trade agreements.

                  Yet the picture of Vietnam’s agro-food trade is not all positive. Most of Vietnam’s expanding export subsectors
                  have left money on the table—failing to take full advantage of the market opportunities for generating increased
                  value and, in some cases, failing to have a transformative impact on the farmers and communities which serve as
                  their foundations. I Vietnam has been cost-competitive when it comes to crop-based commodities. Put differently,
                  Vietnam’s commodities have been sold at a discount as a result of several factors, including:

                       x   Issues related to (lower or inconsistent) quality or food safety;
                       x   The incidence of and perceived risk of contract non-fulﬁllment by Vietnamese suppliers;
                       x   Real or perceived risks regarding the environmental footprint of Vietnamese commodities; and
                       x   Intensive competition among Vietnamese exporters, which has enabled international buyers to negotiate prices
                           downward.

                  For higher-value and processed foods, a range of food safety concerns are being tracked by buyers and reg-
                  ulators, especially in high-income countries. Some of the most common problems have been the presence of
                  (unapproved) antibiotic residues in farmed ﬁsh, violative pesticide residues in tea, fruits and vegetables, harmful
                  microbiological substances in harvested clams and processed foods, and improper labeling. From the mid-to- late
                  2000s, Vietnam’s agro-food trade faced a relatively high number of food product consignment interceptions or re-
                  jections by regulatory authorities. There have since been signs of improvement—both absolutely and in Vietnam’s
                  relative position.26 Major efforts are being made to identify and better manage critical control points, especially
                  in relation to ﬁsh exports, yet problems are still evident more generally—and relate to proper pest and disease
                  control, environmental contamination, and overall supply chain management.27

                  25 percent brokens rice has tended to sell at a $30
                  to $40 per ton discount of the same product from
                  26       Between 2006 and 2008, Vietnam had, by far, the highest incidence among major developing country exporters of food product rejections per millions of dollars of trade by
                           U.S. regulatory authorities. In contrast, by 2013, the food product rejection rate on imports into the EU were lower for Vietnam than for India, China, Bangladesh, Egypt, and
                           Thailand.
                  27       International buyers are now giving more attention to the environmental risks within their supply chain. These are risks which could either undermine their supply or harm
                           their reputation and brand when their ﬁnal products are publically associated with environmental degradation. Companies with global brands are now regularly monitoring or

            Thailand. Vietnam’s Robusta exports have tended to sell at a small discount to the LIFFE (International Price) index.
            In 2013, the average unit value for Vietnam’s tea ($1,524)—some 40 percent lower than that of India ($2,688)
            and Kenya ($2,799). Until the late 2000s, the bulk of Vietnam’s rice exports consisted of medium and especially
            lower quality white rice sold at some of the lowest prices in international rice trade, in some years primarily to
            public agencies abroad for distribution via supplemental feeding programs. In recent years, there has been some
            repositioning of the rice trade into higher quality or different variety segments, including for aromatic varieties. But
            there too, the Vietnam product earns a lower price than that of peers.

            Much of Vietnam’s large agro-food trade is virtually invisible to the majority of end-users or consumers
            abroad. Its less-expensive raw materials tend to be blended with those from elsewhere to obtain a ﬁnished product.
            Vietnam’s low cost Robusta coffee is blended with Arabica coffee from Africa or Latin America to produce different
            brands of instant coffee in Europe and North America. Vietnam’s dried cassava is converted into animal feed, starch,
            and other products, generally in China. The bulk of Vietnam’s exports of bamboo follow a similar path (along which
            most of the value-addition occurs overseas). Many of its raw materials are sold in products with labels that say
            “made with supplies from different countries.” Fresh produce may go unlabeled or sometimes it is even labeled with
            a different country origin. Paradoxically, while Vietnamese cuisine is attracting more and more attention in high
            income countries, most Vietnamese-supplied food products and ingredients remain out of sight. Part of this may
            relate to perceptions about food safety or environmental risk.

            The bulk of Vietnam’s agro-food exports are sold as primary commodities or initially processed products (i.e.
            milled rice). In 2013, primary commodities accounted for nearly 83 percent of exports, by value (Table 19). Value-
            Added shrimp products account for a large proportion of a recent expansion in processed food exports. While there
            has been some growth in recent years in processed product exports, much of that growth is accounted for by gains
            by several ﬁrms in selling value-added shrimp products. Given Vietnam’s pattern of agro-food exports, relatively few
            Vietnamese brands are recognized and sought after by consumers abroad.

                  There is nothing intrinsically bad about being primarily a supplier of agricultural commodities, especially if
                  one is a very efﬁcient supplier with a strong international reputation. Brazil ﬁts this description. Upward of
                  80 percent of its massive agro-food exports consists of primary commodities—soybean, maize, cotton, raw sugar,
                  coffee, chilled beef, and so forth. Canada, the United States, and the Ukraine also have large agro-food export
                  industries in which primary commodities predominate. Yet these are all countries with very large land areas where
                  large-scale mechanized farms deliver the bulk raw materials which are transported by low-cost rail or river freight.

                  Vietnam has an entirely different agrarian structure, and by international standards is heavily land-constrained.
                  It therefore needs to get more value from its relatively scarce resources—especially land.28 That can be achieved
                  through changes in land-use, changes in varieties and farmer and post-farm production practices (toward higher
                  value or differentiated commodities), and the transformation of more raw materials into value-added products.
                  Thailand has a factor endowment which is closer to Vietnam’s than that of the other large commodity exporters
                  noted here. And Thailand has had some success in developing competitive value-added product lines from its raw
                  material base—even as it continues to be a major exporter of the primary commodities underlying some of these.
                  That country is now a major exporter of consumer and industrial rubber products, processed fruits and vegetables,
                  sugar confectionery, and value-added ﬁsh products.




                  Value Chain Inefﬁciencies and a Deﬁcit of Collective Action

                  Generating rural wealth from agro-food exports and higher-value domestic food markets need not depend
                  on moving up the value chain. In several of Vietnam’s commercial agriculture value chains there are major
                  inefﬁciencies which contribute both to higher, unnecessary costs and to a weakening of the signals and incentives
                  for farmers and intermediaries to meet certain quality standards. Although one needs to be cautious about making
                  generalizations, the following structural and institutional features are quite common.

                  At the farm level, very inefﬁcient (and generally excessive) use of fertilizer, chemicals, and other inputs
                  broadly persist. Farmers are risk averse and have been guided in the mind-set of maximizing yields, rather than
                  raising efﬁciency and lowering costs to realize higher ﬁnancial returns. Focused initiatives to promote lower input—
                  yet better-managed—crop production have demonstrated a very considerable potential for reducing both material
                  and environmental costs. The example of water-use for coffee production was noted earlier. Farmers adopting
                  production practices involving lower input and water use for rice have often increased their yields and proﬁtability
                  while reducing GHG emissions (Tran Thu Ha 2015, Keyser et al. 2013).

                  A very small proportion of exported commodities is aggregated by cooperatives or other formal entities
                  serving commercial purposes. There has been a long-standing government policy of supporting farmer cooperatives,
                  but the number of cooperatives has fallen signiﬁcantly over time and the vast majority of the surviving ones are
                  involved mostly in coordinating water-use and channeling advisory services to members. Of the nearly 9,200 service
                  cooperatives still active in 2012, 84 percent were in regions of the country which account for little of Vietnam’s
                  agricultural exports. Less than 1 percent of Vietnam’s smallholder coffee farmers are members of commercially
                  oriented cooperatives; the proportion in core sourcing areas for rice exports is similarly very low. In the Mekong
                  28   Taking into account average yield and price differences, the return per hectare of land under tea is ﬁve times higher in Kenya than in Vietnam. Smallholder tea farmers in Kenya
                       are relatively wealthy; those in Vietnam are not.

            Delta there are many thousands of informal collaborative groups, but these are not permitted to perform business
            functions. For commercially-oriented cooperatives there are issues of cooperative management and governance,
            and (local) government interference in decision-making. The paucity of well-functioning cooperatives raises the
            transaction costs in most export supply chains as it is more challenging for downstream ﬁrms or intermediaries
            to communicate with farmers, inﬂuence and monitor their practices, and aggregate their production. It may also
            contribute to higher post-harvest losses as raw materials may not get properly dried or be handled properly. There
            are at least some economies of scale in most post-harvest functions. However the lack of collective commercial
            action diminishes the bargaining power and voice of many small farmers in the value chain.

            Contract farming is much less well developed in Vietnam than in other countries where smallholders play
            a prominent role in commercial value chains (Verhofstadt et al. 2014). Such arrangements tend to involve a
            combination forward selling and buying commitments, the provision of quality inputs (often on loan), and
            management advice. Such arrangements can help in managing price risks, minimize inappropriate and ineffective
            input use, and improve the alignment between production and the raw material quality needs of companies. Contract
            farming has featured in the domestic dairy industry and has grown in importance in both the horticulture and
            aquaculture industries. Although still small, a growing proportion of broiler and pork production involves forward
            contracts together with breeding animal and feed supply. This pattern is predictable—these are perishable higher-
            value products for which quality may be highly variable.

            In the coffee sector, there are few direct purchases by processor-exporters from farmers. Based on Circular
            08/2013/TT-BCT issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, foreign-owned companies are not permitted to source
            directly from farmers but must instead buy through a registered local company (or cooperative). Formal contract
            arrangements may not be very beneﬁcial in Robusta coffee value chains, yet an inability for companies to source
            directly from farmers serves as a barrier to providing clear incentives or requirements for farmers to adopt more
            environmentally sustainable practices. In the rice export industry, there are some interesting emerging examples,
            yet the current share of supply which falls under some type of direct contracting arrangement is somewhere in
            the 3 to 6 percent range. Such arrangements make sense where the company has very speciﬁc variety or quality
            requirements and is trying to promote a brand based on quality differentiation. Recent regulations and measures by
            provincial government agencies aim to accelerate the pace at which the rice export subsector moves toward more
            integrated, contractual arrangements.

            So, at the level of aggregating farm supply there remain only limited patterns of collective action. And direct
            linkages between farmers and processor-exporters is still uncommon, outside of aquaculture. Most value chains
            therefore feature large numbers of intermediaries and, in the case of rice, several steps of intermediaries (i.e.,
            local assemblers, ﬁrst stage millers, sometimes another set of traders or brokers who then supply the larger miller-
            exporters). Technologies, capabilities, ﬁnancial strength, and business ethics vary across these intermediaries. And it
            becomes difﬁcult to track one’s supplies (i.e. for lack of a chain of custody). With this, it is difﬁcult to make forward
            commitments to buyers and assure them that the product’s origins are safe and sustainable. Where there is a deﬁcit
            in supply chain governance, it is often best to keep one’s products invisible in the eyes of consumers. A considerable
            amount of Vietnam’s agro-food trade is invisible in another way. This is informal, cross-border trade with neighbors
            to the north and west, with the participants seeking to avoid taxes, quality and sanitary and phytosanitary controls,
            or restrictions on the sale of certain products (i.e., wildlife, certain types and origins of wood).

                  Collective action at the industry level has shown more promise in recent years, although in the past, many
                  industry associations played more of a political and information-monitoring function than technical and
                  professional ones. In many other countries, industry associations play very signiﬁcant roles in product promotion,
                  in incentivizing improved practices (through industry codes of practice and labels), in prioritizing research, and in
                  other functions. Aspects of this are emerging in Vietnam, for example through the newly formed Coffee Coordination
                  Board and through the industry associations for tea and ﬁsh products. For rice, the Vietnam Food Association
                  continues to play primarily administrative roles and has helped to maintain a very large share for state-owned
                  enterprises in rice exports. Partly as a result, a country which is the world’s second or third largest rice exporter
                  lacks a coherent commercial export competitiveness strategy. In its place have been a ﬂow of new regulations
                  seeking to reshape the structure and direction of the industry. While the orientation has strong merit, and improving
                  technical efﬁciency in the value chain is essential, it is very difﬁcult to achieve improved market relationships by
                  decree. Within the rice sector, both stick and carrot are needed, together with improving the enabling environment
                  for commercial businesses by either levelling the playing ﬁeld between them and SOEs or refocusing the efforts of
                  the latter primarily on social, food security-focused functions rather than commercial functions.

                  The mixed record of Vietnam’s agricultural exports—with major expansion in trade volumes yet signiﬁcant
                  shortcomings in quality and sustainability—is partly a reﬂection of the compressed time period (i.e., 10 to
                  20 years) over which various industries have gained prominence. It is also a reﬂection of government policy and
                  the ways in which the public sector has focused its engagement in certain industries. In several of these, state-
                  owned farms and processing or trading companies have played a very prominent role, historically if not currently.
                  State-owned coffee and tea enterprises contributed, for many years, to a culture of low product quality, while their
                  prominence delayed the emergence of the types of professional industry organizations commonly found in beverage
                  crop industries world-wide. State-enterprise dominance of Vietnam’s rice export trade from its emergence to the
                  2000s gave the industry more of a political than a commercial orientation, with the bulk of trade occurring through
                  government–to-government transactions. Private and otherwise professional value chain operators were limited by
                  export quotas or otherwise forced to work around the margins of the state-dominated trade. The emergence of a
                  quality product segment and recognizable brands, along with a growing private sector share in the trade, haves only
                  begun in recent years.

                  The SOE presence—and favored access to ﬁnance—in these and several other subsectors has retarded or
                  delayed greater involvement in agribusiness activities, both by international and domestic companies. It has
                  also tied up government resources in comparably unproductive farms and factories. Such resources might have had a
                  more transformative impact by providing technical, ﬁnancial, and trade promotion services to the private sector and
                  by developing high caliber systems for food safety and biosecurity management. This is the direction needed now.

                  In other respects, there has been an imbalance between government efforts to promote industry growth and
                  to manage the risks associated with this growth. For example, the environmentally destructive pattern of coffee
                  and aquaculture expansion during the 1990s and 2000s was condoned if not facilitated (through infrastructure
                  investments and support services) by provincial and other government entities. Only more recently, as industry
                  growth has been seemingly threatened—by pests, diseases, or aging assets, has the government made a major
                  commitment around sustainability initiatives. Competition among provinces to attract and promote investment in
                  ﬁsheries and ﬁsh processing contributed to the build-up of excessive industry capacity and the over-exploitation of
                  the near-shore ﬁsheries. Efforts to sustainably manage coastal and ﬁshery resources—a core public interest—have
                  also been subject to insufﬁcient budgetary resources. With government primarily engaged as an industry operator

            or growth-promoter, and with other players unable to or not encouraged to take on industry leadership roles,
            systems of industry or value chain governance have either been slow to develop in Vietnamese agriculture or been
            too under-developed to be effective given the size and complexities of the industries. The result of these modes of
            public sector intervention has been the quality and sustainability deﬁcits widely observed in the agricultural sector.

                n thinking about what Vietnamese agriculture can become in the future, it is important to consider
                the evolving context which includes broader changes in the Vietnamese economy and society, expected
                changes in domestic agro-food demand, possible trends in international commodity markets, and anticipated
            climate change impacts.




            Macro-Societal Setting

                  x During the upcoming one to two decades several important demographic and socio-economic trends are
                    expected in Vietnam as it aspires to become a “modern industrial economy.” These include (World Bank/
                    MPI 2016) an aging population structure. Vietnam has recently beneﬁtted from having a bulge in the share of
                    the population of working age. This demographic dividend has now ended—the working age share peaked in
                    2013 and has begun to decline. The absolute number of people of working age is expected to peak in the mid-
                    2030s. Over this period, Vietnam is expected to change from being a young to an aged society, according to UN
                    deﬁnitions.

                  x Continued urbanization. Between the mid-1980s and 2015 Vietnam’s urban population grew from 13 to
                    30 million, accounting for one-third of the total population in that latter year. A decade from now, it is
                    anticipated that Vietnam will have more than 50 million urban residents, accounting for half of the total
                    population.

                  x An expanding middle class. By the mid-2030s, more than half of Vietnam’s population is expected to join the
                    middle class (consumption of $10 or more per day, compared with less than 10 percent today).

            These demographic changes have signiﬁcant implications for human capital development, the domestic labor
            market, and competition for land and water resources. The expanding middle class offers major potential for the
            domestic market to be a driver of growth, including in agriculture (see below).




            Expected Changes in Regional and Domestic Food Demand
            Within East and Southeast Asia, total food consumption is projected to continue to increase and diversify
            rapidly driven by a growing population, economic growth, rising incomes, and urbanization. Total calorie
            consumption in the region has gone up together with income, and will continue to increase in the future, particularly
            among the poor, but the rate of growth is expected to decline in most countries including Vietnam. Table 20 shows
            the daily calorie availability per capita based on food balance sheets for 1961, 2009, and a projection for 2030.29
            Looking forward, the main change will be in diet composition, assuming that the rates of urbanization and income
            growth continue. Overall calorie intake is projected to rise by 19 percent. In China, the changes will be even more
            dramatic. Total calorie intake, already higher than in the rest of East Asia, is projected to grow by 23 percent through


            29      It is important to note that calorie “consumption” as calculated in food balance sheets is actually a measure of “availability” after industrial, feed, and other non-food uses
                    (e.g., biofuels) have been deducted from the total domestic supply (production plus net trade). This availability does not include spoilage, plate waste and other losses, which
                    are signiﬁcant in most countries. Hence, food balance sheet estimates inevitably overestimate actual per capita intake.

                  animal protein demand in turn creates derived
                  intermediate demand for feed-grains for livestock; (ii) processed products to cook at home; and (iii) prepared foods
                  bought away from home. Diet diversiﬁcation and these shifts are strongly linked to urbanization, but also to the
                  commercialization of food in rural areas. Table 21 shows the average calorie intake per capita by main type of food,
                  in 2009 and projected for 2030.

                  In East and Southeast Asia as a whole, rice consumption is declining among the urban population and higher-
                  income groups. Direct consumption of wheat and maize (as food) is projected to increase. Total calorie intake of
                  cereals will grow slightly, but indirect cereal and oilseed consumption (as feed) will grow much more rapidly than
                  the demand for meat. Consumption of non-grains is also growing faster and further in urban areas than in rural areas
                  in Asia. As countries urbanize, the value chain embodies a much higher degree of processing and cold storage. Urban
                  consumers have a much higher share of prepared foods in their diet. Demand for meat has doubled in quantity per
                  capita in the ﬁfty years between 1961 and 2009 and can be expected to double again between 2015 and 2030. The
                  strong and steady growth in meat consumption, particularly of pork and poultry, has huge indirect consequences
                  through the rapid growth in the demand for animal feed (Agrifood Consulting International 2014). Demand for ﬁsh
                  and seafood products has more than doubled in per capita terms from 1961 to 2009. Fish consumption per capita
                  is expected to increase by around 50 percent between now and 2030. Dairy products are expected to become the
                  fastest growing food category as demand will continue to catch up with the world’s standard levels of consumption.

                  Growing population, rising incomes, and dietary changes will require huge additional volumes of some of the
                  main groups of commodities—apart from the basic staples—to become available to meet the food demand
                  of 2030. Given the trends and projections presented in Table 21, the value of food demand in East and Southeast
                  Asia could increase by 30 percent between 2009 and 2030 in constant dollars. In value terms, according to available
                  projections, food consumption for the selected commodity groups and countries could go up from $824 billion in
                  2009 to above $2 trillion in 2030—equivalent in constant dollars to around $1,062 billion, i.e., an increase of nearly
                  30 percent. The ﬁnal composition of demand will of course be inﬂuenced by relative prices for different categories


                  30   A recent study on China has shown that between 1980 and 2009, one third of the increase in food consumption could be attributed to the country`s population growth, and the
                       remaining two-thirds to dietary changes China’s Urbanization and Food Security, World Bank, 2014.

            and increased nutrition awareness—then
            the composition of food calorie consumption will look quite different. As recently as the late 1990s, rice accounted
            for nearly 70 percent of Vietnam’s food calorie consumption. Rice’s share of calories has been declining steadily and
            reached 52 percent in 2009 (see Figure 29). By 2030, rice’s share is expected to further decline to just over one-
            third of the total. Animal products including seafood are expected to account for just under one-third while the
            remaining one-third could come from edible oil, fruits and vegetables, sugar, and various processed foods. Rapid
            growth in milk consumption is expected to continue.

            If such consumption patterns emerge, then the economic implications will be very large. Figure 30 highlights
            the current and expected volume and values of different food categories. While aggregate rice consumption would
            fall in volume by around 10 percent, the value of this, in current value terms, would be substantially lower than that
            in 2009 given an expected decline in real prices for rice. In contrast, the value of domestic spending on livestock
            products and seafood will surge. While direct human consumption of maize is unlikely to grow much, there could be
            signiﬁcant market opportunities for maize and other crops for animal feed, if the productivity of such crops can be

                  feed and feed ingredient imports could continue to grow. While many factors might inﬂuence absolute and relative
                  prices for different food commodities, the general picture is likely to hold, yet maybe with less dramatic shifts in
                  the value-composition of the domestic food market. Still, if this is the broad direction, then there will be large
                  opportunities in the animal-protein space; and there will be a premium on effective animal disease control and
                  food safety management, and on the development of integrated cold chains to maintain quality and reduce physical
                  wastage of higher-value perishables.

                  Along with changes in domestic food consumption and spending, major changes could shake the structure
                  of the agro-food system, and the behavior of downstream actors. Structural changes in the food market will
                  involve the number of segments and sub-segments of agro-food supply chains, and the degree of concentration and

                  include how actors per segment buy, make, and sell; their choice of technology, the role of market practices, such
                  as quality standards and contracts, and the extent of vertical and horizontal integration and coordination among
                  market actors. “Expectations” and “conﬁdence” become critical behavioral dimensions of change. The essence of the
                  transformation is the shift from a system that is local, small-scale, based on spot markets, and labor-intensive, to
                  a system with geographically long supply chains, with varying degrees of disintermediation, and with increasingly
                  capital-intensive technology used in all segments. In relation to the above, Vietnam’s food retail industry will
                  continue to modernize (Reardon et al. 2014). While supermarkets are attracting increasing investment, their share
                  of total food expenditures remains lower in Vietnam than elsewhere in the region. Whether this share grows to 30 or
                  50 percent by 2030 will depend upon demographic factors, urban land markets, and the extent to which Vietnam’s
                  current wholesale and wet markets are upgraded over the years to assure higher levels of food safety.

                  How this plays out will have widespread repercussions. A pattern observed elsewhere is that modern retail trade
                  starts off with the trade of processed foods (canned, dry, and packaged items such as rice, noodles, and edible
                  oils) and later on includes semi-processed foods (dairy products, processed and packaged meat products, processed
                  fruits) and ﬁnally fresh fruits and vegetables (IFPRI 2008). This is a reﬂection of the risks linked to perishable
                  produce, marketed volumes, seasonality in supply, and the challenge of standardizing quality. The risks involved
                  need to be managed and this requires the procurement system to become vertically coordinated, from farm to fork.

            It also requires the establishment of traceability systems. This is often accompanied by the emergence of formal and
            informal contracts, possibly including the forward provision of credit, inputs, and technical support to producers;
            and a shift from local procurement by each store, to centralized procurement using distribution centers, coupled
            with a wider procurement hinterland and elongated supply chains that may involve national, regional, and global
            sources of supply (Reardon et al. 2014). Modern procurement systems use distribution centers and warehouse
            networks to achieve economies of scale.

            There may be no way to stop the consolidation and disintermediation processes that make sense from an
            economic and business perspective. The issue for public policy is how to guide and support the private sector to
            deliver outcomes that are not only economically efﬁcient but also considered socially desirable—without getting in
            the way. Experience has shown that policies can play a key role in facilitating the adaptation of small farmers and
            small-scale operators and their inclusion in modern marketing chains. There are a variety of models for inclusive
            value chains, the suitability of which depends upon the local context and the characteristics of the commodity.
            Systems of contract farming are appropriate and feasible in some contexts; in others the aggregation and transaction
            cost problem needs to involve farmers organized in a different fashion, including commercial cooperatives (Labaste
            and Jaffee 2015).




            International Commodity Markets

            Multiple organizations have modeled expected trends in international commodity markets over the coming
            decade. The results vary, although these variations are more common in relation to the magnitude rather than the
            directions of expected changes. For the purposes of this report, the predictions from recent USDA (2015) and OECD/
            FAO (2015) studies are highlighted.

            With regard to consumption, global demand for agricultural commodities will continue to rise through 2024
            in both the USDA’s and OECD/FAO’s forecasts. According to the OECD/FAO, however, consumption growth, while
            robust, will be less so than over the past decade. Growth will be strongest for grains, oilseeds, cotton, and livestock
            products, and come mostly from changes in low- and middle-income countries (USDA) (see Box 5 on the outlook for
            cereals). Key drivers include population and income growth, and with these, urbanization and dietary diversiﬁcation
            (USDA). The ongoing evolution of dietary preferences will particularly boost demand for meat and dairy, along with
            the coarse grains and protein meals that are used as animal feed (OECD/FAO). Other related factors include improved
            infrastructure, and greater access to modern food markets (USDA). Meanwhile, oil prices are expected to remain
            low, putting downward pressure on prices by keeping energy and chemical costs down (on the supply side), and
            moderating the appetite for energy crops (on the demand side) (OECD/FAO). Major exceptions to this are likely to
            be policy-driven, as in Brazil and Indonesia, where government incentives are expected to fuel biofuel expansion.

            Global production of agricultural commodities is anticipated to rise—faster than the world population, in
            the USDA’s view. This growth outlook reﬂects the expectation that yields will continue to improve as a result of
            technological enhancements—albeit at a slowing rate (the continuation of a two decade slow down. To a lesser
            extent, it also reﬂects an expected expansion in agricultural land, though that expansion will be constrained
            by decreasing water availability and rising water access costs in many places (USDA), and the translation of
            environmental and responsible investment concerns into policy (OECD/FAO). Potential for land expansion exists

                  primarily in South America, according to the OECD/FAO. By contrast, land and natural resource constraints are
                  particularly binding in the Asia-Paciﬁc region (OECD/FAO). Meanwhile, the coming decade is likely to see a cooling
                  of investment in large scale farming operations, as the high commodity price levels that attracted investors are
                  unlikely to be sustained (OECD/FAO). China is the only signiﬁcant producer country where production is not expected
                  to rise, in the OECD/FAO’s view.

                  Growth in trade ﬂows, the OECD/FAO predicts, will slow relative to the past decade, though will generally
                  keep pace with production. Meanwhile, the world will source most of its agricultural exports from a narrower set
                  of exporting countries, making trade ﬂows more vulnerable to disaster- or policy-related disruptions. By contrast,
                  imports will become increasingly dispersed over a large number of countries.

                  Projecting prices into the future, and especially projecting the expected terms of trade for agriculture, is
                  a hazardous exercise. Only a year ago, before international oil prices plummeted, the World Bank was projecting
                  more or less a steady decline in the terms of trade for agriculture during the upcoming decade. The updated analysis
                  in 2015 still projects a decline in agricultural commodity prices, yet, at least until 2020, more favorable terms
                  of trade considering the lower fertilizer and energy
                  prices. Yet, the current projection is for these terms   Table 22: International Commodity Price Index Projections
                  of trade to turn in a negative direction during the      (2010=100)31

                       Cereals will remain the most consumed agricultural products, predicts OECD/FAO (2015), and consumption will increase
                       by 390 million metric tons (Mt) by 2024, primarily in response to growing demand for animal feed (which will claim
                       70 percent of coarse grain, i.e., grains other than rice and wheat). Boosted by meat demand and the intensiﬁcation
                       of animal agriculture, trade in soybean meal as a source of livestock feed, for example, will continue to grow strongly,
                       particularly as many countries have no choice but to meet their growing need for oilseed through imports (USDA
                       2015). Imports of the meal are expected to climb especially fast in Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and
                       Malaysia. Competition for imports will also come from rising demand from North Africa and the Middle East and South

                  American countries other than Brazil and Argentina. Imports of wheat—which is primarily consumed by humans—are
                  also expected to rise especially rapidly in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh and the Philippines (e.g., for bakery and
                  specialty products) (USDA).
                  Mostly grown for human consumption, rice demand will grow more moderately than that for coarse grains—though only
                  slightly less than in the past decade—with consumption slated to increase by 62.5 Mt (13 percent), under the OECD/FAO
                  forecast. Nearly all of the increase in rice consumption is expected to come from developing countries. Rice production
                  is expected to rise by close to 70 Mt, or 14 percent over 2012–2014 levels—with 28 percent of that increase coming
                  from LDCs, and 69 percent coming from other developing countries (OECD/FAO). Rice trade, according to the USDA’s
                  forecast, is projected to grow 1.8 percent per year from 2015–2016 to 2024–2025, reaching nearly 50 Mt, an increase of
                  41 percent over the previous decade average. World rice trade as a share of world consumption has grown from 4 percent
                  in the early 1990s to 8.6 percent; and this share is projected to rise to 9.5 percent by the end of the next decade.
                  China is and will remain the largest importing country. China became a net importer of rice in 2011–2012; however, its
                  rice imports are expected to gradually decline (USDA). Still, its imports in absolute terms will remain historically high—
                  particularly for lower-priced rice from Southeast Asia. The next largest rice importers after China are Nigeria, Indonesia,
                  Iran, and the Philippines. Each are expected to import 1.9 Mt to 2.2 Mt per year by the end of the coming decade. Other
                  large importers include Iraq and Saudi Arabia (>1.5 Mt per year), South Africa and Malaysia (> 1 Mt per year). Due to a
                  rising population and land constraints, Bangladesh’s rice imports will be among the fastest rising, as these could go from
                  0.6 Mt in 2015–16, to 1.5 Mt in 2024–2025—an annual growth rate of over 10 percent.




            Climate Change Impacts

            As this report documents, Vietnam’s agricultural sector is undergoing a variety of transformations as a result
            of demographic, economic, market, and other factors. Going forward, Vietnam’s changing climate could gain
            prominence as a driver of sector transformation as well as in changes in the geography, nature, and quality of
            production. Indeed, temperature and sea-level rise, the disruption of rainfall patterns, and the intensiﬁcation of
            weather extremes will alter sector constraints over time, namely with respect to land-use possibilities. That said,
            with proactive policies and investments that sustain a fast pace of sector restructuring, Vietnamese agriculture has
            the opportunity to remain ahead of the race against climate change.

            In the timeframe of the coming two decades, many of the changes that are anticipated as a result of climate
            change—including a contraction of rice production, further aquaculture development, and an end to coffee’s
            and other tree crops’ physical expansion—will largely be consistent with the sector’s potential, not only to
            adapt, but also to thrive by “producing more from less.” In these and other cases, the challenges brought by a
            changing climate need not represent binding constraints. This report argues that this will be possible with targeted
            investments in a range of no-regrets measures illustrated in Chapter 4. These include investments in agricultural
            innovation systems, in the strengthening of natural resource and farm management skills, and in the institutional
            capacity to mount, monitor, learn from, and redirect a coordinated climate change response (i.e., institutions
            equipped for adaptive management).

            In Vietnam, as in many other parts of the world, several manifestations of climate change have not gone
            unnoticed by farmers, and over time these are projected to become more pronounced still.

                       x Since 1958, Vietnam’s average surface temperature has increased by 0.5–0.7°C, with the largest departures
                         from the norm observed during the winter months, and in the north of the country. Since the 1970s, temperature
                         has risen much faster in Vietnam than it has worldwide, on average during each decade. At the same time, the
                         incidence of extended cold fronts has increased, as has the number of exceptionally hot days and nights, in
                         every season (McSweeney et al. 2010 a&b). Looking ahead to 2030, average temperature is expected to rise by
                         0.5–1.2°C, compared to 1980–1999 levels, depending on the scenario and region (World Bank 2010). Warming
                         will be felt more acutely in the summer, potentially resulting in unprecedented heat extremes in the 2030s and
                         2040s.

                       x In relation to rainfall patterns, no clear trend has been discernable across regions and time periods during
                         the past 50–60 years. Overall, rainfall decreased by around 2 percent over the 50-year period spanning 1958–
                         2007, but this trend was not seen consistently (MONRE 2010). Looking forward, while overall rainfall may or
                         may not continue to decline (it could decrease or increase depending on the global warming scenario and
                         region)32, it will almost certainly become more concentrated and intense. The difference in rainfall between
                         wet and dry seasons is expected to become more pronounced, which is to say that the wet season will
                         become wetter, and the dry season drier.

                       x Changes in temperature and rainfall distribution will affect water resources. For example, river ﬂows are
                         expected to decline in the South, groundwater is expected to drop compared to present-day levels (GIZ 2012),
                         and evapotranspiration rates are expected to rise, causing greater demand for irrigation. Evapotranspiration in
                         the Central Highlands, for example, is expected to increase by 8.5 percent (1,726 mm) by the middle of this
                         century (MONRE 2010 in Haggar and Schepp 2012).

                       x Meanwhile, over the past several decades, the sea level has been rising at an accelerating rate: by 1.3–2.3 mm
                         per year between 1961 and 2003, and by 2.4–3.8 mm per year since. By 2040, the sea level will likely have risen
                         by 23–24 cm over 1980–1999 levels along Vietnam’s shorelines, and that could increase to 28–33 cm by mid-
                         century (World Bank 2010, based on ofﬁcial projections).

                       x Sea level rise is anticipated to exacerbate coastal erosion and salinity intrusion, both of which are already
                         under way. Severe coastal erosion has already been observed in parts of the Red River Delta, for example, with
                         Hai Thinh experiencing more than 45 percent erosion linked to sea level rise between 1965 and 2005. Similarly,
                         Vietnam’s low-lying coastal areas are already dealing with salinity intrusion during the dry season. In the
                         Mekong River Delta in particular, the area affected by salinity intrusion (at a concentration of 4g/liter) could
                         increase from around 1.3 million hectares to over 1.7 million hectares by 2050 with a 30 cm rise in sea level
                         (World Bank 2010). Of note, these forecasts do not take into account the exacerbating effect of subsidence,
                         which could reach 9 mm per year, or 1.5 times the rate of sea level rise (Doyle et al. 2010 in IFAD 2014).

                  The consequences of climate change for agriculture will depend not only on what global warming scenario
                  unfolds, but also on the country’s ability to adapt to its new environment; and this will depend on many
                  factors including the speed at which the climate changes, private resourcefulness, and public sector action.
                  Thus, what the above means for the sector may differ substantially from modeled projections, not only because of

                  32     For example, for the Northwest region, the IPSL model predicts a 16.5 percent decline in annual precipitation by 2030 while the GISS model points to a 9.8 percent increase.
                         For the Mekong Delta, these two models, respectively point to a 10.5 percent decline and a 5.2 percent increase. The MONRE model anticipates much lower impacts by 2030—a
                         1.7 percent increase for the Northwest and a 0.9 percent increase for the Mekong Delta.

            climate forecasting uncertainty, but also because the models assume a limited range of adaptations, spontaneous
            or planned.33 In reality, agriculture is constantly adapting to change—up to a point—giving little credence to a
            do-nothing scenario. Nonetheless, impact projections offer some insight into the nature and magnitude of sector
            risks.

            Rice production could be impacted by several factors, including warming and water availability, and in
            Vietnam’s deltaic regions where much of the agricultural land lies 2 meters below sea level, by the risk of
            salinity intrusion and inundation (which impact the area considered suitable for rice). Warming, pest inci-
            dence, and other factors are expected to impact rice yields.34 For example, under the MONRE scenarios, IFPRI has
            estimated that national level rice yields would be 4.3 percent lower over the 2016–2045 period than would have
            been the case in the absence of climate change. For the Mekong River Delta, the reduction from the business-as-
            usual scenario is projected to be 4.2 percent.

            Sea level rise and salinity intrusion will almost certainly impact the geography of rice production in the future.
            On this, the time horizon one takes is very important in considering potential impacts. MONRE has estimated that
            the sea level could rise by 17 cm over 1980–1999 levels by 2030. By 2050, the sea level could rise 30 cm above
            baseline, while by 2100, it could rise by as much as 75 to 100 cm.35 This long-term picture presents a frightening
            prospect for many of Vietnam’s coastal areas and is leading to discussions about the need for a complex system
            of sea dykes, sea walls, and mangrove forests to protect these coastal areas. However, nearer term scenarios are
            less dire. Figure 31 highlights the suitability of different parts of the Mekong Delta for rice production under the
            condition of a 17 cm sea level rise. The green color denotes “highly suitable”, the yellow is “suitable,” the red is
            “marginally suitable,” and the turquoise areas are “ﬂooded.” The white areas (e.g., the southern tip of the Delta)
            are unsuitable for rice production due to restrictions or topography (e.g., urban land, sandy land, mountain,
            aquaculture, or other). It is important to note that a very large proportion of this red and white area has already
            been converted to aquaculture production. Most of the now dominant, core rice area would remain highly suitable
            or suitable, with the exception being some parts of the Kien Giang coastal area which will become more marginal
            for rice production.

            These projections reﬂect the reality that climate change will reshape the rice sector’s physical production
            constraints. However, they need to be put in perspective. For one, the projected climate impacts do not preclude
            a future of higher rice yields, on average, and in strategic rice-producing areas in particular. Average yields have
            increased for the past two decades, albeit at a declining rate, rising by 2.87 percent per annum over the 1996 to
            2005 period and by 1.72 percent per annum between 2006 and 2010. Under a pessimistic scenario in which
            average rice yields would grow only by 1 percent per annum over the coming two decades, this would take the
            average rice yield to 6.47 tons per hectare by 2035, from a base of 5.3 tons per hectare in 2014. Even if climate
            change resulted in a 10 percent decrease in yields from that trajectory, by 2035 the average yield would still be
            5.82 tons per hectare, which is 10 percent higher than the current average and higher than the current average in
            any other Southeast Asian country. One also has to factor in the sector’s potential to adapt. The development of

            33    They also do not account for the potential positive effects of CO2 fertilization on crop yields.
            34    Analysis is this ﬁeld continues to evolve with reﬁnements in broad impact analysis and then drilling down to examine the speciﬁc prospective impacts for particular regions
                  and crops. For example, two publications released in 2010 and involving overlapping work teams, report somewhat different estimates for expected climate change impacts
                  on Vietnamese and Mekong Delta rice production. That work did not take into account distinctive rice production patterns within the Mekong Delta and thus the prospective
                  impact of sea level rise, salt water intrusion, and ﬂood inundation in the core growing zone vs. supplementary growing areas. See Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change,
                  World Bank, and Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture and Policy Options for Adaptation: The Case of Vietnam by Yu et al., IFPRI Discussion Paper 01015.
            35    A 1-meter rise in sea level would directly result in a loss of more than 5 percent of the country’s land area, more than 7 percent of its agricultural land and 28 percent of its
                  wetlands (Dasgupta et al. 2007 cited in IFAD 2014).

            Meanwhile, average rice yields already mask stark contrasts within the subsector (relating both to growers’
            geography and sophistication), and climate change may amplify those contrasts, with very different impli-
            cations depending on whether one is concerned with commercial or subsistence production. Today, Vietnam’s
            rice growers range from highly productive commercial ones, concentrated in the Mekong Delta, to household
            subsistence ones (in every region).36 The core production areas are currently in the midst of processes of land
            consolidation, mechanization, shifts to lower input (including water) practices, and increased collective action in
            post-harvest handling, storage and sale. The demographics and the management of rice production in these areas
            will continue to change for economic reasons. This will inﬂuence future capacities—ﬁnancial and technical—to
            manage emerging risks. Average yields in the core rice areas of the Mekong River Delta during the winter-spring
            season are currently between 6 and 7.5 tons per hectare, depending upon the district. It is that core area which
            has accounted for virtually all of the region’s rice production growth since 2000 and which accounts for a domi-
            nant proportion of the marketable rice surplus. A changing climate will probably drive rice production to concen-
            trate further in areas which are especially suitable for multi-cropping and in the winter-spring season where the
            growing conditions and the harvested rice quality are the best. This would be a continuation of the trend—at
            least within the Mekong Delta—since 2000 (Jaffee et al. 2012 b).

            It is also important to note that the impacts of upstream development could have impacts on production
            patterns and rice yields that outweigh those of climate change. In particular, the upstream damming of the
            Mekong River in neighboring countries will inﬂuence water and sediment ﬂows. While a more even annual ﬂow of
            water could make more water available in the dry season and counteract the likely ﬂood inundation effects of sea
            level rise during the wet season, the reduced sediment ﬂows could adversely impact soil fertility plus have a strong
            negative impact on ﬁsheries (International Centre for Environmental Management 2010).

            A second consideration is that the macro-economic implications of potential decreases in Mekong Delta and
            national rice production will largely depend on their broader context, including future trends in domestic
            consumption and export opportunities. Per capita rice consumption in Vietnam is expected to decline by 10 to
            30 percent over the coming two decades, with that higher level of decline placing consumption at a level which
            is similar to that of China, Malaysia, India, and South Korea today. Factoring in an aging population and slower
            population growth, this would result in an absolute decline in rice consumed within Vietnam. The country
            presently has a very large exportable surplus cushion. Thus, the expected impacts of climate change—at least
            over the next several decades—would not pose a threat to national food security.37 Reference is often made to
            the potential loss of rice-land. Yet, what might happen to such land? If that land is shifted to aquaculture
            production then there could be both private and social beneﬁts from this change, in the forms of higher income,
            improved nutrition, and higher export levels in an industry in which Vietnam has a clear comparative advantage.
            How the food security of individual households or speciﬁc communities will be affected (in a distributional sense)
            is a different matter. Yet this too needs to be seen from the wider perspective that agricultural productivity (as it
            will be impacted by climate change) is only one of several key factors—including factors outside the agricultural
            sector altogether—that will shape the prospects of current rural households.

            The future of aquaculture in Vietnam generally looks promising, making the subsector look as much
            like an adaptation solution as a source of vulnerability, at least in the near-term. There is evidence that

            36    Most of the analytical work dealing with the potential climate change impacts on rice production has focused on the Mekong Delta region. Examining potential impacts in other
                  regions should like-wise take into account the changing roles of rice in farming systems and livelihoods.
            37    See Jaffee et al. 2012a for an elaboration on various rice supply and demand scenarios for Vietnam until 2030.

                  rising temperatures and increased inundation during the wet season, within a range, could improve aquaculture
                  productivity, though higher temperatures could also result in unwelcome pressures, such as eutrophication and
                  disease (De Silva and Soto 2009, JICA 2013). More importantly, in the longer-term, parts of the subsector are
                  in a strong position to adapt to some of the real climate threats that lie ahead (marine ﬁsheries may be harder
                  pressed to adapt to a loss of natural habitat). Over time, certainly, maintaining aquaculture productivity will rest
                  on signiﬁcant investments in R&D, namely (though not only) to breed aquatic species varieties that are adapted to
                  higher temperatures and salinity. Adapting shrimp and catﬁsh aquaculture to changing conditions in the Mekong
                  River Delta (which accounts for over 70 percent of Vietnam’s aquaculture production) could prove very costly (Kam
                  et al. 2012, Cheung et al. 2010) and, again, should be considered against the beneﬁts of those investments and the
                  availability of alternatives. Structural factors also need to be taken into account. Vietnam’s aquaculture sector is
                  currently experiencing a consolidation—a process which is quite advanced for Pangasius and incipient for shrimp.
                  Aquaculture enterprises in the future may have stronger management capabilities and ﬁnancial resources, facilitating
                  a smoother process of adaptation than might otherwise occur.

                  Coffee production, which mainly occurs in the Central Highlands, could be hard hit by the effects of climate
                  change on evapotranspiration, the frequency of hot days and nights, pest and disease incidence, the occurrence
                  and intensity of droughts (all expected to increase), and the availability of irrigation water (expected to
                  decrease in the dry season) (Haggar and Schepp 2012). Coffee’s reliance on irrigation, and continuing expansion
                  onto lands that are marginally suited to the crop, make it particularly vulnerable to disruptions in water resources
                  and temperature stress. A decade or two from now, climate change could create pressure on forested land as coffee
                  growers seek to migrate to higher and cooler altitudes. Carried by half a million weakly organized smallholders,
                  moreover, the sector has limited capacity to mount a coordinated response—though this may be changing
                  (Havemann et al. 2015). In a more positive light, however, the rampant over-irrigation of coffee observed in the
                  Central Highlands to this day suggests that there is ample room to use water resources more efﬁciently (D’Haeze
                  2008 in Amarasinghe et al. 2015). Furthermore, climate change may strengthen farmers’ incentive to use resources
                  more judiciously, while weakening the attraction of already marginal land. Managing incursions into forested
                  highlands, meanwhile, is consistent with the government’s plans to reign in coffee’s uncontrolled expansion. In
                  fact, the coffee master plan anticipates a reduction in the coffee planted area from over 625,000 hectares today to
                  500,000 hectares.

                  Livestock systems are also expected to suffer—not just from temperature change, but also more signiﬁcant-
                  ly from disease-related impacts of climate change. Here too, proactive investments—such as ones geared to
                  strengthen early warning and veterinary services—will help mitigate anticipated losses. In this case, moreover,
                  the challenges ahead may have a silver lining, as they may help to moderate the anticipated increase in meat
                  consumption and production, and thus mitigate the human health and environmental costs associated with
                  these.38 As with the other production systems discussed above, climate change may not be the greatest risk that
                  the livestock subsector faces. One important vulnerability that Vietnam’s livestock may need to contend with, for
                  instance, is its increasing reliance on imported feed (i.e., coarse grain, soybean meal) and increased competition
                  from meat product imports under the Trans-Paciﬁc Partnership.




                  38   Meat consumption is associated with heightened risk of cancer, cardiovascular and other disease, and meat production is a major source of climate and other environmental
                       pollutants.

            Anticipating Vietnam Agriculture: Circa 2030

            While Vietnam has its own distinctive features, it is instructive to consider the trajectory of agro-food sys-
            tems in other middle-income countries, especially in Asia, as urbanization and per capita income rise from
            Vietnam’s current levels. Given the current trends and available evidence, the share of primary agriculture can be
            expected to decline over the coming two decades, perhaps by 0.5 percent per annum. By the early 2030s primary
            agriculture would then account for some 8-9 percent of Vietnam’s GDP. However, agro-industry, together with
            food distribution and logistical (and other services), could account for nearly double this share (15 percent)39 .
            The agro-food complex would then still account for nearly one-fourth of total GDP.

            The expectation is that primary agriculture (including ﬁsheries and forestry) will provide the major source
            of direct livelihood or employment for between 25 percent and 30 percent of the population (down from the
            current 47 percent), with the lower end of this range representing the current pattern in Turkey, and the upper
            end representing what China is likely to experience later this decade. The share of employment in agro-industry
            and agro-food services will likely be just below its share of GDP. Hence, the overall agro-food complex would still
            account for a minimum of 35 percent of employment in the early 2030s. It will be higher than this if the structural
            transformation of rural areas does not accelerate and many people still ﬁnd themselves trapped between inﬂexible
            land markets and irrigation services on the one hand, and a lack of remunerative jobs or business opportunities in
            manufacturing and especially services on the other.

            Increasingly, Vietnamese agriculture is likely to become spatially specialized. The further development of
            beverage and industrial crops will concentrate in the South-East and Central Highlands, as would the associated
            agro-industrial investments. Forestry production will be further developed in the Northern Mountainous areas, in
            the upland portions of the central region, and in the ecologically critical areas in the Central Highlands and Mekong
            Delta. Horticulture, ﬂoriculture, and medicinal plants will gain more prominence in peri-urban areas, and in speciﬁc
            sites in the upland or mountainous areas where the agro-ecological conditions are most suitable. Poultry and pig
            production will shift further away from Vietnam’s large cities.

            The future trajectory for agriculture in Vietnam’s different regions will depend upon many factors. Of course,
            each region’s natural resource endowment and the legacy pattern of agricultural development will be inﬂuential.
            Also inﬂuential will be demographic trends, including out-migration and the likely average aging of the household
            heads engaged in farming in the future. The competition for resources from other sectors will also, increasingly,
            come into play. For example, while there is potential for further aquaculture development in Vietnam’s Central
            Coast, that area will see increased investment in energy services and possibly accelerated industrial, real estate
            and tourism—all of which may compete with or impinge upon aquaculture expansion. Climate change will call for
            improvements in adaptive management capacities, new technologies, and land-use changes to address changes in
            weather patterns, and new and heightened production risks.

            About one-third of the current paddy-land will likely have shifted to alternative agricultural land uses or
            ecosystem services by 2030.40 Paddy-land affected by saline intrusion will be converted to aquaculture, involving
            more diverse species than at present. Much of the paddy land in peri-urban areas will be converted to vegetable

            39    In 2011, food and beverages accounted for some 20 percent of Vietnam’s industrial output. Its growth in output and output per worker over the 2000–09 were quite similar to
                  that of many of industrial subsectors (Nguyen et al 2014).
            40    This will help to accelerate agricultural growth as simulated by Gisseke et al (2013).

                  ornamental plant production. Paddy land near the coast and ecologically sensitive sites will take on more multi-
                  functional roles, such as ones that maintain or revive biodiversity and support eco-tourism. Where drainage services
                  are improved, some paddy land will be converted to maize production.

                  Remaining rice-based production systems will also change. These will increasingly incorporate rotation crops to
                  improve soils and manage pests, and tend to specialize—notably in fragrant varieties of rice and organic or other
                  ecological production methods. Despite the decline in the rice growing area, Vietnam will continue to produce a
                  signiﬁcant exportable surplus with, hopefully, a larger share consisting of high quality and specialty variety products
                  that generate higher proﬁts for farmers and agro-enterprises.

                  With regard to sectoral performance, one needs to be cautious in identifying speciﬁc quantitative targets
                  as the outcomes will be affected by important developments outside of agriculture, including international
                  factors over which Vietnam may have little capacity to inﬂuence. Still, it is certainly possible to outline a set of
                  aspirations for the sector relative to its past performance and relative to that of its international competitors and
                  regional peers.

                  The following represent a set of ambitious yet realistic outcomes that Vietnamese agriculture can achieve in
                  the 2025–2030 time range. While not exhaustive, these illustrate the range of accomplishments that are within
                  Vietnam’s reach, taking into account expected conditions in international commodity markets, changes in domestic
                  food demand, climate change impacts, and past performance.

                  Sustainable Agricultural Productivity and Growth

                    x The agricultural growth rate will cease its ten-year decline and revert to the pace experienced in years just
                      after the turn of the millennium at between 3.0 and 3.5 percent.

                    x This acceleration of growth will come primarily from growth in total factor productivity (TFP) and the reversal
                      of its recent decline. Akin to patterns observed in other high performing middle-income countries, more than
                      80 percent of growth will be due to TFP growth. Agricultural labor productivity will increase substantially, and
                      this will close the gap which currently exists between Vietnam, Thailand, and China. It will also close the gap
                      between Vietnam’s agricultural sector and its labor-intensive manufacturing subsectors.

                    x The current gap in water productivity in Vietnam’s large irrigation schemes (vis-à-vis those in China and other
                      middle-income Asian countries) will be closed as a result of land-use changes and improved water management
                      and irrigation services.

                    x The reality and reputation of Vietnamese agriculture as eco-unfriendly will fundamentally change. In large
                      portions of the sector, the monitoring of agronomic practices against sustainability standards, natural resource
                      management, waste management, and energy efﬁcient methods will have been mainstreamed. Vietnam will be
                      among the leading developing countries in the effective utilization of agricultural wastes—for energy, feed,
                      composting, and other purposes. Dimensions of Vietnamese agriculture will be domestically and internationally
                      recognized for their multi-functionality—including their protection of landscapes and contribution to eco-
                      tourism.

                  x The sector will continue to play a major role in meeting national food security, servicing increasingly diverse
                    food demands and meeting domestic consumer expectations for safety, quality, and price. And Vietnam will
                    meet or exceed all of the World Health Assembly nutrition targets for 2025, including those related to under-
                    nutrition (i.e., child stunting), micro-nutrient deﬁciencies, and obesity. While this is a multi-sector challenge,
                    the agricultural sector will help promote a healthy and diverse diet.

            Competitiveness in Domestic and International Markets

                  x Vietnam will rank in the top 10 to 20 percent of developing countries in terms of the proportion of its agricultural
                    commodity export volume which is derived from production areas which are either internationally certiﬁed or
                    otherwise recognized for compliance with a broad range of environmental and social standards.

                  x More than 50 percent of Vietnam’s agro-food exports will consist of processed and other value-added products,
                    more than double the current proportion. More than two dozen brands of Vietnamese companies that make
                    agro-food products will be well-recognized in major regional and international markets. In the process of
                    this recognition, the current discrepancy between the high international regard for Vietnamese cuisine and the
                    invisibility of most Vietnamese foods and raw materials abroad will be resolved.

            These aspirations reﬂect a combination of economic, social, and environmental considerations. This sustainable
            development (triple bottom line) orientation was emphasized in the 2013 Agricultural Restructuring Plan (ARP).
            In it, economic goals were articulated in terms of “maintaining robust agricultural growth and improving sectoral
            competitiveness primarily through advances in productivity, efﬁciency, value-addition and better meeting the needs
            and preferences of consumers.” Social goals reﬂected broader rural development aspirations in terms of “continuing
            to raise farmer incomes and rural living standards, address lagging regions; reduce the incidence and severity of
            rural poverty and ensure national and household food and nutritional security.” Goals related to the environment
            were conveyed in the ARP as “improving natural resources management, reducing the sector’s adverse environmental
            impacts, contributing environmental beneﬁts and improving capacities to manage weather-related hazards.”

            V
                   ietnam’s agricultural sector now sits at a crossroads. While there are several very dynamic elements within
                   the sector, this report has highlighted some trends and contextual realities that demand new approaches.
                   These include declining rates of agricultural GDP and productivity growth; a growing gap between farm and
            non-farm incomes; and an erosion of natural capital that can no longer be ignored. They also include growing
            competition for land, labor, water, and other resources; booming domestic demand not just for more food, but
            also for more choices, more diversity, and more safety; and intensifying competition and pressure from buyers in
            international commodity markets—all of this in context of a changing climate.

            Public investment and various forms of government support have played very important roles in Vietnam’s
            agricultural development. A recent OECD report (2015) provides a very good historical review of agricultural
            policies in Vietnam, spanning three phases (see Box 6).



                  Box 6: The Policy Context for Vietnamese Agriculture

                  Reuniﬁcation (1976–1986)
                  Following the 1976 reuniﬁcation of the country, the Communist Party took a centrally planned approach to the economy.
                  The government hoped to achieve food self-sufﬁciency and to supply inexpensive rice and other staple crops to a
                  growing industrial sector. Small farms were consolidated under cooperatives growing annual crops while perennial crops
                  like coffee were grown on state farms. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) provided inputs and managed markets. Goals were
                  centrally managed and prices mandated.
                  Collectivization, well established in the North, did not take hold in the South and about 75 percent of farming households
                  remained outside of the newly established cooperative system (Wolz and Pham 2010 in OECD 2015). Farmers looked to
                  sell their output on unofﬁcial private markets, where prices were substantially higher. By 1980, the agricultural sector
                  was in disarray. In early 1981, the centralized cooperative system gave way to an in-kind contract arrangement under
                  which households were allowed to farmland managed by the cooperative (and owned by the state) in exchange for
                  meeting production quotas. Water, seeds, fertilizer and other inputs were provided by the cooperatives as part of the
                  contract. Surplus production belonged to the farmer and could be sold to the state or to private buyers. Prices paid by
                  the state were slowly raised to match informal market prices.
                  Following a brief period of success, the contract system started to break down. Cooperatives were often unable to
                  provide the inputs contracting farmers required. In-kind quotas were often raised, cutting in to farmers’ incentives
                  (Kirk and Nugyen, 2009 in OECD 2015). Agricultural growth slowed and turned negative in 1987 (Pham, 2006 in OECD
                  2015). At the same time, a bout of hyperinﬂation gripped the country. Near-famine conditions and widespread food
                  shortages spread to large areas of the country (OECD 2015). Around the same time, the Soviet Union announced an end
                  to economic aid to Vietnam.
                  Renovation (1986–1993)
                  At the historic VIth Communist Party Congress in 1986, the government abandoned the central planning model of
                  economic management and took a series of steps to renovate (doi moi) the country’s economic institutions (OECD 2015).
                  The decision was driven in part by the worsening of the economy; yet occurred in a context in which many developed
                  and developing countries were undertaking reforms, particularly in agriculture. Relevant were China’s successful market-
                  based reforms in agriculture following the failed Great Leap Forward (Akiyama et al. 2003).
                  The new policy framework beneﬁtted the agricultural sector and farming households in many ways. First and foremost,
                  agriculture was no longer viewed as a way to provide cheap food for Vietnam’s industrialization; instead, the development
                  of agriculture became a primary objective of government policy. In addition, independent household farms, rather than
                                                                                                                           Continued to next page.

                    directed cooperatives, became the basic economic engine of rural development (OECD 2015). Resolution No. 10/1988/
                    NQ-TW directed agricultural cooperatives to provide farming households with long-term leases (15 years for annual crops,
                    40 years for perennial crops). Even at the time of the reforms, the practice of leasing paddy ﬁelds to individual farmers
                    took place in some villages (OECD 2015). Farmers were also able to buy and sell animals and machinery. Cooperatives
                    were left in place to provide inputs and manage services, especially irrigation and marketing services, but as a practical
                    matter many ceased to exist. Although the cooperative structure had never taken hold in the South, there were over
                    110,000 cooperatives in the North covering 98 percent of the farms in 1980. By 1994, there were an estimated 16,243
                    cooperatives in the entire country (Wolz and Pham 2010 and Riedel and Turley 1999 in OECD 2015).
                    Initially, farmers remained obligated to meet production quotas at prices set by the state. This changed in 1992 with
                    the issuance of Decision No. 1237/1992/HDBT by the Committee of Ministers. The decision freed markets to set the
                    prices for goods and services, with the notable exception of strategic commodities and inputs including sugar, rice,
                    and fertilizer. A series of steps also opened the economy to trade. Import tariffs were cut in 1988 and trade with China
                    resumed in 1989. Private ﬁrms and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were licensed to trade with foreign ﬁrms (OECD
                    2015). During this time, the exchange rate regime changed as well, from one based on a ﬁxed rate to one in which the
                    exchange rate was allowed to ﬂuctuate within a range. As was often the case in developing countries at the time, the
                    ﬁxed-exchange-rate regime had over-valued the dong, effectively taxing agricultural exports (Krueger, Schiff and Valdés
                    1988). The effects of the reforms were dramatic. Vietnam, which had imported rice in 1987 and 1988, became the world’s
                    third largest exporter in 1989.
                    Expansion (1993–2000)
                    During this phase, many more market-reliant policies took shape as the logic of Doi Moi continued to play out. Chief
                    among these was a greater reliance on output markets and the introduction of an institutional framework for land
                    markets. The 1993 land law extended land-use rights for annual crops to 20 years and those for perennial crops to 50.
                    Households were granted certiﬁcates in the form of red books that formalized their land-use rights. The assigned rights
                    could be leased, inherited, and used as collateral for loans. Decree No. 14/1993/ND-CP established a credit policy that
                    allowed households to borrow, and credit was extended via increased government funding to the Vietnam Bank for
                    Agriculture and Rural Development. A contemporaneous Law on Agricultural Land-Use Tax gave farmers greater say in
                    marketing their production by dismantling the compulsory quota system and the agricultural output tax, and instituting
                    a land-use tax in their place. Internal trade restrictions, which had prevented rice produced in the South from moving to
                    the North, were relaxed (Benjamin and Brandt 2002 in OECD 2015).
                    Overseas trade restrictions were loosened as well. Vietnam signed a preferential trade agreement with the European
                    Economic Community in 1992, and in 1995, it joined the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and became
                    a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area. In response to large gains in rice production, export quotas were raised to
                    4.5 million tons by 1998; however, participation in the export business was still limited to a handful of national and
                    provincial SOEs (Abbott et al. 2006 in OECD 2015). It would not be until the late 2000s that private sector involvement
                    in this export trade would be encouraged.



                  Yet if one looks across an array of factor- and goods-markets, one sees a common pattern of too much state
                  and too little governance constraining the effectiveness of those markets. The following examples illustrate
                  this pattern.

                    x The government is the owner of all agricultural land, and it has placed restrictions on the size of farms and
                      the uses of agricultural land, and engaged in extensive land-use planning at multiple levels. Yet farmers
                      pay no rent or land tax, face high transaction costs in all land transactions, and encounter lax enforcement to
                      protect against land degradation or forest encroachment. Long-standing restrictions on the use of paddy-land
                      helped to ensure food security in the past, yet are now a barrier to investment in agriculture.

                  x The government controls bulk water delivery via irrigation SOEs, yet there is no transparency in the
                    performance of these companies, no pricing of irrigation water, and little or no monitoring of water-use or
                    misuse. These conditions have given rise to low water productivity and an increased level of vulnerability to the
                    impacts of climate change.

                  x The dominance of public institutions in agricultural research, and multiple ministries allocate research
                    funds in a setting in which intellectual property rights are difﬁcult to protect, agricultural machinery is
                    readily cloned or cannibalized, multiple steps are needed to initiate a research activity, and competitive or
                    venture funding for research is scarce if unavailable.

                  x SOEs continue to play a very signiﬁcant role in many commercial areas where the private sector would
                    normally invest. This includes seed and fertilizer supply, rubber production, commercial forestry, rice trade, and
                    dairy processing. Where the state is directly involved in agribusiness activity, the playing ﬁeld has generally
                    been uneven. And many state farms and plantations have low productivity. Despite (or maybe because) of
                    relatively heavy direct involvement by the state in agricultural value chains, there is generally weak strategic
                    planning and limited collective action to govern and resolve problems in these industries. For example, Vietnam
                    is the world’s third largest rice exporter yet has no commercial rice trade strategy.

                  x The agricultural sector has developed within the context of multiple quantitative targets, at the subsectoral
                    and aggregate levels. Nevertheless, the sector still features underdeveloped systems for quality, food safety,
                    and environmental management, creating concerns among consumers and exacerbating operational, livelihood,
                    and/or reputational risks for farmers and ﬁrms. While coastal provinces set export targets and compete to
                    attract more ﬁsh processing investments, hundreds of thousands of ﬁshers lose their primary livelihood as the
                    near-shore ﬁshery resources are depleted.

            Vietnam’s Agricultural Restructuring Plan of 2014 already recognizes many of these challenges and
            opportunities, and signals a shift in thinking about roles of government and spending priorities. Speciﬁcally,
            the government has begun to shift from a supply-oriented focus on agricultural production, to a focus on market-
            responsiveness and sustainability. With this comes the recognition that changes are needed in how government
            intervenes in the sector. Going forward, this reorientation will need to be put into practice and translated into
            policies and programs that allow Vietnam to realize its ambitious vision for the sector—the vision articulated in
            Chapter 3.

            How does Vietnam get from here to there? While Vietnam will need to custom-design approaches that ﬁt the
            country’s political values as well as its institutional, economic, physical, and socio-cultural realities, this ﬁnal
            chapter offers some general direction, and presents approaches that have been tried elsewhere. Vietnam may be
            able to borrow from these and many others not covered here.

                  Role of the State: Cross-Cutting Considerations

                  The following are cross-cutting considerations on the roles and approaches of government.


                  Looking Beyond Traditional Agricultural Policy

                  Many of the challenges that Vietnamese agriculture faces as it transitions to an efﬁciency-based and higher
                  value-added sector cannot be addressed exclusively through changes in agricultural policies. Addressing the
                  sector’s transitional and longer-term competitiveness and sustainability challenges requires broader, economy-wide
                  reforms, especially in relation to land (ownership/tenure and usage rights), the role and operating conditions of
                  state-owned enterprises and banks, policies and institutions associated with science and technology, and approaches
                  to government decentralization and coordination. Many of the recent special initiatives to support structural and
                  behavioral changes within the agricultural sector have become necessary to countervail the constraining effects of
                  non-agricultural policies, regulations, administrative practices, and so forth.

                  Likewise, supporting the business of agriculture entails government functions not normally considered the
                  mandate of ministries of agriculture. For example, there is a need to facilitate good corporate governance;
                  provide a level playing ﬁeld for market participants and potential entrants (e.g., efﬁcient, transparent processes
                  for business licensing and establishment); create a regulatory environment suited to local business and cultural
                  standards and the relevant level of industry development; and establish a transparent system of business and
                  trade taxation, and a clear legal code and redress processes for contracts. There is need for coordinated roles for
                  public institutions. Elsewhere in Asia, ministries of agriculture have found it very challenging to develop capacity
                  for effective, proactive support to agricultural diversiﬁcation and inclusive agribusiness.41 Guiding the moderniza-
                  tion of agriculture thus involves numerous ministries beside agriculture: trade and industry, environment, health.
                  Getting these ministries to coordinate effectively is a challenge.


                  Leading Less and Facilitating More

                  To achieve the lofty aspirations laid out in Chapter 3 and otherwise support the modernization of Vietnamese
                  agriculture, the government will need to lead less and facilitate more. This is true in relation to many of the
                  outcome areas the government would like to inﬂuence for the better. For illustration, Table 23 identiﬁes some
                  areas where changes are possible in how the government intervenes in relation to agriculture and agribusiness
                  development.

                  The above also implies that the government will need to invest more selectively, focusing on core public
                  goods and services.42 In Vietnam, this might mean continuing to invest in rural infrastructure, early warning

                  41   FAO (2014) commissioned six Asia case studies of the institutional models used to provide public sector support for inclusive agribusiness development (Bangladesh,
                       Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam). All conclude that the departments or agencies created under MOAs in these 6 countries have largely failed to live up
                       to expectations in terms of moving the ministries into effective, proactive roles in off-farm agribusiness. In most cases, weaknesses in staff and budget are major constraints.
                       In some cases, the agencies created within MOA have mandates that overlap with other ministries, e.g., of industry. In several cases, it appears that the agencies were created
                       under externally ﬁnanced projects, but subsequently ﬁnd themselves under-staffed and under-funded when these projects close, only to re-emerge when new donor projects
                       start up.
                  42   Including non-agricultural investment to enhance the rural institutional environment and improve human wellbeing; such investments relate to education, sanitation and
                       clean water supply, and health care.

            weather systems, land administration services, basic agricultural research, pest and disease surveillance and
            reporting, institutional capacity to enforce environmental and input regulation, or to support certiﬁcation systems,
            food safety inspection and related regulatory functions, and the provision of safety nets.

            In addition, by focusing on improving the enabling environment, the government will better be able to
            leverage public funds to encourage and enable much greater investment by farmers and the private sector.
            In higher income countries, agro-food chains largely consist of private sector businesses. The levers of intervention
            for government are limited and essentially exist to create and maintain a supportive enabling environment. As
            discussed next (and reﬂected in Vietnam’s low score on the OECD’s agricultural growth enabling index, see below),
            this is not necessarily what policies in Vietnam currently do.

            In its regulatory actions meanwhile, the government may ﬁnd it more effective, in some cases, to proceed
            incrementally and with signiﬁcant consideration for the day-to-day realities of ﬁrms of different natures
            and sizes. With regard to food safety and environmental standards for example, the government may at times
            allow players to adopt or remove practices in incremental stages over time, rather than introduce abrupt measures
            and demanding compliance tomorrow. Distinctions might be made between ﬁrms of different sizes, with varied
            implementation deadlines. Pushing things along may involve capacity building interventions, technology transfer
            schemes, and targeted subsidies. These measures may be preferable than simply de-licensing the laggards.

            Moving in the direction of a modern, market-responsive food system needs a foundation of greater trust in
            market processes, a greater degree of comfort with mistakes, and acceptance that these are not an overall
            sign of failure. The government exhibits a tendency to intervene more deeply in inter-ﬁrm relations—as in picking
            winners, match-making, and engineering market relationships. While this often reﬂects the best intentions of
            pushing things along and spending public resources wisely, it can distort market signals and prices, drive out
            lagging players prematurely, and stiﬂe private sector experimentation and entrepreneurship.

            One cross-cutting area in which these (re-)orientations of government will imply signiﬁcant changes in
            Vietnam is that of innovation policy (as discussed again below). Building the sector’s capacity for innovation—
            that is, for continuous, and sometimes breakthrough improvement in how the business of agriculture is carried
            out—will be vital for achieving nearly all of Vietnam’s aspirations for the sector. And doing so will generally call

                  upon the government to retreat from a number of functions it has proactively ﬁlled, including in research and
                  technology transfer, and to assert leadership by helping to draw out the best in the multiplicity of actors now seen
                  as central to innovation. In Vietnam’s case, this will involve shifting more resources and effort into, among things,
                  building the capacities of and connections among people, organizations, and systems.

                  This is in the same vain as recent reforms that have sought to make research institutions more demand-
                  responsive, and ﬁrms more engaged in developing and absorbing technology. The launch in January 2015 of the
                  National Technology Innovation Fund, for example, is expected to promote competitive research by moving away
                  from a system of annually assigned research missions to one based on ﬂexible projects that can evolve faster to
                  match demand. And MARD is developing a circular (implementing Decree 15 on public-private partnerships) that
                  will support the efforts of enterprises that invest in research, demonstration, and technology transfer.

                  The rest of this Chapter is devoted to exploring and illustrating ways in which governments elsewhere have
                  promoted sustainable agricultural productivity and growth as well as competitiveness in international and
                  domestic markets. A series of annexes offer more in-depth treatment and illustrations of the approaches discussed
                  below.




                  Sustainable Agricultural Productivity and Growth

                  Agricultural growth and development over the past decade was based upon very intensive use of human
                  resources, natural resources, and production inputs. Physical output (and trade) grew at a fast pace, yet at high
                  cost to the environment, with mixed or uncertain product quality, with declining rates of productivity gain and
                  with limited value-addition. Given these developments and given the evolving roles of agriculture in a country
                  experiencing broader demographic, spatial, and economic structural changes, a unifying motto for the sector can be
                  achieving more from less. That is, the sector will yield greater producer, consumer, ecosystem, and broader economic
                  beneﬁts, yet with less (or less intensive) use of labor, land, water, other natural resources and environmentally
                  harmful inputs. This will require the better realization of economies of scale and scope at the farm level and within
                  value chains, much greater efﬁciency in land and water-use, and a shift toward more knowledge-intensive and
                  skill-based agricultural practices. And these imply signiﬁcant shifts in the functions (and performance of those
                  functions) by government.


                  Facilitating More Efﬁcient Use of Agricultural Land

                  In order to improve farmer welfare, meet the changing needs of domestic consumers, and reverse the pattern of
                  a declining rate of agricultural growth, much more efﬁcient use will need to be made of Vietnam’s agricultural

            land. Inefﬁciencies in land-use, at least in the lowland and delta areas, stem from various factors, including (i) the
            structural legacy of earlier egalitarian land allocation policies; (ii) legal, regulatory, and administrative barriers to
            a more active (transfer and leasing) land market; and (iii) the restrictions placed on land-uses, for the large area of
            land designated as paddy-land.

            Land consolidation, in various forms, will be critical for upgrading production systems and product quality,
            reducing transaction costs within value chains, and enabling households to gain and maintain a middle living
            standard based at least partly on agriculture. A more active market for agricultural land will facilitate land
            consolidation in some areas, allow those farms and ﬁrms wishing to invest further in agriculture to pursue their
            plans and enable many households to reduce their livelihood risk, by gaining guaranteed lease income while focusing
            their labor or entrepreneurial efforts elsewhere. Land consolidation will also allow for increased mechanization, a
            process which will become increasingly important as labor costs rise.


            Î Vietnam can learn from international experience about ways to facilitate the development of mechanization
              services in a farming structure still dominated by small-scale farms, a topic discussed further in Thematic
              Sheet E.


            Enabling greater choice and ﬂexibility in land-uses will be critical for improving farm household welfare,
            better managing weather, other production and market risks, and spurring investment in agriculture. The
            government is rightly concerned about widespread and uncontrollable conversion of agricultural land for other
            purposes. And it wants to ensure that large areas of lowland suitable land continue to cultivate Vietnam’s leading
            staple food—rice. Yet, the paddy-land designation policy has resulted in Vietnam far overshooting its food security
            objectives and generating a massive exportable surplus whose international sale generates only modest incomes for
            farmers and net returns to the country overall. The costs of the restrictive paddy-land policies have been recognized.
            The government has set goals for the conversion of some paddy-land and with Decree 35 has set out rules which
            should provide farmers and local leaders with much greater scope to convert land to other agricultural uses or
            introduce rotations between seasons. Active technical and other support by government for crop diversiﬁcation
            may be needed during the transition phase given lower levels of knowledge and technology availability for the
            alternative crops and different types of risk which farmers may face. The changes being brought should be carefully
            monitored. The revised policy still restricts farmers from converting paddy-land for more permanent purposes—i.e.,
            the planting of tree crops. This restriction should be reconsidered after the impacts of the current reform are
            observed. As noted earlier, over the longer term we might expect upward of one-third of the current paddy-land
            being shifted over to alternative agricultural land-uses and ecosystem services. Gisseke et al. (2013) project that
            this type of change will bring very signiﬁcant beneﬁts and increase the future pace of agricultural growth.


            Facilitating More Efﬁcient and Sustainable Use of Irrigation Water

            Irrigation facilities have been the government’s biggest investment in the agricultural sector. Since the mid-
            1970s, some $6 billion (present value) have been invested in irrigation—about 80 percent of the government’s
            capital investment in the sector. While irrigation schemes have played a major role in Vietnam’s impressive progress
            with respect to food security and poverty reduction, their utility will come under a stronger spotlight as farmers seek

                  to diversify land-uses and in the face of intensifying competition for land, water and budgetary resources. Irrigated
                  agriculture needs to increase overall factor productivity and better account for its water-use. And the existing
                  infrastructure will need to deliver a range of multi-functional water services—not just irrigation and drainage.
                  Water supply to municipalities, rural centers, industry and maintenance of ﬂows for aquaculture, ﬂuvial transport
                  and environmental services are becoming increasingly important (see Error! Reference source not found. on public-
                  private water services and quality protection in Latin America in Thematic Sheet F).

                  In 2014, an irrigation restructuring scheme was announced, calling for an array of sustainable development
                  objectives and pointing toward a combination of technical advances and institutional reforms. As the subsector
                  is fully decentralized, the focus of change and modernization will be at the provincial level. The provinces are
                  responsible for irrigation investment planning, implementation of the investment, and operation and maintenance.
                  Yet MARD—working with provincial and user agencies—will need to play a major role in promoting a facilitating
                  a more service oriented approach to irrigation. The implementation of reforms in the subsector will be a long-term
                  effort that needs to be accompanied by measures to:

                    x Resolve the long-term ﬁnancing of IDMCs, improve their accountability (and oversight), and improve
                      their incentives to deliver requested and reliable irrigation services. Various approaches are being pursued
                      including changes in corporate governance arrangements, use of performance contracts, basing funding on
                      the implementation of business plans, and using improved tools for monitoring the performance of schemes in
                      relation to both technical and higher level objectives.

                    x Strengthen the relationships between IDMCs and WUOs in order to improve irrigation service delivery. Good
                      practices locally seem to involve a shift from a hierarchical top-down approach to one of regular communications,
                      joint problem solving, and an overall orientation of co-managing the irrigation schemes.


                  Strengthening Green Agriculture Policies and Implementation Capacities

                  Vietnam, as previously noted, has achieved high rates of growth in agricultural output over the past decades,
                  but this accomplishment has been at a heavy cost to the environment. The sector’s increasing use of land and
                  synthetic inputs has accelerated deforestation, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse
                  gas emissions. Today, this pattern is not only gaining attention but may be reaching its limits as natural resource
                  degradation is starting to have an observable effect on farmers’ bottom lines. Saddled as it is with high expectations,
                  Vietnamese agriculture will need to produce more from less going forward. Maintaining high output growth under
                  changing climate and economic conditions may require a strategy of intensiﬁcation, sparing not only time and
                  labor, but also land and water, pesticides and fertilizer.

                  The government has recently turned its attention to environmental challenges, Vietnam’s Green Growth
                  Strategy—which touches upon agriculture-related themes—being emblematic of the attention being paid to
                  the matter at the highest levels of government. However, Vietnam’s agricultural policies and public expenditures
                  are still primarily driven by production output objectives (Khoi et al. 2015). Several agricultural promotion policies
                  moreover appear to conﬂict with environmental protection goals. For example, efforts to conserve ﬁsheries and
                  promote ﬁshery resource (co-)management occur in the same locations where fuel and/or boat-building subsidies
                  are offered to expand local ﬁsh processing capacity. Efforts to restrict farmers from cutting trees and cultivating

            steep slopes may be undermined by the promotion of new investments in nearby ethanol plants with large feedstock
            requirements. Government waivers and subsidies for water and irrigation service fees temporarily increase farmer
            incomes, but contribute to improper water management, often in ways that increase greenhouse gas emissions.

            In Vietnam as in many other countries, meanwhile, primary attention has been given to putting in place
            effective regulatory solutions to agro-environmental problems. Yet, regulatory enforcement is often challeng-
            ing, especially in circumstances like that in Vietnamese agriculture where primary production is highly fragment-
            ed. Scherr et al. (2015) highlight a wider range of policy instruments that governments may use, often in combi-
            nation, to provide the incentives and controls needed to prevent environmentally destructive agricultural activi-
            ties and otherwise induce sustainable farming and natural resource management practices. These instruments set
            and allow enforcement of the rules, raise awareness and provide needed information, and enable, through various
            means, better behavior and technologies.43 Through incentives and information, whether these surface through
            procurement, R&D, extension, or quality systems, government can enable and encourage private action. It can di-
            rectly invest in environmentally protective infrastructure or activities, or help others to mobilize such resources.
            Table 24 provides examples of some of the speciﬁc instruments governments can and have used in this space.

            Many of these may be relevant to Vietnam, though the suitability of different instruments depends upon
            the type and scale of the environmental problem and the prevailing institutional context. In this regard, it is
            helpful that a wealth of international experience exists in the use of all these instruments.


            Î Market-based approaches. The past decade, for instance, has seen tremendous growth in market-based
              approaches to environmental management, namely in the form of payment for ecosystem services (PES)
              programs. These encompass a range of programs that involve the direct compensation of land stewards to
              maintain speciﬁed ecosystem services, usually through conservation and restoration activities. Government
              roles in support of PES range from paying for the ecosystem services, to convening stakeholders, and
              establishing the legal framework and soft infrastructure that have proven essential to the success of these
              programs. Several examples of payment for ecosystem service schemes are developed in Thematic Sheet F.


            Another market-based approach that is rapidly developing (though some see it as a form of PES) rests on
            the use of eco-certiﬁcation. Public sector support for this approach has spanned working with private sector
            stakeholders to develop standards, to regulating the use of such standards, supporting their adoption through
            capacity building, and ensuring consumer protection when it comes to their use.


            Î Thematic Sheet G develops examples of eco-certiﬁcation and eco-labeling programs.


            Multi-stakeholder initiatives. Despite their growth in recent years, meanwhile, market-based approaches are not
            the only ones to have proven effective. In fact, one key lesson that is emerging from transactional approaches
            to environmental protection is the importance of the institutional, social, and cultural fabric in which these are

            43    Scherr et al (2015) highlight and draw lessons from the applications of many such instruments in a series of commodity landscape case studies in East and Southeast Asia.

imbricated. A range of approaches that can be grouped under the umbrella of multi-stakeholder initiatives have also
been used with success. While these range in nature, these tend to leverage non-monetary currencies, such as social
recognition, belonging, status, favors, or community acceptance, to provoke behavior change.

            General lessons on government roles in the greening of agriculture. More generally, Vietnam’s and other
            countries’ experience in the greening of agriculture point to the following lessons.

                  x The need for pro-active agro-environmental strategies which anticipate likely or potential environmental
                    risks and aim to prevent the degradation from occurring in the ﬁrst place. More commonly in developing
                    countries, agro-environmental policy continues to be reactive to outside pressure (from buyers or external
                    regulators) and rehabilitative, with measures taken only after serious environmental consequences have
                    manifested.

                  x Beneﬁts from mobilizing multiple stakeholders for green agriculture initiatives. Whether or not monetary
                    or other economic incentives intervene, public-private partnerships have been effective in implementing many
                    schemes as have initiatives involving collective action at the industry or community levels. The needed roles for
                    government should be tailored to the speciﬁc circumstances.

                  x Opportunities for interventions at multiple levels. At the farm and community levels, efforts can focus on
                    mainstreaming the adoption of good agricultural practices and promoting the multi-functionality of farming
                    areas (production; ecosystem services; eco-tourism). And, at a landscape level, multiple stakeholders can be
                    mobilized to develop sustainable agro-based ecosystems, such as one for industrial crops and agro-forestry in
                    the Central Highlands.

                  x The need to strengthen green agriculture capabilities, including data, knowledge, skills, management
                    systems, physical assets, and institutional relationships. These must be present among supply chain
                    actors, among national and sub-national government agencies, research/training institutes, and civil
                    society organizations. To effectively manage agro-environmental risks, investments are often needed in hard
                    infrastructure (i.e. testing laboratories), hard competencies (i.e. technical skills) and soft competencies (i.e.
                    facilitative skills).


            Managing Climate Change Risks to Vietnamese Agriculture

            Growing recognition that climate change risk will interfere with the pursuit of near-term and long-term
            agricultural development objectives has led a growing number of countries and development partners to
            embrace climate-smart agriculture. The concept reﬂects a desire to integrate or mainstream adaptation
            and mitigation objectives into ongoing sector development efforts, reorienting these as necessary. Less than a
            preconceived approach or outcome, climate-smart agriculture implies the embrace, at multiple levels, of processes
            to identify context-relevant policies and actions that will enable the agriculture sector to better fulﬁll its multiple
            functions in a changing climate (e.g., as they relate to production, food security, livelihoods, economic growth,
            and ecosystem health). As deﬁned by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), climate-smart agriculture “seeks
            to support countries in putting in place the necessary policy, technical and ﬁnancial means to mainstream climate
            change considerations into agricultural sectors and provide a basis for operationalizing sustainable agricultural
            development under changing conditions” (FAO 2013).

            In Vietnam, agriculture is expected to be signiﬁcantly affected by climate change through sea level rise,
            salinity intrusion, higher temperatures, modiﬁed rainfall patterns, and heightened storm intensity. Short of

                  concerted adaptation efforts, these changes will impact the risks and productivity of crop, livestock, and aquaculture
                  production. Yet a signiﬁcant number of adaptations are likely to occur spontaneously, that is, as the result of farmer
                  rather than public sector initiative (JICA 2013, World Bank 2010). Examples include delaying planting of winter-
                  spring rice in the Red River Delta; switching to drought-resistant crops such as cassava, maize, and groundnut in
                  the Central Region; shifting to salt-tolerant aquaculture as salinity creeps into the coastal parts of the Mekong River
                  Delta; and stepping up the capacity of veterinary services to respond to a higher incidence of vector-borne disease
                  in the livestock sector. Many of these changes can already be observed in Vietnam today. And taken together,
                  shifts such as these can go a long way toward averting the worst sector impacts suggested by “business-as-usual”
                  modeling results, which usually assume zero adaptation. That said, the rapid pace and extent of change that could
                  transpire as global greenhouse gas concentrations rise could test farmers’ and other agricultural actors’ ability to
                  cope.

                  This points to a critical need for the government to help bolster the sector’s ability to manage both the
                  foreseeable challenges that climate change will bring (such as salinity intrusion, temperature stress, dry season
                  water scarcity, heightened ﬂood and extreme weather risk, and so forth), as well as the signiﬁcant amount of
                  uncertainty or unpredictability that climate change implies (e.g., with respect to rainfall, pests, and disease). In
                  fact, the uncertainty that is intrinsic to climate change points to the relevance of at least three mutually reinforcing
                  approaches when it comes to planning adaptation and other climate-smart agriculture strategies. These are (i) to
                  embrace the tenets of adaptive management; (ii) to strengthen the capacity for learning and innovation within
                  government as well as in the private sector; and (iii) to favor “no regrets” adaptation strategies.

                  Adaptive management is an approach to making decisions that deals with a context of uncertainty by making
                  learning central to the process (i.e., by making learning about a given system a central objective of decisions
                  that otherwise intend to improve that system). Adaptive management represents the deliberate and systematic use
                  of best available knowledge to guide policy decisions and management practices. Its effectiveness can reﬂect such
                  things as the quality of leadership; the skills, attitudes and social capital of individuals; the aptness of institutional
                  incentives and culture; and the strength of data and knowledge management systems. Particularly fundamental to
                  its success over time—and the ability to adapt to climate change—is the capacity for innovation and learning, at
                  every level of government, and much more broadly throughout the economy.


                  Î The concept of adaptive management is further discussed and illustrated in Thematic Sheet I. Separately,
                    Thematic Sheet A goes into the concept of agricultural innovation system.


                  This adaptive management approach is consistent with the idea of prioritizing no-regrets strategies—actions
                  that can be justiﬁed from economic, social, and environmental perspectives whether a given climate change
                  scenario unfolds or not, or actions that are relatively reversible in case of unforeseen developments. Many of these
                  have already been identiﬁed and are actively being pursued in Vietnam, as illustrated in Box 7.

                  Box 7: Examples of Planned Adaptation Measures that Vietnam is Unlikely to Regret

                  Planned adaptation measures are generally understood to involve the public sector, whether it intervenes as a coordinator,
                  advocate, investor, funder, law-maker or regulator, or in another capacity. The following are examples of measures that
                  are likely to pay off irrespective of how climate change progresses—and that could be redirected if needed (JICA 2013,
                  World Bank 2010, authors).
                    x Increasing the availability of timely weather information and seasonal climate forecasts, along with the knowledge
                      to use this information (e.g., climate information systems and extension-type services)
                    x Funding research and extension to develop and diffuse new crop or animal varieties tolerant to changing conditions
                      (e.g., resistant to higher temperatures, salinity, prolonged or deeper ﬂooding, prolonged water scarcity, etc.);
                      or management practices that reduce waste and increase efﬁciency (if possible while reducing climate and
                      environmental pollution)
                    x Supporting lower-income farmers diversify into higher value farm products, for instance, by helping them access
                      ﬁnancing including to manage risk (e.g., by participating in the development of crop and livestock insurance); and
                      into non-farm income-generating activities
                    x Developing frameworks for or directly designing or funding payment for ecosystem service programs
                    x Incentivizing water savings (namely in irrigation systems) by introducing water charges by requiring better
                      monitoring, introducing charges, or improving management systems
                    x Rehabilitating or upgrading irrigation infrastructure as needed to reduce system losses (e.g., in the Red River
                      Delta); potentially expanding irrigation infrastructure and/or climate prooﬁng at-risk infrastructure in select areas
                      (e.g., in the Central region)
                    x Funding education, training, and research to strengthen veterinary services
                    x Restoring mangrove forests (lost to aquaculture) as a natural barrier to ﬂooding and storm surges in coastal areas
                      (“green dykes”); incentivizing producers to abandon intensive aquaculture (e.g., intensive shrimp farming) in favor
                      of extensive, agro-ecological aquaculture (e.g., mangrove-shrimp polyculture)
                    x Developing plans for more integrated management of coastal zones, and improved collaboration among Mekong
                      states to manage water quality and availability—and only potentially investing in coastal embankments (in many
                      cases, this many not qualify as “no regrets”)
                    x Strengthening innovation systems, with a broad focus on fostering a dynamic, multi-stakeholder, multi-directional
                      ecosystems, rather than on scientiﬁc research exclusively
                    x Continuing to build an institutional architecture to coordinate and prioritize climate change response through all of
                      government, at the national and sub-national levels




            Fostering Learning for Knowledge-Based Agriculture

            Vietnam’s ability to respond to both environmental and market pressures in years ahead will require it to
            incorporate increasingly sophisticated levels of knowledge into decision-making, production techniques,
            and management processes at the farm level and beyond. For example, farmers will be in a better position to
            compete, while generating more from less, if they are able to base what they grow and how they grow it on a strong,
            evidence-based grasp of the resources they have to farm with, of weather, phytosanitary and other risks they face,
            and of consumer preferences (including for greener production processes) and price dynamics. And they will better
            be able to compete if they can do this with access to the best solutions science has to offer to the speciﬁc challenges

                  they face. Shifting from a resource-intensive to knowledge based agriculture will, among other things, require major
                  changes in the ways in which farmers learn and gain access to technical and commercial information. This has
                  particular implications for Vietnam’s extension and advisory services, the training and educational opportunities it
                  offers individuals working in the sector, as well as data management systems, as discussed below.

                  Agricultural extension. Agricultural extension in Vietnam has traditionally been top-down and supply driven.
                  Large numbers of public extension ofﬁcers continue to work at provincial, district and local levels, providing train-
                  ing, organizing demonstration models (related to new varieties or different agronomic practices), help farmers to
                  respond to outbreaks of pests or diseases, and supporting the implementation of a variety of localized schemes.
                  The government has recognized the need for and value of socializing advisory services, encouraging the involve-
                  ment of universities, private enterprises, and NGOs in advising farmers, and encouraging a more multi-directional
                  ﬂow of information. Central government funding for certain extension programs have established a competitive
                  bidding process, enabling non-state entities to increase their activity.44 Recent projects supported with develop-
                  ment assistance funding have also sought to encourage private extension work. Agro-enterprises which are enter-
                  ing into contracts or partnerships with farmer groups are likewise ﬁelding staff to serve advisory and monitoring
                  functions. This will become increasingly important where companies will be needed to have an effective trace-
                  ability system for their products and raw materials. Yet despite these developments a broader rethink is needed
                  regarding the objectives (i.e. beyond crop yields), approaches, and methodologies for extension.

                  The government and traditional public sector extension services may still have an important role to play,
                  though less as the main provider of centralized advisory services and more as a broker, mobilizer and funder
                  of services provided by others. For many extension agencies, moving into these roles will rest on an embrace of
                  structural and cultural changes, both internal and external to their organization. In particular, integrating brokerage
                  functions into traditional extension services will often require these institutions to build new skillsets, reframe
                  their mission, and modify staff incentives by changing performance measurement criteria. Brokering requires
                  speciﬁc facilitation skills for managing group processes and building trust; and it cannot be judged by traditional
                  performance indicators such as publications or numbers of trainings. Vietnamese policy-makers might consider how
                  approaches from elsewhere could be applied locally.


                  Î For example, Thematic Sheet C unveils the concept of extension-plus and how it has been implemented in
                    other countries.




                  Competitiveness in Domestic and International Markets

                  A 2014 OECD study (Diaz-Bonilla et al. 2014) found the enabling environment for agricultural growth
                  and competitiveness to be (far) less favorable in Vietnam than for an array of countries—including Brazil,
                  Chile, China, Colombia, Mexico, Thailand, and Turkey—with which Vietnamese agriculture competes in regional

                  44   Recent projects supported with development assistance funding have also sought to encourage private extension work. Agro-enterprises which are entering into contracts or
                       ‘partnerships’ with farmer groups are likewise ﬁelding staff to serve advisory and monitoring functions. This will become increasingly important where companies will be needed
                       to have an effective traceability system for their products and raw materials.

            or international markets. The study developed an agricultural growth enabling index (AGEI) based upon multiple
            indicators that were clustered in four groups: economy-wide governance, human and physical capital availability,
            market operations (for goods, labor and ﬁnancial services), and agriculture/rural institutions (and public spending).
            Twenty low and middle-income countries were rated using this index. Overall, Vietnam ranked in 14th place, ahead
            of only Pakistan, Egypt, and a number of African countries. In each of the AGEI’s four sub-categories, Vietnam
            scored at or below the average for the twenty countries—suggesting that its agricultural sector currently faces
            head-winds in its efforts to modernize and compete globally.

            Just as the AGEI intends to capture a multi-dimensional reality, the levers for improving competitiveness—in
            both domestic and international markets—are many and diverse. Those explored below include the institutions
            and processes involved in research and innovation, food safety control, collective action, and market creation. In
            these and other domains, Vietnam will need to intervene proactively considering the towering domestic market
            opportunity that is currently Vietnam’s to lose; the squeeze of declining prices and multiplying competitors in
            international commodity markets—and the challenges of responding convincingly to the evolving (and ever-more
            exacting) demands and concerns of consumers.


            Stimulating Innovation throughout Agro-food Value Chains

            How effectively it can seize domestic demand opportunities, compete in commodity markets and remain food
            secure—in a changing climate—will depend upon how well Vietnam innovates. As has already been argued,
            this will call for continued reforms in Vietnam’s innovation policy to sharpen the country’s research and absorption
            capabilities.

            Research. While Vietnam’s agricultural strategy has come to embrace a broad set of themes—including post-har-
            vest management, climate change adaptation, advances in quality and value-addition, and so forth—the focus of
            most publically funded programs has remained on agricultural production. In addition, research priorities remain
            are still identiﬁed centrally, to a large extent, and may not be aligned with regional or local (business) needs.
            Public funding for agricultural research is provided through MARD, provincial governments and the Ministry of
            Science and Technology, and although the size of the envelope has increased—it rose from some $10 million in
            2000 to $40 million in 2012—it is small in comparison to that of Asian peers as a fraction of agricultural GDP.45

            In recent years, competitive processes have gained favor as a means of allocating research funding, as they
            are seen as a means of encouraging research institutes to become more autonomous, responsive to demand,
            and commercially driven. Yet, the reform process of the agricultural research system is still at an early stage. In this
            respect, Vietnam may ﬁnd merit in placing increasing emphasis on more demand-responsive and multi-disciplinary
            research, and on multi-stakeholder consortium models involving research institutes, universities, industry, and
            farmers.


            Î Thematic Sheet B provides views on roles of research and development institutes and universities in
              innovation processes.

            45    In 2008, Vietnam spent the equivalent of 0.2 percent of its agricultural GDP on research. The comparative shares for China and Malaysia were 0.5 and 1.0 percent, respectively.

                  Absorption. Vietnam will also want to gravitate toward more effective technology absorption—not only by farmers
                  (see previous section on knowledge-based agriculture and Thematic Sheet C on extension), but also by agro-enterprise
                  SMEs. The absorption of technology by producers and agro-food enterprises is a weak link in many transitioning
                  agricultural innovation systems, including Vietnam’s. A lack of dynamism in ﬁrms’ embrace of improved processes or
                  tools can be symptomatic of innovation systems in which the development of new technologies or improved ways
                  of doing things is separate from ﬁrms’ activities, or includes limited involvement of these in innovation processes.
                  It can reﬂect the notion and reality that technology absorption is separate from innovation, and a resulting weak
                  capacity on the part of ﬁrms to absorb technology that they played little role in conceiving or developing. This
                  separation limits ﬁrms’ opportunities to learn-by-doing, or to shape technology developments that are well-tailored
                  to their day-to-day business needs. Other factors that contribute to weighing down technology absorption by ﬁrms
                  include a lack of investment and especially venture funding, inadequate support for the development of business
                  plans and marketing strategies especially, and a lack of tools and appetite for risk-taking.

                  Over the past 15–20 years, agribusiness incubation has developed as one means of stimulating technology
                  absorption—generally focusing on young enterprises and entrepreneurs—and enabling constructive risk-
                  taking. Agribusiness incubators directly engage with startups to help them grow, usually offering them a range
                  of advisory and business development services geared to improving ﬁrms’ competitiveness and access to markets.
                  Several have a track record in transforming comparative advantages in commodity markets into competitive
                  advantages in differentiated product markets (Goletti/World Bank 2011).


                  Î Thematic Sheet D discusses the principles and models of agribusiness incubation at greater length, and
                    provides examples of these.




                  Strengthening Systems and Capacities for Managing Emerging Food Safety Risks

                  The processes of urbanization, industrialization, and income growth, and changes in the composition of
                  consumer diets (favoring animal products and other high value and processed foods) have simultaneously
                  increased the exposure of Vietnamese consumers to food safety risks and increased demand for higher
                  standards of food safety. At stake is the Vietnamese agro-food sector’s ability to maintain and gain relevance in
                  the rapidly evolving and growing domestic market—in short, to stake out increasing market share.

                  Vietnam has responded to these challenges by revamping its food safety regulations and investing in
                  laboratories. It has also streamlined institutional structures by reducing the number of ministries in charge of food
                  safety from the previous six to the current three. Having moved to a model that privileges decentralized support for
                  agriculture, with some three fourths of public agricultural expenditure occurring at the provincial level, Vietnam will
                  need to look at ways to make a devolution of food safety responsibilities work well. The government wants to utilize
                  its existing capacity to address food safety, and plans to task agencies that were previously in charge of export food
                  safety to take increasing responsibility for domestic food safety control. As it proceeds with these and other reforms,
                  international experience and global trends in food safety control systems can inform the strategies it employs.

            In terms of food safety governance, international experience highlights a move toward the judicious sharing
            of responsibilities—among levels of government as well as with private sector entities—and proactive, risk-
            based approaches to protecting consumer safety. Notable trends include the following.

                  x Consolidation and coordination. While a majority of OECD countries maintain several agencies in charge of food
                    safety, the trend in emerging economies has been to consolidate food safety within one government agency (as
                    in China and Kazakhstan). This reﬂects the desire to reduce barriers for collaboration between multiple agencies.
                    In emerging economies, more than in developed economies, collaboration between government institutions is
                    a major challenge. Through such consolidation governments expect to reduce institutional battles for spheres
                    of inﬂuence. That said, high level coordination bodies have become common in many countries (e.g., Germany,
                    South Korea, China) and offer an alternative to single or integrated agency structures.

                  x Devolution of authority. To address the challenge of oversight at the sub-national level, some countries have
                    opted to entirely devolve food safety authority to regional bodies (e.g., Australia), while others—usually
                    small ones—have opted to centralize authority without attempting to replicate national structures at the
                    sub-national level. In the latter case, even local food safety inspectors report to a central national authority
                    as opposed to a regional or local one. There are several trade-offs to consider in deciding between these two
                    approaches. The devolution model allows for greater integration of food safety with other regulatory functions
                    yet also creates the potential for inconsistent applications of national laws and regulations. It can also suffer
                    from a lack of adequate resources being devoted by sub-national government to this function.

                  x Pro-active prevention. Many countries have moved toward approaches to food safety management that give
                    precedence to the prevention of hazards over the inspection of ﬁnished products. While this approach has
                    been spearheaded in developed countries, it is of high relevance to more resource-constrained countries. When
                    it comes to prevention, the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) approach is one of the best
                    known and most widely adopted. HACCP is a management system developed in the U.S. in which food safety
                    is addressed through the analysis and control of biological, chemical, and physical hazards from raw material
                    production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the ﬁnished product
                    (U.S. Food and Drug Administration). Its principles require that (identiﬁed and realistic) food safety hazards be
                    prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.

                  x Risk-proﬁling. One of the deﬁning pillars of pro-active prevention (i.e., HACCP) is the principle of hazard
                    monitoring. One practical way to go about doing this involves auditing and assigning risk proﬁles to enterprises.
                    Risk-proﬁling generally entails a shift from the retrospective recording of food safety breaches, to the more
                    pro-active assessment of how likely future problems are going forward. And risk-proﬁling generally places less
                    emphasis on the safety of end-products than on that of business facilities and practices. Ideally, risk-proﬁling
                    also takes into account risks that arise through sourcing and primary production of the foods that ﬁrms use.

            Ultimately, the governance of food safety is only as successful as its ability to widely, consistently, and
            durably change the behavior of the many: of consumers, of farmers, small food processors, food service
            workers, and of those working in agro-enterprise more broadly. And the key lesson from international experience
            in this respect is that it is not effective to manage risk strictly through policing. The public sector needs to seek to
            inﬂuence all of these players to, in essence, motivate them to in large part police themselves. Box 8 illustrates a
            number of ways in which government has tackled this vast challenge elsewhere.

                     Box 8: Approaches to Changing the Behavior of Farmers, Firms, and Consumers to Improve Food Safety

                     Agricultural best practices. It is common in many developed and emerging economies for public extension services
                     to develop and disseminate agricultural best practices that are designed with food safety in mind. These exist for both
                     crop and livestock production. In the U.S., for example, state extension services public good agricultural handbooks, and
                     offer farmers support in applying these within the speciﬁc context of their operations.
                     Safe food handling protocols. In some countries, other public agencies regularly publish protocols and instructions
                     on safe food handling in the manufacturing and service sectors. One example is the U.K.’s Safer Food, Better Business
                     program that provides instructional materials to restaurants and small and medium food business operators.
                     Professional training and certiﬁcation. Developed countries universally offer training and capacity building programs
                     for small and medium enterprises. Not only do these impart knowledge on safe food handling and the serious risks
                     associated with departures from protocol, but they also (presumably) build a professional identity and ethic that can
                     be instrumental in changing the behavior of individuals employed in ﬁrms, even in the absence of public scrutiny. Other
                     approaches that encourage individuals to adopt pro-social behavior can also be effective at relatively low cost.
                     Public disclosure of risk proﬁles. In restaurants, the public posting of food safety inspection results in visible places—
                     using intuitive ratings such as smiley faces or A/B/C/D grades—has worked well across a host of cities, including
                     Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, and New York. For agro-food ﬁrms that do not have end-consumer-facing operations, risk-
                     ratings carry less direct reputational risk but can still inform business-to-business transactions.
                     Financial support. Some countries provide matching grants or low-cost loans to companies for upgrading their food
                     safety capacities and infrastructure.
                     Consumer education. Most developed countries have strong consumer education programs for food safety (e.g. U.S.,
                     EU member states). In these countries, industry and industry associations also run consumer education programs. The
                     Grocery Manufacturing Association in the U.S. runs consumer education programs for middle-school children in less-
                     advantaged counties and towns for instance.



                  Meanwhile, despite its renewed focus on food safety, the Vietnamese government has not yet identiﬁed new
                  ﬁnancial and human resources to put to task and this is putting severe resource pressure on the regulatory
                  agencies. From this perspective, one approach—or rather collection of approaches—that the government may ﬁnd
                  informative is one in which the public sector fosters close cooperation between government and industry.


                  Î Some of advantages of food safety co-regulation, as it is known, and applications of it in different parts of
                    the world, are discussed in Thematic Sheet N on food safety governance.




                  Fostering Collective Action for Competitive and Inclusive Agricultural Value Chains

                  Although processes of consolidation have begun, Vietnamese agriculture remains largely characterized by
                  fragmented production and value chain structures. Comparatively low levels of collective action have often
                  prevented the realization of economies of scale, inhibited the development of quality management and product
                  traceability systems, and served to weaken overall subsector governance and coordination. In Vietnam, common
                  types of collective action organizations—including cooperatives and industry associations—have often served
                  political rather than technical or commercial functions. Yet, in recent years, the government has recognized

Draft 7.indd 99                                                                                                                                        11/05/2016 15.29.50

            the importance of various forms of institutional collaboration for fostering innovation and improving industry
            performance. The Agricultural Restructuring Plan advocates for the broader application of public-private partnership
            and contract farming models.

            International experience points to the multiple approaches and beneﬁts of strengthening collective action
            in its many possible incarnations. Three of these are discussed in this report: producer organizations, contract
            farming arrangements, and agro-based clusters.

            Producer organizations. While Vietnam is home to a healthy number of producer organizations, a closer look at
            these reveals that these are in large part made up of water management and extension-oriented cooperatives.
            Only a small share of cooperatives serve a commercial function on either the input or the output side. For a sector
            that is largely smallholder-based and increasingly but already very much market-oriented, this represents a missed
            opportunity to tame high transaction costs that arise across a variety of agricultural activities. The aggregation of
            supply, record keeping, short-term storage, negotiation and coordination with downstream buyers and upstream
            input suppliers are examples of a range of functions in which Vietnamese producer organizations have yet to meet
            the full potential for economies of scope and scale.

            Government can support producer and industry organizations in two broad ways: it can invest in institutional
            strengthening, and it can use its legal and regulatory authority to create a supportive environment. The
            public sector can help build stronger organizations by funding technical assistance for such efforts as participatory
            institutional assessments, administrative and governance reforms, leadership building, and the development of
            learning and information exchange mechanisms. It can also directly fund targeted activities, or personnel such as
            organizational facilitators and brokers; and deploy economic incentives for businesses and research organizations to
            work with these organizations, increasing their relevance in the value chain.


            Î A more detailed account of the different functions producer organizations can take on, and where this can
              lead, is offered in Thematic Sheet K.


            Contract farming. Besides being mentioned in the ARP, contract farming is relevant to Vietnamese in as much as the
            sector boasts a paucity of regularized relationships between suppliers and downstream buyers. This makes things like
            tracing products and ensuring the reliability and quality of supply difﬁcult. Along with the development of systems
            that support these, the development of more formal relationships in the value chain will become increasingly
            valuable as aspects such as quality come to the fore in targeting certain consumers.

            While contract farming is primarily private-sector led, government support for such arrangements is not
            uncommon on the grounds that these can contribute to meeting broader policy objectives such as inclusive
            growth, food security, or the protection of natural resources. Besides improving the enabling environment (e.g.,
            the rule of law, the quality of infrastructure, health, and education, political stability, ﬁnancial markets, and so
            forth), the public sector can encourage contract farming by facilitating interactions and brokering transactions
            among potential counterparts, establishing a legal framework for farming contracts, putting economic incentives
            in place, building technical and institutional capacity, and educating counterparts about potential beneﬁts and
            risks. That said, the public sector needs to tread carefully. A number of contract farming arrangements have owed

                   their failure to facilitators in the public or non-proﬁt sector getting ahead of value chain actors and pushing for
                   arrangements that were not in line with existing capacities, ambitions, risk-preference, or levels of trust; or that put
                   development objectives ahead of business viability.


                   Î Thematic Sheet L covers contract farming in greater depth and discusses an East Asian variant of this
                     model.


                   Clusters. Agro-based cluster development will be an appropriate strategy in a number of Vietnamese contexts in
                   which important gains could come from strengthening (cooperative and competitive) linkages among farmers and
                   various commercial players, as well as the infrastructure that underpins these. Cluster development lends itself to
                   incremental forms of public sector support. In an initial phase, the public sector can be involved in sowing the seeds
                   of institutional reform by building trust, encouraging collaboration, and helping to strengthen local infrastructure.
                   And it can focus on supporting a series of small value chain initiatives that accompany process and later product
                   upgrading, and build conﬁdence in cluster activities. In subsequent phases, support can focus on access to ﬁnance,
                   incentives for startups, and measures to attract and develop entrepreneurs, and potentially the creation of special
                   economic zones.


                   Î Thematic Sheet M takes a look at examples of agro-based clusters in Latin America.




                   Repositioning and Rebranding Vietnamese Agriculture in International Markets

                   The bulk of Vietnam’s agricultural exports consist of primary commodities which are often invisible to
                   their users or end-consumers. From this perspective, it is instructive to draw insights from the experiences of
                   other countries where competitive pressures and market opportunities have stimulated shifts, in various parts
                   of agro-industry, to differentiated commodities or higher value-added products. These repositioning strategies
                   have invariably been multi-pronged and involved government in varied roles. Examples include investing in
                   human capital, including in higher technical education; establishing a legal space in which intellectual property
                   is recognized and protected; requiring that producers abide by certain production practices, namely in the name
                   of social, environmental, or reputational/label protection; and working closely with industry to help package and
                   possibly orchestrate the marketing of such things as cultural heritage, environmental protection and product quality


                   Î Thematic Sheet O provides examples in which agro-industry has successfully been supported in efforts to
                     move toward higher-value, more differentiated products, thus shifting its product mix.


                   For Vietnam, there would also be beneﬁts in constructing a (more) positive national brand in certain
                   industries. This could help in attracting FDI and tourism and more generally promote exports and domestic sales.
                   There are a number of international examples of public-private collaboration in this endeavor. These cases illustrate

                   Over the past quarter century, Vietnam’s agricultural sector has made enormous progress. Steady advances
                   in smallholder rice productivity and intensiﬁcation through the 1990s and beyond played a central role in the
                   Vietnam’s successes in poverty reduction, national food security, and social stability. Over a relatively short period,
                   Vietnam emerged as a major global supplier of a broad range of food and agricultural commodities. In these and
                   some other areas, Vietnam’s agriculture has matched or outperformed that of many other developing countries.

                   Nevertheless, there are growing concerns related to the quality and sustainability of Vietnam’s agricultural
                   growth and related patterns of development. This report has provided evidence which supports these concerns—
                   pertaining to low smallholder farmer proﬁtability, low agricultural worker productivity, low or mixed product quality,
                   and low value-addition. A large proportion of Vietnam’s agricultural growth has stemmed from expanded or more
                   intensive use of land and other natural resources and relatively heavy use of fertilizer and agro-chemicals. As a
                   result, aspects of Vietnam’s agricultural success have come at the expense of the environment, including processes
                   of deforestation and ﬁshery resource depletion, and a growing incidence of land degradation and water pollution.
                   Hence, Vietnam’s agricultural growth has relied very heavily on human, natural, and chemical factors of production.
                   For the most part, more output has come from more and more inputs and increasing environmental costs.

                   Vietnam’s agriculture now sits at a critical turning point. While there are several very dynamic elements within
                   the sector, recent aggregate trends have included declining rates of sectoral GDP and productivity growth and a
                   growing gap between farm and non-farm incomes. Some environmental problems are now adversely impacting
                   both productivity and the international position of Vietnam’s commodities. Administrative controls on land, and
                   direct state involvement in both input and output markets have been important factors in the sector’s stability and
                   inclusive growth over recent decades. Yet these policies and certain legacy institutions seem now to be delaying
                   or stunting the agricultural sector’s transformation in directions needed to serve a continued important role in a
                   modernizing middle-income country.

                   The agricultural sector now faces growing domestic competition—from cities, industry, and services—for
                   labor, land and water. Rising labor costs are beginning to inhibit the sector’s ability to compete globally as a
                   low cost producer of bulk, undifferentiated commodities. The consequences of over-intensive input- and natural
                   resource-use—both for the environment and for farmer proﬁtability—are being increasingly recognized. Vietnam’s
                   agriculture will need to generate more from less. That is, it will need to generate more economic value (and farmer
                   and consumer welfare) using less natural, human, and other forms of capital. Future growth will need to depend
                   upon increased efﬁciency and innovation.

                   Major opportunities will be available both in the domestic and international market, yet effectively competing
                   in these markets will depend upon the ability of farmers and ﬁrms to deliver products on a reliable basis,
                   with predictable quality, assured food safety, and clear evidence of sustainable practices. This was recently
                   highlighted in the Agricultural Restructuring Plan, approved by the Prime Minister in June, 2014. The ARP outlined
                   a conceptual and strategic re-orientation, with sectoral goals to be set in the framework of the triple bottom line
                   of sustainable development (i.e. economic, social and environmental) and with major changes expected in the
                   roles and spending patterns of the government in the sector. There are currently many initiatives aiming in these

            directions. Yet achieving the shift on a large, sector-wide scale will require changes in some important economy-wide
            and sectoral policies and, over time, major changes and additions to the core institutions servicing agriculture. This
            report has argued that the modernization of Vietnamese agriculture will necessitate that the government lead less
            but facilitate considerably more. Numerous illustrations of effective facilitative roles of government and of effective
            collaborative initiatives of the public and private sectors—from both high income and emerging countries—have
            been provided to help further inform Vietnam’s agricultural policy and institutional reform process.

            Long equated with research and development (R&D), innovation is now seen as the process of learning for
            continuous improvement. The paradox of research without innovation—and the recognition that entrepreneurship
            is a driving force for innovation—have led research to be viewed as a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for
            innovation. This has given rise to the innovation systems approach. An innovation system can be deﬁned as a set
            of “networks of organizations or actors—together with the institutions and policies that affect their innovative
            behavior and performance—that bring new products, new processes and new forms of organization into economic
            use” (Hall et al. 2010).

            The concept of building capacity [to innovate] through innovation systems represents a departure from the
            previously dominant technology transfer approach. Traditional technology transfer assumes a linear process
            whereby new technologies are developed by research agents (primarily scientists), and are then delivered to end-
            users, or adopters, by dedicated transfer agents (primarily extension workers). In a review of innovation models (ways
            of conceptualizing innovation processes), and how these have evolved over time as a result of empirical research,
            Tidd (2006) highlights the following pitfalls of past approaches, or what he calls forms of “partial thinking”:

                   x “Seeing innovation as a linear ‘technology push’ process (in which case all the attention goes into funding R&D
                     with little input from users) or one in which only the market is relied upon to pull through innovation
                   x Seeing innovations simply in terms of major ‘breakthroughs’—and ignoring the signiﬁcant potential of
                     incremental innovation
                   x Seeing innovation as a single isolated change rather than as part of a wider system
                   x Seeing innovation as product or process only, without recognizing the interrelationship between the two.”

            The innovation systems paradigm, by contrast to the technology transfer one, holds innovation—that is, the
            development and adoption of better ways of doing things—as the product of interactions among people,
            organizations, institutions, markets, technologies, information—or innovation ecosystems. In 2012, a
            comprehensive review of agricultural innovation systems (AIS) by the World Bank concluded that the ability to
            innovate is often related not only to research and development (R&D) capacity, but also to collective action,
            coordination, knowledge exchange among diverse actors, and partnership and business development incentives.

            The public sector has a critical role to play in building out the systems that support the capacity to innovate.
            Innovation systems literature sheds light on some of the leading justiﬁcations for public support. Due to the public
            good characteristics of some forms of innovation, for instance, the private sector cannot always fully appropriate
            the full value of the return on its efforts to innovate. Thus, even high return investments may not be worthwhile
            investing in for privately held entities. Asymmetries of information between the supply of and demand for solutions
            can also dampen potentially mutually beneﬁcial transactions. Similarly, imperfect information about challenges and
            solutions can also limit potentially beneﬁcial transactions. In some instances, the public sector can help overcome
            coordination failures which can stand in the way of disruptive innovation in particular.

            Looking beyond the above rationales, the public sector can be seen as being a part of innovation ecosystems
            and having a role to play (though not necessarily a monopolistic or unique one) in fostering connectedness,
            the ﬂow of information, and risk taking among others. Looking beyond market failures, then, a more positive

                   take on public sector roles emerges from the following description of innovation systems in Hall (2010). Innovation
                   systems comprise “a combination of linkages or networks and institutional settings that [foster] a dynamic process
                   of interaction and learning among scientiﬁc and entrepreneurial actors in the public and private sectors in response
                   to evolving economic and technical conditions.” “The focus is on interaction between actors and their embeddedness
                   in an institutional and policy context that inﬂuences their innovative behavior and performance.”

                   This understanding of innovation systems underscores a place for explicit innovation policy that goes beyond
                   public funding for scientiﬁc or public interest research, and suggests a role for public sector in, inter alia:

                     x Nurturing interactions, linkages, and networks among scientiﬁc and entrepreneurial actors in the public and
                       private sectors;
                     x Fostering information sharing and learning;
                     x Inciting research into use / R&D commercialization; and
                     x Institutionalizing these functions.

            Thematic Sheet B - AIS II: Agricultural Research


            The systems perspective described in Thematic Sheet A on agricultural innovation displaces research
            institutions as innovation systems’ primary center of gravity, redistributing roles to a wider and more diverse
            set of actors. Nonetheless, the need for both theoretical and market-oriented research has arguably never been
            greater as the climate changes, and demand for food and quality soars. In other words, while the focus on research
            as a driver of innovation has been reassessed, its importance is not diminished in absolute terms. The expected
            returns on public and private investment in research are as high as ever.

            Internationally, types of organizations that play central and complementary roles in research are universities
            and research and development institutes (RDIs). Whereas the primary focus of universities is usually research
            and teaching, the core business of RDIs is to provide services to industry—particularly SMEs that lack the means
            for internal R&D yet have sufﬁcient absorptive capacity. RDIs are typically involved in a broad range of innovation-
            related activities spanning research, experimental development, design engineering, standards development,
            technical and certiﬁcation services, and technology diffusion (World Bank 2009). Compared to universities, RDIs are
            generally better at providing short-term, practical services to industry. They are often easier and less risky for the
            private sector to collaborate with as they are more structured than universities, and often make use of management
            processes and norms of conﬁdentiality (World Bank 2009). That said, they tend to be more constrained than
            universities when it comes to stability and consistency, and are under less pressure to regenerate their capabilities
            and remain at the cutting edge of research to secure grant ﬁnancing. Universities provide critical human resources
            for projects that are risky or require advanced problem-solving skills (World Bank 2009).

            Funding sources and conditions play a determining role in research institutions’ market-orientation as well
            as their efﬁciency. Government strategies that increase these include allocating research funding on a competitive
            basis, and restricting the amount of unconditional core funding they allocate to these as this forces institutions to
            seek funding from non-government sources. Ensuring predictable funding streams with fewer conditions attached,
            by contrast, is one way in which government can enable research shaped less by commercial motives than by
            scientiﬁc and theoretical inquiry (i.e., “public good” research with more potential for spillovers). Within research
            institutions, key inﬂuences include incentives for personnel (e.g., ones linked to salary and promotion), as well
            as management and governance structures (e.g., professionalization, checks and balances, autonomy, reliance on
            contracts).

                   Thematic Sheet C - AIS III: Agricultural Extension


                   Agricultural extension has evolved signiﬁcantly as a concept and practice since the 1970s when it spread
                   widely to developing countries. At the time, agricultural extension was by and large a public sector service
                   focused on raising yields and productivity by providing technical training to farmers. Today, the vision for effective
                   agricultural extension is less that of a public technology transfer service, than that of a pluralistic system of
                   public and private sector actors offering technical and non-technical services, not only to help raise farm-level
                   productivity, but also to improve business, health, social and environmental outcomes in the sector more broadly.

                   Extension-plus, as it is sometimes referred to, is bent as much on the brokerage of relationships and the
                   facilitation of reciprocal knowledge ﬂows, as on the direct, one-way provision of information and technology
                   from knowledge-institutions to end-users. In its broader quest to improve sector performance by boosting its
                   capacity to innovate, it is meant to enhance value chain actors’ access to knowledge, information and technology,
                   and their interactions with research, education, agribusiness and other institutions. In the same vein, enhanced
                   extension systems strive to help value chain actors develop their own technical, organizational and management
                   skills, as well as the capacity to continuously absorb new knowledge and technology. Extension-plus tends to
                   involve multi-directional information ﬂows, and involving multiple disciplines, methods, and stakeholders. In the
                   Indian state of Kerala, the system supporting fruit and vegetable growers offers one illustration of extension-plus
                   that has engaged the public and private sectors in evolving roles (see Box 9).



                      Box 9: Public-Private Provision of Technical and Other Services: An Indian Example

                      Since the early 1990s, a key actor in the Indian state of Kerala’s extension system started out as the Kerala Horticultural
                      Development Programme (KHDP), a joint-venture between the European Union and the state of Kerala. When the program
                      ended in 2001, it reinvented itself as the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council (VFPCK), a for-proﬁt company held
                      jointly by producer groups—with a majority stake (50 percent)—the state of Kerala (30 percent), and private ﬁnanciers.
                      The VFPCK’s objective, not unlike its non-proﬁt predecessor’s, is to “improve the livelihood of vegetable and fruit farmers
                      by empowering them to carry on vegetable and fruit production, value-addition and marketing as a proﬁtable venture
                      in a sustainable way.” The company also purports to continue the work of the KHDP, key to which was the promotion
                      of farmer self-help groups. These became the program’s backbone, and later, the VFPCK’s majority shareholders. Within
                      these groups, the KHDP trained master farmers as well as extension staff to demonstrate production methods, uses of
                      credit, and approaches to marketing that would help increase and stabilize their incomes. To generate and access locally
                      relevant technical knowledge, KHDP contracted with the local agricultural university system, and also introduced farmers
                      to participatory technology development methods.
                      Today, the VFPCK is a public-private vector of enhanced extension services. It continues to organize horticultural farmers
                      in self-help groups (it claims to have formed over 8,900 of these), to engage in technology development trials (including
                      to develop improved planting material), and to train extension staff and master farmers in production techniques—
                      demonstrating that in a commercial context such as this, a privately, mostly farmer-controlled company can take on the
                      functions of a conventional extension agency, and possibly enhance these. Indeed, the knowledge and technology it
                      promotes are highly tailored to producers’ needs, and developed with their participation. In less commercial production
                      settings, the public sector may need to play a greater role.
                                                                                                                                  Continued to next page.

                   Like the KHDP’s moreover, the VFPCK’s training and other services do not focus on farm-level production exclusively.
                   The organization engages with value chain activities more broadly, and in some cases directly (going a step beyond
                   its predecessor which did not have the large commercial presence of the VFPCK). It is active, for example, in advising
                   producers on marketing strategies, allocating land and building space, in developing credit and insurance products, and
                   in organizing collection centers and retail outlets, including farmers’ markets, which it sets up to enhance producers’
                   bargaining power. It is also promoting linkages and integrating diverse actors within the value chain. For example,
                   it is making efforts to develop a cluster around urban horticulture, and separately, running a program to link tribal
                   producers to market opportunities. Meanwhile, through its retail arm, Krishi Business Kendra, the VFPCK has become one
                   of Kerala’s top sellers of seeds, seedlings, and a variety of tools and inputs. The company has also invested in packing,
                   cut-vegetable processing, soil testing and other facilities.

                   Thematic Sheet D - AIS IV: Agribusiness Incubation


                   Agribusiness incubation has emerged over the past 15–20 years as a means to stimulate commercial
                   agriculture and transform comparative advantages in commodity markets into competitive advantages in
                   differentiated product markets (Goletti/World Bank 2011). A deﬁning characteristic of agribusiness incubators is
                   that they directly engage with startups to help them grow, usually offering them a range of advisory and business
                   development services geared to improving ﬁrms’ competitiveness and access to markets. Box 10 describes and
                   provides examples of various types and roles of agribusiness incubators.

                   Government involvement in agribusiness incubation varies signiﬁcantly, and incubators enjoy different
                   degrees of ﬁnancial and political autonomy. Many are non-proﬁts and start out with public sector and other
                   external sources of funding from which they wean themselves to varying degrees. Incubators are generally able
                   to cover some if not all of their operating costs by charging ﬁrms for access to their services and facilities, i.e.,
                   by charging consulting, business development, marketing, franchising, rental, and other fees. Over time, certain
                   incubators invest in the ﬁrms they incubate as well as their intellectual property, allowing them to share in their
                   proﬁts and royalties.



                      Box 10: Types and Examples of Agribusiness Incubators

                      Some incubators are dedicated to accelerating technology commercialization or technology transfer. The former typically
                      have strong ties with agricultural research institutions; oftentimes they are arms or spinoffs of such institutions.
                      Examples include the ICRISAT-afﬁliated Agribusiness Incubator (ABI) in India—now the country’s largest agribusiness
                      incubator—IAA-IPB, afﬁliated with the Bogor Agriculture University in Indonesia, and Brazil’s CENTEV/Technology
                      Based Business Incubator, afﬁliated with the Federal University of Vicosa. Though their ties to research are to some
                      degree these incubators’ strength as they provide privileged access to, and understanding of, the latest research, these
                      carry certain risks.
                      Examples of incubators that focus on technology transfer—at the grassroots and high-tech levels respectively—are
                      Villgro in India, and the Malaysian Life Sciences Capital Fund. Villgro accelerates the uptake of indigenous technology
                      with activities involving knowledge creation and sharing, competitions and awards, brokerage between innovators
                      and entrepreneurs, and retail, mostly at the village-level. These activities aim to build rural conﬁdence and networks.
                      MLSCF, a public-private venture fund, is focused on importing technologies that can be adapted to the national oil
                      palm industry. Incubators transfer technology across national and corporate borders in various ways, including through
                      intellectual property markets, manufacturing contracts, and joint ventures.
                      Some incubators go beyond technology commercialization and provided a broader set of support services. Timbali
                      Industrial Incubator in South Africa, and Fundacion Jalisco in Mexico—focused on high-end ﬂoriculture and packed
                      fresh berries respectively—are examples of incubators that specialize in developing value chains as well as providing
                      market access to small-scale farmers. Both have developed farm-level business models that large numbers of small-scale
                      producers can adopt, along with a suite of supportive farm-level and supply chain services (e.g., the identiﬁcation
                      of new inputs, cropping methods and handling technologies, marketing, packing, order fulﬁllment, logistics, cash
                      management). They allow what are generally low-asset, low-capacity, risk-averse producers to access distant and high-
                      value niche markets that they would not be able to access on their own, or even through existing farmers’ organizations.
                      Timbali speciﬁcally recruits and nurtures black, female agro-entrepreneurs to launch franchises. Both organizations
                      have cultivated internal competencies and relationships to undertake or outsource market research and the testing of
                      products before their launch.

            Thematic Sheet E - Economies of Scale and the Mechanization of Smallholder Agriculture


            Mechanization is a central component of agricultural modernization, not least because of its power to increase
            land, input, and labor productivity on and off the farm, and reduce the drudgery of farming. Going forward,
            moreover, it could play a central role in enhancing the sector’s sustainability. Historically, mechanization has often
            been detrimental to the environment and farming resources by contributing to soil compaction and erosion, tillage,
            and chemical pollution. However, different choices and uses of labor-saving technology have demonstrated potential
            to facilitate sustainable farming practices, having already enabled the spread of no-till agriculture, precision farming
            (reducing water and chemical use), and improved labor conditions in parts of the world. Sustainability-enhancing
            mechanization, be it in the form of automated, data-intensive, or lower-tech approaches to farming (and post-
            harvest handling), is still in its early days, and regional experience suggests that government has a continued role
            to play.

            In leading East Asian economies such as Japan, Korea, Taiwan (PoC), and China, agricultural mechanization
            has been a joint product of structural transformation and direct public sector support. Mechanization has
            generally accelerated where the pull of industrial and urban employment has led farm labor to dwindle. Rising
            labor costs make farm machinery more ﬁnancially attractive. And outmigration can aid mechanization by increasing
            rural incomes and the size of farming operations, and thus farmers’ ability to invest in and recoup the costs of
            machinery—though empirical evidence of this is mixed (Luo and Escalante 2015). In South Korea, for illustration,
            mechanization took off in the 1970s, even as rapid industrialization drew manpower away from farms. In China,
            the use of tractors and other machinery rose rapidly in the 1980s and 1990s in possible response to farm-labor
            constraints thought to have preceded the rural population’s outright decline starting in the mid-1990s (Yang et al.
            2013). In Japan, cultivators became prevalent in the late 1950s, when post-war industrialization drove agricultural
            wages up (Pingali 2007).

            However, mechanization has rarely been purely spontaneous. Rather, governments have directly intervened to
            promote it, often in the name of sector modernization and competitiveness, but also food security. Notwithstanding
            national differences, a recurrent motive has been the perceived need to compensate for labor shortages in order to
            prevent food production decline. Furthermore, mechanization has meant confronting a range of challenges classically
            associated with technology diffusion—related to risk aversion, information asymmetries, and coordination failures.
            In East Asia, governments have used a combination of supply- and demand-side interventions to address these (see
            Box 11 on Korea’s mechanization plan). The ﬁrst have sought to stimulate the domestic production, absorption,
            distribution and servicing of agricultural machinery (i.e., supply), while the second have been geared to stimulating
            the adoption and use of machinery by agricultural producers (i.e., demand). What follows are examples of each.

            On the supply side, even if a country can rely primarily on imported equipment, mechanization cannot progress
            without investing in national capacity to adapt machinery to local needs and conditions, as well as to operate
            and service equipment over its useful life. Accordingly, East Asian governments have resorted to a range of
            measures to develop a domestic machinery industry. Examples include training a class of specialized engineers and
            technicians; shielding national ﬁrms from competition (e.g., restricted market entry, ﬁscal advantages, subsidized
            debt, guaranteed sales); and courting foreign technology transfer through various arrangements. In China, notably,
            the government has pursued a policy known as “exchange of market for technology,” which consists of facilitating
            the entry of foreign ﬁrms (relaxing restriction on foreign investment, offering ﬁscal advantages) involved in

                   domestically-beneﬁcial joint ventures (e.g. John Deere-Jalian) (Wang 2013). China now sports a healthy machinery
                   industry that caters both to home and export markets (Gao 2006).

                   On the demand side, one impediment that is speciﬁc and central to the adoption of agricultural machinery—
                   everywhere but particularly in East Asia—lies in its high ﬁxed costs. Although machines come in different sizes
                   and levels of sophistication, their indivisibility can represent a barrier to the adoption of costly equipment. This
                   is particularly problematic in regions such as East Asia where landholdings or farming operations have remained
                   small, limiting individual farmers’ ability to recoup a large investment. To address this issue, one approach has been
                   to support direct equipment purchases by farmers, using such instruments as price subsidies, concessional credit,
                   and extension services (while simultaneously fostering the development of machinery adapted to small farms and
                   their environment). In China, for example, short-listed machinery has been eligible for subsidies since 2004. By
                   one account, however, only 2-3 percent of (larger) farmers have taken advantage of it (sources cited in Gale 2013).
                   (The opening up of land rental markets in China (see Box 3) has given rise to larger farming operations able to take
                   advantage of machine services (Wang et al. 2014).)

                   A complementary and potentially more effective approach has been to promote equipment sharing
                   arrangements such as joint ownership, leasing, and farming services. The Chinese government, for example,
                   aided the development of now widely used combine service enterprise clusters by subsidizing the price of machines
                   and warehouse space; exonerating them from road tolls while improving roads; and offering them market intelligence
                   (e.g., harvest calendars) that helped them to develop viable service areas spanning multiple provinces (across
                   which they can spread high ﬁxed costs). The government also helped these entrepreneurs develop cooperative
                   relationships that have enabled them to share the costs of maintenance and coordinate their service areas—for
                   instance, by paying for their cell phone communications for a time (Yang et al. 2013).



                      Box 11: Korea’s Agricultural Mechanization Plan: Combining Supply- and Demand-Side Components

                      Korea’s ﬁrst Five Year Agricultural Mechanization plan, dating to 1970, can be used to illustrate this combination of
                      supply and demand components. Focused on promoting the uptake of small-scale machinery (such as power tillers) in
                      rice farming, the plan supported research and development to adapt equipment to Korean conditions, favored Korean-
                      made machines, and strengthened machinery inspection and quality control services. It also required manufacturers to
                      develop far-reaching sales networks and after-sale services, and to collaborate with public extension services that were
                      put in place to train farms in the use of machines. The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, present across the
                      country, also took part in promotional efforts. Meanwhile, farmers were given access to concessional credit to purchase
                      machinery or lease equipment purchased by a joint-use organization put in place for this purpose. By the 1990s, and
                      several plans later, the mechanization of Korea’s rice sector could be considered complete, and Korea had become an
                      exporter of agricultural machinery to developed countries; after which the government’s focus shifted to the uptake of
                      machinery to support value-addition (e.g., in horticulture) (Yun Jin Ha and Kim Kyeong Uk 2013; Kang jung-il 2006).

            Thematic Sheet F - Greening Agriculture I: Payment for Ecosystem Services


            Payments for ecosystem services (PES) offer a market-based approach to environmental management that
            involve the direct compensation of land stewards to maintain speciﬁed ecosystem services, usually through
            conservation and restoration activities. Deﬁning features of PES transactions are that they are voluntary46, and
            contingent on the continued of a well-deﬁned ecosystem service (or a form of land-use likely to secure that service)
            (CIFOR 2006). Payments can refer to direct cash payments, or other forms of compensation, and can be used, for
            example, to incentivize landowners to grow trees to sequester carbon, restore vegetative cover to ﬁlter and clean
            water, conserve landscapes so to preserve cultural and aesthetic value, or preserve biodiversity to minimize the
            need for fertilizers and pesticides. In the context of agriculture, PES are typically used either for farmers to retire
            land from production, or to adopt production systems that preserve or contribute to ecosystem services.

            Although PES are part of a market-based mechanism, their proper functioning depends on policies and
            institutions (whether at the local, national or international level), and hence, on investment in these.
            Experience with PES has demonstrated that national institutional capacity for the valuation of services, the
            collection of fees and compensation of providers, and the redistribution of value are essential elements for success



                   Box 12: Public-Private Water Services and Quality Protection in Latin America

                   In several countries, including Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, and Brazil, companies have partnered with municipal
                   authorities and environmental non-proﬁts (notably The Nature Conservancy) to put in place water funds that aim to
                   offer participants a cost-effective means of securing the clean water resource on which they depend. These funds are
                   used in large part to incentivize land owners, farmers, households, or communities to adopt better land management
                   practices, often in connection with farming. In Latin America, at least 23 local water funds invested $3.8 million in
                   watersheds in 2011, affecting an estimated 125,000 hectares of land (Benett et al. 2013).47 Contributions to these are
                   mostly voluntary, though some (e.g., in Ecuador) beneﬁt from earmarked water-user fees and municipal contributions.
                   Several receive contributions from agribusinesses, including sugar mills and breweries (e.g., in Colombia). Though
                   some offer cash payments, several offer in-kind incentives such as training, agro-inputs, ﬁnding that these can be
                   better perceived by and more motivating to stewards of the land. It is also common for these programs to work with
                   and build the capacity of community-based organizations. In fact, these programs often prefer to refer to themselves
                   as reciprocal watershed agreements or cost-sharing programs rather than as payment for ecosystem services programs
                   (PES), with their more market-oriented overtone.
                   In Colombia, a global beverages company has used PES to help protect the water resources on which its operations
                   depend. The impetus came partly from rising water fees. With operations on the outskirts of Bogota, the company
                   depends on the public water supply, the quality of which was being negatively impacted by upstream agriculture and
                   related land clearing and degradation. And water-users were bearing the burden of escalating water treatment costs. The
                   company has partnered with the water utility company, the national parks agency, and an international conservation
                   organization to address the problem at the root. It now pays into a water fund that is used to support stewardship
                   activities designed to keep sediment out of the waterways that supply Bogota. Under one of the company’s initiatives,
                   farmers are paid to adopt modiﬁed farming practices, to restore degraded lands, or to relocate their activities—in
                   particular, to graze livestock on less steeply sloping pastures.


            46      Although the motivation for transacting may be rooted in regulatory requirements in some instances (e.g., wetland or greenhouse gas emission mitigation requirements).
            47      PES programs, more broadly deﬁned, are estimated to have made at least $84 million in payments in the region in 2011 (Bennett et al. 2013). More PES programs are in place
                    in the region, including large national programs in Mexico and Costa Rica.

                   (based on Rodriguez in Rapidel et al. eds. 2011). Moreover, PES programs are most effective when they are couched
                   in broader policy objectives (e.g., pertaining to rural development or the environment), and when those policies
                   call for the use of economic incentives (based on Rodriguez in Rapidel et al. eds. 2011). PES, in that respect,
                   are best understood as more than a ﬁnancial mechanism or tool, and rather as a package of policy, legal, and
                   institutional arrangements. Framed this way, PES programs require broad involvement on the part of government
                   and private sector stakeholders, and the elaboration of a shared vision or framework that clariﬁes expectations and
                   responsibilities (e.g., as they relate to the legal framework, monitoring, enforcement, standard-setting, knowledge
                   management, ﬁnance, technical work, and so forth).

                   Over the past decade, PES programs have grown tremendously, driven in part by increasing private sector
                   participation on the buyer side, and by the rise of formal markets for speciﬁc ecosystem services such as
                   carbon, water, and biodiversity. Various PES programs dedicated to protecting water quality in Latin America have,
                   as Box 12 illustrates, been possible thanks to public-private partnership. However, while private conservation groups
                   and companies are important players in PES programs, public agencies remain the leading buyers of ecosystem
                   services (UNEP 2012). In fact, government willingness to pay for ecosystem services seems to be growing in the
                   developing world; some of the largest PES programs, in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, and China, are primarily
                   or fully funded with domestic resources (e.g., revenues from general taxes, or water- and electricity-use fees)
                   (Milder et al. 2010). China’s Grain for Green program, and the United States’ Conservation Reserve Program, are two
                   examples of government-funded PES programs that have been deployed on a wide scale—in both case, to mitigate
                   and prevent soil erosion among other forms of environmental degradation linked with agriculture (see Box 13).

                        China’s Grain for Green Program. The government of China launched the Grain for Green program in 1999, in the
                        wake of the calamitous ﬂooding of the Yangtze, Songhua and Neijing rivers, which brought the extent, severity, and
                        signiﬁcance of soil erosion to the public’s attention.48 The program started in the western provinces of Sichuan,
                        Shaanxi and Gansu, where soil erosion was particularly pronounced due to forest clearing and over-logging on sloping
                        lands. In 2002, the program went national, and by 2008, it had succeeded at converting over 8 million hectares of
                        erosion-prone cropland to forest (Liu and Wu 2010). To achieve this, the program incentivized farmers to retire and
                        afforest cropland using mostly cash and some grain subsidies. The program also substantially covered the costs of
                        afforestation activities.
                        In early years, the program faced the challenge of gaining households’ trust—a challenge it overcame by mobilizing
                        local leaders. And in many cases, the economic incentives exceeded what farmers could earn from business-as-usual
                        activities. In that respect, it is possible that the size of subsidies was not fully optimized, and indeed, the program
                        fell short of its targets, converting only 56 percent of the total land it set out to convert. The program has been
                        criticized for accentuating inequality by transferring the most resources to families holding the most land. However,

                   The United States Conservation Reserve Program. Since 1985, the United States government has administered a
                   similar conservation program that pays farmers to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production
                   and instead plant species that improve water quality, prevent soil erosion, and provide wildlife habitat. The Conservation
                   Reserve Program (CRP) involves 10–15 year-long contracts under which farmers receive annual rental payments from the
                   government. The program also defrays the costs of eligible conservation practices, including for example shelter belts,
                   wetlands buffers, contour grass strips, and salt-tolerant vegetation. Though managed through local Farm Service Agency
                   ofﬁces, the CRP is national in scope and farmers compete nationally to enroll. Their applications are scored and ranked
                   on the basis of both their costs and environmental beneﬁts, factoring in the sensitivity of the land, the practices that
                   farmers propose to adopt, the sustainability of these practices beyond the duration of the contract, and the annual rental
                   payments and cost-sharing farmers require to implement these. The program considers multiple areas of environmental
                   impact, including beneﬁts to wildlife habitat, water quality, erosion, and air quality.

                   When it comes to taking up sustainable agricultural practices, producers need and respond to market signals.
                   In this respect, ecological or sustainability standards and certiﬁcation programs can be helpful in sending a clear
                   market signal. Moreover, the active promotion over the past twenty years of sustainable agriculture and related
                   standards by organizations such as the Rainforest Alliance (RA), the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI), and
                   the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance (the ISEAL Alliance), as well as
                   by commodity roundtables (e.g., for sustainable soy, palm oil, biofuels, cocoa, sugar, and rice), has led to a
                   dramatic increase in market demand for eco-certiﬁed agricultural products. As of 2010, the market for certiﬁed
                   agricultural products was worth over $64 billion, and estimated to be growing by around 15 percent per year (in
                   UNEP 2012). Business-to-consumer certiﬁcation is generally accompanied by product labeling, and examples of
                   eco-labels include those of the RA, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), and various organic certiﬁcation
                   programs. Examples of business-to-business certiﬁcation programs are SAI and GlobalGAP.49 Over time, many
                   sustainable sourcing programs have become increasingly oriented to sourcing from small-scale producers (UNEP
                   2012, Famine). Sustainability certiﬁcation can, in some cases, help small-scale farmers reach more lucrative mar-
                   kets and generate higher margins (Blackmore et al. 2012 in UNEP 2012).



                        Box 14: Building a Legislative Framework for Sustainability: Organic Agriculture in Tunisia

                        In Tunisia, the public sector has played a central and proactive role in developing standards and a certiﬁcation system for
                        organic agriculture. In 1999, the government put a comprehensive legal framework in place (a law and over 15 decrees
                        and orders), followed by a national action plan. The law emerged from a highly consultative process involving multiple
                        government ministries and sector stakeholders and draws selectively on elements of European laws and standards while
                        responding to Tunisian priorities.
                        The Ministry of Agriculture, in charge of its implementation, houses several bodies and oversees multiple programs
                        dedicated to supporting organic agriculture. The National Commission of Organic Agriculture, for example, sets policy
                        direction and facilitates the uptake of organic production and certiﬁcation for export. The National Bureau of Organic
                        Certiﬁcation is responsible for monitoring organic certiﬁcation (including accrediting certiﬁers); manages a database
                        of organic certiﬁers, certiﬁcates, product traceability, crops, volumes, markets and exports; and participates in bodies
                        dedicated to harmonizing organic standards. The Technical Centre of Organic Agriculture undertakes applied research
                        to support organic farming (e.g., it experiments with crop rotations, composting, rearing of insects for biological pest
                        control, and so forth), and offers technical advice and training to farmers and researchers. Meanwhile, the Tunisian
                        government also supports organic agriculture with tax breaks and other ﬁnancier incentives (as of 2008, these could
                        cover up to 70 percent of the costs of certiﬁcation). In the 2000s, the number of certiﬁed organic farms and exports
                        both experienced a leap of signiﬁcant proportion as a result of these and other interventions. As of 2008, Tunisia had the
                        largest area of certiﬁed organic land on the African continent (Carey 2008).




                   Though the private, non-proﬁt sector has been the motor behind the growth in eco-certiﬁcation, the public
                   sector can and has in some cases played a role in developing, and enabling this form of market signaling. In
                   Tunisia, for example, government involvement in the development of standards illustrates how the public sector can

            play a key role in deﬁning what sustainable means (see Box 14). In Ireland, the public sector is building the entire
            food sector’s brand and credibility as a sustainable food exporter by enlisting suppliers in a rigorous and certiﬁable
            process of measurement and continuous improvement (see Box 15). In Brazil, a non-proﬁt is helping an increasing
            number of soy producers progress toward sustainability certiﬁcation—under private, voluntary standards—by
            building knowledge and trust, illustrating an enabling and supportive role that the public sector can also play (see
            Box 16).



                   Box 15: Building a Business Case for Sustainability: Ireland’s Origin Green Program

                   In Ireland, the national food promotion agency (afﬁliated with the Department of Agriculture), Board Bia, has had
                   broad success involving agricultural producers as well as food and beverage manufacturers in the national sustainability
                   program that it put in place in 2012 (building on its previously existing quality assurance programs). The program aims
                   to cover the entire Irish food and beverage sector. Roughly two years after inception, some 60 percent of Irish food and
                   drink exports came from veriﬁed program members. To qualify as members, food manufacturers must develop a multi-
                   annual sustainability plan with targets pertaining to raw material sourcing, resource efﬁciency, and social sustainability,
                   and report annually on their progress against those targets. Both the plan and annual reports are third-party audited.
                   Farmers, for their part, undergo sustainability audits every 18 months and receive advice on how they can mitigate the
                   environmental impacts of their operations. So far, the program has focused on enrolling beef and dairy farmers and its
                   audits look among other things at greenhouse gas emissions, animal and herd performance, feed, traceability, and agro-
                   chemical use efﬁciency.
                   Several factors have contributed to the program’s success to date. One is that the program has beneﬁted from broad
                   public sector support and national visibility. Indeed, it was put in place as part of a broader national strategy targeting
                   increased exports by 2020, speciﬁcally to build the reputation of the Irish food and drink sector as supplier of high
                   quality and sustainably-produced products. The program has also attracted producers by making a business case
                   for adopting greener practices. On a macro level, Irish farmers widely recognize sustainability as a strength of Irish
                   agriculture and perceive Origin Green as a vehicle to communicate this to international markets. On an individual
                   business level, the signiﬁcant savings that the program has helped participants identify through its audits—particularly
                   for manufacturers—has been key to building participation.
                   Related to this last factor, a key aspect of the program is that it provides participating farmers and manufacturers with
                   feedback and advice. It lets farmers know, for example, how they are performing relative to their peers, both in relation
                   to the environment and their bottom line. In order to become members, farmers must open their operations to audits,
                   which among other things, calculate farmers’ carbon footprint. High rates of participation in this data-intensive process
                   have been made possible by information-sharing agreements among participating organizations, and the use of smart
                   handheld technology for on-farm data collection.

                   Box 16: Building Capacity for Sustainability: Certiﬁed Soy in Brazil

                   In Brazil, the non-proﬁt organization Aliança da Terra (AT) is helping soy producers gradually work toward Round Table
                   on Responsible Soy (RTRS) certiﬁcation, a label that promotes the sustainable use of land, natural biosphere protection,
                   and social responsibility. In many cases, rural producers lack awareness of or a ﬁrm grasp of the technical requirements of
                   certiﬁcation. AT addresses this by helping farmers acquire and apply knowledge related to sustainable practices, helping
                   them to design and implement cost-effective, social and economic improvements on their property. Meanwhile, AT’s own
                   Registry of Socio-Environmental Responsibility (RSR) guides and encourages landowners to improve their production
                   practices in steps. For this, the RSR measures and records landowners’ progress against a range of criteria related namely
                   to water quality, biodiversity, and vegetation productivity. Based on farm-level assessments against such criteria, AT
                   works with landowners to structure commitment plans to bring operations up to RTRS standards. The organization claims
                   that farms in the registry incur 25–55 percent lower certiﬁcation costs than those that are not.
                   In addition to playing a knowledge-transfer function, AT also plays a brokerage role, acting as a conduit among those
                   seeking, granting and requiring certiﬁcation. The ability to play this role is largely a function of trust, and AT has worked
                   at developing and maintain credibility. In 2012, for example, AT signaled its commitment to rigor when it excluded
                   108 properties from its registry for non-compliance.

            Thematic Sheet H - Greening Agriculture III: Multi-Stakeholder Approaches
            to Greening Agriculture
            Many successful green agriculture initiatives have involved close collaboration among an array of public and
            private entities. Vietnam has been moving in this direction with some of its agricultural public-private partnerships.
            Three international examples are highlighted here. Landcare is an example of a grassroots movement to promote
            sustainable practices. The movement originated in and is most developed in Australia (see Box 17). Paraguay’s
            success, over the past decade, at curbing rampant deforestation in the eastern part of the country offers an example
            of how multi-stakeholder involvement in implementing well-designed legal and institutional measures can keep
            the environmental damage of a booming agriculture sector in check (see Box 18). In addition, the central role of
            forest policy in this case, illustrates how greening agriculture can rest on the adoption of policies in other sectors.
            In Italy’s La Marche region, the Valdaso agro-environmental agreement also illustrates the power of landscape-level
            collective action—involving multiple stakeholders across the public and private sectors—to mitigate agriculture’s
            impact on the environment (see Box 19). This case differs from that of Paraguay, however, in that collective action
            developed on a purely voluntary basis.



                   Box 17: The Landcare Movement in Australia and Beyond

                   Landcare is a grassroots movement that originated in Australia in the 1980s to curb the degradation of farmland, public
                   land and waterways. The movement acquired national support and recognition in the 1990s in Australia, and has spread
                   to multiple other countries including South Africa, the Philippines, Kenya, Uganda, Fiji and Sri Lanka. Landcare groups
                   promote sustainable agricultural practices and undertake a range of restoration activities. Examples include promoting
                   practices to combat soil erosion and salinization, rehabilitating waterways, wetlands and coastal ecosystems, planting
                   trees, shrubs and grasses, and protecting species.
                   Deﬁning features of Landcare include its emphasis on people and communities ﬁnding and implementing solutions for
                   natural resources management, as well as on communities building the capacity and ethic to pursue these (based on
                   Catacutan et al. in Minang et al. eds. 2015). The Landcare approach is more bent on the development of social norms
                   around conservation, than on the monetization of conservation beneﬁts or on the development of economic incentives
                   for conservation more generally. In this respect, the growing prominence of programs which tie economic incentives to
                   the conservation behaviors of local people may represent a challenge for the Landcare movement. These incentive-based
                   programs, which include monetary compensation, revenue-sharing schemes, and conservation concessions, can fall short
                   in their ability to generate broad community support, for example, or to maintain beneﬁts over the long-term (based on
                   Catacutan et al. in Minang et al. eds. 2015).
                   In Australia today, Landcare designates a network of around 6,000 groups—Landcare, Coastcare, Bushcare, Rivercare,
                   Indigenous, and other related community and farmer groups—and over 100,000 volunteers, working to support farmers
                   and ﬁshers adopt sustainable production and resource management practices. These groups are organized in regional-
                   level organizations known as Catchment Management Authorities or Integrated Natural Resource Management groups.
                   While initiative continues to come from the community level, the Australian government now substantially supports this
                   structure at the local, regional, and national levels. The department of agriculture supports Landcare in a variety of ways,
                   including by training Landcare facilitators and leaders, ﬁnancially supporting regional Landcare and other organizations,
                   sponsoring knowledge-sharing activities, ﬁnancing or rewarding farm-level innovation, and directly funding certain
                   environmental restoration activities.

                   Prior to 2004, lucrative opportunities to grow soy and cattle had driven the eastern part of Paraguay and its Upper Parana
                   Atlantic Forest—one of the earth’s most biologically important—to experience the second-fastest rate of deforestation
                   in the world. Seven million hectares of tropical forest were destroyed in 40 years, leaving only 13 percent of the original
                   forest standing. In 2004, the government passed a forest conversion moratorium known as the zero deforestation law
                   that made it illegal to clear protected forest land. By 2009, the rate of deforestation had declined by 90 percent
                   compared to a 2002 baseline. Since 2004, the law has been extended twice, and as of 2011, reforestation rates were at
                   an all-time high.
                   Robust enforcement systems certainly played a role: satellite monitoring, and the threat of ﬁnes, forced social work, and
                   jail time were key factors. However, the reversal that was observed would not have been possible had these sticks been
                   developed from the top-down, or used alone. Instead, results on the ground coincided with the development of grassroots
                   coalitions that mobilized numerous and disparate interest groups to voluntarily support the law’s implementation. One
                   coalition that played a key role was the Social Pact for the Conservation of the Atlantic Forests. Although it took shape
                   with international support from the UNDP and WWF, the Pact rallied 139 organizations—from the weak to powerful—
                   around the zero deforestation goal. Importantly, it brought soy producers onboard by demonstrating to them that the
                   law need not halt the industry’s growth, thanks to the potential for expanding production on existing fallow lands.
                   By bringing the timber industry, major soy producers, farmers, unions, indigenous communities, national and regional
                   government, and other parts of civil society around the same table, the Pact facilitated the development of effective
                   systems of control.
                   Of note, the government, in 2006, passed a law that was meant to enable trading among land owners with compliance
                   obligations under the zero deforestation law—in essence, a forest conservation cap-and-trade program. Once
                   implemented, it will allow large land owners to meet the requirement that at least 25 percent of their land be forested,
                   by paying other land owners—large or small—with forested lands in excess of their requirements (those with less than
                   20 hectares do not face the 25 percent requirement). Some see payments for ecosystem services) as one tool that will
                   facilitate continued forest conservation in the longer term.




                   Box 19: An Agro-Environmental Pact to Cut Agro-Chemicals in Italy

                   While aesthetically well preserved, the Valdaso area in La Marche region of Italy has suffered from intensive agriculture
                   and in particular from the heavy use of pesticides in fruit orchards. Since 2009, however, this situation has been
                   improving as the result of the Valdaso agro-environmental agreement—a private sector agreement reached with public
                   sector funding. The agreement has broadened farmers’ awareness of the impacts of their practices on natural resources,
                   and increased their adoption of sustainable farming practices. The agreement notably speciﬁes targets for cutting the
                   aggregate use of agro-chemicals (within ﬁve to seven years), and identiﬁes alternative management practices—such as
                   integrated pest management, organic farming, and soil protection techniques—that farmers can adopt to reach their
                   stated goals. A concrete result is that many farmers are taking practical measures to curb their use of agro-chemicals.
                   The early impetus for the agreement came from a small group of concerned farmers, who in 2007 formed an association
                   to promote more sustainable practices. As the process gained momentum, farmers continued to play a key role, namely
                   in identifying alternative farming techniques that are adapted to local needs and conditions. The public sector also
                   played a signiﬁcant role from an early stage, ultimately funding and brokering much of the process leading to agreement.
                   Different levels of government were involved in different ways. The regional government and EU, for example, funded and
                   gave structure to much of the process leading to agreement, while provincial authorities and the regional agricultural
                   advisory agency (ASSAM) played a signiﬁcant role in working with farmers to broker and deﬁne, and later to promote and
                   implement, the agreement.

            Thematic Sheet I - Adaptive Management and Climate Change


            Climate change is often thought of as the embodiment of well-deﬁned risks such as those brought by extreme
            weather and sea level rise (e.g., more intense droughts, ﬂoods, heat waves, cold fronts, and storms, resulting
            in crop stress and damage, the loss of suitable agricultural land, and so forth). While this is an accurate view,
            climate change is in equal part a conveyor of uncertainty, in that it is raising the level of unpredictability with
            respect to both the nature and magnitude of future risks.

            The high degree of uncertainty that is intrinsic to climate change has renewed interest in adaptive
            management, a structured learning-by-doing-approach which takes as its starting point the idea that coping
            with novel situations requires the capacity to learn (Moore ed. 2009). Adaptive management was ﬁrst embraced
            as a concept in ecology during the 1970s (Holling 1978), as a means to reduce the ecological, social, and economic
            costs of learning (Peterson et al. 1997). Indeed, waiting for better-established information to materialize to take
            action can be more costly than acting on imperfect information, provided that this course of action build in stock
            taking and ﬂexibility.

            Adaptive management guides policy decisions or management practices to reﬂect best available knowledge,
            but also to monitor system responses, and to respond to new opportunities and risks (based on Moore ed.
            2009). This requires a rigorous approach to monitoring and analyzing management outcomes, and a willingness
            to update management practices and priorities, but also objectives and learning processes (see Box 20 on its
            application in the U.S.). U.S. government guidance on the application of adaptive management notes that it can
            be useful to interrupt the technical learning cycle of decision-making, monitoring, assessment and feedback, with
            an institutional learning cycle that reconsiders overall objectives (those established at an earlier stage), or even
            aspects of the learning-and-adaptation process (Williams and Brown 2012). In practice, all of the above often
            requires involved organizations to transition from traditional, top-down organizational structures to more inclusive,
            collaborative, ﬂexible, and risk tolerant ones (Gunderson 1999, Stankey et al. 2005, in Williams and Brown 2012).



                   Box 20: Applications of Adaptive Management in the United States

                   Adaptive management has been used in many contexts. In the U.S., for example, it has been used to manage river
                   ﬂows, the breeding habitat and food supply of endangered species, acid rain pollution, wetlands restoration, and
                   much more (Nyberg 1999, Williams and Brown 2012). And multiple government agencies are increasingly turning to
                   or even in some cases requiring adaptive management as a means to address climate change uncertainty, given the
                   recognition that optimal courses of action cannot be developed for all possible scenarios (multiple sources cited in
                   Convertino et al. 2013). Climate change, moreover, is only one source of uncertainty—other sources of it coming
                   from political, budgetary, and stakeholder preference change. One key lesson from this experience is that monitoring
                   outcomes, analyzing alternative scenarios, and drawing lessons from observations, can all be challenging and costly.
                   Noting this, Convertino et al. (2013) conclude that “without a framework that links results of modeling and monitoring
                   to management decisions, the degree of learning from the results of monitoring and ability to use those results to reﬁne
                   the monitoring plan will be limited.”

                   Thematic Sheet J - ICT in Agriculture


                   Adaptive management, the greening of agriculture, and other competitiveness-boosting transformations
                   discussed in this report can be a knowledge- and data-intensive endeavor, as well as one that involves
                   complex, non-linear interactions among a multiplicity of actors. While the examples above highlight some of
                   the institutional requirements to support this reality, the following examples highlight how advances in information
                   communication technology (ICT) are supporting approaches that previously would have been too time consuming or
                   too costly to undertake.

                   ICT refers here to computing, cellular and internet-enabled connectivity, and communication platforms
                   more broadly.50 In Uruguay and Ireland, for example, ICT is facilitating the ﬂow of information between farmers
                   and authorities and enabling data-intensive, evidence-based approaches to sustainable land management and
                   farming (see Box 21, and Ireland’s Origin Green Program discussed in Thematic Sheet G, Box 15). By providing
                   highly tailored, relevant, and timely meteorological information to farmers, the government of a province in
                   Turkey has enabled farmers to drastically reduce their use of pesticides in fruit orchards (see Box 22). In all three
                   cases, ICT is arguably enabling a gradual move toward a kind of precision-farming at the service of sustainability.



                        Box 21: Data-Driven Planning: Uruguay’s Agricultural Information and Decision-Support System

                        Already well-known for its national livestock traceability system, Uruguay has been making intensive use of data and
                        traceability systems to support the sustainable intensiﬁcation and resilience of agriculture across the country. One
                        notable initiative that relies heavily on ICT has involved the establishment of an agricultural information and decision
                        support system, known as the SNIA (its Spanish acronym). Conceived of in the wake of extreme weather in 2008-2009,
                        the SNIA was originally thought of as part of an early-warning system, as well as a planning tool for farmers. The data
                        system publicly launched in 2014 and collects data on climate, soil, and crop production.
                        The SNIA rests on but also enables two-way information ﬂows between the system and farmers. On the one hand, much
                        of the SNIA’s data ﬂows up from farmers; since 2013, those with more than 100 hectares have been legally required to
                        submit annual soil-use and -management plans for example. On the other hand, its database—which brings together
                        data from multiple other sources including remote sensing—forms a substrate for a range of public information and
                        advisory services, and decision-support tools, geared to supporting farmers make land-use and production choices, as
                        well as to better access markets. For example, a recently developed indicator will use data from the SNIA to capture
                        the impact of weather events on production variability—using bottom-up data from the soil plans in combination with
                        real-time weather and other nationally available data. The indicator is meant to serve both policy-level and farm-level
                        decisions.
                        The entire system—from data collection to use—is heavily reliant on ITC. Farmers, for example, submit all of their data
                        electronically, via an online interface. Farmer soil plans, which need to be certiﬁed by accredited experts, are veriﬁed
                        against the results of an erosion simulation model; and the execution of these plans is overseen using satellite imagery.
                        The extension agents being trained to help farmers draw up and execute these plans are being trained not only in-person
                        but also via an online platform. While institutional factors are likely to be the biggest determinant of the system’s
                        success over time, its use of ICT is fundamental to the system’s architecture and scalability.




                   50    The World Bank sourcebook on ICT in agriculture (2011) deﬁnes ICT as “any device, tool, or application that permits the exchange or collection of data through interaction or
                         transmission. ICT is an umbrella term that includes anything ranging from radio to satellite imagery to mobile phones or electronic money transfers.”

                   Box 22: Information-based Farming: Actionable Weather Forecasts in Kastamonu Province, Turkey

                   Agricultural pesticides can be a signiﬁcant contributor to non-point source water pollution. At the same time, orchards
                   are highly susceptible to pests, the comings and goings of which are extremely sensitive to weather conditions. An
                   additional challenge is that differences in humidity, precipitation, temperature, and other relevant variables can be
                   signiﬁcant (from a pest perspective) from one farm to the next, such that national weather forecasts are generally
                   insufﬁciently correlated with farm-speciﬁc conditions to be of much help to farmers in managing pests. This is especially
                   true when national forecasts are based on data collected in warmer, urban areas. The timing of national forecasts can
                   also come too late for farmers to take precautionary measures.
                   This was the case in the Kastamonu Province in Turkey, until province-level authorities established a local meteorological
                   forecasting service that better served farmers’ needs. In order to collect more relevant data, the province put in place
                   several rural weather stations, as well as multiple reference farms at which weather conditions were measured and pest
                   cycles monitored. With these data, the weather service began to generate higher-ﬁdelity and therefore more relevant
                   weather forecasts. What more, it delivered these to farmers on a daily basis via SMS, in time to take preventive measures.
                   Within two years of this program being put in place, pesticide applications dropped by 50 percent in one year, saving
                   farmers the expense of chemicals, and keeping these out of the soil and runoff (World Bank 2011).

                   Thematic Sheet K - Collective Action I: Producer Organizations


                   Producer organizations can play a key role in fostering inclusive innovation and competitiveness in value
                   chains. They can also take on an important role in activities traditionally dominated by the public sector, such as
                   input provision, research and extension, and natural resource management. Ekboir (in World Bank 2012) identiﬁes
                   four types of farmer organizations:

                     x Traditional, commodity-based farmer organizations such as the Colombia Coffee Growers’ Federation, India’s
                       dairy cooperatives, or the Kenya Tea Development Agency, play a role in diffusing technical innovations and in
                       coordinating large numbers of farmers. These often carry out research internally.

                     x Nontraditional, market-oriented farmer organizations such as Papa Andina aim to improve market access
                       by fostering collaboration among key actors in the marketing chain. They usually take interest in social and
                       commercial innovation as well as the technical kind, and foster it through a combination of participatory
                       processes and afﬁliations with universities and research centers.

                     x Innovation-oriented farmer organizations, such as no-till farmer associations in Latin America, explicitly focus
                       on developing and diffusing technical, commercial, and organizational innovations. They often proactively
                       build and coordinate diverse networks involving local farmer organizations, research institutes, private ﬁrms,
                       and public agencies; and they usually use a combination of top-down and bottom-up (participatory) research
                       methods.

                     x Service-oriented farmer organizations, such as Mexico’s Produce Foundations, aim to offer farmers a range
                       of services—ﬁnancial, extension, training, advocacy, research and others—and usually do so through the
                       development of local organizations, partnerships, and networks.

                   There is no recipe for creating innovative producer organizations, and effective organizations have different
                   origin stories—involving various levels of donor or government support. Nonetheless, strong producer
                   organizations generally exhibit several common attributes including a clearly articulated purpose; effective and
                   transparent governance structures; active engagement of members; leadership that is prevented from being captured
                   by narrower interest groups; social cohesion; an organizational culture that embraces change; the ability to learn
                   and adapt, and to identify and address the organization’s needs; strong technical capabilities; and the ability to
                   mobilize resources and participate to in networks (based on Ekboir in World Bank 2012). Innovative producer
                   organizations also tend to have federated structures—that is, they are composed of small, linked farmer groups—as
                   strong roots in communities facilitate upward participation and downward accountability (Ekboir in World Bank
                   2012). In many cases, they beneﬁt from ﬁnancial support from government, donors, or lead ﬁrms; it is not the norm
                   for producer organizations to be fully self-ﬁnancing.

                   Strong producer organizations can also spur product innovation and market development. The case of Ocean
                   Spray Cranberries illustrates how market innovation can lead a cooperative to assume a leading role in a commercial
                   value chain (see Box 23).

                   Box 23: From Cooperation to Product Innovation: the Case of Ocean Spray Cranberries

                   From its humble beginnings in 1930, when it was formed by three cranberry farmers, Ocean Spray has become the US’
                   leading commercial supplier of high value-added cranberry products—largely products of its own creation. Its feat has
                   been to transform the cranberry, a seasonal fruit with limited distribution, into a “superfruit” renowned for its health
                   beneﬁts and entire line of processed, differentiated and branded products that are widely consumed year-round.
                   Cranberry Canners, the predecessor of Ocean Spray Cooperative, was initially formed to process unsuitable or surplus
                   cranberries. It labeled these products Ocean Spray, the name the cooperative would assume in 1957. The cooperatives’
                   efforts to expand consumer demand for processed cranberry products paid off in the 1950s, when sales of cranberry
                   products initially overtook those of fresh cranberries. Cranberry products took off in earnest the following decade as
                   yields and harvesting technology improved, and the cooperative started introducing new products such as Cran-Apple
                   and other juice blends that rapidly gained popularity. Later, the cooperative actively promoted research on the multiple
                   health beneﬁts of cranberries. The cooperative’s sustained product innovations and involvement in industry-wide efforts
                   to manage production levels were critical in turning around a sharp decline in cranberry sales in the late 1990s.

                   Thematic Sheet L - Collective Action II: Contract Farming


                   Contract farming is a transaction-based approach to coordination in agro-food value chains. Though contract
                   farming is centuries old and its track record is mixed, there is rising interest in its potential to address traditional as
                   well as emerging challenges related to food production and marketing. These include increasing demand for quality,
                   sustainability, traceability, and certiﬁcation, and growing competition for agricultural land and labor (based on
                   Will/GIZ 2013).

                   On the most basic level, contract farming offers a potential means to reduce the transaction costs involved
                   in sourcing agricultural products, and conversely, getting these to market. Though there is no single contract
                   farming model, it generally involves a formal agreement—often between a multiplicity of producers and at least one
                   buyer such as a processor or trader—to buy/sell agricultural products on terms established in advance. In addition,
                   it is common for contract farming agreements to address market failures surrounding the provision of agricultural
                   inputs, technology, and services such as ﬁnance, extension, training, transportation, and logistics—by involving
                   buyers or third parties in delivering these to farmers.

                   Contract farming has also become a growth strategy for a number of processing and trading ﬁrms facing
                   tightening land, labor, or other resource constraints, as well as increasing pressure to meet more rigorous
                   or restrictive environmental, labor, social, land-use, food safety, quality, and traceability standards. In some
                   contexts, smallholders can become a source of competitive advantage by providing access to ever scarcer land and
                   labor resources, and local farming knowledge (Will/GIZ 2013). And comprehensive, forward-looking arrangements
                   with such producers can help lower the costs and increase the feasibility of meeting higher standards. Buyer
                   involvement ranges from providing or dictating the use of certain inputs (e.g., speciﬁc varieties), to controlling
                   or investing in most aspects of production from land preparation to harvesting (e.g., land, machines, staff,
                   management). The latter is often true when large volumes of a commodity need to be of a uniform quality for
                   processing (e.g., sugar cane, cotton, coffee, tea, dairy, poultry, and so forth); and when buyers source from their
                   own estates as well as contracted farmers (e.g., outgrower schemes involving perennials, Will/GIZ 2013).

                   When it goes well, contract farming can offer buyers greater consistency in terms of quality and volumes, a
                   better alignment of supplies and customer requirements, and lower operating risks and costs. For smallholders,
                   central beneﬁts of successful contract farming include enhanced access to markets along with higher and more
                   stable incomes. Under some arrangements, producers negotiate an equity stake (i.e., become joint owners) of
                   productive assets such as land and processing facilities.

                   While contract farming is primarily private-sector led, government support for such arrangements is not
                   uncommon on the grounds that these can contribute to meeting broader policy objectives such as inclusive
                   growth, food security, or the protection of natural resources. Besides improving the enabling environment (e.g.,
                   the rule of law, the quality of infrastructure, health, and education, political stability, ﬁnancial markets, and so
                   forth), government can encourage contract farming by facilitating interactions and brokering transactions among
                   potential counterparts, establishing a legal framework for farming contracts, putting economic incentives in place,
                   building technical and institutional capacity, and educating counterparts about potential beneﬁts and risks. India,
                   Vietnam, Morocco, Thailand and other countries have developed policies aimed at promoting it (Will/GIZ 2013).
                   Box 24 offers an example of a public-sector led approach to contract farming that has taken root in China. That

            said, the public sector needs to tread carefully. A number of contract farming arrangements have owed their failure
            to facilitators in the public or non-proﬁt sector getting ahead of value chain actors and pushing for arrangements
            that were not in line with existing capacities, ambitions, risk-preference, or levels of trust; or that put development
            objectives ahead of business viability.



                   Box 24: The Dragonhead Enterprise: An East Asian Take on Contract Farming

                   A public sector-led variant of contract farming, China’s dragonhead enterprise model has become a core part of the
                   government’s strategy to promote vertical coordination in agricultural value chains and help farmers access higher-
                   value markets by connecting them to leading agro-enterprises. It accomplishes this by offering subsidies, such as
                   ﬁscal incentives, to lead ﬁrms that formally qualify to receive the dragon head label. For this, ﬁrms must meet certain
                   requirements, including that they source at least 70 percent of the material they use in processing or distribution from
                   external, small-scale farms. Farmers, for their part, must join cooperatives to deliver their products to these ﬁrms.
                   Meanwhile, the government actively supports farmer cooperatives, which it sees as improving small-scale producers’
                   ability to meet food safety and quality requirements. It does so not only ﬁnancially, by offering credit, ﬁscal advantages
                   and direct support, but also by organizing mobilization meetings, providing land and ofﬁce space, and giving out awards
                   (Verhofstadt et al. 2014).
                   The dragonhead enterprise model resembles the agricultural cluster model (see related thematic sheet) in that it promotes
                   formal contracts and informal relationships to connect actors in the value chain. Unlike the cluster model, however, the
                   dragon head model centers around one or few, rather than a multiplicity, of ﬁrms to organize collective action. In that
                   sense, it is more akin to contract farming. The central place of the value chain construct in these approaches—which
                   actively seeks to link and promote cooperation and competition among value chain actors—is relatively new in China.
                   Until recently, different parts of the value chain fell under the purview of different government bodies and were treated
                   as separate. Now, the ministry of agriculture has been empowered to support value chains as a whole, as the government
                   has downgraded or abolished the role of other ministries (Galvez-Nogales/FAO 2010).

                   Thematic Sheet M - Collective Action III: Agro-based Clusters


                   Agro-based clusters51 foster interactions among all actors in a value chain, including public institutions, to
                   help innovation and competitiveness. Public sector promotion of agro-based clusters has emerged as one response to
                   the productivity and market pressures on agro-industry that are being shaped by globalization, standardization,
                   high-value production, massive growth in demand, retail and packaging innovations, and a ramp up in efﬁciency
                   (Galvez-Nogales/FAO 2010). They have been particularly helpful to export agriculture by improving productivity,
                   value-addition, and access to high-value markets. They have also beneﬁted small producers by allowing them to
                   participate in economies of scale and share costs related to training, quality management, market information,
                   and capital-intensive assets. Another beneﬁt of clusters, in some cases, has been their contribution to creating a
                   regional or brand identity, often with links to other clusters such as tourism (Galvez-Nogales/FAO 2010).

                   The public sector can support clusters in multiple ways that include investing in human capital through
                   education and training, promoting cooperation among ﬁrms, strengthening applied research institutions, and
                   adopting industry-friendly policies. Box 25 provides examples of this through examples of agro-based clusters in
                   Latin America.



                        Box 25: Public Sector Support for Clusters: Examples from Latin America

                        Clusters do not usually emerge spontaneously, but take shape through the efforts of agents such as government, large
                        local ﬁrms, foreign direct investors, and universities, often working in concert. In most cases, clusters are shaped by
                        public-private collaboration. The ﬂower cluster in Ecuador and apple cluster in Santa Catarina, Brazil, for example,
                        were the product of public collaboration with lead ﬁrms. In some cases, the private sector has played a driving role and
                        government has only become involved at a later stage as in the case of the Rio Grande do Norte melon cluster in Brazil
                        (Galvez-Nogales/FAO 2010).
                        Chile’s salmon cluster offers an example of a cluster in which government has played a signiﬁcant, supporting role.
                        That cluster is known for having turned Chile, previously a minor player in the salmon industry, into the world’s second
                        largest producer. In this case, government helped by building trust and facilitating joint action among different industry
                        players. It also funded and collaborated in research and program design efforts to overcome a wide variety of challenges
                        related to upgrading (e.g., ﬁsh health and genetics, supplier management and certiﬁcation, vaccine registration, coastal
                        zoning, ﬁsher registration, regulatory enforcement, and clean production). As in Chile’s multiple fruit clusters, an
                        integrated territorial program that sits within a key industry association helped to align regional government efforts
                        with business needs.
                        In some cases, as in the Chilean and Argentine wine clusters, government support has been decisive. In both cases, the
                        government played a pivotal role in liberalizing grape and wine production and exports, as well as in enabling collective
                        marketing and export promotion efforts. The public sector in Chile also supported technology absorption, especially by
                        small producers, while in Argentina, the government promoted public-private partnerships and participatory governance
                        which engaged industry in mutual monitoring. However, examples of government, alone, creating clusters from scratch
                        are extremely rare; the Brazilian Petrolina-Juazeiro mango and grape clusters are exceptional in this respect. This is
                        because clusters build upon the co-location of their actors, and the formal and informal linkages between them—
                        elements that develop organically, over time, even if they are later encouraged.


                   51    Agro-based clusters are a concentration of producers, agro-industries, traders and other private and public actors engaged in the same industry inter-connecting and building
                         value networks, either formally or informally, when addressing common challenges and pursuing the same opportunities (FAO 2010).

            Thematic Sheet N - Food Safety Governance


            High proﬁle outbreaks and increases in the recorded incidence of food-borne illness have led many
            governments to tighten food safety regulations and oversight. At the same time, industry has increasingly taken
            food safety into its own hands and developed private food safety control mechanisms (whether voluntarily or as
            directed by regulation or cooperative agreements). In several countries and regions including Canada, New Zealand,
            and the EU, the public sector has fostered close cooperation between government and industry, an approach broadly
            known as co-regulation.

            While a purely market-driven control system may not yield socially efﬁcient outcomes, Martinez et al. (2007)
            note the beneﬁts of co-regulation by highlighting how the alternative—an approach based solely on coercion—
            “can breed minimalist approaches to compliance resulting in sub-optimal improvements to public health alongside
            signiﬁcant expenditure of resources on enforcement and monitoring.” Greater coordination of public and private
            sector efforts can be beneﬁcial (in terms of efﬁcacy or efﬁciency) when it comes to setting food safety standards,
            but also when it comes to implementation, monitoring, and enforcement.

            Co-regulation typically involves cooperation between the public and private sectors to create new rules,
            whether these take the form of mandatory, binding, or purely voluntary food safety standards or agreements.
            In several countries, the public sector has come to rely increasingly on standardized risk and cost-beneﬁt assessment
            methodologies to objectively evaluate speciﬁc risks before taking regulatory action. In this context, co-regulation
            has represented an attempt to remedy the fact that oftentimes, these assessments have involved industry too little
            or too late (see Box 26). In some instances, the government has encouraged industry to develop and implement its
            own codes of good conduct.



                   Box 26: Examples of Co-regulation of Food Safety

                   Examples involving the development of standards. In Canada, for example, the impetus to develop on-farm HACCP52
                   programs came from a number of commodity organizations (especially for pork, chicken, and eggs); these started
                   developing voluntary codes of safe practices. Recognizing these efforts, the government stepped in in the capacity of
                   facilitator and coordinator, eventually leading to the formal recognition of individual commodity programs by the
                   Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
                   By contrast, the development of national, voluntary organic standard by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the early
                   2000s illustrates how the absence of co-regulation can result in the duplication of effort and slow progress. In this case,
                   although 50 organic certiﬁers operated prior to the national standards being put in place (by the U.S. Department of
                   Agriculture), the national standard did not attempt to build on these and the labeling program took ten years to develop
                   (Martinez et al. 2007).
                                                                                                                                                               Continued to next page.




            52      According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, HACCP is: “a management system in which food safety is addressed through the analysis and control of biological,
                    chemical, and physical hazards from raw material production, procurement and handling, to manufacturing, distribution and consumption of the ﬁnished product.” http://

                      Examples involving implementation. In Ontario (Canada), the province-level government has accompanied producers
                      in moving to a system of more stringent and mandatory standards (e.g., from Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) to
                      mandatory HACCP) (Martinez et al. 2007). Meanwhile, the province promulgated a voluntary standard for HACCP
                      implementation, HACCP Advantage, in meat and poultry processing that was developed in close collaboration with
                      these sectors. Since, the government body responsible for the regulatory inspection of processing facilities has played
                      no role in the veriﬁcation process (certiﬁcation is ensured by the Standards Council of Canada) and focused instead on
                      promoting the voluntary standard, developing training materials, and assessing its costs and beneﬁts.
                      In the EU, the legislative framework for food safety generally shifted, with the adoption of the General Food Law of
                      2002, from a command-and-control approach to one that enshrines an enforced, self-regulatory approach; and this
                      approach was embraced more fully in regulatory changes dating from 2006. It requires businesses to determine and
                      implement their own internal rules and procedures to fulﬁll regulatory obligations. One beneﬁt of this approach is
                      that it has allowed the rapid adoption of new monitoring technologies by industry—an example being the use of radio
                      frequency identiﬁcation data (RFID) (Martinez et al. 2007).



                   Challenges with uptake of co-regulation. For the time being, co-regulation remains limited in scope in many parts
                   of the world. This is partly largely due to a lack of trust in the private sector to have the motivation or capacity to
                   take the necessary precautions to ensure food safety. In addition, shifting responsibility onto the private sector
                   requires a greater degree of public-private coordination and a more complex system of public incentives and controls
                   (Henson and Hooker 2001 and Hobbs et al 2002 in Martinez et al. 2007). It can be a formidable challenge to ensure
                   a balance between industry participation (and inﬂuence over regulations and standards), and consumer protection
                   (consumer groups having less resources than industry ones). Nonetheless, co-regulation could have its place in
                   more countries, speciﬁcally when the costs of regulatory requirements (and their enforcement) outweigh their
                   potential beneﬁts, and for products that carry lower risk.

            More than 80 percent of Vietnam’s agro-food exports consist of primary commodities. This is not intrinsically
            bad—it can be proﬁtable—and the country enjoys a strong competitive advantage in the sale of bulk commodities.
            Still, there may be missed opportunities to add value domestically. Selling intermediate or ﬁnal consumer products
            can created increased job opportunities and may enable ﬁrms to experience less volatility in the prices of their
            exports. Cited here are two examples of this. One relates to India’s spice industry (see Box 27; the other to Taiwan’s
            overall agro-food trade (see Box 28).



                   Box 27: Knowledge-Intensive Value-Addition in the Indian Spice Industry

                   Historically the leading producer and exporter of spices, India has responded to increasing price competition—namely
                   from Vietnam—by moving into high value-added products including branded, packaged consumer products, as well as
                   spice oils and oleoresins. Knowledge- and technology-intensive, the latter displaced black pepper as India’s leading
                   spice-export in value terms in the early 2000s. While multiple factors enabled this shift, this scenario would not have
                   been imaginable without India’s heavy investment in quality infrastructure, applied research, and higher education.
                   India began to face increasing competition in the world market for bulk spices in the 1990s. The rise of low-cost
                   producers such as Vietnam, China, and Indonesia has undermined India’s ability to compete on price, but also to a
                   large extent on quality. Although Indian spices often meet higher standards, international sourcing of bulk spices has
                   become increasingly price-driven. A growing number of Indian enterprises have confronted this challenge by shifting
                   to and promoting higher value-added spice products. This strategy has not prevented India from losing ground to more
                   price-competitive exporters in certain segments, but has allowed Indian exports to reach record value. The public sector
                   has played an instrumental role in this achievement, in particular through the Spices Board of India. This industry
                   regulator doubles as a research, extension and export promotion agency, supporting product and market development,
                   and coordinating privately-held trade bodies.
                   India’s high value-added spice exports fall broadly into two categories: packaged consumer products, and spice-derived
                   products used in manufacturing. India’s focus on branding, quality certiﬁcation, and less demanding markets have over
                   time improved its presence in foreign markets for packaged spices, particularly in the Middle East. More transformational
                   have been its investments in highly specialized, technology-intensive export products such as spice oils and oleoresins.
                   India now holds a major or dominant position in the international markets for these products, the exported value of
                   which, in 2000-2001, overtook that of black pepper—the commodity that has historically dominated India’s spice trade.
                   The export of black pepper, in bulk, has more generally given way to trade in higher value pepper products including
                   pepper powder, dehydrated green pepper, brined pepper, and pepper oil and oleoresin. India crossed a symbolic turning
                   point in 2012 when it became a net importer of black pepper.

                   Box 28: From Commodities to Value-Added Products: Taiwan, China

                   Taiwan’s farm and food sectors were able to respond and take advantage of shifting patterns of domestic consumption to
                   climb their way up the value-addition ladder and move into high value food exports, even as rising labor and raw material
                   costs threatened to thwart their price-competitiveness in increasingly competitive raw and process food markets. Though
                   this shift was achieved by private farmers, cooperatives and companies, government provided signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and
                   technical support.
                   In the space of a few decades, Taiwan’s proﬁle as a food producer and exporter changed dramatically, with its focus
                   shifting ﬁrst from raw to canned products, and then from canned products to frozen and prepared foods. In the 1960s,
                   Taiwan’s exports were dominated by sugar, canned pineapple, and bananas. By 1980, nearly 60 percent of its agricultural
                   exports were of canned vegetables and processed seafood. High value-added frozen and prepared meals began gaining
                   ground in the 1990s as the canned foods market grew increasingly competitive. Food manufacturing has remained
                   relatively important in Taiwan’s economy even as the contribution of agriculture to GDP has shrunk notably.
                   Part of the explanation for this pattern is that Taiwan’s farm and food sectors proved responsive to domestic market
                   changes. Starting in the 1960s, sustained income growth, urbanization and westernization led domestic consumers
                   to increasingly substitute protein- and vitamin-rich foods for starchy ones, and demand convenience or ready-to-eat
                   packaged foods. The government of Taiwan, moreover, intervened proactively to enable the private sector to accompany
                   these trends. Thus, farmers wishing to shift out of rice production beneﬁtted from different forms of technical and
                   ﬁnancial support.
                   Cooperatives and farmer associations received subsidies to invest in marketing facilities. The government sponsored
                   the development of a market information system that supported fruit and vegetable cooperatives market fruit. Pork
                   production beneﬁted from a production credit, technical assistance, price guarantees, and marketing support via
                   cooperatives. The government invested in the development of a food processing machinery industry. Its investments in
                   education and training supplied the industry with large numbers of trained technicians, and experienced managers. Also
                   helpful were the country’s strong business ties to Japan and macroeconomic stability.

            Thematic Sheet P - Repositioning II: Branding Strategies


            Constructing a positive national or sub-national brand can help attract FDI and tourism, but also promote
            exports and domestic sales while raising their price point. Vietnam, however, has not succeeded at associating
            its agricultural export success with a national brand image helpful to differentiating its exports for non-price
            competition. The success in domestic and international markets of products such as Pu’er tea from the Yunnan
            province of China, Mexican tequila, single-origin coffees and teas from multiple countries, and other countries,
            illustrate how the national or regional branding of a product—combining elements of marketing, legal protection,
            and quality management—can have a transformative effect on both domestic and international markets (see Box
            29, Box 30, Box 31, and Box 32).



                   Box 29: Pu’er Tea in China

                   The recent success in domestic and international markets of Pu’er tea from the Yunnan province of China illustrates
                   how the national or regional branding of a product—combining elements of marketing, legal protection, and quality
                   management—can have a transformative effect on a market. Pu’er tea went in the 2000s from being a relatively unknown
                   product to one that enjoys broad recognition and distribution in China and increasing presence overseas. Long prized
                   by connoisseurs as a reﬁned and healthful elixir, the beverage is now mass-marketed both as a premium eco-product,
                   and the symbol of an ancient regional tradition. Chinese consumers widely believe it to improve digestion and promote
                   weight loss. In a context where the multiplication of labels bearing safety guarantees, together with health-scares,
                   have led to confusion and distrust among consumers [of Chinese products], Pu’er has risen above the fray, capturing the
                   imagination and conﬁdence of [domestic] consumers.
                   The brand owes its success to the joint efforts of national and local government, growers, and industry, and their
                   investments not only in marketing, but also in legal protection and environmental and quality management. Though
                   rooted in history, the distinctive shape and packaging, and the vibrant images of ethnic minorities and traditional
                   agricultural landscapes now associated with Pu’er tea-cakes, have been crafted by leading brands such as Dayi with
                   support from Yunnan province and Pu’er City. Meanwhile, industry and government have taken measures to substantiate
                   claims to authenticity and quality. The Chinese government, in 2008, codiﬁed Pu’er as a geographic indicator for tea.
                   Though not immune to counterfeiting, the Pu’er-labeled tea is now subject to stringent standards and quality-testing
                   performed in local facilities. In addition, subsidies and training to promote ecological farming practices have helped to
                   keep tea off of unsuitable lands, biodiversity protected, and agro-chemical use in check.




                   Box 30: Mexican Tequila

                   The story of tequila’s rise in the 1990s illustrates how a cultural branding strategy can, in conjunction with legal
                   protection, vastly widen a product’s horizons. Tequila is named after its town of origin in the northwestern Mexican state
                   of Jalisco, where the blue agave plants from which the alcohol is derived grow. Once considered a cheap and low-brow
                   drink, this regionally-branded mezcal is now seen as a quality-alcohol and symbol of Mexican identity, both domestically
                   and abroad. In the 1990s, global sales of Mexican tequila doubled, making it the fastest growing liquor category in the
                   world. Underscoring the power of branding, the boom in tequila consumption carried on through a three-year price spike,
                   after the severe winter of 1997 and a fungal plague put half the blue agave population out of production. If anything,

                                                                                                                            Continued to next page.

                        high prices helped the drink by attracting global media attention and placing tequila in the price range of premium
                        spirits. Surging interest in tequila also contributed to the development of regional tourism centered on the beverage.
                        Tequila’s take-off was the result of joint efforts, on multiple fronts, by industry, government, and cultural organizations.
                        On a legal front, tequila obtained protection in over 40 countries and was registered as an appellation of origin under
                        the World Industrial Property Organization. No less pivotal were a host of initiatives that contributed—many with
                        government backing—to legitimizing and elevating the drink’s image. UNESCO’s recognition of the “agave landscape and
                        ancient industrial facilities of Tequila” as a world cultural heritage site, for example, resulted from the joint efforts of a
                        cultural institute, an industry association, and the State of Jalisco (the National Institute of Anthropology and History,
                        the National Chamber of Tequila Industry, and State of Jalisco). Other efforts included the launch of a professional
                        organization of tequila tasters, a tequila studies degree by a major Mexican university, tourism initiatives, and tequila
                        associations.




                        Box 31: Marketing Undifferentiated Products in the USA

                        In the United States, many agricultural commodities are promoted by mandatory marketing programs funded through
                        commodity-speciﬁc sales taxes. The famed “Got Milk?” publicity campaign, for example, started as the product of such
                        a program—in this case, a marketing order issued by the state of California at the behest of milk processors. Marketing
                        agreements and orders, and commodity research and promotion programs, are the main types of mandatory marketing
                        mechanisms that can be put in place under state or federal law. These allow the government to intervene in an agro-
                        industry—often at industry’s request—to enable it to fund its own research, promotion and other efforts. Without
                        government intervention to mandate full participation on the part of producers or handlers, coordination failures linked
                        to the potential for free-ridership can hamper such efforts and even prevent them from getting off the ground. That risk is
                        particularly pronounced when it comes to promoting relatively undifferentiated and weakly-branded commodities, since
                        it is difﬁcult to prevent non-participating producers from beneﬁtting from the efforts of others (e.g., from beneﬁtting
                        from generic advertising).
                        Mandated marketing programs typically include provisions for research, minimum quality standards, regulation of packag-
                        ing and containers, quantity controls, and generic advertising and promotion (Carman 2007). However, programs are
                        tailored to speciﬁc commodities and conform to the different laws under which they are created. Commodity research
                        and promotion programs, also known as check-off programs, enable industry actors to “pool their funds and develop a
                        coordinated program of research, promotion and consumer information to improve, maintain and develop markets for
                        their products,” according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). They are also meant to yield public health,
                        nutrition, and other public beneﬁts. These programs are created under federal law,53 and are both requested and
                        funded by industry. Fes are assessed on commodity sales at different points along the supply chain.
                        Marketing agreements and orders help to “provide stable markets” and “maintain the quality of produce being marketed,
                        standardize packages or containers, and authorized advertising, research and market development,” again according to
                        the USDA. Although they are initiated by industry, and tailored to industry’s marketing needs, these programs become
                        binding for all industry participants once they are enacted. They can be put in place at the federal and state levels,
                        though the process and range of eligible commodities differ.



                   53    A law passed in 1996 gave the USDA broad authority to establish national generic promotion and research programs for nearly commodities without the need to pass
                         commodity-speciﬁc legislation (Carman 2007)
