Public works are one of the most popular safety net and employment policy instruments in the
developing world, despite limited evidence on their effectiveness and optimal design features.
This paper presents results on contemporaneous and post-program impacts from a public works
intervention in Côte d’Ivoire. The program provided 7 months of temporary employment in
road maintenance to urban youths. Participants self-selected to apply for the public works jobs,
which paid the formal minimum wage and were randomized among applicants. Randomized
sub-sets of beneficiaries also received complementary training on basic entrepreneurship or job
search skills. During the program, results show limited contemporaneous impacts of public
works on the level of employment, but a shift in the composition of employment towards the
better-paid public works wage jobs. A year after the end of the program, there are no lasting
impacts on the level or composition of employment, although positive impacts are observed on
earnings through higher productivity in non-agricultural self-employment. Large heterogeneity
in impacts are found, particularly during the program. Results from machine learning
techniques suggest potential trade-offs between maximizing contemporaneous and post-
program impacts. Traditional heterogeneity analysis shows that a range of practical targeting
mechanisms perform as well as the machine learning benchmark, leading to stronger
contemporaneous and post-program benefits without sharp trade-offs. Overall, departing from
self-targeting based on the formal minimum wage would lead to strong improvements in
program cost-effectiveness.

1   Introduction

Public works programs are an important component of the policy portfolio of decision makers
trying to address the social challenges of underemployment and poverty. Under such programs,
the government offers temporary employment, typically remunerated at the minimum wage or
below, for the creation of public goods, such as road or infrastructure. Unlike welfare programs,
such as cash transfers, public works programs transfer cash to their beneficiaries conditional on
their meeting work requirements.

There are different types of public works programs. Some are employment guarantee schemes
that offer participants a number of days of employment on demand each year and have as
primary objective to provide social insurance for the poor. For example, the Mahatma Gandhi
National Rural Employment Guarantee program (MGNREGA) in India guarantees 100 days of
work per year per household to all rural households with members willing to do unskilled
manual labor at the statutory minimum wage.

Other programs are implemented to address temporary shocks, such as those induced by an
economic downturn, a climatic shock or period of violent conflict, and primarily aim to offer
mass public employment as a stabilization instrument. They also include programs that provide
temporary employment during the lean agricultural season, to address underemployment and
seasonality in agriculture, as well as help households deal with the incidence of shocks and
transient poverty. In Sub-Saharan Africa, our context in this paper, labor-intensive public works
programs have often been adopted in response to transient negative shocks such as those
induced by climatic shocks or episodes of violent conflicts. These programs typically offer
temporary employment (for a few months), at the minimum wage or below.

While traditional welfare programs, such as unconditional cash transfers, could also be used to
support the poor and most vulnerable, public work programs are often claimed to have a variety
of advantages. First, while both “workfare” and welfare programs can transfer cash to the poor,
workfare programs also contribute to the creation of public assets (e.g. better roads) which may
benefit the broader community. This argument is particularly relevant in contexts where
physical infrastructure was destroyed or damaged as an outcome of the crisis the programs are
aiming to address (e.g. climatic shocks or violent conflict).

Also, “workfare” programs, through skill development or the signaling value of prior work
experience, may increase the future employability or productivity of the participants. This
                                                3
benefit can be potentially further improved upon, even if at a higher cost, by adding some
complementary productive interventions, such as savings facilitation or training, to the work
experience.

Another advantage of workfare programs, as highlighted by Besley and Coate (1992), is that
they can solve the difficult problem of efficiently targeting who should be the beneficiaries for
the transfers. Indeed, the appropriate targeting of social protections programs is particularly
complex in lower income countries because of a lack of robust data, challenges to identify
beneficiaries at the bottom of the welfare distribution, as well as weak systems and institutions,
leading to potential errors of inclusion or exclusion. Public works programs are appealing as
they may in theory solve this problem through self-targeting, in that only the poor would be
willing to supply labor in these programs at the stated (low) wage.

Also, and particularly relevant to post-conflict environments, engaging beneficiaries in work-
for-cash rather than simply handing out cash may operate as a social stabilization tool. This
might operate through an incapacitation effect: time spent working may displace socially
disruptive activities such as crime. Moreover, work, even if unpleasant, may improve well-
being, self-esteem, and overall mental health, a set of non-cognitive assets that may also help
beneficiaries become more productively employed.

Finally, even though more mundane, another advantage of public work programs compared to
traditional welfare programs is that they are often politically more acceptable and sustainable.
Political preferences for workfare programs are often linked to (valid or not) concerns about
welfare dependency (and how unconditional transfers may disincentive work) as well as a
desire to generate immediate visible improvements to employment conditions.

In this paper, we present the results of a randomized control trial designed to assess both the
contemporaneous (i.e. during the program) and post-program (i.e. a year after program
completion) impacts of public work programs. The particular public works program we
evaluate was implemented by the Côte d’Ivoire government in the aftermath of the post-
electoral crisis that hit the country in 2010/2011, and was funded by an emergency loan from
the World Bank. The stated objective of the program was to improve access to temporary
employment opportunities among lower-skilled young (18-30) men and women in urban or
semi-urban areas that were unemployed or underemployed, as well as to develop the skills of
the program participants through work experience and complementary training.

In particular, participants in the public works program were employed for a period of 7 months
to rehabilitate and clean road infrastructure and remunerated at the statutory minimum daily
wage, corresponding to about $5 per day (FCFA 2500), approximately $110 per month (FCFA
55 000). Program participants were required to work 6 hours per day, 5 days per week. The
road maintenance work, carried out in “brigades” of about 25 youths with a supervisor, was
implemented by the National Roads Agency (AGEROUTE) and supervised by BCPE1, under
the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.

All young men and women in the required age range and residing in one of 16 urban localities
in Côte d’Ivoire were eligible to apply to the program. Because the number of applicants
outstripped supply in each locality, fair access was based on a public lottery, setting the stage
for a robust causal evaluation of the impacts of the program. In addition, a randomized sub-set
of beneficiaries were also offered (i) basic entrepreneurship training to facilitate set-up of new
household enterprises and entry into self-employment, or (ii) training in job search skills and
sensitization on wage employment opportunities to facilitate access to wage jobs (e.g. help in
identifying wage job opportunities, CV production, interview skills, etc.).

In addition to a baseline survey of program applicants, we carried rich surveys of youth in the
treatments and control groups both during the program (4 or 5 months after the program had
started) as well 12 to 15 months after program completion to capture any post-program effects
of participation.

Our analysis of contemporaneous effects demonstrates that the program had limited impacts on
the level of employment, mostly inducing shifts in the composition of employment. Reflecting
limited unemployment and a high concentration of the active population in low-productivity
occupations, 86 percent of the control group was working 4 to 5 months after the lottery took
place, compared to 98 percent of those assigned to the intervention. Moreover, the program did
not substantially raise hours worked, with mean hours worked at about 41 hours in the control
group compared to 44 hours for those assigned to the treatment. The value of the program for
the modal applicant was therefore not as a way to escape unemployment but more as a way to
escape under-employment in low-paying informal activities: monthly earning are about FCFA
20,000 higher in the treatment groups, from a base of FCFA 60,000 in the control group. So,
while the program managed to lift earnings, foregone earnings are quantitatively important,
with only about 40 percent of the transfer translating into earnings gain.

These results strongly suggest that self-targeting based on the formal minimum wage did not
succeed in this context in getting only the most vulnerable (e.g. those without outside
employment opportunities) to benefit from the program. A couple of factors likely explain this
failure of self-targeting. First, a job that pays the statutory minimum wage could still be of
appeal to many in an environment where informal employment and self-employment are
rampant. Second, because the work was only 6 hours per day, many applicants with outside
employment opportunities, especially those that allow for more flexible hours, would still see
value in applying for the public works program as they could combine it with other activities.
Finally, while the unpleasant nature of the work may have discouraged some, it is unclear
whether this work is more unpleasant than most informal activities. In fact, positive effects on
overall well-being and behavioral skills are also found in the short term.

Twelve to 15 months after program completion, no impacts are observed either on the level
(employment or hours worked) or on composition of employment (salaried work vs. self-
employment). However, we do observe sustained positive impacts on earnings
(FCFA 5,622 or $11 per month, a 11.6 percent increase compared to the control group), mainly
stemming from non-agricultural self-employment activities. These sustained impacts are
mostly driven by youths who were assigned to the public works and complementary basic
entrepreneurship training.

Based on these estimates of direct earnings impacts on youths, and given rich data we have
collected on program costs, we conclude the public works program under its current form is far
from cost-effective, with cost per participant being about 3 times the estimated benefit.

While our results suggest that self-targeting based on the formal minimum wage failed in this
context, it is possible that better targeting criteria may have resulted in improved cost-
effectiveness. This is the issue we address in the remaining sections of the paper, where we
study heterogeneity of program effects, both during the program and post-program.

First, using recent machine learning techniques (Athey and Imbens 2016, Wager and Athey
2016), and relying on the very rich data collected at baseline about each program applicant, we
estimate the heterogeneity of program effects both during and after the program. This analysis
confirms large differences in predicted impacts across various groups of program participants,
especially during the program. In particular, the average predicted impact on earnings in the
short-term in the upper quartile of the predicted impact distribution is over FCFA 28,000,
compared to 9,900 in the lower quartile. Also, the average predicted post-program impact on

                                               6
earnings in the upper quartile of the predicted impact distribution is over FCFA 8,000,
compared to 1,475 in the lower quartile.

While these results suggest that the program effectiveness, both in the short-term and the long-
term, could be improved through better targeting, they also highlight the difficulty in improving
contemporaneous and post-program impacts at the same time: program participants that benefit
most during the program are not systematically those that benefit most after the program has
ended.

However, an analysis of the distribution of predicted contemporaneous and post-program
impacts does reveal the existence of some common targeting dimensions that may improve
effectiveness without sharp trade-offs. Compared to the benchmark scenario with self-targeting
based on the formal minimum wage, the cost-effectiveness ratio would improve from 3.2 to
between 1.58 and 1.98 based on finer program targeting such as selecting youths with low
predicted baseline earnings, self-selection based on a lower offered wage, targeting women
only, or targeting based on self-declared baseline earnings. While the analysis cannot decisively
indicate which targeting scenario would maximize cost-effectiveness given the confidence
intervals around the impact estimates, it does highlight strong improvements in cost-
effectiveness when departing from self-targeting solely based on the formal minimum wage.

2     Framework


The primary objective of workfare programs is to provide income support through temporary
jobs. Beyond this short-term goal contemporaneous to the program, another objective is
sometimes to facilitate transitions to more productive, higher-earnings occupations after the
program. Several potential channels can contribute to such longer-term objectives, for instance
the ability to save and invest in ongoing or new activities, or the opportunity to develop skills
valued in the labor market.


2.1    Contemporaneous Impacts in the Short Term


Targeting is a key design feature of social safety nets programs seeking to provide income-
support in the short term. It is a general issue that each transfer program faces. The specificity
of workfare programs is that participants typically self-select into the program. This is a major
difference compared to transfer programs, which often select participants based on a screening
procedure such as a proxy-means test or a participatory community targeting approach. The
mechanism through which workfare programs address the selection problem is to ask for hours
of work in exchange for the transfer. This mechanism has several well-known implications. The
first one is the self-selection mechanism: only potential participants for whom the utility level
in the program, accounting for earnings and disutility of work, is larger than their current utility
level should participate. The second important implication is that there are forgone earnings
when participating in the program: the time participants spend in the program cannot be used
for work on regular activities. Thus the contemporaneous program impact on earnings is the
difference between transfers to the participants and forgone earnings. Another consequence is
that the impact of participation on income in the short term is heterogeneous and depends on
participants’ alternative economic opportunities, as well as the extent to which they are able to
keep operating these activities while in the program. A reasonable expectation is that the impact
is almost zero for the ‘marginal’ participant. On the other hand, the impact should reach the
amount of the transfer for those whose income would have been zero without the program. In
this context, the average contemporaneous program impact on self-selected participants




                                                 8
depends on the distribution of individual impacts over the population, and is typically smaller
than the transfer from the program.

The following simple model helps formalizing these ideas. Assume for example that earnings
for a program participant are       =     ℎ . This is a lump sum. There are fixed hours to work in
the program, with no part-time participation possible. Let          (ℎ) capture participants' earnings
for ℎ hours of work on other activities while in the program and let ℎ be the number of hours
participants can spend on these activities while in the program. Let               (ℎ) capture earnings for
ℎ hours of work absent the program and ℎ be the number of hours participants would have
spent on these activities absent the program. The impact of the program on earnings in the short
term is therefore


          (         )=         +     		       (ℎ ) −      (ℎ ) =         −          		(   (ℎ ) −   (ℎ ))


where         means expectation on participants. It is thus different from the direct transfer
received from the program by the amount of forgone earnings :                    (ℎ ) −   (ℎ ).
Similarly the impact on the number of hours of work is different from hours spent in the
program


                          (ℎ       )=ℎ +            (ℎ − ℎ ) = ℎ −                 (ℎ − ℎ )


A standard ratio to assess the capacity of the program to increase earnings is the ratio of
contemporaneous program impact on income to the average income of participants in the
control group during the program.


                                     +          	    (ℎ ) −       (ℎ )
                                                    ( (ℎ ))


One interesting parameter to add is the ratio of the contemporaneous program impact on income
to the actual transfer:


                                          −              (ℎ ) −    (ℎ )
                               Λ=                                            	



                                                     9
In this context, one of the key empirical question for a given program is the extent to which
hours of work and earnings change due to participation in the program. What are the changes
in the portfolio of activities of program participants? Are there substantial changes in hours
worked? Are there changes in income during the program?


2.2   Heterogeneity in contemporaneous program impacts


Assuming for a moment that only earnings during the program matter for participation, the
basic idea of workfare as a selection device is that participants will self-select into the program.
Hours of work are determined by participants seeking to maximize their utility. Assuming
earning functions have the same form          (ℎ) =    (ℎ) =     ∗ ℎ and that there is an increasing
convex disutility of effort	 (ℎ), there is an optimal number of hours of work	ℎ ( ), leading to
a maximum utility level absent the program	" ( ) =          ∗ℎ ( )−       ℎ ( ) . In such a simple
setting, there is a threshold in earnings 	   (that is supposedly lower than	   ) such that for	    <
	 , 	ℎ ( ) < ℎ . It can be shown that in such a case		ℎ ( ) = 0, and that the utility level
increases: for potential participants with very few outside employment opportunities, program
participation would lead to an increase in the number of hours, in earnings and in the utility
level. For example, if we consider people who have no employment opportunity:            = 0, hours
of work and earnings absent the program would be zero. In such a case, the impact of program
participation on hours and earnings would be an increase by respectively ℎ and            ∗ ℎ . For
individuals with intermediate opportunities,	      <    <      , the total number of hours does not
change: ℎ ( ) = ℎ ( ) − ℎ but the utility level increases	" ( ) = " ( ) +                  −       ℎ .
Last, for   >      the program does not improve the utility level and therefore individuals would
not participate.


This simple setting could be adapted to account for several important practical aspects of public
works program. For example, there could be a fixed cost of participation due to the cost of
accommodation, or specific disutility for the type of work required by the program, or lost
earnings due to transportation costs to the work sites, etc. Notice that, as is well-known, there
might be cases when income effects imply that program participation would actually reduce the
numbers of hours worked. A general result remains: contemporaneous program impacts on
income and utility are heterogeneous in the population. There are ‘marginal’ participants for
whom employment opportunities are large enough for them to be indifferent between
                                                 10
participating or not. On the other hand, there are other participants with very few opportunities
for whom contemporaneous program impacts are expected to be very large.


It is therefore critical to understand the heterogeneity of impacts in public works program. We
address this issue in this paper by assessing whether there is evidence of heterogeneous program
impacts on employment, hours worked and earnings during the program.


                                                    ' (ℎ)   =   'ℎ       /2 for individual	+ , it is possible to show
                                                                     (
Notice that assuming a disutility of work
that the intervention is rank preserving for hours worked. This is also the case for earnings if
we assume that             '   is the only source of heterogeneity, and thus that disutility of work is
homogeneous (          '   = ). However, if there is also heterogeneity in	 ' , there is no reason for the
rank of individuals in the earning distribution to be the same with and without the program.
This is important as rank preservation is a property that helps in the identification of the variance
of the program impacts.


2.3       Targeting


Targeting is a question related to heterogeneity. Assume productivity ( ) is the only source of
heterogeneity and that the social planner seeks to maximize the average income of a target
population.2 Are there different assignment mechanisms that would improve the average impact
on utility or earnings? A first idea is to change the characteristics of the workfare contract. Let
    ( ) stands for                   (ℎ ( )) and	 ( ) = ℎ ∗                  +      ℎ ( ) =ℎ ∗         + ℎ ( )−
ℎ     ∗     ∗ 1[./.] . Assuming the program is made available to everybody in the population, the
average impact on income becomes

                   	
      1       =2               ( ( ) − ( ))3( )4
                  .5.6
                                 	
                           =2          [ℎ ∗    + ℎ ( )−ℎ                 ∗       ∗ 1[./.] −   ∗ ℎ ( )]3( )4
                                .5.6




2
 It is more common to consider that the social planner seeks to maximize well-being. We consider earnings
here to make the link with the empirical section.

                                                        11
Given the apparent ‘waste’ due to participants for whom the marginal impact is zero, a natural
idea would be to reduce the contract wage. However, this would be ineffective since for the
marginal applicant the program effect would remain zero. A marginal reduction in the wage
would actually reduce the impact on average income, corresponding to the related reduction in
income for each participant (there is no contribution of the newly selected out participants for
whom the impact of the program is zero):


                                     	1 7     = 	 ℎ ∗ 8(        ).


However the program is generally not available to everybody in the population. Assume that
there is oversubscription. One selection mechanism is to randomly assign applicants to the
program until the budget constraint is reached. The surplus in such a case would write instead


                                        1       = 9	1       	


with 9 such that 9	8           ∗ ℎ = :, and : the budget available for the program. 	


In such a case, reducing the program wage and increasing the share of applicants to meet the
budget requirement would have an ambiguous effect on the average impact on earnings.
Straightforward computations show the change in the surplus due to a marginal change in
would be:


                                                                3         +8
                   17      = 9	(	ℎ ∗ 8(       )−1                               	)
                                                                     ∗8


A reduction in the wage        would not lead to a reduction as strong as in the former case. The
expression also shows that there might actually be an optimum wage level. Notice that the
formula can be rewritten as:


              17        =9∗ℎ ∗8             ∗ (	1 − Λ(1 +       3(    |    <+   +    )))


where Λ is the ratio of the program impact on income to the actual transfer previously defined
and 3(   |    <+   +    ) is the applicants’ density of the productivity level at the program wage

                                                12
rate, i.e. for the marginal applicant. This formula could be of some help to appreciate whether
the derivative of the criterion with respect to the wage rate is positive or negative.3




Another potential assignment mechanism would be to randomly assign individuals to the
program with different probabilities depending on some characteristic	=, for instance proxies
for their productivity or outside opportunities. The assignment probability would be a
function		9(=). Assume that the objective is to maximize the program impact on income


                   S     , 9 = 8(      )>        ( )− ( ) 3         , =|   <     9(=)4 4=


It is clear from the computation above that the individual gain                ( ) − ( ) is decreasing
in	 . If the productivity level can be observed, 9(=) would only depend on               and an obvious
choice for the function 9( ) is to select individuals with the highest potential impact on income.
For the same budget constraint, the best allocation would be to select participants with the least
opportunities outside the program. Let ? be the maximum productivity level consistent with
full assignment and the budget constraint	8( ?)                  ℎ = :. The assignment mechanism
achieving the largest impact would be:


                                                  9( ) = 1[.5.
                                                             ? ].



It would allow to reach the largest contemporaneous program impacts:

                                            	
                                   @=2
                                   1               ( ( ) − ( ))3( )4
                                             ?)
                                          (.5.



It can easily be shown that 1                    @ . This leads to the conclusion that although changing
                                                <1
contract features such as changing the wage               might lead to an improvement (keeping in mind
it is hard to tell in which direction to adjust), the realized surplus will always be below the
surplus obtained through a direct selection of those for whom the impact of the program is the
largest.



3
    Similar formulas could also be derived for the number of hours ℎ in the program.

                                                         13
Finally, if       is not fully observed but one can make a prediction of the impact at individual
level (based on =), then we can consider assigning individuals based on that predicted impact:



              1     , 9 = 8(      )2         ( )−       ( )|=,      <        3 =|    <       9(=)4=



Assignment can be based on A =                 ( ) − ( )|=,              <    . It is then possible to proceed
as before and first assign individuals with the highest predicted impact on earnings until the
budget constraint is saturated. The accuracy of the prediction is clearly a key element in the
performance of the assignment mechanism.


When defining an assignment mechanism, it is important to keep in mind that the mechanism
is known to potential participants, so that they can make participation decisions. Participation
in the program requires that the expected gain from participation is positive. If we consider that
applying costs an amount B( , =) (for example time to go to the registration office, time to
enroll and to participate in the selection process and some related forgone earnings), the
participation rule becomes:


    9(=)" ( ) + 1 − 9(=) " ( ) − B( , =) > " ( ) ⇔ 	 " ( ) − " ( ) > B( , =)/9(=)	
                                                                     	



Changing the assignment rule is likely to change the characteristics of the marginal applicant,
unless there is no cost of application4.


2.4    Other aspects of the analysis of contemporaneous program impacts


Another important aspect of the analysis of contemporaneous program impacts relates to use of
the transferred income. We would expect an increase in consumption caused by program


4
  Programs frequently only advertise the number of slots available. For example, in the case of the public works
program in Côte d'Ivoire we discuss in the rest of the paper, the number of slots available in each locality for men
and women was known in advance. The program also initially introduced a fixed ratio of slots for women
compared to men. Changing the total number of slots available or the ratio of slots reserved to women is likely
to change expectation about 9 for men and women. In such a case, the decision to participate might be affected,
if applying is costly.


                                                        14
participation and higher earnings5. The allocation of income between consumption and savings
also affects post-program impacts. Indeed, the additional income can be used to save or finance
investments like training or capital for income-generating activities. Youths may encounter
constraints to build up savings, and positive income shocks during the program may be
associated with savings accumulation. Savings can have several potential post-program
benefits, including precautionary savings to absorb future shocks, or savings to finance
investments.


Finally, externalities are another important dimension of impacts during the program. Public
works programs are likely to have an impact on participants themselves but also on people
around them. While externalities are challenging to address empirically, it is nevertheless
possible to examine the impact of participation of one member of the household on other
members of the household. First, this might lead to an increase in the contribution of
participants to expenses at the household level. Second, the participation of one member of the
household in the program might have an impact on activities of other members of the household.
On the one hand, traditional income effects would imply a reduction in other members’ activity.
On the other hand, underemployed members of the family could take on part of the forgone
activities of the participant (especially if she was engaged in self-employment).


2.5   Post-program Impacts


A first-order question in the public works literature is about the existence and size of post-
program impacts in the medium to long-term. A growing number of public works programs
also have the objective to facilitate youth’ transition towards more productive occupations after
the program. There is little evidence in the literature on such long-term effects, although there
are several potential channels through which they could unfold. First, the idea of return to
capital. Several experiments have proved that returns to capital can be very large for poor
households (for a review, see Blattman and Ralston, 2015). Common instruments to make
capital available to youth have not proved very effective, for instance micro credit. Transfers




5
  Another question relates to the type of goods for which an increase in consumption should be expected. We
could expect that program participation first increases the consumption of goods needed to meet basic needs.
However, a common question when it comes to providing cash to young people is whether there are any
increase in consumption of temptation goods such as alcoholic beverage, drug or gambling.

                                                     15
through public works programs are a way to help alleviate capital constraints for participants.
A related empirical issue is whether participation in public works affects savings6.


However, there are also other possible mechanisms for workfare interventions to have impacts
in the longer run. Usually, subsidized jobs are seen as a way to improve experience, skills and
productivity of participants. Raising their employability increases the likelihood that they find
a wage job. This employment channel is another possibility for the program to have an impact
in the long term. Lastly, we can think about behavioral aspects related to program participation.
It might be the case that youth do not perceive financial constraints but that they have biased
time preferences leading them to undervalue their situation in the future. It might be possible
that a program requiring youths to form work habits, like waking up each morning to go to
work, may induce lasting behavioral changes.


Finally, note that public works programs could also have negative long-term impacts on
participants. Actually, this is a scenario that has been frequently considered. One channel for
such negative long term impacts relates to the potential ‘stigmatization’ of participants, i.e.
program participation sending negative signals to the labor market. Another possibility is that
the experience provided to participants through the program is of little value or only enhances
skills which are not demanded in the regular labor market. Participants may also directly forgo
some activities, which may create a form of destruction of capital through program
participation. Potential participants might struggle in day to day occupation requiring a lot of
search and connection. They could be tempted by the ‘easy’ way to obtain earnings through a
temporary workfare job. However, doing so can induce the loss of capital or connections which
might take time to rebuild after exiting the program



3    Empirical literature on workfare programs



Despite the popularity of public work programs such as those implemented throughout much
of Africa, experimental evidence on their overall effectiveness are limited (Subbarao et al.,


6
  Notice, also, that it is possible that the program has a temporary impact in the medium run. It would be the
case if participants have been able to save part of the additional income due to the program but have been
unable to use it to start or expand income generating activities. Savings in such a case is mainly used to cope with
future income or expense shocks.

                                                        16
2013). Existing evidence mostly comes from quasi-experimental studies, and from a small
number of programs such as those from India or Ethiopia.

As indicated in the introduction, a particularly important design feature of workfare programs
is their traditional reliance on self-targeting mechanisms, dating back to Besley & Coates
(1992). Early papers on workfare programs analyzed the profile of beneficiaries and benefit
incidence patterns (Ravallion et al. 1993, Jalan and Ravallion, 2003). A related strand of the
literature assessed the role of public works as a short-term safety net or insurance mechanism
providing temporary employment and income to vulnerable populations during lean
agricultural seasons or after economic shocks. Datt and Ravallion (1994) and Jalan and
Ravallion (2003) estimate the net income gains from public works programs in India and
Argentina, finding foregone income ranging between 30% and 50% on average. Datt and
Ravallion (1994) point to differences in behavioral response across households, while Jalan and
Ravallion (2003) also highlight variations in program effects along the welfare distribution.
Galasso and Ravallion (2004) study how another program in Argentina affected employment
outcomes and contributed to attenuate the welfare effects of an economic crisis. General
findings on program impacts on welfare and food security remain mixed. Ravi and Engler
(2015) find impacts of the India workfare scheme on consumption and food security, but
Beegle, Galasso and Goldberg (2015) do not find significant effects on food security in Malawi
in one of the few randomized control trial of a public works program so far. Gilligan et al.
(2009) also find limited average welfare effects of the Ethiopia PNSP program, although
households who received larger transfer amounts did see improvements in some measures of
food security. Beyond welfare effects, a series of recent studies are attempting to estimate the
impact of public works program on school enrolment and child labor (Li and Sekhri, 2013;
Islam and Sivasankaran, 2015; Shah and Steinberg, 2015), also with mixed results.

In low-income or lower-middle-income countries, and in particular in Africa, most of the active
population is engaged in low-productivity self-employment with average earnings lower than
the formal minimum wage. In contrast, unemployment and formal wage employment is very
limited, typically affecting 10%-15% of the active population (Filmer and Fox, 2014;
Christiaensen and Premand, 2017). In this context, the extent to which public works programs
trigger contemporaneous impacts on employment is unclear a priori. There are also questions
on whether beneficiaries of public works programs can find pathways towards more productive
post-program employment in wage jobs or in the informal sector. The evidence on mechanisms
through which workfare programs affect employment in the medium to long run is particularly

                                              17
thin. Ravallion et al. (2005) analyze post-program impacts on earnings from a public works
intervention in Argentina. Rosas and Sabarwal (2016) document investments from public works
beneficiaries in assets and micro-enterprises in Sierra Leone. Deininger et al. (2016) find effects
of the India public works program on agricultural productivity. A few studies assess the
effectiveness of complementing public works programs with training or savings facilitation,
including Galasso, Ravallion and Salvia (2004) and Almeida and Galasso (2010). Gilligan et
al. (2009) report impacts of the Ethiopia public works program combined with agricultural
support on adoption of agricultural technologies and off-farm small businesses.

The understanding of externalities generated from workfare programs is also particularly
limited, even though such externalities are often part of the core rationale for these
interventions. A series of recent studies from India analyze how the public works program affect
labor markets and wages beyond program beneficiaries (Imbert and Papp (2015) and
Zimmerman (2015)). Some papers have attempted to estimate the returns on the public goods
created by public works programs (e.g. Deininger and Liu (2013) on land investments in India),
although this remains one of the biggest gap in the literature (Alik-Lagrange and Ravallion,
2015). Finally, few studies have addressed the question on whether public works can generate
social externalities by offering alternative occupations to populations in fragile or post-conflict
settings and create a peace dividend. Recent exceptions include Fetzer (2014) and Amaral et al.
(2015), who analyze the linkages between the Indian public works program and conflict,
respectively gender-based violence.

To our knowledge, no study has analyzed whether there are trade-offs between maximizing
contemporaneous and post-program benefits from public works, or between maximizing
economic impacts on earnings or broader impacts on social outcomes. This paper addresses
these questions.

4.1    The PEJEDEC public works program




                                                18
Public works programs were introduced in Côte d’Ivoire in 2008 by a post-conflict assistance
project following the 2003-2007 armed conflict.7 Public works were later included as a
component of an Emergency Youth Employment and Skills Development Project (PEJEDEC)
set-up after the 2010/2011 post-electoral crisis8. The PEJEDEC public works program was
managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, through BCP-E9, and implemented
by the national roads management agency (AGEROUTE). A range of other institutions have
been implementing public works interventions with similar features in Côte d’Ivoire10, and
more broadly across Sub-Saharan Africa

The PEJEDEC public works intervention aims to improve access to temporary employment in
road maintenance for low-skilled youths in urban areas. The program targets youths aged 18-
30 in 16 localities11 throughout the country. A quota of 30% of program positions was initially
reserved for women. Participants are offered temporary employment for 6 hours per day and 5
days a week for a total of six months12. Participants work in teams of 25 individuals (called
“brigades”), under the supervision of a team leader and a local supervisor. They perform road
maintenance activities such as sweeping roads or cleaning ditches. The jobs are paid FCFA
2,500 (approximately $5) per work day, a wage equal to the legal daily minimum wage in the
formal sector. Wages are paid monthly on bank accounts that are set-up for all participants as
they start working.

In addition to participating in the public works program, youths are offered various training
activities. First, all participants receive a one-week basic life skills training covering issues
related to HIV-AIDS, citizenship and hygiene. Second, some participants are offered a
complementary basic entrepreneurship training to facilitate transition into more productive
self-employment upon exit from the program. Third, other participants are offered a training

   4 municipalities were covered in Abidjan (Abobo, Yopougon, Koumassi, Marcory) and 12 cities throughout
the country (Yamoussoukro, Bouaké, San Pedro, Daloa, Korhogo, Abengourou, Man, Bondoukou, Gagnoa,
Séguéla, Daoukro, Dimbokro).

   As explained further below, the program wave under evaluation lasted for 7 months, but the standard
program lasts 6 months.

on wage jobs search skills and sensitization to wage jobs opportunities, with the objective to
facilitate transition into wage jobs upon exist from the program.

The curricula for the complementary skills training are tailored for low-skill population that
may not be able to read and write, in particular by relying on drawings and visuals. Each training
lasts approximately 80-100 hours distributed over two two-week periods. They are
accompanied with field exercises to be undertaken between the training periods, in parallel to
the public works jobs (typically in the afternoons). The trainings are delivered by work brigades,
i.e. in groups of 25 youths. Participants do not have to work during the trainings, but still receive
their corresponding daily wage13.

The basic entrepreneurship training aims to build skills to help youth set-up and manage a
small non-agricultural micro-enterprise. The training lasts 100 hours and focuses on providing
cross-cutting business skills and practical guidance to develop simple business plans for small-
scale activities that can be set-up using savings from the public works program. A first phase
(40 hours over two weeks) reviews themes related to basic entrepreneurship and business skills.
A second phase includes field research for youths to gather information, undertake basic market
research and sketch a business plan. A third phase (40 hours over two weeks) includes feedback
on youths’ basic business plans, and reviews of key related issues from the curriculum. The
final phase (20 hours) is an individual post-training follow-up14.

The training on wage jobs search skills and sensitization to wage jobs opportunities provides
information on wage jobs opportunities, skills on jobs search techniques, as well as a more
professional environment during the public works programs and skills certification to facilitate
signaling upon exit from the program. The training itself lasts 80 hours. The first phase (40
hours over two weeks) reviews how to identify wage jobs opportunities (either locally or
through migration), how to search for wage jobs, prepare a CV, apply for a job and participate
in a job interview. The second phase includes field exercises to gather information on potential
opportunities, identify and visit potential employers or professional networks, etc. The third
phase (40 hours over two weeks) provides feedback on field exercises, reviews part of the
curriculum and provides additional practical guidance. In addition, supervisors of the brigades
who were offered the wage employment training were also trained on how to manage teams
and provide feedback to workers, with the objective to mimic the professional experience one

   Some youths were offered the second half of the training after their exit from the public works program.
While these youths were not paid during that time, they received a small stipend to cover transportation costs.

these evaluations were later used to issue a work certificate that signaled between one and five
competencies identified as strengths for each participant15.



4.2    Experimental design: Enrollment and Randomization



The PEJEDEC public works program was implemented in 16 urban localities throughout Côte
d’Ivoire, including Abidjan and cities in the interior16. Four waves were organized between
2012 and 2015, each covering all 16 localities, with a similar number of pre-determined places
available for each locality in each wave. In total, 12,666 youths participated in the program.
The randomized control trial focuses on the second wave of the program, which took place
between July 2013 and February 201417. The identification strategy relies on a two-step
randomization process.

The first step involves individual randomization into the program. Before the start of the second
wave, and as was the case for the other waves, an intense communication campaign was
organized by the implementing agency (AGEROUTE) through local newspapers, local radios
and public notice boards to invite interested youth to visit a registration office and apply to the
program. Enrollment was open for two to three weeks in each locality, between June 2013 and
July 2013. Only two eligibility criteria were applied during enrollment: applicants had to be
between 18 and 30 years old, and could not have participated to the public works program
before.

Once the enrollment period had closed, public lotteries were organized in each locality
(separately for men and women, hence stratified by locality and gender) to randomly select
beneficiaries among the registered applicants present at the lottery. Remarkably, the public
lotteries were put in place at the time of the post-conflict assistance project. Since then, they
have been used continuously as a transparent assignment mechanism to allocate limited public
works jobs in a way that would be socially acceptable and limit potential tensions. As such, the

   The evaluation policy report has additional information on the scope of the training (Bertrand et al. (2016)).

17
   Less than 5% of youths assigned to the public works program did not participate, or participated for less than
3 months. The second wave was extended from six months to seven months for all participants to ensure that
the complementary training could be completed during that time for those who were assigned to them (see
below).

                                                       21
first step of the randomization protocol was already implemented by the program in its routine
operations.

In practice, during the enrollment phase for the second wave of the program, 12,188 individuals
applied, of which 10,966 participated in public lotteries where 3,125 beneficiaries were selected
and assigned to 125 brigades of 25 individuals each (17 men, 8 women)18. For the study wave,
a waiting list was created to protect the control group, although in practice replacements were
minimal19.

The second step involves the randomization of public works brigades into groups receiving
different types of complementary training. Specifically, brigades were randomized into three
groups: (i) 45 brigades (1,225 individuals) were assigned to receive the public works only; (ii)
40 brigades (1,000 individuals) were assigned to receive the public works plus the
complementary basic entrepreneurship training, and (iii) 40 brigades (1,000 individuals) were
assigned to receive the public works plus the wage jobs search skills training20. This second
randomization was stratified by locality, and performed through a lottery held in the project
office with implementing partners and a notary public in November 2013. Results remained
confidential until two weeks before the start of the trainings.



4.3     Timeline and Data


4.3.1    Timeline and Surveys



The randomized control trial focuses on the second wave of the public works program. The
public lotteries were held in each locality between the end of June and early July 2013, right
after the end of the enrollment.

A baseline survey was conducted shortly after the public lotteries and before program
implementation (between the end of June and mid-July 2013). The study sample comprised all


18
   Beneficiaries were assigned to brigades within localities based on the number they drew in the public lottery.
19
   Replacement of drop-outs was allowed during the first two-months of the program. Replacements were only
possible based on the waiting list, and had to be stopped when the waiting list was exhausted. After two
months, replacements were not allowed anymore. This ensured that individuals in the control group were not
offered the program during its implementation.
20
   All brigades receive a one-week basic life skills training covering issues related to HIV-AIDS, citizenship and
hygiene. This training is considered part of the basic public works program.

the individuals selected to participate in the program after the first randomization (3,125
individuals), as well as a control group obtained from a (random) sample of 1,035 individuals
drawn among the non-beneficiaries not on the waiting list21. The data collected included
measures of employment and earnings. It also captured a range of other characteristics such as
preferences for risk and present, behavioral skills, as well as the results of practical tests
measuring cognitive, manual and numeracy skills. Attrition at baseline was very small (1.5%).

The public works activities started between early and late July 2013, depending on the locality.
In August, participants received the one-week life skills training that is considered part of the
basic public works program. The second randomization took place in October 2013 in the main
project office. Brigades’ assignment to the various complementary training modalities were not
made public until January 2014, in order to limit potential response bias during the midline
survey.

In addition to the baseline survey, two surveys were conducted in order to study
contemporaneous impacts during the program and medium-term post-program impacts.

To estimate contemporaneous program impacts, a midline survey was conducted on 3,036
individuals (2,001 beneficiaries22 and the control group) between the end of November 2013
end early January 2014, i.e. 4 to 5 months after the start of the program. Both individuals and
household heads were interviewed. A two-weeks tracking phase was implemented in February
2014 to limit attrition, mainly due to the mobility of control individuals23. Attrition at midline
is limited (2.6%) and balanced across treatment and control groups. The midline questionnaire
included very detailed sections on employment (up to three activities), specific information on




21
   Individuals randomly assigned to the waiting list are excluded from the sampling frame to prevent
contamination of the control group. Sampling for the control was stratified by gender and locality (similar to
the randomization procedure).
22
  The 2,001 treated individuals are a sub-sample of the 3,125 beneficiaries stratified by locality, brigade and
gender. This sub-sample voluntarily excludes brigades which had been allocated to the wage employment
training. Indeed, their supervisors were following a specific management training at the time of the survey, and
we wanted to avoid potential anticipation effects or any behavioral changes that could potentially affect
outcomes.
23
   The tracking helped reduce attrition rate from 5.4% (after main data collection) to 2.6%. Before tracking, a
small attrition differential was observed between treatment and control groups due to larger mobility out of
program localities in the control group. The survey firm had not planned tracking outside the localities. The
sample for tracking was randomly selected among the treatment and control groups (stratified by locality and
gender) among non-respondents who were alive, not outside Côte d’Ivoire, and excluding individuals that could
not be reached since baseline. After tracking, remaining attritors were mainly people impossible to contact or
highly mobile individuals, and attrition was balanced between treatment and control groups.

characteristics of independent activities, a time use module and measures of behavior and well-
being.

The public works program was originally expected to end in January 2014. However, as the
complementary trainings were starting in January, participants were given a one-month
extension on their contracts, which exceptionally extended the public works duration from 6 to
7 months. This ensured that all ‘brigades’ selected to participate in one of the trainings could
do so while being paid by the program (at the same wage) for the first half of the training, which
reduced the opportunity cost of time during the trainings. Complementary trainings were
organized between January and mid-March and the second wave of the program ended between
early and mid-February 2014 (depending on the locality). Some beneficiaries attended the
second half of complementary skills trainings after the end of their contracts, and were given a
transport allowance24.

To evaluate post-program impacts, an endline survey was conducted between March and July
2015, i.e. between 12 to 15 months after the end of the program. The sample included 4,360
individuals. It was comprised of the whole baseline sample of 4,160 individuals in the treatment
and control groups, plus 200 individuals randomly selected to be added to the control group25.
Again, both individuals and household heads were interviewed. A one-and-a-half month
(random) tracking phase took place in September 2015. The final attrition rate was 6.2%, and
was balanced between treatment and control groups. The endline questionnaire was based on
the midline survey and enriched with ‘historic’ information on job search, independent
activities (including past projects) and an employment calendar.



4.3.2    Key outcomes and descriptive statistics


Descriptive statistics




24
   Half of the brigades assigned to complementary skills trainings (50% of each type of training) had 25% of
their training hours after the end of the public works contract, and received a transportation allowance of FCFA
1500 (the program wage was FCFA 2500). 25% of the brigades had 25% of their training hours (i.e. the second
phase of the training) after the end of the public works contract and received the same transportation
allowance. The remaining 25% were fully under contract during their trainings. Transportation allowance was
paid ex-post in one transfer, based on the actual number of days attended.
25
   The replenishment of the control group is explained in section 4.4.1.

                                                      24
As in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Côte d'Ivoire faces a relatively low unemployment
rate, but also a small share of individuals working in wage jobs. A large part of the population
is concentrated in informal occupations, mainly in agricultural and non-agricultural self-
employment (Filmer et al, 2014; Christiaensen and Premand, 2017). In addition, most of wage
employment takes place in casual and informal jobs without contracts. Overall, many earn less
than the legal minimum wage, as the regulations are only binding for formal private companies
and public administration (INS and AGEPE, 2014). Inactivity and unemployment tend to be
more frequent for individuals in households in the top of the wealth distribution, especially
those holding a higher education degree. This reflects the fact that the poor and vulnerable often
cannot afford not to work. Moreover, gender disparities are strong. Women are more likely to
be inactive and unemployed compared to men. They are also more likely to be self-employed
rather than in wage jobs.

Public works applicants are on average 25 years-old, and mostly live in urban areas (93%).
They live in households with an average of 6 individuals (with 4 adults). 25% of applicants are
head of the household and most of applicants have no more than one child (50% of applicants
have no children, 25% have one child). Three quarters of them attended (at least partially)
primary school, but around half of the applicants (47%) have no degree26. This reflects the fact
the program was designed to attract low-skilled youths, although 11% of the applicants have
completed secondary school. Less than half of the applicants have attended some form of
vocational training, mostly informal apprenticeships. 80% of applicants were already working
before the program, in line with the national employment situation marked more by
underemployment in low-earning occupations rather than unemployment. Also, although most
applicants report searching for wage jobs, most of them declare aspiring to be self-employed in
the future. Finally, the data also points to limited financial resources, as only half of the
applicants have saved money over the last three months and nearly 75% of them report facing
constraints for basic needs expenditures.

We compare our evaluation sample to a national sample of individuals who are 18 to 30 years
old and live in urban areas27 to provide insights on public works participants’ profile (Table 1).
Overall, the program attracts a lower share of inactive and unemployed individuals compared
to all youth aged 18-30 in urban Côte d'Ivoire. Among the employed population, public works

26
  At the end of primary school students pass a certifying exam (CEPE).
27
  We use the 2013 national employment survey (ENSETE) which data was collected in February 2014 and
compare it to our closest dataset, the control group of the midline survey which occurred from November 2013
to January 2014.

                                                    25
applicants are more likely to hold wage jobs (in their main occupation) rather than be self-
employed. The educational attainment is quite similar among the general population and public
works applicants. Individuals with a relatively high level of education were also attracted by
the program, even though it had been originally been conceived for low-skilled youth.



Key outcomes

This section describes the main outcomes measured both at midline and endline surveys.

Total monthly earnings are expressed in CFA francs. They are aggregated over up to three
(parallel) activities undertook by an individual in the 30 days preceding the survey. They
include payments received in cash and the monetary equivalent for in-kind payments. The
variable is winsorized at 99%. Total monthly earnings are decomposed in total (monthly)
earnings from wage employment and self-employment (as well as earnings from other
occupations, which are not displayed separately).

Has an Activity is a dummy taking a value of 1 if the individual has worked at least one hour
over the 7 days preceding the survey, consistent with the official employment indicators used
in Côte d’Ivoire. It takes a value of 0 for inactive and unemployed individuals. We also report
having at least one wage-job (Wage employed) and at least one self-employment activity (Self-
employed), which is a decomposition of this outcome.

Weekly hours worked capture the total number of hours worked per week. It is aggregated from
up to three (parallel) activities undertook by an individual across all occupations (wage
employment, self-employment or other type of activity). The variable is winsorized at 99%.
Weekly hours worked are decomposed in hours worked in wage employment and self-
employment (as well as hours worked in other occupations, which are not displayed separately).

Savings stock is the total amount of savings in CFA francs at the time of the survey. It aggregates
savings from formal or informal mechanisms. The variable is winsorized at 99%.

Total expenditures aggregates several types of expenditures made by the youth whether the
expense would benefit himself of another member of his/her household. It includes basic
expenses (health, clothing, sanitation, and accommodation), communication (mobile, internet,
and medias), investment type (education, training, maintenance of assets), transportation,
temptation goods (alcohol, tobacco, gambling, and luxury goods) and social expenses
(celebrations and charity). The variable is winsorized at 99%.

                                                26
A well-being index aggregates 6 measures: measures of happiness and pride in daily activities
taken from a time-use module, the Rosenberg28 self-esteem scale, a ‘positive affect’ sub-scale
(from the CESD scale29), a sub-scale of (positive) attitude towards the future (from the ZTPI
scale30), and a sub-scale of (internal) locus of control (the inverted ‘fatalist present’ sub-scale
from the ZTPI scale).

A behavior index aggregates 6 measures: an inverted measure of anger or frustration in daily
activities taken from the time-use module, an inverted measure of impulsiveness, an inverted
‘conduct problem’ sub-scale (from the SDQ scale31) and a (positive) ‘pro-social behavior’ sub-
scale (from the SDQ scale).

The well-being and behavior indices are z-score, with a mean set to zero and a standard
deviation to one for the control group, so that estimated coefficients can be interpreted in
standard deviations. A positive impact on the well-being index is interpreted as an overall
increase in well-being and a positive impact on the behavior index as an overall improvement
in attitudes.



4.4     Empirical Methodology


4.4.1    Main specifications



We estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) effects for contemporaneous and post-program impacts for
the pooled treatment via an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression:

(1)

                                      D' = E	 + F	      ' 	+   G	H',I + J' 		



28
   The Rosenberg Self Esteem scale includes 10 items and measures self-esteem. We use the validated French
version.
29
   The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale was specifically developed to measure
depression. It also includes an inverted scale that measure positive feelings (“Positive Affects”).
30
   The Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI) is an instrument measuring time perspective for individuals
in different dimensions. In particular, we use the two dimensions of “future” (to have a positive attitude
towards future) and “fatalist present” which is very close to the concept of internal locus of control. We use the
validated French version.
31
   The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire was initially created to measure behavioral issues for young
children and teenagers (3 to 16 years old). We use two sub scales (out of five): “conduct problems” and “pro-
social behavior”.

                                                       27
where D is an outcome for individual + ,                is an indicator for treatment (being assigned to the
public works program at first randomization), and H is a vector of stratification variables
(locality, gender). Robust standard errors are clustered at the level of “large” brigades for treated
individuals32.

To estimate post-program ITT effects across treatment arms, we use the following specification:

(2)

                 D' = E	 + F     ' 	+   F( 	(   '   ∗ K1' ) 		 + FL 	(   '   ∗ K2' ) 		 + G 	H',I 	 + J'



where K1 (respectively K2) is an indicator for being assigned to the complementary self-
employment training (respectively wage employment training). Coefficient F estimates the
impact of the ‘pure’ public works while the coefficient F( estimates the additional effect of the
self-employment training and FL the additional effect of the wage employment training. F +
F( (respectively	F 	 + FL ) capture the total effect of the program for individuals assigned to
public works and complementary self-employment training (respectively wage employment
training). In the results table, we also provide the p-value for the test that this sum is equal to
zero.

We analyze heterogeneity in treatment effects by groups M determined by a set of baseline
characteristics N (see discussion in section 6). The specification used in that case is the
following:

(3)

              D' = 	E + 	 O (   '   ∗ 	 M' ) + 	 O( (   '   ∗ (1 − M' )) + OL ∗ M' + δ( 	X',I + ϵS 	,



where M is an indicator for belonging to the group determined by N. We are interested in
coefficient O , which estimates the impact of the pooled treatment for a specific group	M . We




32
   We suspect within-brigade error correlation due to the interactions between treated individuals who worked
together in the same brigade for several months. Brigades are sometimes aggregated to account for the fact
that some individuals have been moved across brigades during public works implementation for various
reasons: when such movement occurred, we group the different brigades together.

                                                            28
                            T and the p-value for the test that O + O( 	is equal to zero at the
provide standard errors for	O
bottom of the tables.

For specifications (1) to (3), we use probability weights. They are composed by up to five33
multiplicative weights to account for (i) public lotteries specificities in the first randomization,
(ii) locality specificities in the second randomization, (iii) the sub-sampling of non-respondents
during tracking surveys, (iv) the sub-sampling of the treated group for midline survey and (v)
cases of control individuals who enrolled and eventually participated in later waves of the
program34.



Potential threats to internal validity



We check for balance across treatment and control groups in Table 2. Column (3) contains the
p-values for the test of difference between treatment and control groups, and column (4) for the
test whether all treatment arms are jointly equal to zero. Overall, there are no meaningful
differences across groups35. We note that collecting the baseline survey after assignment to the
program affected a few variables for which control or treatment groups may have had incentives
to over or under report. Based on that, we do not add baseline controls on top of stratification
controls to our specification.

At midline, compliance to program assignment was high. Only 6 control individuals in the
sample succeeded in ‘cheating’ the public lottery (by registering for the program in different
locations) and only 2 generated contamination after being selected for the program. Among
youth assigned to the public works, take-up was high as 93% of them participated for more than
five months out of the seven months of implementation. In total, youth worked an average of
141 days, out of a maximum of the 154 days expected in case of full attendance.

An unforeseen issue emerged at endine. Between the end of the phase of the program being
evaluated and the time of the endline survey, a few individuals from the control group were




33
   With midline data, we use weights related to (i), (iii) and (iv). With endline data, we use weights related to (i),
(ii), (iii) and (v). More details on weight construction provided in Appendix A.
34
   This specific point is detailed in the next paragraphs and in Appendix A.
35
   We also checked the balance across groups for both midline and endline respondents.

                                                         29
able to enroll (and eventually participate) in the third or fourth wave of the program36. However,
administrative data about enrollment and public lotteries enabled us to observe control
individuals’ behavior for the third and fourth wave (i.e. whether control individuals applied or
not to the program, and whether they were selected and participated or not). For post-program
impact analysis, control individuals who (later) participated to the program are not included.
To adjust for this, control individuals who also applied in future waves but were not selected
through the public lotteries are assigned relatively larger weights37. 200 individuals were also
(randomly) added38 to increase the total size of the control group.

Finally, the take-up of complementary training is lower than the take-up for the ‘pure’ public
works: 72% of individuals assigned to self-employment training and 67,2% of those assigned
to wage-employment training attended at least 75% of the training (i.e. at least 60 hours out of
the 80 total hours). This level of take up is aligned with take-up observed in other skill training
programs. For both trainings, only 10% of individuals never attended.



4.4.2   Heterogeneity analysis using machine learning


Machine learning and heterogeneity of treatment effects



The use of machine learning methods in this paper comes from the desire to understand the
heterogeneity of treatment effects, in an experimental setting with rich and multi-dimensional
baseline data. In particular, we would like to assess how much the treatment effect would vary
under alternative assignment rules (based on observable characteristics), and especially if larger
treatment effects could be obtained by targeting specific sub-groups compared to average
treatment effects estimated across all participants. Understanding how much different types of
individuals benefit from the program could help policy makers define a more efficient selection
rule and maximize the impact of the program. In addition, analyzing heterogeneity can improve



36
   We identified 140 individuals from our baseline control group (i.e. 13,5%) among next waves beneficiaries
(91 for third wave, 49 for fourth wave). Among the 200 individuals randomly added, 30 were also identified to
be among third or fourth wave beneficiaries.
37
   Specifically, we use specific weights to account for the behavior of enrollment to the waves and put a zero-
weight on control individuals who ever received the program (see Appendix A).
38
   To keep the same stratification as the initial control group sample, we selected the 20% next ones of each
(baseline) lotteries’ list.

                                                      30
our understanding of the mechanisms: across outcomes, some subgroups can highly benefit in
terms of earnings but not in other dimensions and vice versa.

When looking at heterogeneity in treatment effects, we are traditionally interested in estimating
the coefficient of the interaction between treatment and a binary indicator for a group, in a linear
specification. However, looking at subgroups defined by one or two interaction terms is rather
limited, and searching intensively for subgroups may lead to spurious conclusions that will
probably not hold once one accounts for multiple hypothesis testing. A different approach
would be to consider the identification of heterogeneous treatment effects as a prediction
problem: mapping individual characteristics to treatment effect estimates (Mullainathan and
Spiess, 2017). In fact, a recent literature has been reconsidering the importance of prediction in
policy issues (while the focus is on causal inference) and how machine learning could contribute
to solve these “prediction policy problems” (Kleinberg et al., 2015). These range from police
hiring and teacher tenure decisions (in which predicting productivity can inform decisions) to
crime risk prediction to help judges’ decisions in bail-type problems (Chalfin et al., 2016;
Kleinberg et al., 2017).

Targeting is an area where machine learning techniques are potentially extremely useful. If
policymakers have a clear assignment rule to implement (e.g. target the poorest or those at
higher risk), the challenge is to accurately predict the corresponding outcome (wealth or risk,
to follow the same examples) in order to improve the targeting of a given program. Machine
learning tools typically outperform standard regression tools at this task39. Another way
machine learning can inform targeting is to understand if among eligible people some
subgroups could benefit more than others. This is the approach followed by Davis and Heller
(2017a and 2017b), using machine learning to look at heterogeneous treatment effects across
different outcomes of interest, in a large-scale employment program for disadvantaged youth.
Based on such analysis, policy makers could adapt the selection rule to target individuals
predicted to be those who benefit the most, and therefore maximize program impacts.



Using causal forests to predict (conditional) treatment effects




39
  For example, McBride and Nichols (2016) shows how machine learning algorithms can improve poverty
targeting compared to Proxy Means Tests.

                                                   31
In supervised machine learning methods40 (e.g. regression trees, random forests), a model of
the relationship between a set of features (H)	and an observed outcome (D) is first built by
training the model on a dataset where (D, H)	are observed. That model is subsequently used to
predict D	on a population for which only the characteristics H are observed. Many applications
can be found in the fields of medicine or more recently online marketing. Such an approach
could be applied to the prediction of treatment effects (instead of the outcome	D) using for H a
set of covariates measured at baseline (before treatment). In particular, algorithms such as
regression trees or random forests can help us predict treatment effects conditional on a set of
characteristics	H without making assumptions on which Hs or combinations of Hs might be
relevant, or on the functional form of this heterogeneity (i.e. whether it is linear or not41). Given
the prediction model built, we would be able to predict treatment effects for any set of
characteristics included in H and simulate the treatment effects of the program under alternative
selection rules (based on	H)42. Using predictions for different outcomes, we could also look at
the variation of treatment effects across outcomes.

Actually, adapting the prediction of outcomes to treatment effects is not straightforward. The
main challenge is that machine learning algorithms require to assess the quality of predictions:
this is relatively easy when predictions can be directly compared to realizations of the outcome
for each individual; however this is ‘infeasible’ when only one potential outcome is observed
(fundamental problem of causal inference). Athey and Imbens (2016) build a framework and
propose a new algorithm - causal tree - which adapts classification and regression trees (CART)
to the specific case of predicting treatment effects conditional on a set of H. Causal trees differ
from CART in two main aspects43: (i) the splitting criteria has been adapted to maximize the
variation in treatment effects across leaves (rather than the variance of the outcome), (ii) an
independent sample (different from the sample used to partition the data) is used to estimate
treatment effects within each leaf (“honesty” property) which should eliminate some
overfitting. This new sample splitting (“honesty”) also makes inference on treatment effects
valid (conditional on a tree). Wager and Athey (2016) extend this framework to random forests
based on causal trees and the possibility to make causal inference with the obtained results44.



40
   See Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2009) for their detailed review of these methods.
41
   In particular, random forests can detect nonlinear heterogeneity that could not be identified using LASSO.
42
   More details on machine learning procedure in Appendix B.
43
   Appendix B.2.3 provides more details on the differences between causal trees and CART.
44
   Random forests were introduced by Breiman (2001). See Wager, Hastie and Efron, 2014 for the computation
of confidence intervals for random forests.

                                                     32
We rely here on the framework developed by Athey and Imbens (2016). We want to estimate
the conditional average treatment effect (CATE): τ(=) = [	D' 	(1) − 		 D' 	(0)|	H'X = =] with
H X a vector of K baseline covariates (features) and D the outcome of interest. This requires a
dataset D' YZ[ ,         X
                    ' , H'   , + = 1 … ], considered as an i.i.d. sample drawn from an infinite
population, where            is a binary indicator for treatment and D YZ[ the realized and observed
outcome, that is to say the potential outcome corresponding to the treatment received. We also
need to make the assumption of ‘unconfoundedness’ (e.g. treatment is randomized conditional
on observable covariates), which is reasonable given our randomized experiment.

In this paper, we implement the causal forests algorithm45 to recover a prediction of	^ = . In a
nutshell, causal forests are random forests of causal trees, the latter being standard trees adapted
to the case of treatment effect estimation as in Athey and Imbens (2016).

First of all, as in most machine learning methods, our data is split in two separate samples: a
training sample used to build the model, and a test sample. This is fundamental as all subsequent
analysis will be performed on the test sample, a sample that is not involved at any step in the
construction of the prediction model. Given our dataset (small46 ] compared to _ ), this will be
a constraint in terms of sample size.

Then, the model giving a prediction of ^ = is built using a training sample set to 50% of the
full sample ] (standard). In a second step, ^ = is estimated on the test sample (set to 50% of
]). This is applied to both midline and endline surveys, for our main outcome of interest total
monthly earnings (see section 4.3.2), and with = ∈ H X a rich set of 101 baseline covariates
comprising individual and household characteristics, education, employment and savings
dimensions, assets held, measures of personality, preferences, ability and cognitive skills.
Appendix B provides extensive details on the construction of the model and the covariates used.

To discuss heterogeneity of the impacts, we report the mean of ^̂ = over each quartile on the
test sample. To document heterogeneity we will focus on the upper and lower quartile
(respectively top and bottom 25% groups). In particular, impacts at the top quartile of the
distribution indicate the potential gains in treatment effects when selecting individuals based
on a large set of characteristics.

function from causalTree package in R, with small modifications. See Appendix B.

   The sample size varies depending on the survey used for the algorithm and ranges from 2,884 to 3,910 units.

5     Results: ITT Estimates for Public Works Impacts



This section presents ITT estimates for public works impacts on main outcomes for youths,
based on the pooled treatment specification in equation (1). The ITT estimates are discussed
separately for contemporaneous impacts (3-4 months after the start of the program, while youths
are still participating) and post-program impacts (12-15 months after youths have exited from
the program). The next section discusses mechanisms for post-program impacts and impacts by
treatment arms (using specification in equation (2)).



5.1    ITT Estimates for Main Outcomes


Table 3 (Panel A, columns 1-6) presents contemporaneous ITT estimates on employment and
hours worked. 86% of youths in the control group have an activity at midline, with 53% of
youths holding a wage job, and 33% self-employed. This is consistent with the employment
situation in Côte d’Ivoire and much of Sub-Saharan Africa, where a large numbers of youths
are underemployed by working in low-productivity occupations, often in self-employment or
informal wage jobs paying less than the minimum wage in the formal sector, and few are
formally unemployed. In this context, impacts during the program on the overall level of
employment are limited for youths in the sample (+12 pp). The stronger employment effects
stem from a change in the composition of employment, with strong impacts on the share of
youths holding wage jobs (+44 pp) driven by the public works jobs, and a smaller decrease in
self-employment (-9 pp). Similar patterns are observed for contemporaneous program impacts
on hours worked per week, with a small overall increase in total hours worked (by 3.5 hours
from on an average of 41 hours per week in the control group). This is driven by a large increase
in hours worked in wage employment (+14 hours) and smaller decrease in hours worked in self-
employment (-6.7 hours). Employment in the public works program accounts for approximately
30 hours a week for individuals in the treatment group, so that the small increase in overall
hours worked in fact hides a large decrease in hours worked in other activities. Youths in the
treatment group also become more likely to cumulate various activities47. Overall, the observed

47
  It is estimated than the share of youths holding multiple activities increase in the treatment group, see
Bertrand et al. (2016).

                                                       34
contemporaneous program impacts on employment raise questions on the effectiveness of the
self-targeting mechanism in a context where most youths are working and have to rearrange
their activities to make time to access the better public wage jobs offered by the program.

Table 3 (Panel B, columns 1-6) presents post-program ITT estimates on employment and hours
worked. Despite strong shifts in youths’ employment portfolios during the program, no post-
program impacts on employment level, employment composition or hours worked are
observed. Youths in the treatment group display a similar employment profile than youths in
the control group, with no statistical difference in the main indicators for employment and hours
worked. On the one hand, these results show that the public works program did not lead to
“stigmatization” or “scarring” effects for youths. Past participants are not less likely to be
employed (including self-employed or holding wage jobs) a year after their exit from the
program. This suggests a relatively rapid adjustment back to the pre-program occupations. On
the other hand, results also show that the public works does not bring longer-term benefits to
youths in terms of employment types or hours worked. An important exception, however,
relates to the earnings and productivity in these occupations, to which we now turn.

Table 3 (Panel A, columns 7-9) presents contemporaneous ITT estimates of program impacts
on earnings. The public works leads to a net increase in earnings of FCFA 20,885 per month
(or approximately $42) during the program. The net earnings gains represent a 35% increase
from the level of earnings in the control group (FCFA 60,052, or $120), or approximately 42%
of the average net monthly transfer amount (FCFA 50,600, or $10148). As such, the estimated
effects point to substantial foregone earnings from activities that youths left or scaled down in
order to participate in the program. As for employment patterns, contemporaneous impacts on
earnings stem from the strong increase in earnings from the wage jobs offered by the program
(+FCFA 35,385, or $71), with a significant decrease in earnings from self-employment (- FCFA
12,625, or $25).

Table 3 (Panel B, columns 7-9) presents post-program ITT estimates of program impacts on
earnings. The public works leads to a small but significant increase in earnings a year after the
end of the program (+FCFA 5,622, or $11 per month), a 11.6% increase from the level of
earnings in the control group. The increase in earnings is concentrated in self-employment,
where earnings increase by FCFA 6,223 ($12.4) per month, or substantial relative increase of

  This figure is the average amount transferred over all individuals assigned to the public works (independently
of non-compliance and days not worked).

                                                      35
32%. On the other hand, post-program earnings in wage jobs are not statistically different
between the treatment and control groups. These results show that, while participants were not
more likely to be employed, employed in different occupations, or working longer hours, they
were on average running more profitable self-employment activities one year after exiting from
the program.

To go beyond traditional economic indicators, we also discuss the impacts of public works on
indices of well-being and behavior. The consideration of broader well-being indicators are
important as the temporary jobs offered by the program may have indirect benefits or costs
beyond economic dimensions. On the one hand, the public works activities are hard manual
labor activities, which some may consider depreciating. On the other hand, there can be a certain
status associated with holding a public wage job in the community, in particular a predictable
and secured formal wage job. Changes in youths’ well-being and behavior are particularly
relevant in a post-conflict setting such as Côte d’Ivoire, including as they point to potential
program externalities on social cohesion, an issue of strong interest for policymakers.

Table 3 (Panel A, columns 12-13) presents ITT estimates of contemporaneous program impacts
on indices of well-being and behavior (see section 4.3.2 for definition). Results show significant
contemporaneous program impacts on the well-being index (+0.2 standard deviations), as well
as the behavior index (+0.13 standard deviations). Improvements in well-being while youth
participate in the program come from a larger share of youths reporting feeling happy and
proud, scoring higher on sub-scales for self-esteem, positive affect and positive attitude towards
the future, as well as reporting higher present and future life satisfaction49. Improvements in
behavioral dimensions are more limited, but point to less anger and frustration in daily life, and
less impulsiveness, although no related changes in other domains such as pro-social behavior
and conduct problems are observed. These results may be associated with the economic gains
mentioned earlier. They also raise the possibility that some youths who do not benefit
substantially in economic dimensions may nevertheless benefit from the program in
psychological or behavioral dimensions.

Table 3 (Panel B, columns 12-13) presents post-program ITT estimates on indices of well-being
and behavior. Some lasting improvements are observed on psychological well-being for youths
in the medium-term (0.09 standard deviations), although they are more muted than during the
program. They are also concentrated in a narrower set of domains such as happiness, self-


49
     In contrast, present fatalism is unaffected.

                                                    36
esteem and present life satisfaction. In contrast, there are no lasting impacts on sub-scales for
pride, positive affect, positive attitude towards the future and future life satisfaction. A year
after the end of the program, no lasting impacts are observed in the behavior index or any of its
subcomponent, suggesting that short-term behavioral gains have faded.



5.2   Mechanisms for Post-Program Impacts


Intermediary Outcomes: Short-term Expenditures and Savings

Table 3 (Panel A, columns 10-11) presents contemporaneous ITT estimates on expenditures
and savings, to complement the estimated impacts on earnings documented earlier. During the
program, the observed increase in earnings (+FCFA 20,885 per month, or $42 as mentioned
above) translate into an increase in both expenditures and savings. Total monthly expenditures
are estimated to increase by FCFA 15,085 ($32), constituting approximately 70% of the nets
earnings gains. The overall increase in expenditures can be decomposed in roughly equal shares
between youths’ own expenditures and their contribution to household expenditures. The
additional expenditures are mostly for basic necessities (food, clothes, …), as well as education
and training.

Yet, beyond consumption support, youths are able to save a significant share of their net
earnings gains. On average, after about 4 months in the program, youths in the treatment group
have increased their stock of savings by approximately FCFA 39,633 ($79). This impact is of
large magnitude as it corresponds to a 182% increase from the average stock of savings in the
control group (FCFA 21,752, or $43). The order of magnitude is also consistent with youths
saving approximately 30% of their earnings gains. Importantly, youths are not only more likely
to save and to save larger amounts, but most of these savings are kept in formal bank accounts.
These include accounts in which youths are paid their public works wages. Overall, these
substantial contemporaneous increases in savings are likely to contribute to the post-program
effects on earnings in self-employment. Indeed, post-program results show that youths are not
more likely to be self-employed, but are more likely to operate micro-enterprises with a
relatively larger asset stock and scale of operations, pointing to higher productivity. Youths in
the treatment group also report higher investments in household enterprises, which likely have
been facilitated by savings from the program and are consistent with observed higher earnings
in self-employment.

                                               37
Impacts by Treatment Arms

Table 3 (Panel C) further illustrates the contribution of the various treatment arms to disentangle
the causal impacts of complementary skills training from the average post-program impacts
documented so far. Overall, little variation in impacts across treatment arms is observed,
suggesting limited value-added of the complementary skills training. Specifically, post-
program impacts on employment level, employment composition and hours worked are very
consistent across the different treatment arms50. One noteworthy distinction relates to the post-
program impacts on earnings. Post-program impacts on total earnings are mostly observed for
the groups of individuals that were assigned to the basic entrepreneurship or jobs search skills
training. In particular, post-program impacts on self-employment earnings mostly come from
youths in the treatment group that was assigned to the basic entrepreneurship training. Still, the
impacts on earnings are not statistically different between arms, so that we cannot reject
equality of the impacts on earnings across groups. The only difference in earnings that is
significant is when comparing self-employment earnings across individuals assigned to the
basic entrepreneurship training and individuals affected to the basic public works only.
Ultimately, since there are no statistical differences in impacts on overall earnings across
treatment arms, we pool treatment to conduct finer heterogeneity analysis in the rest of the
paper.

The limited value-added of the complementary training suggests that skills acquisition through
these trainings is not the main mechanism that explains the post-program impacts. In fact, the
trainings were effective in improving knowledge in basic entrepreneurship, respectively jobs
search skills, as they intended to do. They also led to youths applying these skills in practice,
either by intensifying their search for wage jobs (e.g. using a CV for a job search, searching
using adds or by applying independently) or their efforts to set-up a new activity (e.g. by
undertaking a market study or a preparing a business plan)51. However, these changes in skills
and practices were not sufficient to generate earnings beyond those generated by the basic
public works program.



50
   The only exception is that hours in self-employment are significantly larger in the jobs search training arms
compared to the public works only arm. Still, the coefficient is not statistically different from 0 or from the
estimate from the basic entrepreneurship training arms.
51
   We document these two aspects of trainings impact (learning during the training and trying to put this intro
practice) in the policy report, Bertrand et al. (2016).

6     Heterogeneity Analysis



The public works program was oversubscribed, with the number of applicants exceeding the
number of available program slots by a ratio of 4 to 1. While participation in the program was
the result of a random assignment process52, which has the advantage of being fair and
transparent, the performance of the program might have been improved with a better targeting
of the 25 percent of program beneficiaries among applicants.

Whether and by how much alternative targeting might have improved program effectiveness
depends on the magnitude of heterogeneity in program impacts. In theory, given the self-
selection mechanism, we would expect heterogeneity in impacts among program applicants,
with marginal applicants experiencing very limited gains in earnings compared to infra-
marginal applicants with more limited employment opportunities outside the program53.



6.1    Quantile Treatment Effects


In practice, detecting heterogeneity of treatment effects is complicated. Indeed, some
parameters of the treatment effects distribution, such as its variance, are not identified. Their
identification would require knowledge of the joint distribution of potential outcomes whereas
only one potential outcome can be observed at a time for each individual.

To study the potential heterogeneity of program impacts in an experimental setting, researchers
traditionally look at quantile regressions. Indeed, even if not identified, it is possible to obtain
a bound for the variance of impacts (Heckman Smith and Clements, 1997, Djebbari and Smith
2008). Results from quantile regressions provide information about the lower bound of the
variance. When quantile treatment effects are homogeneous, the lower bound of the variance is
zero: a constant treatment effect is consistent with homogeneous quantile treatment effects.
Bitler et al. (2006, 2014) provide a well-known application of quantile treatment effects to
analyze heterogeneity of impacts. As highlighted in this prior work, quantile treatment effects


52
   Recall that the only criteria enforced at enrollment are age (18 to 30) and not being a previous beneficiary of
the first wave of public works.
53
   These marginal applicants could still benefit from the program in dimensions others than earnings.

                                                        39
will help to detect heterogeneity of impacts only if the intervention preserves ranks, or at least
does not lead to too much churning in the distribution of outcomes. In fact, the rank preservation
assumption allows one to interpret quantile treatment effects as the “effect at quantile”, hence
making it directly informative about heterogeneity of impacts. Under this assumption,
observing non homogeneous quantile treatment effects indicates that the lower bound of the
variance is strictly greater than zero. However, if the intervention does not preserve ranks,
quantile treatment effects are of little help to detect heterogeneity.

Figure 1 presents quantile treatment effects on earnings during the program (Panel (a)) and after
the program (Panel (b)). The horizontal axis in each panel reports the quantile and the vertical
axis the estimate of the treatment effect at the corresponding quantile. The shaded area around
the estimate provides the 95% confidence interval. As the figure clearly illustrates, the quantile
analysis shows substantial heterogeneity of impacts on earnings during the program. The
quantile treatment effect is as large as FCFA 45,000 at the 15% quantile, but only FCFA 15,000
at the 85% quantile. Moreover, the estimated quantile treatment effects are quite precise,
strongly suggesting the existence of true heterogeneity rather than just sampling variation.

The quantile analysis of treatment effects on income after the program (Panel (b)) offers a rather
different picture. Post-program quantile treatment effects are uniformly small and the small
dispersion is within confidence bounds, consistent with sampling variation.

In summary, there appears to be large heterogeneity of quantile treatment effects during the
program, but less heterogeneity after the program. The model derived in the framework (section
2) shows that the intervention possibly preserves ranks, or at least might not induce too much
churning in the distribution of contemporaneous effects. Thus, the true variance of impacts
might not be too far from the lower bound and the heterogeneity seen in quantile treatment
effects points to true underlying heterogeneity during the program.

However, this is not necessarily the case for post-program earnings. There might be individual
latent factors, such as return to capital, that would not contribute to the ranking of individual
earnings in absence of the program but contribute to the ranking of individuals’ post-program
earnings. For example, if there are individuals trapped at the bottom of the earnings distribution
without the program, but with high returns to capital (e.g. through setting-up a highly profitable
activity), these individuals, thanks to their participation in the program, might end up further
towards the top of the earnings distribution. This is because the program allows them to save
and implement their latent project after program completion.

6.2. Machine learning to study heterogeneity in impacts



Given the possible limitations of the quantile regression approach, in particular when it comes
to assessing heterogeneity in post-program effects, we turn to a different empirical approach.
The technique is based on the identification of underlying baseline variables contributing to
heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In a standard regression framework, this would be done
by interacting the treatment variable with covariates, before recovering predicted impacts
conditional on these covariates. Djebarri and Smith (2008) apply this method and show that it
captures a substantial share of the variability of impacts. The machine learning methods
developed by Athey and Imbens (2016) and Wager and Athey (2016) go one step further in
identifying the expectation of impacts conditional on a set of covariates. The main innovation
of these machine learning methods is that they can uncover the underlying heterogeneity in
impacts without making any assumptions about the source or form of this heterogeneity54.
Although these methods can miss some determinants of heterogeneity (especially if the set of
                                       55
covariates is not rich enough)              , they offer an alternative and systematic way to explore
heterogeneity of impacts. These methods are particularly relevant to our context given the large
number of covariates we have captured in our rich baseline survey. Moreover, these methods
permit to detect heterogeneity even if the intervention is not rank preserving.

We apply the causal forest algorithm developed by Wager and Athey (2016) to study the
existence and magnitude of heterogeneity in treatment effects. As already discussed above,
these machine learning methods are implemented in a two-step procedure. First, the relevant
set of covariates is identified on a “training sample” comprised of 50% of the total sample
(random subsample). Second, impacts conditional on these identified covariates (and
interactions of covariates) are estimated on a “test sample,” the remaining 50% random
subsample of the total sample. After having generated several causal forests, we can recover a


54
   Specifically, (i) it doesn’t require assuming linearity and looks for more complex relationships across
covariates; (ii) it can search for heterogeneity across high-dimensional sets of covariates rather than restricting
to a few covariates (in standard approach).
55
   Causal forests could fail to detect heterogeneity (when there is true underlying heterogeneity) if
heterogeneity depends on unobservable characteristics (missing in the “input” features of the model). They
would have hard time finding heterogeneity if underlying heterogeneity is highly linear or if some features
strongly affect the level of the outcome but not the treatment effect (leading to spurious splits in the
algorithm). Lastly, measurement errors in covariates could also decrease the efficiency of the algorithm to
determine the right splits of the data.

                                                        41
predicted treatment effect conditional on baseline covariates for each unit in the sample. In the
following section, we will simply refer to them as “predicted treatment effects”, but these
predictions are obtained from test samples only and are conditional on the set of baseline
covariates used. The full procedure, including the implementation of the causal forest
algorithm, is detailed in Appendix B. This approach can be used to estimate the heterogeneity
of predicted impacts both during and after the program; and it can be applied to study
heterogeneity in the impacts on earnings, but also on other outcomes, such as well-being.



Assessing the magnitude of heterogeneity in impacts on earnings



Figure 2 shows the distribution of predicted impacts on earnings derived from the causal forest
algorithm during the program (darker shade) and after the program (lighter shade). It reveals
substantive heterogeneity of impact during the program, consistently with the quantile
regression results reported above. The distribution of predicted impacts on earnings during the
program is skewed to the left, which implies that more than half of program participants benefit
more than the average treatment effect. Conversely, the extended lower tail suggests that some
individuals benefit far less from the program. In comparison, the distribution of predicted
impacts after program reveals less heterogeneity; both the standard deviation and the
interquartile range are smaller than for the distribution during the program.

Table 4 complements Figure 2 by reporting predicted impacts by quartile, both during and after
the program. Contemporaneous program effects on total earnings are reported in column (1),
and post-program effects in columns (2). Although confidence intervals cannot yet be
constructed for the predictions recovered from the causal forests, the average treatment effects
per quartile highlight how much impacts vary along the distribution. We focus in particular on
the difference between the average impact in the top quartile and in the bottom quartile, as well
as with the estimated average treatment effect.

Panel (A) of Table 4 presents the means and standard errors of the distribution of estimated
conditional impacts on earnings during and after the program. Summarizing the evidence from
Figure 2, we find that the mean predicted impact on earnings during the program is FCFA
20,230, with a standard deviation of 7,614. The mean predicted impact on earnings after the
program is FCFA 4,914, with a standard deviation of 2,713.


                                               42
Column (1) of Panel (B) offers further confirmation that there is a large amount of heterogeneity
in impacts on earnings during the program. The average predicted impact on earnings is FCFA
9,934 in the lower quartile of the distribution compared to FCFA 28,622 in the upper quartile.
In contrast, column (2) of Panel C suggests more modest heterogeneity after the program. The
average predicted impact on earnings is FCFA 1,475 in the lower quartile of the distribution
compared to FCFA 8,329 in the upper quartile.

In other words, finer targeting could in theory strongly improve program impacts. For the
bottom 25% of applicants, the contemporaneous impacts on earnings are less than half of those
of the mean applicant, and represent only approximately 20% of the transfer made by the
program. Replacing randomized assignment of the program by a targeting rule that
“maximizes” contemporaneous program impacts on earnings would lead to a 37% increase in
impacts during the program (FCFA 28,622 compared to FCFA 20,885 achieved under random
selection). Replacing randomized assignment of the program with a targeting rule that
“maximizes” post-program earnings would roughly double post-program impacts (FCFA 8,329
compared to FCFA 5,621 achieved under random selection). This last result is an important
one, as we now further discuss.

It does not come as a surprise that workfare programs have large and heterogeneous
contemporaneous impacts. This is actually what we expect from the self-selection mechanism,
with a fraction of marginal participants almost indifferent between being enrolled or not (in
terms of earnings), and others being infra-marginal. One major question with workfare
programs is whether they have impacts after program completion. The potential mechanisms to
explain heterogeneity in post-program impacts are less straightforward than for the
contemporaneous impacts. They might have to do with experience in the labor market and
ability to signal skills. They could be related to return to capital and the impact of investments
on income generating activities, through accumulated savings during the program.

While the results in Table 4 so far suggest the possibility of improving program effectiveness
both during and after the program through better targeting, an important question is whether the
targeting that would maximize contemporaneous program impacts would also maximize post-
program impacts. In other words, are the covariates that are associated with large predicted
impacts during the program associated with large predicted impacts after the program as well
(and vice versa)? The scatter plot in Figure 3 suggests a negative answer. Figure 3 shows
predicted impacts on earnings during the program (x-axis) against predicted impacts on
earnings after the program (y-axis), all derived from applying the causal forest algorithm. The
                                               43
solid vertical and horizontal lines on the scatter plot respectively correspond to the average
predicted impacts during and after the program. Similarly, the horizontal (respectively vertical)
dashed lines represent the 1st and 3rd quartile of the distribution of predicted impacts during
(respectively post) program. A high correlation between impacts on earnings during and after
program would lead to a concentration of predictions along the diagonal from the top right
corner – those who have the largest impacts during and after the program, to the bottom left
corner. On the contrary, the scatter plot shows that even within the top quartile of impacts during
the program, the post program impacts are dispersed on the opposite axis (and similarly for the
top quartile of post program impacts). The remaining columns in Panel (B) and (C) of Table 4
illustrate further.

Column (2) of Panel (B) and column (1) of Panel (C) confirm the visual evidence in Figure 3
in that there is no systematic relationship between those who benefit the most during the
program and those who benefit the most after the program. Specifically, targeting the program
to the 25% of applicants that benefit the most during the program would result in average
predicted impacts after the program of FCFA 5,119, marginally below the average treatment
effect. Similarly, targeting the program to the 25% of applicants that benefit the most after
program completion would result in average predicted impacts during the program of FCFA
20,706, close to the average treatment effect. In other words, these results suggest tradeoffs
when trying to improve program effectiveness through better targeting. They highlight the
challenge in isolating a single targeting rule that can “maximize” impacts both during and after
the program. This relates to a broader trade-off between the two objectives of the public works
program, namely its safety net role “during” the program and its productive dimension related
to post-program employment and earnings.



Analyzing patterns of heterogeneity



Given the important heterogeneity of impacts on earnings during the program, we want to learn
more about the differences between individuals in the bottom and top quartile of the distribution
of predicted impacts. On the one hand, one could argue that individuals in the bottom quartile
should be explicitly excluded from the program. On the other hand, these individuals decided
to participate in the program despite small earning gains so they might benefit from the program
in other dimensions.

                                                44
It is not straightforward how one can use causal forest predictions to summarize the differences
                                                                                   b is
in characteristics associated with high versus low treatment effects. The function ^(=)
derived from non-parametric procedures, which makes it difficult to display differences in the
characteristics that matter most. Moreover, interpreting the structure of the covariate splits, say
for a given tree of the causal forest, could be misleading56 (Mullainathan and Spiess, 2017). By
looking at the summary statistics for quartiles of the distribution of treatment effects, Table 5
offers a way to grasp some of the most important differences in terms of baseline covariates
between the two groups. The table investigates the differences between the groups with lowest
(column 2) and highest (column 3) estimated conditional impacts on earnings during the
program by presenting the average of several baseline characteristics over the two groups as
well as for the sample of participants (column (1)).We present in column (4) the p-value for the
test of the hypothesis of no difference across these groups.

The table clearly shows differences in profiles between individuals who benefit the least and
the most during the program. The share of women is significantly higher among the upper
quartile at midline (43%) than among the bottom quartile (22%). A large set of characteristics
related to the financial status of the individuals suggest that the lower quartile was “better-off”
at baseline, whereas the upper quartile was poorer. This holds for assets, expenditures, savings
and earnings. There is a large difference in the stock of savings among individuals in the bottom
quartile of the distribution of predicted impacts during the program (FCFA 48,115) and those
in the top of the distribution (FCFA 17,535). Similarly, the share of participants in the bottom
quartile saying they face credit constraints (44%) is much lower than for applicants in the top
quartile (59%). Finally, the share of people working is substantially higher among the bottom
quartile (90%), compared to the top quartile (66%). Baseline earnings are four times higher for
the group in the bottom quartile compared to the top quartile. Twice as many individuals in the
bottom quartile are engaged in independent activities at baseline compared to the upper quartile
(respectively 49% and 23%).

Those who benefit the least during the program appear to be less financially constrained and
have a higher stock of savings. While they have larger foregone earnings than other participants,


56
  Mullainathan and Spiess (2017) consider that the underlying structure (covariate splits) is part of what “we
do not learn” from machine learning. Although machine learning algorithms are stable in terms of prediction
quality, they are not in terms of model selection. It means that across trees within a forest, one can get similar
predictions based on very different partitions determined by covariates on which splits are performed. One
reason for that is the positive correlation across variables and with treatment effects, for example. It makes the
interpretation of the covariate splits highly challenging.

                                                       45
they may be able to save a greater share of their income during the program, or they may be
able to better invest these savings into income-generating activities57. Table 4 and Figure 3
suggested earlier that those who benefit the least during the program do not necessarily benefit
more than others on average after program completion. The observed differences in baseline
characteristics suggest it is worthwhile exploring more how treatment effects on other outcomes
differ between the two groups, especially outcomes related to self-employment and productive
investments. By doing this, we highlight how machine learning techniques can help tease out
mechanisms explaining program impacts58.

Tables 6 and 7 present estimates of treatment effects on a range of outcomes, first for individuals
in the upper quartile of (predicted) impacts on earnings during the program (designated as “top
25%” group in Panel A), second for individuals in the lower quartile (designated as “bottom
25%” group in Panel B). Table 6 presents estimates of treatment effects (ITT) for the main
outcomes during the program, while Table 7 contains post-program estimates. In both tables,
we report the coefficient and standard errors of the interaction between treatment and dummies
for the relevant quartile59, which gives us the total treatment effect (ITT) for the group of
interest. We also report the p-value of the test assessing if the estimated treatment effect for the
relevant quartile is statistically different from the estimates for the rest of the sample.

Columns (1) to (6) in Table 6 show that the top 25% group have the highest impact on wage
employment and related earnings. This is consistent with results in Table 5, which suggested
they were more vulnerable people less likely to have an activity prior to the program. Panel (B)
also confirms that the self-targeting mechanisms based on the formal minimum wage failed in
the sense that it brought to the program a subgroup –the bottom 25%- for which impacts on
total earnings are close to zero and significantly lower than for the other applicants (Column
(5))60. Column (7) reveals interesting differences in terms of savings. Panel B suggests that the

57
   It is also possible that these individuals may particularly benefit from the opportunity to save through the
bank accounts set-up by the program.
58
   We follow here Davis and Heller (2017b), who explicitly use machine learning to test underlying mechanisms
relying on differential treatment response from disadvantaged youth who benefitted from summer jobs.
Indeed, if some subgroups are strongly affected in one dimension but negatively on another one, it will hard to
identify that while looking at average treatment effects. Compared to them, with look at mechanisms across
time (during the program versus post program) rather than across outcomes measured at the same moment.
59
   Quartile dummies are based on the predicted treatment effect obtained for each individual using causal
forest algorithms. Appendix B details how assignment to quartile groups is made when using simulations of
several causal forests.
60
   Note that for this table, column (5) is the outcome which was used in the causal forest algorithm to predict
treatment effects on earnings and therefore used to define the top 25% and bottom 25% groups. This can be
interpreted as an indirect test for detecting heterogeneity using causal forests, as implemented in Davis and
Heller (2017b). However, note that it is limited by the fact that (i) it tests for a linear interaction whereas the

                                                        46
savings stock of the bottom 25% group increases significantly more than for the other
applicants, while total earnings only marginally increase, which represents an increase in the
marginal propensity to save. For this group, the impact on savings is 25% higher than the
average impact. Individuals in the upper quartile experience smaller increases in savings than
average, although the difference between this group and the rest of the sample is not statistically
significant. Finally, positive impacts on well-being are observed consistently across the top and
bottom quartiles, without statistical differences with the rest of the sample. This suggests that
gains in this other dimension are shared broadly irrespective of the magnitude of impacts on
earnings.

Overall, Table 6 confirms that, in the short run, the program benefits a more vulnerable group
by offering a wage employment opportunity and raising earnings and attract less vulnerable
people for which impacts are much more limited. At the same time, impacts on savings open
the possibility that these better-off individuals might have opportunities to make productive
investments and improve their employment prospects after the program.

Table 7 investigates post-program impacts on a range of outcomes, including employment,
earnings, well-being and productive investments. Table 7 displays how post-program impacts
vary in the top quartile of the predicted short-term impacts compared to the rest of the
population (Panel A), and similarly for the bottom quartile (Panel B). Overall, little
heterogeneity in employment and earnings is observed. One exception is that individuals in the
bottom quartile – who had higher baseline level of savings, and saved a higher fraction of their
income during the program – are marginally more likely to be self-employed in the long run (+
7 pp, column (3)). Results also suggest that they made larger investments in independent
activities either by starting new activities requiring a higher amount of capital to start (column
(9)), or by investing in productive assets (column (10)). Although the differences are not
statistically significant, partly due to large standard errors, the point estimates suggest that the
program nearly doubled the value of productive assets (in independent business) for this
specific group, and in comparison other applicants invested twice less. One caveat is that some
of the differences between this group and the rest of the sample are statistically weak. The last
column indicates that a substantial share of these independent activities are “new” businesses




forest searches for more complex relationships, (ii) quartile indicators are defined on an estimator, which is not
taken into account in the standard errors displayed. The results confirm the visual we had in Figure 2: strong
heterogeneity is detected for the bottom of the distribution, with smaller heterogeneity at the top.

                                                       47
launched after the end of the program, so that impacts on self-employment are not only driven
by pre-existing activities.

Overall, results on post-program impacts reveal limited heterogeneity. Vulnerable individuals
who saw the largest gains in earnings and employment during the program do not enjoy
relatively larger post-program gains. Similarly, better-off individuals who saw smaller gains in
earnings during the program but nevertheless managed to mobilize substantial savings do not
see post-program impacts on earnings, despite signs that they are more likely to be self-
employed in slightly expanded activities. Little heterogeneity on impacts on well-being are
observed either.



6.3. Alternative Targeting Rules



The analysis in this section so far suggests the possibility of targeting the program in alternative
ways that would improve contemporaneous program impacts or post-program impacts on
income, but also highlights some trade-offs between these two objectives. It is also clear that
the targeting rules that would emerge from machine learning approaches would be too
complicated and expensive to implement, relying on information that is not easily observable
or verifiable and involving complex functions based on this information, and hence of limited
practical relevance. An important follow-up policy question is therefore whether there are
simple targeting rules, or simple changes to the self-targeting procedure, that could be
implemented and come close to achieving the predicted impacts in the upper quartiles of the
distribution in Table 4 column (1) of Panel (B) (contemporaneous program impacts) and
column (2) of Panel C (post-program impacts). We address this question in Table 8. In
particular, Table 8 presents average contemporaneous program impacts on income (upper
panel) and post-program impacts on income (lower panel) for specific sub-populations. For
reference, the first column displays averages of predicted impact on income over the whole
sample of participants. Similarly, columns (1A) and (1B) report averages of the causal forest
predictions of impacts on income over the top quartile and bottom quartile of the distribution.

One of the findings from Table 5 was the greater relative representation of women in the subset
of the population that benefit the most during the program. What if only women had been able
to apply for the program? Column (3) in Table 8 shows that such a change to the program


                                                48
participation rule would improve impacts both during and after the program. In particular,
average impacts on income during (after) the program would be FCFA 37,150 (FCFA 8,258)
if the randomized assignment had been restricted to female applicants. This corresponds to a
77% improvement in average estimated impacts on during-program income and a 46%
improvement in post-program impacts compared to randomized assignment of both men and
women. The point estimates are not statistically different from the machine learning benchmark.

As we discussed above, one of the reasons why self-targeting might have led many non-poor to
apply to the program is that the wage was set at the statutory minimum wage, well above hourly
rate for many in the informal sector. What if access to the program had been randomized among
those, men and women, willing to participate at a lower wage rate? We can, albeit imperfectly,
explore this question. Indeed, our endline survey asks participants whether they would have
participated in the workfare program for a FCFA 1,500 (daily) salary instead of the offered
FCFA 2,500. While it is clearly suboptimal to study heterogeneity of effects based on a variable
measured at endline, we note that identical proportions in treatment and control groups agreed
to the idea of participating at the lower wage. So, while it is somewhat speculative to run
heterogeneity analysis based on such a characteristic, it remains interesting to consider because
self-selection is central to workfare programs61. Results are displayed in column (2) of the table.
We see that here again there is a substantial improvements in both contemporaneous and post-
program impacts. Average impacts would have reached FCFA 32,076 at midline and FCFA
8,121 at endline if a random sample of only those willing to work for FCFA 1,500 had been
selected. Here again, the point estimates are not statistically different from the machine learning
benchmark.

Importantly, we should note though that this is not what the effect of a workfare program paying
FCFA 1,500 would have given. Indeed, these are the earnings impacts, during and after the
program, among those willing to participate at FCFA 1,500 but actually being paid FCFA 2,500.
Hence, while self-selection would have been better (with lower foregone earnings) had the wage
paid to program participants been set below the minimum wage, the value of the program for
the participants, at this lower wage, would have been reduced. In other words, while lowering
the offered wage improves the self-targeting, it also reduces the transfers, and hence program
benefits, to this better targeted group. This is one of the key tradeoff embedded in the self-

61
   We implemented some robustness checks by examining results not based on the endline binary variable but
on a prediction of this variable, using baseline covariates. The (linear) prediction model is estimated on the
control group (expecting that their answer to this question is not affected by their treatment status) and
applied to the treatment group. The results are similar.

                                                      49
targeting logic behind workfare programs. If this were a one-shot game, policymakers might
have been able to surprise program applicants expecting a FCFA 1,500 wage with a higher
actual wage and hence mimic the results above. Clearly though, in a realistic repeated game
setting, such a practice would certainly not be sustainable.

While self-targeting may offer the cheapest targeting approach, what about simple targeting
rules based on a few predictors of baseline income? If there is limited churning in the
distribution of income over a period of time as short as the length of this program (6-7 months),
those with the lowest baseline income are likely to have the lowest income at midline absent
program participation. In columns (4) and (5) of Table 8, we experiment with two approaches
to directly target the poor. First, we assess impacts during and after the program among those
that report baseline earnings in the bottom quartile of the distribution (column (4)). Second, we
use the machine learning methods outlined above to predict baseline earnings among program
applicants using a limited set of covariates that are both easily observable and not easily
manipulated, including gender, age, household characteristics and assets. We then assess
program impacts among participants in the lowest quartile of this distribution of predicted
baseline income. This second approach is meant to mimic the proxy means tests that are often
used when targeting safety nets to the poor, and more robust to misreporting than self-reported
income. Columns (4) and (5) show that the midline impacts would match predicted impacts in
the upper quartile of the predicted impacts distribution at midline under either of these targeting
rules. Targeting the 25% with the smallest baseline self-reported income leads to an average
expected impact on income during the program of FCFA 32,695; targeting the poor based on
the 25% lowest predicted income leads to an average expected impact on income during the
program of FCFA 36,822. Targeting based on a proxy test for income leads to estimated post-
program impacts that are roughly comparable to restricting program participation to women,
and not statistically different from the machine learning benchmark.

The previous analysis has shown that the allocation of program slots can be substantially
improved with better self-targeting or targeting rules. The machine learning heterogeneity
analysis suggests that optimal targeting would differ based on the outcome of interest
(contemporaneous or post-program) and that trade-offs will appear. Yet the consideration of
alternative targeting rules suggests no sharp trade-offs. In other words, targeting those that will
benefit the most in one dimension does not lead to targeting those that will benefit the least in
another dimension. Our results in Table 8, with the exception of the result in column (3), are
consistent with this. We can substantially improve impacts during the program through better

                                                50
targeting, at no large costs, in terms of post-program impacts. Furthermore, any of the
alternative targeting rules performs as well as the machine learning benchmark.



7. Cost-effectiveness

The estimated direct economic impacts of the program on youths’ earnings can be used to
perform cost-effectiveness calculations. The total costs per beneficiary for the basic public
works program amounts to FCFA 660,478 ($1321), of which FCFA 354,166 ($708) are direct
transfer to beneficiaries, FCFA 255,189 ($510) are other direct costs (material, team leaders
and supervisors, basic life skills training), and FCFA 51,123 ($102) are indirect management
costs62. For the public works only, the contemporaneous impacts on earnings are estimated at
approximately FCFA 20,900 ($42) and the post-program impacts on earnings at FCFA 4,100
(8.2$) per month.

Table 9 presents the main results from cost-effectiveness calculations. Assuming that the
contemporaneous impacts are constant during the 7 months of the program, and that the
estimated post-program impacts are constant for the 13 months after the end of the program63,
the discounted total impacts on earnings (over 20 months) is estimated at FCFA 206,695 ($42).
The cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention is 3.2, meaning that the average cost per
beneficiary is 3.2 times higher than the average discounted direct impacts on earnings. This
poor cost-effectiveness ratio is not surprising given that the net earnings gains are only 42% of
the average monthly transfer amounts during the program, and that the cost of transfers only



62
   Cost-effectiveness calculations presented in that section are performed for the public works only (without
complementary basic entrepreneurship training or jobs search skills training). The comparisons of relative cost-
effectiveness between scenarios remain similar if considering cost and impacts from the pooled treatment
instead.
63
   We compute a discounted sum of impacts on total earnings from program starts (month 1) up to 13 months
after exit from the program (month 20) which corresponds to the moment when post-program impacts are
measured. This is conservative in the sense that we make no assumptions for what happen after month 20 (or
equivalent to zero-impact assumption). The following assumptions are used for the calculations:
H1 : contemporaneous program impacts F cd 'ef correspond to the impact on earnings at the end of month 4
and this impact is constant (up to a monthly discount factor) over the program period (month 1 to month 7)
H2 : post-program impacts F Y[ correspond to the impact on earnings at the end of month 13 and this impact
is constant (up to a monthly discount factor) from the end of the program (month 8) to the endline survey
(month 20).
H3 : the annual discount rate is equal to 1/	(1 + G), with	G = 10%. Using monthly discount factors, h =
1⁄(1 + G) / ( 	.
Finally, the total discounted impact flow (DIF) is :	j 8 = 	 ∑o
                                                              lp (h
                                                                    lmn
                                                                        ∗ F cd 'ef ) + 	 ∑lp
                                                                                           L
                                                                                             (hlm L ∗ F Y[ ) , with
F cd 'ef (respectively F Y[ ) the contemporaneous (respectively post-program) ITT estimates of monthly total
earnings impact.

                                                        51
represents 54% of overall program costs. To highlight the poor average cost-effectiveness of
the program in another way, the post-program impacts observed after 13 months would need to
be sustained for 22.9 years for the program to be cost-effective based on net earnings gains for
youths.

This cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered a lower-bound as it does not account for
non-economic benefits such as those on psychological well-being or behavior mentioned above,
or other externalities from the program, including the indirect benefits of roads rehabilitation.
Nevertheless, they provide a benchmark to assess the cost-effectiveness of potential program
improvements such as the implementation of alternative targeting mechanisms, in particular if
we consider in a first-order approximation that non-economic benefits and externalities are
similar across these potential improvements.

Table 9 indicates how adjustments in program targeting would strongly improve cost-
effectiveness. In light of the strong observed heterogeneity in impacts (at least during the
program), cost-effectiveness improves strongly across the various targeting approaches
considered. Compared to the benchmark scenario with self-targeting based on the formal
minimum wage, the total discounted total impact on earnings more than double (from FCFA
206,695 to FCFA 418,961, or $413 to $838) under the scenario of selecting youths with low
predicted baseline earnings. Large improvements are also observed under other alternative
selection criteria, including those that proxy self-selection based on a lower wage, target women
only, or target based on self-declared baseline earnings. Overall, the cost-effectiveness ratio
would improve from 3.2 to between 1.6 and 2 based on finer program targeting. The years
needed to sustain post-program impacts for impacts on youths’ earnings to justify investments
in the program would go down from 22.9 to between 3 and 5.5. While the analysis cannot
decisively indicate which targeting scenario would maximize cost-effectiveness given the
confidence intervals around the impact estimates, it does highlight strong improvements in cost-
effectiveness when departing from self-targeting based on the formal minimum wage.



8. Conclusion



The Côte d’Ivoire public works program we have evaluated shares many of the features of other
public works program that have been adopted throughout the developing world in response to
transient negative shocks such as those induced by climatic shocks or episodes of violent

                                               52
conflicts. It provided a few months of employment in road rehabilitation to those willing to
work at the stated wage. Our analysis, relying on a randomized control trial as well as the
collection of rich data before, during and after the program, has allowed us to assess the
effectiveness of these programs in lifting participating youth, both economically and
psychologically.

Results show that program impacts on employment are limited to contemporaneous shifts in
the composition of employment towards the public works wage jobs, with no lasting post-
program impacts on the level or composition of employment. However, participation in the
program does raise earnings and psychological well-being, both during the program but also,
and maybe most importantly, after program completion. Post-program earnings gains are
mainly achieved through more vibrant small-scale entrepreneurial activities, likely boosted by
the additional savings participants were able to secure during the program, but also possibly by
other skills that were developed through the workfare and related complementary training.

However, the program as currently implemented is far from cost-effective when benefits are
measured solely based on the earnings gains of those participating. This is primarily due to the
fairly high indirect cost of implementing public works programs compared to more traditional
welfare programs, but also due to the use of self-selection mechanisms based on the formal
minimum wage. Many of the individuals who apply to participate in the program are already
employed, consistent with the widespread underemployment challenge and limited
unemployment in Sub-Saharan Africa. In an environment where informal employment is
rampant, many of those who already have some form of occupation self-select into a public
works program that offer higher earnings (even by paying the formal minimum wage), as well
as potential non-economic benefits on psychological well-being and behavior. In this context,
the program has very small average impacts on employment or hours worked, leading to large
foregone earnings.

A basic framework to consider self-selection mechanisms shows that a reasonable theoretical
expectation is that the impact on earnings is almost zero for the ‘marginal’ participant, and
equal to the amount of the transfer for those with no outside employment opportunities. In this
context, the distribution of individual impacts over the population is likely to vary substantially.
Consistent with this, we demonstrate, using new methods from machine learning, large
heterogeneity in program impacts during the program, with more modest heterogeneity after
the program. In fact, heterogeneity in program impacts on earnings during the program are so
large that they suggest that improvements in targeting is a first-order program design question,
                                                53
and perhaps a more critical issue than other program design aspects such as those related to
program content like the value-added of complementary skills training.

Results from machine learning techniques suggest potential trade-offs between maximizing
contemporaneous and post-program benefits. Yet traditional heterogeneity analysis shows that
a range of practical targeting mechanisms perform as well as the machine learning benchmark,
leading to stronger contemporaneous and post-program benefits without sharp trade-offs. This
implies that cost-effectiveness could be boosted by departing from self-targeting based on the
formal minimum wage. Indeed, we show that a range of potential self-targeting or targeting
rules, which could be implemented at minimum additional costs, could substantially raise cost-
effectiveness as measured solely based on earnings’ gain. Still, even with this improved
targeting, post-program impacts would still need to be sustained for at least 3 years for the
program to be cost-effective based on participants’ earnings gains alone.

Does it mean that public works program are not worth it? While our results so far could be
interpreted that way, this is under the important caveat that the cost-effectiveness ratios we
currently estimate are based on participants’ earning alone, with zero impacts on earnings
assumed beyond 13 months after the program. The cost-effectiveness calculations are also
conservative as they do not include other social benefits of the public works program, such as
the value of the new or upgraded infrastructure or the reduction of negative externalities (for
example, incapacitation effects leading to reduction in crime or illegal activities) the program
may have generated. These additional benefits are viewed as one of the advantage of workfare
programs compared to traditional welfare, although they are rarely formally evaluated.
Accounting for such externalities, a public works program with improved targeting may well
become cost-effective. It may be particularly socially or politically desirable if social planners
put a high weight on externalities and non-economic social benefits related to social cohesion
relative to direct economic benefits. In future work, we will attempt to provide a back-of-the
envelope calculation as to how much these additional benefits might need to be to justify public
works from a cost-benefit perspective.
