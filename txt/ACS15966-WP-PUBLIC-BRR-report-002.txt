          to disadvantaged populations. For example,
          Cerro Norte in Bogota, Colombia, developed
          mostly as an informal settlement in the 1970s.
          Subsequently, in the 1980s, politicians lobbied for
          large-scale regularization programs in exchange for
          votes, although most of the area was considered
          vulnerable to floods and landslides.61

          This report focuses on the third of the three types
          of corruption identified above.

          Consistent sources of data point to the nature and
          the depth of overwhelming corruption in building
          controls. The World Bank Enterprise Survey shows
          that over 30 percent of firms in South Asia and the
          Middle East are expected to give gifts in exchange
          for construction permits. In countries such as
          India, Ukraine, and Yemen, these rates hover in the
          60 to 80 percent range.62

          The 2008 Business Environment and Enterprise
          Performance Survey (BEEPS) covered almost
          12,000 firms in 29 transition economies in
          southeastern Europe and Central Asia.63
           The survey suggests that of all administrative
          transactions, construction permitting is the
          regulatory area most prone to corruption—more
          so than meeting with tax inspectors, obtaining an
          import license, or applying for a water connection.

          Corruption in building code enforcement is
          associated with some of the worst possible
          disasters. Before the 1999 earthquake in Turkey
          that killed 17,000 people, 65 percent of apartment
          blocks in Istanbul and other cities had been built in
          violation of local housing codes. These structures
          were built by contractors who skipped soil tests,
          built extra floors, and ignored specific seismic
          requirements. Turkey had a building code with
          sophisticated earthquake-resistant provisions
          prior to the earthquake. This failure was first and
          foremost a collapse of the code implementation
          system. It was partly enabled by widespread petty
          corruption that incentivized building inspectors

     This is true, in particular, of fire safety inspections.
     Over 40 percent of businesses in Ukraine are
     inspected per year, with two visits on average.
     The most regularly updated indicator relating
     to safety of buildings is fire safety, and the
     aforementioned countries are covered by the
     international statistical compendium compiled
     by the International Association of Fire and
     Rescue Services (CTIF). All rate particularly
     badly in terms of fire-related deaths per 100,000

     in Moldova, as compared to an average of less
     than 1 in 100,000 for most OECD countries.68
      This data illustrates how countries with very
     intrusive regulatory systems can still end up with
     disappointing records on safety.69

     ensure building safety is the system of technical

2.2— Key components of a
building regulatory process
The generic components of a building regulatory
regime described above are essential to the
reduction of disaster and chronic risk in the built
environment. In many low-income countries,
these core components do not exist or are highly
dysfunctional. In many middle-income countries,
these components may formally exist but remain
inefficient and ineffective. As a result, risk
continues to expand through unsafe construction
on unsafe sites.

The specific configuration and location of
these components as well as the distribution
of responsibility between national and local
government and the private sector will vary from
country to country. In middle-income countries,
the institutions of the regulatory ecology may exist
but may not adequately support a robust regulatory
function. In low-income countries, the institutions
of the regulatory ecology may be absent or
largely dysfunctional.


Legal and administrative capacity
The legislative foundation for a building and
land use framework is typically established at
the national level. Most countries have basic
laws that establish public responsibility to both
regulate buildings and establish principles for local
implementation and enforcement.

Beyond this basic legislation, a robust legal and
administrative component at the national level will
typically include the following elements:

• Comprehensive building codes for engineered
  structures and appropriate guidance on non-
  engineered construction for builders and owners.
• Programs to institutionalize a regulatory
  implementation at the local level, particularly
  in rapidly expanding urban areas. This requires

Finally, building officials need to be adequately
compensated, and the remuneration model for
payment for the services needs to be carefully
considered. This issue is relevant to all countries,
irrespective of their income levels.

A prominent regulatory expert, Kim Lovegrove,
suggests that building officials should not be
remunerated on a competitive free market model.
Given their unique statutory enforcement and
consumer protection role, they should be paid
based on a prescribed remuneration floor (the
lowest acceptable level of pay), which should
be set by the regulator and adequately indexed
(for example, to the CPI if appropriate). This

An effective building regulatory regime begins
with the foundation of national legislation that
establishes rights and responsibilities, including
organizational responsibilities for the core
regulatory process. This foundation must be
properly designed and executed both to support
the organizational structure for development and
maintenance of context-appropriate codes and
standards, and to facilitate code implementation at
municipal and local levels.

The characteristics of successful code development
processes and documents are known. The
major burden of regulatory implementation
and compliance falls at the local level. The
recommendations in this chapter relate to
administrative practice, compliance support,
and procedural justice. They point to education
and training for building professionals and
builders, as well as advisory support to facilitate
code compliance, as a valuable complement to
the normal processes of review, inspection, and
enforcement. Specific recommendations are
directed to the efficient allocation of regulatory
resources to maximize risk reduction—a
process that must take into account the limited

initiation of the Sendai Framework for Action, there
is now an opportunity to reengage in the challenge
of reducing disaster and chronic risk in low- and
middle-income countries. This new effort is
armed with extensive experience and innovative
approaches. Focused attention on the building
and land use regulatory capacity of disaster-prone
countries and municipalities can ensure positive
outcomes. For example, future construction and
urban expansion will take place on safer sites.
Structures will be built to protect population
health and safety, and disaster risk will be reduced.
Building regulation can work as a catalyst to
leverage the total investment in building and
infrastructure toward greater safety and security.

O     ver the past two centuries, effective building and land use regulation have dramatically reduced
      incidences of urban conflagration and epidemic disease. In the developed world, such regulation
has resulted in successful risk reduction and hazard response adaptation. However, disaster risk
reduction strategies for low- and middle-income countries have largely ignored building and land use
regulation. Furthermore, experience has demonstrated that the simple transfer of building codes
from highly developed to developing countries is often counterproductive. A review and analysis
of regulatory experience must be better applied to the creation of regulatory capacity in developing
countries. Knowledge must be appropriately adapted to local conditions and incorporated into methods
of sustainable regulatory implementation.


This publication provides an analysis of available evidence to identify practical measures for increasing
the effectiveness of building code implementation. Focusing on low- and middle-income countries, the
authors argue for increased investment in functional building regulatory and governance systems for
disaster risk reduction, while advocating a practical reform agenda for global collaboration.




The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a global partnership that helps
developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerabilities to natural hazards and adapt
to climate change. Working with over 400 local, national, regional, and international partners, GFDRR
provides grant financing, technical assistance, training and knowledge sharing activities to mainstream
disaster and climate risk management in policies and strategies. Managed by the World Bank, GFDRR is
supported by 34 countries and 9 international organizations.
