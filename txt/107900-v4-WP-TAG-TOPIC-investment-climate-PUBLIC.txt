Communications
A communications strategy builds credibility.
Communications tactics provide the opportunity to
manage public perceptions while building capacity for
transparency and accountability. Successful projects
make specific promises and deliver on them. In FCS, the
role of media in PPD can be controversial. While the
media may promote transparency and accountability,
it may also interfere with the open, frank dialogue
necessary for PPD.

Recommendations
Be cautious branding the platform as a World Bank
Group project through communications tools.
Associating PPD too closely with the Bank Group creates
dependency. Once stakeholders identify PPD as a World
Bank Group service, it is difficult to extricate the Bank
Group and hand the platform over.

Recommendations
To implement a successful transition to local ownership:
•	 Start the project with a clear memorandum of
   understanding that states the period and terms of
   the World Bank Group’s support for PPD, as well as
   the responsibilities of the client in transitioning to
   local ownership.
•	 Find funding as early as possible. National budgets in
   FCS are unpredictable and often in deficit. Conduct a
   thorough consultation with stakeholders and prepare
   a financial plan early in the project. Encourage the
   public and private sectors to acknowledge their
   financial contributions. Other international donors
   and private large companies may also provide
   support.
