1 Introduction
More and more governments are looking to move to a cloud platform. Cloud platforms, when
correctly implemented, can potentially provide greater:
    - flexibility in terms of allocating and managing resources (both computing and
       personnel)
   -    standardization of the overall enterprise architecture, thus simplifying maintenance and
        future application development
   -    opportunities for organizations within governments to share data and applications
   -    opportunities for governments to build up technical skills that can help a country be
        technology competitive on the international stage
Cloud computing has the ability to level the technological playing field and enable countries
with limited infrastructure and digitization to leap frog countries that have a traditional, and
less flexible infrastructure and a large number of large, legacy applications.

While having a cloud platform makes it easier to implement major goals of governments, such
as eGovernance, it is fundamentally a more flexible, on-demand approach to allocating
computing resources. Cloud computing can be a great enabler, but it does not replace needed
strategic initiatives or overcome existing processes and regulations. Cloud computing is a fast
paced, and quickly evolving area of computing. As such, it can be daunting for governments to
implement a true cloud platform, especially as there may be specific and unique concerns
around areas such as data security when using cloud technologies.

The World Bank Cloud Readiness Toolkit was used as the input for this report. The toolkit is
comprised of two assessments, a country assessment and an application and infrastructure
assessment. Each assessment is comprised of a series of questions. The toolkit is designed to
provide a baseline for a country. This baseline shows how ready a government is to implement
a cloud platform, and provides tailored recommendations based on the gaps identified from
completing the assessments. All questions are geared towards the government and the public
sector. As such, the toolkit does not assess cloud providers or skills available in the private
sector.

The country assessment questions cover the following categories:
            Category                                                 Purpose
 General                            Determine the true level of interest in migrating to the cloud and
                                    also the primary benefit that the government hopes to realize.
 Resources                          Determine if the government has the key skills already available or
                                    easily accessible prior to starting a cloud migration.
 Security                           Determine what kind of security is required, including rules around
                                    data retention and security clearances. Perception of security may
                                    also impact public adoption of applications meant for use by the
                                    citizens of a country.
 Regulations                        Determine whether there are regulations in place that would
                                    prevent the migration of some or all government applications to a
                                    public cloud or discourage the creation of local cloud providers.
 Governance of Information          Determine whether existing IT processes and procedures have been
 and Communications                 adapted to a cloud environment. If applications cannot effectively
 Technology (ICT) Systems           utilize a cloud environment, the government will not fully realize the
                                    potential benefits.
 Data                               Determine how secure a government's data is now and whether
                                    there are regulations in place that would prevent the migration of
                                    some or all government data to a public cloud and what the overall
                                    quality of the data currently is.
 Infrastructure                     Determine whether migrating to the cloud may be too much of a
                                    burden on the existing infrastructure.

The application and infrastructure assessment questions cover the following categories:
   Category                                                Description

                  This section covers questions that are not covered in the other categories, such as
 General
                  which department owns the application.

                  This section covers questions that help determine what kind of cloud computing
 Architecture     resources would be needed and how they can be optimized. This category also
                  determines whether the application would benefit from the cloud architecture.

 Operation        This section covers how the application is currently being used and what the potential
 Optimization     boundaries for future growth are based on the current infrastructure.

                  This section covers data security, for example any sensitive data (classified data or
 Security
                  information that can be used to identify individuals) or encryption requirements.


The questions are weighted and scored to produce recommendations that offer a conversation
starter on the current readiness to implement cloud computing. The questions and weights
within the assessment documents can later be updated dynamically to reflect changes in policy
or circumstances, which will update the scores and corresponding recommendations. These
recommendations are only guidelines, and do not replace detailed assessments and planning
that will be needed for a successful cloud migration.

1.1     Contents
The below sections can be found in this report.
1.1.1 What is Cloud Computing?
This report contains a high level overview of cloud. Cloud computing is still a relatively new
concept and one that is rapidly evolving to meet ever changing technological demands and
needs.

1.1.2 Findings and Recommendations
The World Bank Cloud Readiness Toolkit was piloted in three countries in order to test the
toolkit as thoroughly as possible, and then refine the toolkit based on lessons learned. The
findings from all three pilots as well as lessons learned are found in this section. Findings
include a recommended deployment model and high level roadmap.

1.1.3 Assumptions
This section briefly discusses the assumptions that were incorporated into the toolkit

1.1.4 Public Cloud Vendor Comparison
Vendor selection can be one of the most challenging parts of migrating to the cloud. The
number of vendors and their various attributes can be overwhelming. In addition, vendors
frequently do not provide the same metrics and attributes making comparisons even more
challenging. This section compares two of the largest public cloud vendors in terms of size,
global reach, and variety of offerings. This section is intended to provide a guideline for vendor
comparisons that governments may undertake.

This report will not:
    - Replace an in depth assessment or business case
   -    Provide steps for building a private data center or selecting a public cloud provider
   -    Provide estimates for migrating to the cloud
   -    Provide guidance on budgeting for migrating to the cloud
   -    Recommend a specific cloud provider
   -    Assess cloud providers
   -    Assess skills and offerings available in the private sector
   -    Recommend a service model


2 What is Cloud Computing?
According to the National Institution of Standards and Technology, cloud computing is a model
for enabling ever present, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources (i.e., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services)
that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service

provider interaction (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). In other words, cloud computing
can also be referred to as on-demand computing. It is a way for users to get continual access to
shared computing resources, such as servers, storage, and sometimes services, as needed.

2.1 Essential Characteristics
There are five essential characteristics that define the cloud, as shown in the schematic below.




2.1.1 Resource Pooling
The cloud provider pools all computing resources to serve multiple customers (U.S. Department
of Commerce, 2011). These customers can be both external, in the case of a public cloud
provider, who might be serving multiple organizations, or internal, in the case of a private data
center which may be serving multiple departments. The pooled computing resources are
assigned as and when needed, but released and reassigned for other purposes when not being
used. Instead of the traditional approach of allocating a single server or amount of space to an
application, computing resources are dynamically allocated as needed. This optimization of the
infrastructure typically reduces overall infrastructure costs and limits risks such as server
failure.

However, the downside to resource pooling is that you have multiple users, groups, or
organizations using the same computing resources. This concurrent use of shared computing
resources by multiple users, also known as tenants, is referred to as multitenancy. As part of
multitenancy, applications still need to be isolated from each other so that problems in one

                                                                                                       Page 8 of 82

application do not affect others. In addition, access to one application does not mean access is
provided to other applications using the same computing resources.

2.1.2 On-Demand Self-Service
Cloud services are provided on request (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). Users can
request computing resources, such as server time and network storage, as needed,
automatically, without requiring human interaction with the service provider. This automation
is generally considered more efficient and less error-prone than traditional provisioning
processes where requests must be submitted and servers manually set up and configured. The
downside is that individuals may request resources whenever they need them, but may not
release them when they no longer need them. Automated tools can help with this as well.

2.1.3 Rapid Elasticity
Computing resources can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically,
enabling applications to scale rapidly in line with demand. The computing resources available
for provisioning may be requested in any quantity at any time. This enables more effective
utilization of the available infrastructure (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). To better
understand this concept, it helps to understand what it means for an application to scale.

An application can scale either vertically or horizontally. Vertically means the existing
application instance is using more of a specific resource, horizontally means adding additional
instances of an application or nodes. An example of scaling horizontally would be going from
one web server to three and an example of scaling vertically would be going from 4 GB of
memory to 16GB.




Traditionally, computing resources have been allocated with additional contingency in case it is
needed. Elasticity refers to the ability for a platform to be dynamic and adaptable as opposed
to static. A cloud platform is elastic and can adapt to increasing and decreasing utilization by
rapidly expanding and shrinking computing capacity for a given application or application
service. In the diagram below the overall application infrastructure that is used is significantly
less in the elastic, cloud based approach.

                                          Elastic (Cloud) Approach




2.1.4 Broad Network Access
Computing resources are available over the network and accessed through standard devices
such as computers or mobile phones (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It is important to
keep in mind how a cloud will be reached and what the network availability and bandwidth
capacity is before choosing a particular cloud solution.

2.1.5 Measured Service
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by tracking usage at a level
appropriate to the type of service (i.e., storage, processing, network bandwidth, or active user
accounts) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). Payment for these services are based on this
usage. This is also known as “pay per use”.

2.2 Service Models
There are three service models in cloud computing: (i) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), (ii)
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and (iii) Software as a Service (SaaS).




2.2.1 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a Service provides the capability to request (or provision) processing, storage,
network, and other fundamental computing resources; the requester is able to deploy and run
operating systems and applications (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The requester does
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating
systems, storage, and deployed applications; and limited or no control of the networking
components (i.e. host firewalls).




2.2.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service provides the capability to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure, user-
created or owned applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and
tools supported by the provider (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The requester does
not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration

settings for the application-hosting environment. If an application currently resides on an
unsupported operating system i.e. UNIX, the application will need to be updated to run on a
supported operating system i.e. Linux or take advantage of an IaaS offering where any
operating system can be installed.




2.2.3 Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a Service provides the capability to use the provider’s applications running on a
cloud infrastructure (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). The applications are accessible
from various user devices through either an interface, such as a web browser (i.e., web-based
email), or a program interface (i.e. Office 365). The requester does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage.
Individual applications cannot be altered but there may be user configuration settings that can
be adjusted.

2.3 Deployment Models
There are four deployment models to choose from when considering migrating to the cloud.




To understand when to use a particular deployment model as the preferred choice, the models
have been compared across five categories – Security, Reliability, Flexibility, Cost, and Vendor
Lock-in (degree of difficulty to migrate to a different model if needed in the future). These
comparisons are primarily for legacy applications. For each category there is a description and
a general score. The score is in relation to the other models.

The table below describes the scoring used in this section.

2.3.1 Private Cloud
A private cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
comprising multiple users (i.e. departments). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the
organization, a third party, or some combination, and it may exist on or off the premises.

 Category                                    Description                                             Benefit?
               Private clouds are typically more secure than alternatives as the
 Security      servers are controlled and no other organization has access to                            
               them (Pham, 2011).
               Depending upon the infrastructure within a country, a private
               cloud, especially if there is a direct line connecting the cloud to
               the government buildings, may be more reliable than alternatives.
 Reliability   For example, if the Internet is frequently slow or unavailable                            

               internet the primary method of reaching key applications may
               impact day to day business activities.
               A private cloud can be geared towards a particular government’s
 Flexibility   needs. It can be built based on the specific requirements that an                         

               party vendor.
               Once an application is virtualized, it is much easier to move from
               platform to platform. However, a specific virtualization software
 Vendor

               must be selected when creating a private cloud. This will create a                         -
               certain amount of lock-in to a specific vendor, but not significantly
               more or less than any other cloud option.

2.3.2 Public Cloud
A public cloud infrastructure is provisioned for use by any organization that wishes to pay for
computing resources (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It may be owned, managed, and
operated by a business or outside organization. The infrastructure exists on the premises of the
cloud provider rather than the users.

For the purposes of this toolkit, there is also a deployment model called local public cloud. This
term applies to a local public cloud provider whose premises are within the country’s borders.
This may be the only option if a government has strict laws or policies around the storage and
transport of data.

               While there are companies that specialize in enabling users to
               move from one cloud platform to another, it does require effort.
               In addition, once the government gets rid of hardware or

               difficult to move all applications back to government data
               centers without investing time and money. Thus, going with a
               public cloud provider results in a certain level of vendor lock-in.

2.3.3 Community Cloud
The community cloud is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers
from organizations that have shared concerns (i.e., mission, security requirements, policy, and
compliance considerations) (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011). It may be owned, managed,
and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some
combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Community clouds are frequently
used by government or educational institutions that consist of a number of different entities
(i.e. departments or colleges).

Community cloud is a form of private cloud with multiple tenants where all of the tenants are
part of the same parent organization. For the purposes of this toolkit, if multiple departments
or ministries decide to utilize the same private cloud then private cloud and community cloud
are equivalent. For example, if both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense want
to use the same private cloud, but the Ministry of Defense does not want employees from the
Ministry of Finance to have access to the defense data, then you have a private cloud with two
tenants. This is now a community cloud. The addition of another tenant does impact the
security and flexibility of the offering in relation to a private cloud that is dedicated to a single
tenant. A private cloud with multiple tenants must be able to offer the technical architectures
both need. For example, if the Ministry of Finance has primarily .Net applications running on
Windows servers and the Ministry of Defense has primarily Java applications running on Red

needs to be in place to ensure that access is restricted to the appropriate individuals. This is
especially true if any database consolidation takes place.

               Typically all the organizations sharing a community cloud have
               similar types of data and restrictions. It also enables the
 Security      organizations to combine their skilled employees. However, the                             -
               more individuals with access to the cloud from other agencies or
               departments, the greater the risk of an external attack.

               A community cloud can be geared towards a particular group’s
               needs. However, if a large amount of variety is seen in terms of
 Flexibility
               architecture and technologies across the community, some limits                            -
               and standardization may be required.
               Cost is greatly dependent upon whether the community cloud is
               owned by a member of the community or a third party. Also, if a
 Cost          large amount of effort is required to standardize the platform and                        
               applications across the organizations the upfront cost will be
               higher.

               more or less than any other cloud option.

2.3.4 Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud infrastructure consists of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private,
community, or public) that remain separate, but are bound together by standardized or
proprietary technology which enables data and application portability (U.S. Department of
Commerce, 2011). A hybrid cloud is almost always a combination of public and private and is
the combination considered in this section. The most common scenario is a predominantly
private cloud that “borrows” computing resources from a public cloud when it experiences
spikes in data. One example is taxes. Most people submit their taxes within a one month
period of time. During the rest of the year there is minimal use of those tax applications.
Revenue agencies must have enough computing resources to handle the peak demand before
taxes are due. In a hybrid environment, that additional demand is handled by public cloud
computing resources. This enables the agency to not have to maintain all those additional
computing resources on a day to day basis.

               A hybrid approach can combine the strengths of both models,
 Security      allowing the government to keep data under tighter control, but                           

               Since the public cloud is only used when needed, infrastructure
               issues will be minimized.
               If applications are also using public cloud computing resources,
               they typically must be compatible with the public cloud. Since
               public cloud providers may limit the operating systems or
 Flexibility
               databases that they provide, a hybrid approach may require that                            -
               applications be upgraded to a more recent version of some
               components before being able to use the public cloud.
               Future setup and maintenance costs will be lower than with a
               purely private cloud approach, since excess capacity will be freed
               up. Rather than keep computing resources on hand to deal with
               peak demand, that additional demand will now spill over to the
 Cost
               public cloud enabling temporary increases in capacity (Savvas,                             -
               2014). However, setting up the hybrid cloud requires expertise in
               integration and standardization, which can be expensive in the
               beginning.
               Private clouds still require virtualization software. Moving
               applications from one software to another is difficult and can be

               costly so the government could be "locked-in" to the vendor of                            
               whatever software is chosen. Changing the public provider once a
               hybrid solution is setup can also be challenging.

It should be noted that not all organizations should move to the cloud. Before selecting a
deployment model, an organization first needs to consider the benefits and risks of moving to
the cloud in the first place.

2.4 Benefits
Cloud computing has opened up new possibilities and enables numerous potential benefits,
including significant cost savings, faster innovation, and greater flexibility. The following are the
common benefits gained from cloud system implementation.

2.4.1 Faster Development of Applications
Cloud computing allows applications to be created and implemented faster. For many
governments and organizations it can take weeks, if not longer, to order new servers, set them
up, and then build a new application. A cloud system would enable computing resources to be
available within hours instead of weeks (Rodier, 2011).

2.4.2 Cost Saving
Infrastructure is expensive to purchase, to operate and to maintain. Cloud services are typically
pay as you go, or “on-demand”, which allows end-users to utilize computing resources as
needed. It maximizes the utilization of computing resources and reduces the operation and
maintenance costs especially during non-peak times. Cost savings are impacted by current IT
expenditure, current hardware life cycles, and which deployment model is chosen.

2.4.3 Improve Operations (Agility and Scalability)
Limited computing resources can prevent applications from running as quickly as they could or
from running at all if the resources are needed for other applications. For example, a
government has a processor intensive census program that runs once every ten years and runs
on the same server as an application that shows who is eligible to vote. It may not be possible
to generate a list of voters and process the census results at the same time. The cloud can help
by automatically supplying additional computing resources during heavy system use.

Growth can also exceed a system’s capabilities. Perhaps in the past most citizens went to their
local government office to apply for benefits or get a driver’s license, but with the growth of
mobile phones, they can now reach these applications online. This sudden spike of usage may
require more processing power than was originally planned for or purchased. Without the
cloud, such a spike of usage might cause the system to crash or become inaccessible. With the
cloud, additional computing resources are added as needed and removed when no longer
required. (Microsoft, 2011)

2.4.4 Disaster Recovery and High Availability
Many public cloud service providers have data centers located in multiple locations. This
provides a failover location in the event that the primary location becomes unavailable due to a
security event, natural disaster, or human error. This capability keeps the government
operating seamlessly.

Cloud Readiness Toolkit Country Report



2.4.5 Modernization
Many governments have servers with a variety of software components on them. There may
be multiple versions of Linux or Windows operating systems, the same for different versions of
databases, or even programming languages. Moving to the cloud typically gives governments
the opportunity to standardize their technology architecture across the government or across a
department. This increases the ease of maintenance and the ability to add additional features
and functionality to applications going forward.

2.4.6 Technological Advantage or Competition
Governments have a mandate to provide services to their citizens. As part of pursuing this
mandate, government may consider implementing a cloud strategy. Alternatively, a
government may consider implementing a cloud strategy in order to gain or maintain a
perceived technical advantage. This advantage could be in either the public or private sector.
A government may work to build demand or skills in the area of cloud computing in order to
encourage the development of certain skills or products in the private sector.

2.4.7 Security
Major public cloud service providers have their own security protections against internal and
external threats. They also support top-line security protocols commonly used. While anything
you put on a public server is at higher risk than a computer not connected to an external
network, public cloud service providers have security expertise, operation expertise, and are
typically up to date on the latest security technologies.

Private clouds have a certain level of security, especially if they are directly connected to the
users they serve rather than accessed via the Internet. However, organizations using private
clouds generally have a smaller skilled security team than a public cloud provider would.

2.5 Risks
2.5.1 Cost - No economies of scale
There are economies of scale that come from owning an entire data center. Adding one more
server is cheaper than the first one was. In the cloud, every CPU and GB needed will cost the
same, whether you use 200 or 200 million. Savings are greatest if there are large spikes in
usage that cause storage or servers to sit idle when not in use. In the cloud, you only need to
pay for those additional computing resources when used. This can also make it more
challenging to predict monthly costs. Sudden increase in usage of an application can result in a
sudden jump in costs.

2.5.2 Vendor Lock-In
Whether the decision is to build a private cloud or go to a public cloud, there will be a certain
amount of vendor lock-in. The degree of lock-in varies, particularly when it comes to deciding
to move out of a public cloud. Once you exceed existing computing resources, it is much harder

to leave the cloud. This should be considered if you think you might need to make changes in
the future due to data or other concerns.

2.5.3 Infrastructure
If the network infrastructure is unreliable or is already highly utilized then moving to the cloud
may be too much of a burden on the existing infrastructure. It could cause applications to crash
or be inaccessible. In such situations the network infrastructure must either be upgraded
before considering a move to a public or hybrid cloud or, alternative, a private cloud on a
dedicated line should be considered.


2.6 Migrating Applications
An important step in planning for a cloud implementation is deciding which applications to
move. Not all applications should be moved to the cloud. There are many attributes that are
considered in the application assessment, but some of the most important categories to
consider are structure, dependency, connectivity, and reliability.

2.6.1 Structure
A large, single-tiered legacy application typically isn't a good fit for the cloud. In a single-tier
application the user interface, business logic, and data storage are all located on the same
machine. While these applications are typically the easiest to design, they are also the least
scalable. Efficiencies are gained when an application is scalable and the load can be spread
over several instances. This also helps with disaster recovery as it enables a failure in one part
of the system to be mitigated without affecting other parts of the system.

2.6.2 Dependency
Applications that depend on specific hardware—such as a particular chip set or an external
device such as a fingerprint reader—might not be a good fit for the cloud, unless those
dependencies are specifically addressed. Similarly, if an application depends on an operating
system or set of libraries that cannot be used in the cloud, or cannot be virtualized, that
application should not be moved to the cloud.

2.6.3 Connectivity
Applications that interface with or use computing resources that will not be reachable from the
cloud, including other applications or storage, are typically poor candidates for migration. For
example, if tax data cannot be moved to the cloud, you might not move an application that
accesses the tax data frequently throughout the day. In some situations, these issues can be
resolved with a custom network setup, but how well this works depends on the chosen cloud
environment.

2.6.4 Reliability
Applications by their nature are not perfect, but the more reliable an application is, the longer it
can run before encountering a problem. Applications that are known to be unreliable should be

                                                                                                      Page 20 of 82

reviewed as a possible candidate for rewriting or replacing, since known functionality issues
may become worse when migrating an application to a new platform. Trying to migrate an
unreliable application may not only increase the effort required to perform the migration, but
also fail to achieve the benefits of moving to the cloud.

2.7 Virtualization
2.7.1 Overview
Cloud computing is built upon the ability to virtualize applications, regardless of the
deployment model selected. Understanding virtualization is key to understanding how pricing
works in the cloud. A high level knowledge of this area will enable the creation of more
accurate estimates and thus better, and more cost effective, utilization of cloud computing
resources. It will also assist with the building of a business case around implementing a cloud
computing system.

When researching cloud providers and other various cloud service offerings there will be
frequent references to virtual central processing units (vCPUs) and virtual cores (vCores). These
components differ from their physical counterparts in a manner that is not always very straight
forward. NOTE: Amazon Web Services (AWS) uses the term vCPU whereas Azure uses vCore.
Conceptually, they are the same.

The main goal when virtualizing a server is to be able to run multiple applications on the same
server. Each application has its own space, or virtual machine, on the server. One way to look
at this is to think of a physical server as a house. Each room is a virtual machine and each
member of the family, or application, gets their own room. The software that enables the
creation of these rooms is called a hypervisor. A hypervisor is a piece of software, hardware, or
firmware that creates and runs virtual machines. The hypervisor can either be installed directly
on the server or on top of the operating system running on the server. The following diagram
shows how three applications running on a virtualized server might look, depending on where
the hypervisor is installed.

                                                                                                      Page 21 of 82
Cloud Readiness Toolkit Country Report



Once a hypervisor is installed, either on the host operating system or directly on the server then
the hypervisor manages the physical computing resources (i.e. CPU, memory, etc.) and
allocates computing resources to create virtual machines instances upon user request. The
guest operating system is installed on the virtual machine instance. Applications can then be
installed on the guest operating system and accessed by users.

An increasingly common practice is to take virtualization to the next level and build containers
that can easily be moved from server to server. Instead of rooms, the server now has multiple
houses and each house can be picked up as a single unit and moved somewhere else as
needed. The following diagram shows how container-based virtualization is delivered from a
physical server.




Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers do not have a guest operating system installed,
but it does require that the physical server have a host operating system. The container itself
contains the application in addition to all the components needed for that application and uses
the host operating system. This means there is less wasted computing making for a more
efficient system, and is also easier to move when needed.

2.7.2 Sizing
When taking applications that currently reside on a physical server and moving them to a
virtual machine, it can be challenging to determine how much of various computing resources
(i.e. storage, memory, CPUs, etc.) to assign to the application. The recommended approach is
to determine what your peak utilization of your current resources over a period of time (ideally
12 months). If that is not possible, then request the same cloud computing resources as the
current physical server and monitor the application for the next 12 months to determine
utilization, and refine any budget estimates. Based on computing resource usage, the
computing resources can be scaled either up or down.

2.8 Conclusions
Increasingly, citizens expect that they can complete tasks online rather than going into an office
and waiting in line. In addition, the amount of digital data is growing across the globe and is

Cloud Readiness Toolkit Country Report


expected to continue to do so. The ability to take advantage of this data and use it to help
improve efficiencies within the government and provide better services to citizens is driving
many governments to consider cloud platforms. Cloud has the possibility to enable
government employees to work from anywhere and citizens to get access to information from
their phones or homes. It can enable governments to quickly deploy applications and new
functionality.

While cloud has the power to connect, it also comes with risks. Moving data outside of secure
locations opens it up for attack. This can be especially true if a limited number of employees
with skills in security has led to the development of applications that are particularly
vulnerable. Legacy applications that were not originally designed for the cloud may have to be
updated, a potentially time consuming undertaking.

It should also be noted, that while much focus is placed on the potential cost savings of cloud,
much of those savings are difficult to quantify. Many benefits of cloud enable governments to
avoid costs in the future. For example, the implementation of a scalable infrastructure can
reduce future capacity costs, and faster development of applications reduces development
costs. However, these costs do not reduce the current IT budget, and are sometimes
overlooked (Neville Cannon, 2015).

The preferred deployment model and path to implementation will be different for every
country, and possibly even differ by departments or ministries within the same country. It may
be that an agriculture application can move to the public cloud, but a finance application should
consider a private cloud. Then the government must decide if everyone should use the same
solution or if there should be multiple solutions. A Cloud Readiness Assessment will provide
insight into the current state of a country, and will help provide insight into where a country is
now, and what recommendations there are for the future.


3 Cloud Readiness Toolkit
Many countries that are interested in implementing a cloud platform are either uncertain
where to start or are focused on building a national data center, or equivalent; however, a
government may not be ready to leverage the cloud, even if they have one available. In order
to assist governments with this gap, the World Bank Cloud Readiness Assessment Toolkit
provides a series of questions that determines where a country is in terms of overall readiness,
what deployment model they may wish to pursue based on their current regulatory
environment, and recommendations on how they can better position their government to take
advantage of cloud computing. Once a government is ready to implement a cloud platform, the
application and infrastructure assessment can be used to build out a roadmap both at the
department/ministry level and the application level.

3.1 Country Assessment
The country assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the government’s overall cloud
readiness. By answering the questions around regulation, security, infrastructure, etc. the

assessment identifies gaps in a country’s policies, regulations, or current IT infrastru cture that
would impact a migration to the cloud or prevent a country from fully realizing the potential of
such a migration. Research on government cloud migrations show that countries frequently do
not see the full expected savings or benefits when migrating to the cloud due to gaps in
readiness.

3.1.1 Methodology
The country assessment is broken down into seven key categories. Each category has a
different purpose. Together the entire questionnaire is used to identify key gaps and provide
recommendations and a roadmap for the government to consider.

            Category                                                 Purpose
 General                            Determine the true level of interest in migrating to the cloud and
                                    also the primary benefit that the government hopes to realize.
 Resources                          Determine if the government has the key skills already available or
                                    easily accessible prior to starting a cloud migration.
 Security                           Determine what kind of security is required, including rules around
                                    data retention and security clearances. Perception of security may
                                    also impact public adoption of applications meant for use by the
                                    citizens of a country.
 Regulations                        Determine whether there are regulations in place that would
                                    prevent the migration of some or all government applications to a
                                    public cloud or discourage the creation of local cloud providers.
 Governance of Information          Determine whether existing IT processes and procedures have been
 and Communications                 adapted to a cloud environment. If applications cannot effectively
 Technology (ICT) Systems           utilize a cloud environment, the government will not fully realize the
                                    potential benefits.
 Data                               Determine how secure a government's data is now and whether
                                    there are regulations in place that would prevent the migration of
                                    some or all government data to a public cloud and what the overall
                                    quality of the data currently is.
 Infrastructure                     Determine whether migrating to the cloud may be too much of a
                                    burden on the existing infrastructure.

Each question within a category has its own weight. This weight is based on the impact the
answer has on the overall readiness for cloud. Each category sums up to 100%. The answer
given for a question determines the value allocated to the overall readiness score and to which
cloud deployment model would be the closest fit. The overall readiness score shows where on
the path to readiness the country is and aligns with the type of recommendations. A country
that falls into a "Ready" category shows that they are on the right path to implement cloud,
whereas a score that is in the “Needs Additional Preparation” range, means that a country
needs to make some changes before moving forward with a cloud implementation.

Within the document, on the assessment tab, every category is shown, along with the weight
assigned to each category. Some categories are weighted more heavily than others based on

the impact that category has on overall cloud readiness. For example, Governance of ICT
Systems was weighted more because of the impact on the realization of long term benefits of
cloud. The category weights are default values based on established methodology and
experience, but can be updated to reflect the particular needs and situation of a specific
country.

For many questions, an answer of unknown is an option. However, this option should be
selected as infrequently as possible. Unknowns typically result in an average score. Having a
large number of unknowns might lead to a score that is higher than it should be, thus hiding a
lack of readiness or other areas of weakness. Such a score would thus decrease the overall
value of the resulting recommendations. The more complete the questionnaire, the more
accurate the recommendations and the final score.

3.2 Application and Infrastructure Assessment
The application and infrastructure assessment is a questionnaire used to assess the
government’s overall application landscape. By answering the questions for each application
being considered for a migration to the cloud, and any servers associated with those
applications, the assessment helps determine the fitness, effort and recommended deployment
type.

               Fitness                                 Effort                           Deployment Model

     3.2.1 Methodology
     While the questions are separated into two groups - application and infrastructure, the
     questions within each group are split into four categories – General, Operation Optimization,
     Modernization, and Security. These categories are reflective of the migration drivers that are
     identified in the country assessment.

     on the ‘fitness’ and ‘effort required’ for a cloud migration.

  4 Findings and Recommendations
  As part of the Toolkit development, three countries were selected to pilot the methodology and
  questionnaires – Serbia, the Philippines, and Zambia. These countries were identified and
  selected based on local government interest, geography, and differences across a variety of
  country level statistics, as outlined below. The goal of the pilots was to test the toolkit as
  thoroughly as possible, and then make refinements based on lessons learned.

    4.1 Pilot #1 – Serbia
    4.1.1 Summary
    This report is meant to be a conversation starter, and provide Serbia with a high level overview
    of the assessment findings in addition to recommendations on migrating to a cloud
    platform. The assessment documents are point in time and can be updated dynamically to
    reflect changes in direction and regulation. For example, if regulations around where data can
    be stored are put in place, the corresponding assessment questions can up updated to generate
    revised recommendations and scores. This will enable the toolkit to be utilized throughout the
    process of selecting a deployment model, implementing the model, and digitizing key e-
    Government services. This report does not replace a detailed, or in-depth, assessment which
    should be conducted prior to implementing a cloud platform.

    In Serbia, answers were obtained for all but two questions, one of which was marked as
    unknown. This enabled a more reliable recommendation.

Cloud Readiness Toolkit Country Report


The overall cloud readiness assessment shows that Serbia is a good candidate for cloud.
However, Serbia needs to make sure that a solid technology and infrastructure foundation is in
place before moving forward on the path to cloud. At this time, given the uncertainty
government officials expressed around where data can be hosted the assessment recommends
that Serbia pursue a private cloud option which aligns with Serbia’s allocation of budget to start
construction of a national data center in 2016.

4.1.2 Key Findings
Serbia’s overall readiness score is 59%. This puts Serbia towards the higher end of “Need
Additional Preparation”. Cloud, especially a push towards more e-Services, is considered an
important government initiative both at the highest levels of government and by the citizens.
In fact, cloud is even being discussed as part of the upcoming election. However, there are still
some intermediary steps that Serbia needs to take in order to lay the groundwork for a
successful cloud implementation. Serbia has started taking steps in areas – such as defining
regulations, but there are still gaps in terms of implementation and moving towards greater
interoperability across ministries.

A high risk area identified was that Serbia has no cabinet level ICT organization – in addition,
individuals frequently were unable to identify who should be responsible for any sort of overall
government ICT or cloud strategy. A contributing factor to this is the reorganization that took
place when the current President took office, and many people are anticipating that the
government may be reorganized after the upcoming election.

In addition, while Serbia has made strides to put in place certain forward thinking regulations,
much of that progress is driven not just by Serbia’s desire to move to the cloud, but as part of
the country’s overall goal of joining the European Union. The European Union requires not only
that specific regulations exist, but also encourages a certain amount of interoperability. For
example, if the European Union approves a drug for usage across the EU, at some point the
Ministry of Medicine and Medical Devices will need to be able to incorporate that into the
appropriate government systems.

One of the areas where ministries have started laying the groundwork, but still have further
work to do is disaster recovery. Most ministries were quick to identify disaster recovery as a
reason to adopt the cloud and stated that they had disaster recovery capability, but then noted
that the capability was either within the same building or very close to the original site (i.e. next
door). In 2014 a flood did significant damage, raising this as a significant issue. In addition,
disaster plans, when they existed, had not been tested.

While a cloud implementation might be successful at this stage, in order to get the most out of
the cloud in the long term, Serbia should focus on implementing a government wide cloud
strategy and drive adoption of this strategy as it encourages ministries to move to the new
platform it is building.

 Readiness Score           59%              70%               66%              0%                  0%

The cloud readiness assessment recommends that Serbia should consider pursuing a private
cloud. However, this recommendation was driven by key findings that eliminated public cloud
as an option due to restrictions on where data can be stored. The majority of the responses
said that data, sensitive or non-sensitive data, could not leave the country nor reside on public
servers.

In addition, one other element that drove the deployment model recommendation was a
discussion with the major local cloud provider. During the discussion it was determined that no
disaster recovery was available for the local provider’s cloud offerings. As such, a local public
service provider does not exist as a possible alternative for the government at this time.

Serbia may wish to review whether all applications and types of data needs to have the same
level of security and protection. That may open up the possibility of public cloud for some
subset of data and applications. Also, Serbia should make sure that any private cloud can meet
the security needs of all ministries.

4.1.4 Gaps
There are key individuals within the government acting as advocates for cloud and working to
get funding in order to build a national data center to provide the basis for a government cloud.
This is a key step in the right direction; however, without also focusing on some of the gaps,
such as resources, governance, and interoperability; Serbia will only see part of the benefits
that they could get from a true cloud implementation.

4.1.4.1 Resources
Serbia has limited local resources in either the public or private sector with skills in cloud
migration or security. Turnover is high and skilled IT resources frequently leave the country to
pursue other opportunities. In addition, there are no programs currently offered within the
government that would help build these skills. Most training is done through external vendors
as part of contracts to implement new tools or systems.

In order to address this gap, it is recommended that Serbia review their retention policies to
see if they might be able to reduce turnover within the IT sector. In addition, Serbia might
consider working with Universities or vendors to develop cloud training to use internally.

4.1.4.2 E-Payment
There were some conflicting responses as to whether e-payment was feasible, but the general
consensus was that it was not currently feasible. Some of the barriers seen were around
engaging credit card companies and addressing how fees would be paid. Given Serbia’s goal of
digitizing more and more services, it is recommended that Serbia address the existing gaps in
implementing an e-payment service and roll out this capability across the government.

4.1.4.3 Data Location
Most individuals, when asked, said that data should not leave the country; however, when
asked if there were restrictions preventing data from leaving the country responded no rules
exist. In addition, it was noted that as part of joining the European Union, Serbia will have to
pass regulations allowing data to be stored within other European Union countries. In light of
the EU regulations, Serbia should review their current data policies and determine if they
should be revised or if gaps exist. If gaps are identified, then it is recommended that rules be
formalized to address any gaps and that the government work to increase awareness of any
existing or future rules around data storage.

4.1.4.4 Governance
Serbia’s lowest score was in the area of governance. There are three key re commendations for
Serbia in this area.

4.1.4.4.1 CIO
Serbia has no CIO or equivalent cabinet level IT position. This was called out by almost all
groups interviewed. Without this there is no designated organization both authorized and
responsible for creating and driving a cloud strategy. It is recommended that Serbia create a
CIO or equivalent position after the next election.

4.1.4.4.2 Cloud Strategy
Once a CIO or equivalent position has been created, it is recommended that that individual
should develop a cloud strategy. The strategy should then be distributed to all the ministries in
order to provide direction to future ministry level initiatives.

4.1.4.4.3 Governance of ICT
Another critical gap on the path to cloud is in the area of general governance of ICT. Serbia
simply does not have certain ICT processes, such as disaster recovery. Serbia also has no
technical architecture standards. Implementing technical architecture guidelines would help
provide a standard set of technologies being used across ministries. This will make it easier to
determine what needs to be supported on the new platform and to migrate applications once it
is time to do so.

In addition, for those processes that Serbia does have, such as development life cycle and
application documentation, the processes have not yet been updated to include cloud. It is
important to make sure that these processes are updated and enforced prior to starting a
migration to the cloud. This is key to Serbia getting the greatest benefit out of a cloud platform.

4.1.5 Next Steps
4.1.5.1 Policy Roadmap
Various responses to the questions on the country assessment are associated with a
recommendation. Each recommendation has an associated phase, type, and estimated
duration. These are used to construct a detailed roadmap. How the roadmap will look will vary
based on each country’s priorities and needs. However, a sample roadmap has been
constructed for Serbia based on the recommendations produced for this report. The
recommendations are also outlined in the table following the roadmap. The Digital
Development Partnership (DDP) category that most closely aligns to the recommendation has
also been noted in both the roadmap and the accompanying table.

The recommendations and roadmap have been split into three phases.

Phase one (walk) focuses on the regulatory and technical infrastructure that needs to be
defined before moving to the cloud. This would include defining policies and regulations
around data, hosting, encryption, and technical standards. These items should be completed
prior to moving onto phase two.

Phase two (run) focuses on defining the next level of policies and regulations, such as
evaluating where hard copies of documents are truly needed, what the technical architecture
should look like, data validation rules, as well as implementing the policies and regulations
created in phase one. These policies and regulations will help standardize the overall
environment. A standard environment will make it easier and cheaper to move applications to
the cloud. In addition, during this phase, ministries should start to build interfaces to enable
the sharing of data across applications. This will simplify data collection and governance.

Phase three (fly) focuses on implementing a true cloud platform. Starting with converting
existing manual processes into digital, cloud-based processes and consolidating data centers
into the government cloud. A key to a successful implementation of a cloud platform is getting
buy-in from various ministries. Encouraging ministries to use the data center as a disaster
recovery site might encourage buy-in.

4.1.5.3 Application Roadmap
The Medicines and Medical Devices Agency of Serbia supplied information for six of their
applications, the Ministry of Public Administration and Self-Government and the Environmental
Protection Agency each supplied information for one application. No other application
information was provided. This is a living document and can be updated with additional
information. This additional information can be used to provide more guidance, analysis, and
refined results. Based on the responses from the three Serbian agencies to the assessment, the
recommendation for 7 of the 8 applications aligns with the overall country recommendation -
private cloud. For one application the recommendation is local public.

The value map helps show which applications are the closest fit and will take the least amount
of effort to migrate. None of the Medicines and Medical Agency of Ministry of Public
Administration and Self-Government applications are a strong fit for cloud, but the strongest
candidate to start with is EDMS. NRIZ Reporting, the Environmental Protection Agency
application, would require the most effort to migrate to the cloud. Due to the level of effort,
the Environmental Protection Agency may wish to review NRIZ in further depth to see if it
should be replaced, retired, rewritten, or migrated to the cloud.

When starting to plan the roadmap to migrate applications to the cloud, there are numerous
attributes that need to be taken into account, including, but not limited to:
    - Criticality of the system
   -    Sensitivity of the data
   -    Interfaces
   -    Application dependencies

The below decision tree may help in the creation of an application migration roadmap.




4.2 Pilot #2 – Philippines
4.2.1 Summary
This report is meant to be a conversation starter, and provide the Philippines with a high level
overview of the assessment findings in addition to recommendations on migrating to a cloud
platform. The assessment documents are point in time and can be updated dynamically to
reflect changes in direction and regulation. For example, if regulations around where data can
be stored are put in place, the corresponding assessment questions can up updated to generate
revised recommendations and scores. This will enable the toolkit to be utilized throughout the
process of selecting a deployment model, implementing the model, and digitizing key e-
Government services. This report does not replace a full, in-depth assessment which should be
conducted prior to implementing a cloud platform.

In the Philippines, answers were obtained for all questions in the country assessment, enabling
a more reliable recommendation.

The overall cloud readiness assessment shows that the Philippines is ready to consider
implementing a cloud strategy but requires additional preparation before moving forward. At
this time, there are concerns around where the data can be hosted, but there are no
regulations that outlined the government’s official stance on the matter. As a result, the
assessment recommends that the Philippines pursue a private or hybrid cloud option.

4.2.2 Key Findings
The Philippine’s overall score is 56%. This puts the Philippines towards the middle of “Need
Additional Preparation”. There is a clear interest from the government in cloud computing and
efforts are underway to implement and standardize a government cloud (G-cloud). However,
the Philippines need to make sure that a solid technology and infrastructure foundation is in
place before moving forward on the path to cloud. This technology and infrastructure
foundation needs to be implemented in a controlled, step by step approach, or it will not be
sustainable.

In order to achieve this controlled, step by step approach, the Philippines need to work towards
creating an official chief information officer (CIO) or cabinet-level position for ICT. It is
noteworthy that at the time of the pilot, there was legislation pending Presidential approval to
establish an ICT Department. However, with major elections being held in the next 6 months,
the legislation’s future is uncertain. The Philippines does have the Information and
Communications Technology Office (ICTO) as a de facto CIO which falls under the Department
of Science and Technology, but they are not officially recognized as the Department of ICT (or
equivalent). Through this department, the Philippines are currently developing an overall ICT
strategy. The focus of this strategy is primarily internally driven to improve operations (agility
and scalability) and infrastructure which includes an e-Government master plan and a G-cloud.
This government cloud, located within a centralized data center, would be used to provide
cloud services for individual departments and government agencies, and is currently in the
process of being scaled. The Department of Budget Management (DBM) has placed a
purchasing hold on hardware for individual ministries and agencies which was done to
encourage the use of the G-cloud operated by ICTO and DOST and, long term, prompt the
consolidation and retirement of individual data centers. However, there is no official regulator,
or enforcement agency, for the creation of these ICT policies and plans but the DBM does have
limited enforcement capabilities through budget appropriations which makes policy adoption
difficult.

Despite the existence of the G-cloud, concerns over capacity, performance, and reliability
hinder adoption by departments. Currently, the G-cloud does not have the capacity for a
migration of a department’s data center. The current infrastructure is 200 virtual machines
(VMs) and they plan to increase the number of VMs to 1,000 by July/August 2016. However,
the team received conflicting answers regarding how long it takes to procure a server, which
will impact the G-Cloud’s ability to scale. ICTO informed the team that it takes 1-6 months to
procure a server while other projects and departments stated that it could take 6 months to a
year. The team found that the current procurement process sometimes requires additional
procedures and can be tedious.

In addition, the G-cloud does not provide service level agreements (SLAs) or a disaster recovery
center. It is important to note that drafting a disaster recovery plan is in process but is not
planned to be operational for at least a few years. In addition, the limited public sector
employees with the relevant skills or experience in cloud services (i.e. cloud modernization,
cloud migration and cloud security) further complicates the decision to migrate. This is in part
due to the Philippine government facing high turnover rates, which governments as a whole
often face. Most resources in cloud migration had less than 18 months of experience while
cloud security resources had less than 6 months experience. In both of these fields, the
Philippine government saw approximately a yearly turnover rate of 25-50%. This problem had
been compounded by the fact that ICTO’s original resources came from telecommunications
and were not aligned skill wise with the mandate ICTO was given. In terms of future resource
development, the University of Philippines has virtualization courses, but no cloud-related
courses available. Most of these cloud skills are self-taught through job experience or external
vendors and non-governmental trainings. There is a large number of skilled resources,
especially in the area of cloud migration, available in the general workforce, although retaining
those skills within the government has been challenging. The availability of resources with a
strong background in cloud security is less certain. Several responses indicated this was a
missing skillset in both the private and public sectors.

As a result of the limitations with G-cloud, departments have taken this as an opportunity to
implement their own approach. The assessment found this to be an area of concern as there
are limited governance and policies in place for departments to use as guidelines. This has
security ramifications as most departments have gone with a combination of Microsoft Azure
services and open source products such as Gmail and Google Apps instead of using the G-cloud
in attempts to save costs or circumvent the hardware purchasing freeze. In doing so, the
departments are open to security and privacy issues. For example, there are no government
level encryption standards or any laws or regulations related to digital data hosting.

The Philippines needs to determine whether G-cloud will be able to meet the needs of the
government and what those needs are. As part of making this determination, key performance
indicators need to be identified that can be applied to the G-cloud so that success or failure can
be quantified and measured. The decision to guide all department and government agencies
towards a centralized platform that is not ready yet has resulted in departments moving in one
of three directions – putting projects on hold pending official direction, moving to a different

cloud provider (typically a public cloud provider) despite no clear guidance on security and
regulatory rules, or applying pressure on the G-cloud which isn’t operational. In this sense, the
Philippines has started to “run” prior to “walking”.

4.2.3 Deployment Model Recommendation
The cloud readiness assessment recommends that the Philippines pursue a private or hybrid
cloud. This recommendation is a result of the common response around storing data on public
servers. Most people said classified data or PII (personally identifiable information) could not
reside on a public server which eliminates the public cloud option.

                                          Private                             Public           Local Public
                        Overall                          Hybrid Cloud
                                           Cloud                              Cloud               Cloud
                       Readiness                          Readiness
                                         Readiness                          Readiness           Readiness
 Readiness Score           56%              65%               63%              0%                  0%

However, there are several key decisions that are outstanding and will influence the
deployment model.
   1. Currently, there are no government-wide standards for several key areas, such as
      encryption requirements or data hosting standards. When these standards are
      implemented, will public providers be a viable option and be able to support these
      requirements?
   2. Departments and agencies are hesitant to host classified, confidential, or personally
      identifiable information on public servers which ruled out the public cloud. However,
      there are no regulations around data hosting (i.e. geographic local, multi-tenancy, public
      servers, etc.) enabling departments to decide individually. Would the implementation
      of data hosting and overlapping ICT regulations add any restrictions to which cloud
      provider can be chosen?
   3. There are limited individuals with cloud skills such as security and migration in the public
      sector. Would taking advantage of a public cloud provider help mitigate risk, help
      supplement the existing workforce, or raise security concerns?
   4. At a high level, there is a government preference towards local companies over
      international. If this preference extends to services, are there local cloud providers that
      meet the government’s needs?
   5. Do all applications and types of data need to have the same level of security and
      protection? If not, such a decision may open up the possibility of public cloud for some
      subset of data and applications.
  6.  Can a private cloud meet the security needs of all departments? If not, what is the
      alternative?
   7. Would a public cloud provider want to work with the government? There are
      institutional issues which make working with the government unfavorable for private
      companies that need to be addressed.

 4.2.4 Gaps
Even if the G-cloud was operational and able to meet the service level agreements and capacity
requirements of the various departments, there needs to be clear and defined ICT governance
and security policies and regulations. Without this, there is no basis upon which to build a
cloud strategy. In addition, there was a mindset that “there is no rule preventing us from doing
this” which enable departments to implement their own cloud strategy. As a result, the
Philippines has significant gaps in security and ICT governance that need to be addressed.




4.2.4.1 Security
There are certain security measures in place such as requiring public sector employees to
undergo a clearance process and implement user access and authorization management.
However, there are several additional steps required for a secure environment. The
assessment shows that there are no government encryption requirements. This would include
encryption on data at rest, data in transit or general encryption standards for either a cloud
provider or internal hosting. In addition, there are security concerns around using a cloud
provider as there are no laws or regulations around data hosting or cloud providers, and no
standards around how or when cloud providers are required to discard data. The assessment
recommends that this security foundation is built prior to cloud adoption.

4.2.4.2 Governance of ICT
In addition to the security concerns, there is a lack of governance within ICT systems. The
assessment found that there are no standards around applications (i.e. documentation, coding
standards, development lifecycle, or technical architecture) or disaster recovery. For
application related governance, this raises two concerns. First, when moving applications to a
new environment such as the cloud, it will be more difficult to migrate an application that does
not have documentation that is uniform across the government. In addition, this

documentation would help with the creation of new applications, and standardize the
government’s application and infrastructure inventory. It is strongly recommended that the
Philippines define these standards prior to a cloud implementation through an officially
recognized cabinet level ICT office. This office would be responsible with the ICT vision and
strategy for the county as well as routinely revising the government-level standards.

4.2.5 Next Steps
The toolkit provides preliminary policy recommendations and action plans for future steps, but
does not replace a full, in-depth assessment of the country’s existing regulations, applications
and infrastructure.

An ICT policy and vision should be created as well as updated as required. This should not be a
static list of recommendations. The Philippines’ strategy should be consistently reviewed to
ensure the policies align with international ICT best practices.

4.2.5.1 Policy Roadmap
Various responses to the questions on the country assessment are associated with a
recommendation. Each recommendation has an associated phase, type, and estimated
duration. These are used to construct a detailed roadmap. How the roadmap will look will vary
based on each country’s priorities and needs. However, a sample roadmap has been
constructed for the Philippines based on the recommendations produced for this report. The
recommendations are also outlined in the table following the roadmap. The Digital
Development Partnership (DDP) category that most closely aligns to the recommendation has
also been noted in both the roadmap and the accompanying table.

The recommendations and roadmap have been split into three phases.

Phase one (walk) focuses the regulatory and technical infrastructure standards that need to be
defined before moving to the cloud. This would include defining policies and regulations
around data, hosting, encryption, and technical standards. In addition, to these standards, an
official, cabinet level ICT office should work on defining the government’s ICT vision and
strategy. These items should be completed prior to moving onto phase two.

Phase two (run) focuses on the implementation of the policies and regulations created in phase
one. These policies and regulations will help standardize the Philippine’s environment. This
standardization can be used to help standardize the offerings provided by the ICTO G-cloud.
This would encourage usage, as well as provide guidelines for departments who choose not to
use G-cloud as the security and privacy requirements will be clearly defined.

Phase three (fly) focuses on improving services and offerings. The G-cloud will enable
departments to provision resources as needed. The G-cloud also provides the government the
opportunity to investigate implementing some Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings within the
government. For example, there are several software packages, such as email or ERP, which
could potentially be provided as a service to other departments. In addition, the Philippines
could utilize the G-cloud to turn existing paper based processes into true cloud based offerings.

4.2.5.3 Application Roadmap
The departments of Advanced Science and Technology Institute, Construction Industry
Authority, Department of Science and Technology and the Environmental Management Bureau
each provided data for one application. The Department of Budget and Management provided
data for 14 applications and the Department of Interior and Local Government provided
information for five applications. No other application information was provided. This is a living
document and can be updated with additional information. This additional information can be
used to provide more guidance, analysis, and refined results.

Based on the assessment responses from the six departments, the recommendation aligns with
the overall country recommendation – the majority of the applications are a best fit for private
cloud. For the two applications that are not aligned with the overall country recommendation,
one application is a best fit for local public cloud and the other is a best fit for hybrid cloud.
Hybrid cloud does not differ significantly from the country recommendation. The country
assessment found hybrid cloud and private cloud to be only two points apart, a statistically
insignificant difference. In addition, local public may be feasible depending on decisions made
at the government level. For example, if the government decides to allow this option for
certain types of data and applications, this Department of Budget and Management application
may be a good candidate.

It should be noted that the assessments for the applications in the Construction Industry
Agency was only 70% complete and the infrastructure data for the Department of Interior and
Local Government and the Environment Management Bureau applications was not provided.
As a result, the recommendation for these applications may change if additional data is
provided.

The value map helps show which applications are the closest fit and will take the least amount
of effort to migrate. As the graphic shows, the ERP application for the Advanced Science and
Technology Institute and the CLiRS application for the Construction Industry Agency are the two
closest fits for cloud. The Department of Budget and Management and the Environment
Management Bureau may want to consider alternatives such as replacing the applications
rather than migrate the Document Management System (Department of Budget and
Management) and the Permit Processing (Environment Management Bureau) applications to
the cloud. The Philippines needs to provide direction to the various departments, either
through lifting the hardware freeze or providing guidance on whether a public cloud can be
leveraged.

When starting to plan the roadmap to migrate applications to the cloud, there are numerous
attributes that need to be taken into account, including, but not limited to:
    - Criticality of the system
   -    Sensitivity of the data
   -    Interfaces
   -    Application dependencies

The below decision tree may help in the creation of an application migration roadmap.

4.3 Pilot #3 – Zambia
4.3.1 Summary
This report is meant to be a conversation starter, and provide Zambia with a high level overview
of the assessment findings in addition to recommendations on migrating to a cloud
platform. The assessment documents are point in time and can be updated dynamically to
reflect changes in direction and regulation. For example, if regulations around where data can
be stored are put in place, the corresponding assessment questions can up updated to generate
revised recommendations and scores. This will enable the toolkit to be utilized throughout the
process of selecting a deployment model, implementing the model, and digitizing key e-
Government services. This report does not replace a full, in-depth assessment which should be
conducted prior to implementing a cloud platform.

In Zambia, answers were obtained for all but three questions in the country assessment,
enabling a more reliable recommendation.

The overall cloud readiness assessment shows that Zambia needs to put in place their
underlying infrastructure before moving forward. At this time, given concerns around where
data can be hosted the assessment recommends that Zambia pursue a private cloud option, a
path that is aligned with Zambia’s recent request to the World Bank for assistance to
implement several key ICT initiatives.

4.3.2 Key Findings
Zambia’s overall readiness score is 41%. This puts Zambia at the upper end of “Need
Underlying Infrastructure”. There is strong interest from the highest levels of the government
in implementing the “Smart Zambia” vision as outlined by the President. Cloud computing is
seen, by the government, as a driver of this overall initiative. While interest within the
government is high, there are many key components that are not yet in place. Zambia is taking
the steps to make sure that those pieces are in place as they move forward, thus setting
themselves up for success if they continue on this path and if they can get support and buy-in
from other ministries and departments. A challenge in this area will be enlisting the
cooperation of relevant inter- and intra-government officials.

Zambia has an official, cabinet level ICT organization, the Center of Excellence for E-Governance
and ICT. All CIOs in other ministries report to the Center of Excellence, and major ICT initiatives

must be coordinated with this department. This mandate was further supported by a
memorandum from the President’s office encouraging the “coordination and harmonisation of
information systems” that noted that all ICT personnel fall under the Center of Excellence and
ICT procurement contracts need to be undertaken in consultation with the Center of
Excellence. In addition, when we interviewed other departments, they almost unanimously
identified the Center of Excellence as the organization responsible for driving ICT policy and
direction going forward. This puts Zambia in an excellent position to implement policies and
regulations uniformly and from the top down.

Multiple ministries had not only created a disaster recovery plan, but had partially tested them
by bringing up applications and switching users over to them. In addition, most disaster
recovery sites were a significant distance away, as opposed to being within the same or a
neighboring building.

However, Zambia also has some key infrastructure concerns that are not captured within the
scope of the cloud assessment, but could impact Zambia’s ability to move forward with a
migration to the cloud. 99% of Zambia’s electricity comes from hydro, but Zambia has been in a
drought since 2014. Thus, even though they have the grid and the capacity, they cannot
produce enough electricity to provide power to everyone on the grid. While this may be a
reason to bring servers that need to run 24/7 into one data center, a lack of power complicates
access and availability. Zambia has no clear coordination around the laying of fiber optic cables.
This has led to different companies laying cable in the same spot and a lack of a coordinated
effort to reach many of the rural areas of Zambia. Lastly, the cost of transmitting data outside
the country is much higher than the cost of transmitting data within the country. However,
most usage is cross-border, which means that lines leaving the country are on average utilized
at 60-70% of total capacity. Also, less than 20% of government buildings within the capital city
of Lusaka are connected to the internet. This provides an opportunity to create an exclusive,
government owned and operated network that connects to a central data center; however,
such an initiative would be time intensive and expensive. These infrastructure concerns are
foremost on the government’s mind and are a key component of the request to the World Bank
for ICT funding.

While Zambia has significant preparatory work to do before they are ready to implement a
cloud strategy, they are approaching the problem in a step by step manner that may put them
in a better position in the long run than many countries that appear to be further ahead on the
path to cloud at this point in time.

4.3.3 Deployment Model Recommendation
The cloud readiness assessment recommends that Zambia pursue a private cloud. However,
this recommendation was driven by key assessment findings; primarily concerns around data
leaving the country, which eliminated public cloud as an option. However, at least two groups
were looking into public cloud as an option, so the government should review the current
barriers for public cloud computing and formalize the preferred approach.

The most important part of selecting a cloud approach is determining where data can be
stored. This question has multiple parts. Can data be stored on a public server? Can
government data and applications reside on the same server as non-government data and
applications (multitenancy)? Can data leave the country? If so, all countries or just some?
Does this rule apply to all data, or just a subset of data, perhaps non-sensitive data? All of
these questions need to be formalized so that every ministry handles their data in the same
way.

In Zambia, there was general consensus that data, especially sensitive data, could not leave the
country and it could not reside on public servers. Data could reside in data centers owned and
operated by third parties, but when questioned further, most situations appeared to describe
colocation, where the server was owned or exclusively used by the government, regardless of
where it resided. This finding drove the recommendation that Zambia pursue a private cloud as
a public cloud provider would use public servers that may also be used by non-government
organizations. In addition, a non-local public cloud provider would necessitate the storing of
data outside of Zambia.

Zambia may wish to review whether all applications and types of data needs to have the same
level of security and protection. That may open up the possibility of public cloud for some
subset of data and applications. Also, Zambia should make sure that any private cloud can
meet the security needs of all ministries. It is recommended that the Electronic Communication
Transactions Act (ECTA) be revisited and revised, if necessary, to reflect current needs in data
transmission and storage from a regulatory standpoint - this will improve the overall desirability
and propensity for adopting cloud technologies.

Any changes in regards to data storage might change the cloud deployment recommendation,
and the assessment should be retaken.

4.3.4 Gaps
When discussing cloud with various ministries and organizations, there was strong interest in
what was meant by cloud and what benefits the assessment team thought Zambia might see
from implementing cloud; however, there was also a distinct hesitancy. Individuals would
mention that the underlying infrastructure was not ready. To address this, the government has
requested funding from the World Bank for various projects, and also mentioned plans to
construct a data center that would be the location for the future government cloud.

4.3.4.1 Resources
Zambia has limited to no local resources in either the public or private sector with skills in cloud
migration or security. In addition, there are no programs currently offered at the local
Universities that would bridge this gap in the future. When meeting with the University of
Zambia, it was mentioned that while there is an IT Security degree, there is no cloud
component to that course of study due to lack of teachers with the skill set to cover the
material.

In order to address this gap, it is recommended that Zambia work to incorporate cloud into
existing IT curriculum. There are multiple ways this could be approached, including, but not
limited to, sending faculty to cloud training or working with private companies to get guest
lecturers to cover cloud topics.

4.3.4.2 Security
There are several areas within security that Zambia needs to focus on; specifically security
clearances and e-payment.

4.3.4.2.1 General
From a general security standpoint, Zambia does not require public sector employees to
undergo any sort of security clearance. In addition, Zambia has no encryption requirements at
the government level, although two of the ministries we talked to required that sensitive data
be encrypted in transit. As Zambia moves to digitize more and more processes and data, and
enable citizens to use the internet to request government services it will be critical that basic
security rules be standardized and enforced across the government. It is strongly
recommended that Zambia institute security clearances for all individuals with access to
sensitive data and that they review their encryption requirements.

Cloud Readiness Toolkit Country Report



4.3.4.2.2 E-Payment and PKI
Zambia enables e-payment, but only for taxes. The agreements with the banks and other
components of the e-payment system are specific to the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA). In
addition, the ZRA is currently using the digital certificates supplied by the banks. Given
Zambia’s goal of providing 140 government services electronically, it is recommended that the
Center of Excellence formalize both an e-payment and digital signature process that can be
used across the government and make it available to all ministries.

4.3.4.3 Data Location
While most individuals, when asked, said that data should not leave the country, most people
were uncertain as to whether or not any actual regulations restricted where data could be
stored. Some ministries said no such restrictions existed and others said that ZICTA, the
regulatory agency, mandated that sensitive data not leave Zambia. To address this gap, it is
recommended that if restrictions are in place, then awareness of them should be increased,
and if restrictions are not in place, then they should be formalized and the various ministries
and impacted companies made aware of any restrictions

In addition, it should be noted that despite the strong response we got when specifically asking
if data could leave the country, the vast majority of ministries are in fact using non-government
email addresses, such as Yahoo or Google. This means that data is potentially being sent and
stored on email servers located outside of the country. In light of this discrepancy, it is strongly
recommended that Zambia review this situation and finalize their overall approach. It is also
recommended that Zambia consider migrating to a common email platform across the
government.

4.3.4.4 Governance
3.5.4.4.1 Cloud Strategy
While one of Zambia’s key strengths is that they have a Center of Excellence to coordinate and
align ICT activities across the government, they do not yet have an overall cloud strategy. It is
recommended that they develop a cloud strategy that can be implemented across the
government and provide direction to future ministry level initiatives.

4.3.4.4.2 Governance of ICT
Another critical gap on the path to cloud is in the area of general governance of ICT. Zambia
does not have certain ICT processes in place. Cloud platforms do not support all applications.
Having guidelines and processes in place for application development will make it easier to
determine what needs to be supported on the new platform and to migrate those applications
once it is time to do so. As Zambia works to put processes and guidelines in place, it needs to
make sure that they are sufficient for the groups with the strictest requirements. If necessary,
exceptions can be granted to those groups for which such strict requirements would be too
burdensome. However, the reverse situation, where regulations are too lax for some groups,
may mean that the cloud platform, when it becomes available, will not meet the needs of

everyone. It is recommended that Zambia formalize the following processes at the government
level:
    - Interoperability and interconnectivity between ministries
    - Technical architecture
    - Disaster recovery
    - Application documentation

The first two are particularly crucial to getting the greatest benefit out of a cloud platform over
time.


4.3.5 Next Steps
4.3.5.1 Policy Roadmap
Various responses to the questions on the country assessment are associated with a
recommendation. Each recommendation has an associated phase, type, and estimated
duration. These are used to construct a detailed roadmap. How the roadmap will look will vary
based on each country’s priorities and needs. However, a sample roadmap has been
constructed for Zambia based on the recommendations produced for this report. The
recommendations are also outlined in the table following the roadmap. The Digital
Development Partnership (DDP) category that most closely aligns to the recommendation has
also been noted in both the roadmap and the accompanying table.




The recommendations and roadmap have been split into three phases.

Phase one (walk) focuses the regulatory and technical infrastructure needs to be defined
before moving to the cloud. This would include defining policies and regulations around data,
hosting, encryption, and technical standards. These items should be completed prior to moving
onto phase two.

Phase two (run) focuses on defining the next level of policies and regulations, such as
multitenancy and technical architecture, as well as implementing the policies and regulations
created in phase one. These policies and regulations will help standardize the overall
environment. A standard environment will make it easier and cheaper to move applications to
the cloud. In addition, during this phase, ministries should start to build interfaces to enable
the sharing of data across applications. This will simplify data collection and governance.

Phase three (fly) focuses on implementing a true cloud platform. Starting with converting
existing manual processes into digital, cloud-based processes and consolidating data centers
into the government cloud.

4.3.5.3 Application Roadmap
Zamtel, the government owned infrastructure/telecommunication service provider, supplied
information for 15 of their applications. No other application information was provided. This is
a living document and can be updated with additional information. This additional information
can be used to provide more guidance, analysis, and refined results. Based on Zamtel’s
responses to the assessment, the majority of the applications are a fit for public; however,
there are several applications that are a fit for private. In the case of those applications that are
a fit for public, it is not a viable option at this time unless there are changes to the current data
location rules and regulations and a local public cloud provider who has disaster recovery
located with Zambia.




The value map helps show which applications are the closest fit and will take the least amount
of effort to migrate. For example, Zamtel’s service catalogue application, called Intranet,
requires the least amount of effort and is the closest fit. After that, there are several
applications that are a reasonably good fit for cloud, but will require additional effort to
migrate.

When starting to plan the roadmap to migrate applications to the cloud, there are numerous
attributes that need to be taken into account, including, but not limited to:
    - Criticality of the system
   -    Sensitivity of the data
   -    Interfaces
   -    Application dependencies

The below decision tree may help in the creation of an application migration roadmap.

4.4 Overview of Findings
The three countries that participated in the pilot sound very different on paper:
   - Serbia is just starting to build a central data center and many ministries have their own
       small data centers
   -    The Philippines already has multiple national data centers; however, they handle only a
        fraction of the government’s overall ICT operations
   -    Zambia has less than 20% of their government buildings connected to the internet and
        are just beginning to centralize all ICT activities under the aegis of the data center of the
        Center of Excellence for E-Government and ICT (COEEGICT)
But, the final scores actually find the three countries to be within about 20 points of one
another. This is a significant gap, but not as great as might be expected. This is mostly due to
the fact that the assessment helps identify gaps that exist in the overall infrastructure and
governance framework that could cause future problems. Each country has unique gaps but
also similarities such as a large number of paper processes, limited number of available skilled
resources, and a major upcoming election. This can be seen in the following SWOT analysis.

It should be noted that this report simply recommends next steps for addressing the identified
gaps. In addition to implementing these steps, an in-depth assessment based on the findings

4.4.1 Similarities
Despite the difference in scores, there were some similarities seen in all three countries.

4.4.1.1 Defining Cloud
One of the similarities seen across the pilot countries was that most countries interpreted any
sort of online application or national data center as meaning that they had cloud. While this is
in fact a step towards having a cloud environment, true cloud also has the ability for groups to

request computing resources on demand and be able to handle elastic demand. Neither
attribute had been considered by any of the countries where the toolkit was piloted.

4.4.1.2 Elections
The most unexpected similarity was that all three countries will be having a major election
within the next six months. In all cases, this has led to a certain amount of uncertainty. In two
of the three countries, Serbia and the Philippines, there is legislation pending that would impact
cloud adoption, but they only expect the legislation to be signed if there is a change in
administration.

4.4.1.3 Lack of Governance
In two countries the creation of a cabinet level CIO or similar ICT position is likely to be
determined by the election. The one country that did have a cabinet level CIO position had only
created it within the last three months, and has not had much chance to influence policy at a
government level. This lack of high level leadership from a Government ICT Champion and
direction has likely contributed to the fact that in all three countries, Governance of ICT was the
lowest score. Security and information rules were either not very clear, relatively unknown, or
did not exist at all. As a result departments were wary of making changes.

4.4.1.4 Resources
Skilled resources were lacking in both the public and private sector in all three countries and
turnover amongst those resources with cloud skills was high. In the case of Serbia, when
resources gained skills in the public sector through experience they would frequently leave for
the private sector. The private sector told us that turnover was equally high in the private
sector with individuals leaving the country to pursue other opportunities. In the Philippines
resources also frequently left the public sector to take jobs in the private sector, although they
were not as likely to leave the country. Although the Philippines did have a bill pending that
would increase wages to 80% of market rate. In Zambia, there was a lack of individuals with the
skills and limited opportunities for individuals to gain the skills on their own. When talking with
the University it was mentioned that cloud components had not been added to any of the IT
courses due to a lack of faculty who could teach it. In none of the three countries was there
any sort of formal training to build up the skills within the public sector or a plan to decrease
turnover of skilled IT resources.

3.6.1.5 Paper Processes
All three countries had a large number of paper processes. In some cases, such as Serbia and
the Philippines, there were legal requirements that some documents exist in paper form, in the
case of Zambia some ministries had simply not digitized. For example, the Zambian national ID
program exists only on paper. This provides excellent opportunities for all three countries to be
able to increase efficiencies and improve usability of services by digitizing the processes and
creating interfaces between ministries, agencies, and departments that all need access to the
same data. No additional work to update or modernize applications is necessary if the new
applications are created specifically for use in a cloud environment.

4.4.1.6 Driver
The opportunity to modernize and optimize tie in with what all three countries listed as their
key drivers. In the case of Serbia, they selected “modernization”, in the case of the Philippines
and Zambia they selected “increased agility”. All three mentioned cost savings as a secondary
driver. However, while the driver for all three countries is similar, the underlying focus came
across as very different in the interviews. In the case of Serbia, the key underlying desire is to
automate existing government services. In the case of the Philippines the focus was purely
internal, services for citizens were never mentioned unless prompted and no services had been
specifically identified for automation. In the case of Zambia there is a strong drive to digitize.
In addition, Zambia has identified 140 processes as candidates for automation long term.

4.4.2 Differences
These differences seen in focus and leadership, along with organizational differences in
approaches to rules and regulations had a direct impact on some of the other key differences
seen across the countries.

4.4.2.1 Organizational Approach
How people responded to questions was influenced by each government’s organizational
approach. For example, in both Serbia and Zambia, when individuals were asked whether
things could be done, such as whether data could be stored outside the country, answers
defaulted to “no” if there was no official direction. Activities were viewed as restricted until the
government determined the high level direction. In the Philippines the opposite was true,
individuals assumed that no rule or regulation meant that there was no restriction. In addition,
the Philippines took a more consensus approach, so even if a rule did exist, actual enforcement
of rules was significantly more challenging as without a restriction in place, rules were followed
at a department’s discretion.

4.4.2.2 Data Location and Privacy
There was also a difference in organizational approach in how the countries addressed data
location and privacy. In Serbia, concerns around data leaving the country seemed to be
primarily centered on security and control. If it left the country, who might have access to it?
The Philippines overall seemed indifferent to any concerns around privacy. In fact, one group
said that if the data needed to be secured, it shouldn’t be digitized. In the case of Zambia, a
lack of trust was strongly in evidence. Data stored outside of the country was at the mercy of
another country and they strongly believed that any outside country would go through
Zambia’s data. There was also a lack of trust between ministries, citizens, and the government
that fed into this concern as well. This will make interoperability more challenging in Zambia
versus Serbia or the Philippines.

4.4.2.3 Infrastructure Readiness
The greatest difference between the three countries is in their existing infrastructure. Zambia,
with the greatest infrastructure gap, has less than 20% of all government offices in the capital

city of Lusaka connected to the internet. This is a gap they feel strongly about and are working
to remedy, but it will take time. In Serbia, buildings are connected and a network is in place, so
they are now working to build a data center to start centralizing resources. In the Philippines,
they have a multitude of data centers. There are three central data centers as well as quite a
few data centers in the basements of various departments. Even so, the Philippines lacks
enough capacity to meet demand and all interviews led to the conclusion that without a change
in the procurement process or other large change, the Philippines will struggle to meet the
capacity demands of the ministries for the foreseeable future.

4.4.2.4 Digital Certificates and E-payment
Security, particularly in the area of digital certificates and e-payment, was also an area where
distinct differences in where the countries fell on the path to cloud were seen. Serbia and the
Philippines are the furthest along. Serbia has the capability to issue and track digital certificates
and Serbia also has existing applications that take advantage of the equivalency of e-signatures
to written signatures. However, e-payment was a stumbling block. Ministries have faced
challenges around implementing an e-payment system, although some forms of e-banking are
currently accepted for some applications. The Philippines has issues close to 1,000 digital
certificates and are in the process of testing the use of PKI in their archives and records
management information system. In addition, the Philippines also had a partially, but not fully,
implemented e-payment process. In contrast, in Zambia, there is no process defined for using
digital certificates. The Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA), the only group interviewed that had
looked into digital certificates, were using the digital certificates produced by the banks. So far,
the ZRA is also the only organization with the capability to pay online. This is mostly geared
towards companies however as there are less than 600,000 registered tax payers in a country
of 14 million.

4.4.2.4 Encryption
Encryption is a good example of the overall differences seen in the processes implemented
across the three countries. In the case of Serbia, there are encryption standards and they’ve
been defined by a local mathematician. How well they have been implemented is unknown. In
the Philippines there are no government level encryption standards, so implementation is ad-
hoc. In Zambia encryption is also ad hoc. Amongst those organizations interviewed, only two
ministries require sensitive data to be encrypted during transit and only the University was
encrypting any data at rest. This discrepancy remained relatively consistent across standards
ranging from encryption to application documentation standards and life cycle development.
In all of the pilot countries, the standards that did exist had not been adapted for use in a cloud
environment.

4.4.3 Recommendations
There were several key recommendations for each category (administrative, high level strategy,
data, security, etc.) and phase (walk, run, fly). Those key recommendations have been
compiled into the following table.

4.4.3 Lessons Learned
4.4.3.1 Overall Lessons
Many valuable lessons were learned during the three pilots. The most important was that the
application and infrastructure assessment is a valuable second step to the country assessment
when using the toolkit, as the data needed may not initially be available. Once a country has
decided they wish to pursue cloud, the application and infrastructure assessment can be used
to identify which departments or ministries would be good candidates to start with, and which
applications within those departments or ministries should be looked at first. Overall
departments were reluctant to share application and infrastructure data outside of their
country, but did see the value in the assessment and may incorporate it into future internal
cloud strategic planning initiatives.

The need to emphasize the reusability of the toolkit became apparent. Individuals in all three
countries were very quick to note items that were soon to change. Emphasizing that the toolkit
was a snap shot in time and could be updated as things changed, thus updating the score and
recommendations, helped get more accurate answers during the interviews.

The automated recommendations that are produced by the country assessment were refined
during the presentation of the preliminary findings with the country pilot participants. Given
the number of categories, the recommendations were aligned with phases (walk, run, fly).
Putting recommendations into a more matrix format – broken down by both phase and
category - helped give government officials a sense of how the recommendations in different
categories worked in parallel to build a cloud platform.

Responses to questions were sometimes unexpected. Some questions had more gray areas
within the answers than had been expected and some questions were simply interpreted
completely differently from their original meaning. For example, the toolkit did not originally
account for the fact that an e-payment system might be only partially implemented. In Zambia,
questions around whether there were laws in place around which products could be used
almost always immediately raised questions as to whether that included UN sanctions. This
feedback was used to refine the wording and response options for questions throughout the
questionnaire. Questions where multiple groups gave different answers were always reviewed.
Was the difference in answers due to a difference in knowledge, understanding of the situation,
or interpretation of the question? Any changes in wording when asking questions out loud
were noted and later reviewed to see if the question itself needed to be reworded. This helped
identify questions that required additional information or were not self-explanatory.

In addition, new questions needed to be added based on some unexpected discoveries. For
example, it was not anticipated that there might be laws mandating that some documents exist
in paper form. The importance of an upcoming election on the current situation, a discovery
made in Serbia, also had to be incorporated into the toolkit.

4.4.3.2 Serbia
As Serbia was the first pilot country, some missed question areas were identified as well as
some questions that were not needed. One example was around cost. There was no
knowledge on how much was spent on ICT. The questions around cost were asked as well in
Zambia and the Philippines to see if this gap was consistent and it was. The decision was then
made to remove all questions around cost. It was also discovered in Serbia how important a
cabinet level CIO position was to driving any sort of high level ICT strategy. Questions around
such a position were added during this pilot.

4.4.3.3 Philippines
In the Philippines, distinct differences were seen in how questions were answered. In Serbia,
the default was to answer in regards to how things stood. Answers were always given in
reference to the current state, although explanations might note pending or future changes. In
the Philippines, where there seemed to be less differentiation between future and present
tense, government officials would imply that things were in progress, but follow up questions in
regards to a timeline would show that the activity had not yet been started. To address this
some questions were reworded and additional emphasis was placed on the fact that the
assessment was a snap shot in time. For example, originally questions around procurement did
not focus on timing. Based on feedback that servers could not be procured in a timely manner,
even for the organizations running the main data centers, questions were added.

4.4.3.4 Zambia
In Zambia, the wording of new and existing questions from Serbia and the Philippines was
tested and relatively few changes were required. The main lesson learned was around the

questions for data location. Additional questions around infrastructure were added when
interviews showed that just because a government building is connected to the network, it
doesn’t mean the network will be available.


5 Assumptions
When designing this toolkit certain standard assumptions were made. These same assumptions
were made when translating the assessment results into the final findings and
recommendations. The key assumptions are:
   - The individuals completing the questionnaires were relatively familiar with the areas
      covered and thus the questions are as complete and accurate as possible.
   -    By completing this assessment, it is assumed that there is some interest in identifying
        and resolving any readiness gaps.
   -    The government is already using computerized systems.
   -    The country already has a basic Internet infrastructure, such as copper lines.
   -    The country has a full time IT team.


6 Public Cloud Vendor Comparison
If a government decides to go with a public cloud setup then the next step is to determine
which vendor to select. Vendors usually have multiple offerings, and it can be challenging to
compare vendors. Comparisons are typically further complicated by different vendors using
different terminology and units. It is recommended that, even if deciding to pursue a private
cloud, governments still assess public cloud vendors to determine a baseline of offerings and
service level agreements that they may wish to provide. In order to assist with any future
comparisons governments may undertake, a vendor comparison can be found in this section for
reference.

Azure and Amazon were chosen due to their breadth of services and geographic offerings. This
report is not recommending one vendor over another, but only providing an example of a
vendor assessment to provide guidance to governments on developing vendor requirements
for their own vendor assessments.

Price is a key factor, especially as it can differ per region. Unlike private clouds, public clouds
are not fully customizable. Pricing can vary depending upon the components and services
provided by the public cloud service provider and also how the government utilizes those
computing resources. A rough baseline for public cloud pricing can be found in the tables in
this section.

At this time, there is no data center in Africa for Azure or Amazon, so it is recommended that
African countries consider either using a data center on the European continent or a local cloud
provider. If a local provider is selected, it is recommended the provider be assessed based on
