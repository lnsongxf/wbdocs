                                             Summary
The 2014-2015 Romania Regional Development 2 Program is the continuation of the World Bank’s technical assistance
to the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA). Building on the previous engagement,
the current work addresses a fundamental question: given Romania’s persistent development challenges, how can the
country do more with less when it comes to the public infrastructure it needs? The key is to enhance coordination and
harmonization of different funding sources, particularly infrastructure programs financed from the state budget and
from EU structural funds. The National Local Development Program (PNDL), managed by the MRDPA, is reviewed in
depth, though the conclusions typically hold for all state-budget-funded programs.

This synthesis report summarizes the main findings and recommendations from eight final reports and 24 knowledge
sharing workshops organized in all eight regions in Romania in 2015. Several ”bonus” outputs were also produced, going
beyond the terms of this technical assistance (three investment guides, an applicant guide, and an operational manual).

The sectors covered include: roads (county and local); water and wastewater; social infrastructure (education, health,
culture, and sports); and housing. For each of them, the current work assesses the state of the sector, current gaps, and
opportunities for growth, at three interrelated levels: strategic (what should be done?); program-level (with what sources
of funding?); and project-level (through what specific activities?).

This synthesis report – along with all the outputs it draws from – is meant as a practical tool for policymakers at the
national, regional, and local level. It also seeks to inform a broader audience of private and nongovernmental stakeholders.

                                                         Context
1. Romania today displays a complex picture of great hopes and remarkable development potential, in the context
of persistent challenges in many vital sectors. It is beyond any doubt that the country still has a long way to go in
terms of providing its citizens – all citizens, including the poor and the marginalized – the infrastructure and public
services they need to share and add to the benefits of development. Examples of the many gaps are hard to miss (e.g.,
deficient transport infrastructure, lack of access to water and sanitation in certain rural areas, governance capacity
challenges, etc.), particularly in comparison to the situation in other EU Member States. But it is also true that
Romania has taken key steps forward toward sustainable and inclusive growth. Positive results have been recorded,
particularly in large urban centers, with București surpassing cities like Madrid, Lisbon, and Athens in terms of GDP
per capita (PPP). The data confirm Romania’s growth prospects, but the Government should do more to empower its
citizens to pursue opportunities and maximize productive potential.1

2. Romania’s overall aim is clear: achieve sustainable and inclusive development, accelerating convergence with
the European Union. A first question to answer is what needs to be done to help Romania’s economy grow. The World
Bank’s 2013 ”Competitive Cities” report offers a set of potential answers.2 The first priority is to invest in improved
connectivity and accessibility (both within leading areas and between leading and lagging regions), enabling people to
take advantage of opportunities in Romania and abroad. Second, particularly in lagging areas, the government should
invest in functioning institutions that ensure basic living standards for communities – essentially, the same start in
life for all citizens (including running water, sewage, electricity, good schooling, effective land and housing markets,
healthcare, etc.). Finally, marginalized communities require targeted efforts to address the specific obstacles they
face (e.g., discrimination, exclusion, etc.).

3. If what is to be done is generally known, an equally critical question is how to do it. Specifically, how can Romania
address massive infrastructure needs given the limited resources at its disposal? There are multiple challenges. For
one, even the money that is available in theory is hard to leverage in practice. As of October 31, 2015, with only two
months to spend the structural funds allocated to the 2007-2013 programming period, Romania’s absorption rate
stood at only 58.67% – the lowest in the EU by far. Second, available nonreimbursable funds are simply insufficient:
even if the country was able to absorb 100% of the EU funds going forward, it would still face a funding gap estimated
at over EUR 30 billion through 2020 just to cover investment needs in county and communal roads, water and
wastewater, and social infrastructure.3 In water and wastewater alone the gap exceeds EUR 20 billion, and Romania
could face serious sanctions after 2018 if it does not achieve EU-level targets on coverage and service quality. Third,
limited resources are sometimes poorly and inefficiently deployed. Particularly when relying on funds from the state
budget, investment decisions are rarely taken according to rigorous and transparent selection criteria that would
maximize development impact. Between 2003 and 2013, Romania allocated to capital spending a higher share of its
GDP than any other country in the EU, but continues to lag behind its EU peers in terms of infrastructure quality.

4. In particular, Romania’s housing sector faces special policy, legal, financial and institutional challenges.
Romania’s housing is among the most crowded, dilapidated, expensive, and poorly located of any country in Europe,
and exposes a large number of people to high seismic risk. Many of Romania’s housing problems are the legacy of the
former communist regime. The share of poorly built communist housing is the highest in the region, and most of the
housing stock is essentially in the wrong place: many mono-industry cities were built as part of the ”systemization”
program by which the communist regime determined which locations should grow and which should be eliminated.
Many of these cities are now experiencing severe population decline, following the collapse of the communist-era
industries. The result has been a significant housing ”gap”, and more inadequate and more expensive housing conditions,
which almost certainly adversely affects social inclusion and economic growth. Many of Romania’s middle-income
households are forced to live in housing that is either too expensive to maintain, or inadequate in terms of structural
safety, location, energy efficiency, space, infrastructure, or physical appeal.

The poor are relegated to the worst living conditions in slums and ‘ghettos,’ and in many ways have been neglected
by public policies and programs. Moreover, ownership rights are fragmented, which makes the stock even more
badly allocated. Currently, there are more housing units than the number of households in Romania – some 8 million
dwellings for 7.2 million households.

5. Despite all these challenges, Romania spends only a fraction of the average amount of housing sector
government assistance provided by other middle-income countries. Thus, Romania’s expenditures on the twenty-
two such programs amount to less than $35 million, which, in terms of the share of GDP, is less than the one-third
of that spent by other emerging economies. One goal of this work is to help make adequate housing attainable to all
income groups by 2030.

Box 1. The definition of adequate housing

  ”Adequate Housing” is defined in this report as one that offers:
      −
     −Security  of tenure and protection against forced evictions
      −
     −Safety  in terms of structural stability
      −
     −Equal  and non-discriminatory access to housing for disadvantaged or marginalized communities
      −
     −Affordability: Eurostat defines a household to be financially ‘overburdened’ when total housing + utility costs exceed 40% of
       net income.
      −
     −Availability of services
      −
     −Habitability: Appropriate dwelling units usable by special needs communities such as the elderly, nonconventional family types,
       etc.
      −
     −Suitability of location: Access to job opportunities, and workforce mobility




6. In sum, the message for enhancing Romania’s public infrastructure investments is simple: to address its
development needs with its limited financial resources, the country should pursue an all-out effort to ”do more
with less.” This further requires several elements: clear strategies defining the main priorities in each sector and
across sectors; effective and efficient investment programs, with rigorous selection procedures and criteria; and
projects designed and implemented with the principle of maximizing value for money, regardless of the source of
funding. In addition, there needs to be full coordination across these three levels – strategies, programs, and projects.

            What is this work about?
7. Recognizing the importance of this policy agenda, the Government of Romania (GOR) has asked the World Bank
to support its efforts to harmonize and optimize public infrastructure investments. Under the current technical
assistance, the Bank team has worked with the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA),
building upon several previous engagements: the 2010-2011 Functional Review of the ministry; and the World Bank’s
Regional Development Program in Romania (November 2012-March 2014), which provided recommendations primarily
targeted at EU-funded instruments. The current work seeks to encourage effective coordination among all types of
funding sources for infrastructure investments in: local and county roads; water and wastewater systems; social
infrastructure (education, health, culture, and sports); and housing. The current technical assistance with the MRDPA
includes four components, as summarized in the table below. The main focus of this work is on state-budget-funded
investment programs and projects, whether through the National Local Development Program – PNDL (Components
1, 2, and 3) or through housing-related programs (Component 4).

8. Between November 2014 and November 2015, the Bank team delivered a set of multiple outputs to the
MRDPA. The following is a list of the reports submitted:
    •	 Component 1
       •	 ”Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State-Funded Investments in Romania’s Infrastructure” (March
          2015)
       •	 Harmonization of Selection Criteria for Enhanced Coordination and Prioritization of EU and State-Funded Projects”
          (August 2015)
       •	 Beyond the terms of the agreement, a series of detailed maps has been produced, organized in three investment
          guides for: (i) county roads; (ii) water and wastewater systems; and (iii) local roads and social infrastructure
          (August 2015). These atlases show at the level of each county the current infrastructure and the proposed
          prioritization of future investment projects based on a series of proposed selection procedures and criteria.
    •	 Component 2
       •	 ”Prioritization Criteria for Local Infrastructure Development Projects” (December 2014)
       •	 ”Evaluation of the Portfolio of Regional Development Investment Projects” (August 2015)
       •	 Beyond the terms of the agreement, the team has prepared a practical Beneficiary Guide for all beneficiaries
          considering applying for PNDL financial support for county or communal infrastructure investments.
    •	 Component 3
       •	 ”Efficient and Innovative Designs and Technologies for Public Infrastructure Investments in Romania” (June 2015)

        •	 Beyond the terms of the agreement, the Bank team produced an extensive operational manual for public
           infrastructure investments, covering the full cycle: project planning and preparation; public procurement;
           project implementation (supervision); and the post-implementation phase (December 2015)4
     •	 Component 4
        •	 Housing in Romania: ”Towards a National Housing Strategy,” ”Coordination of State and EU Funds for Housing,” and
           ”Program Prioritization and Projects” (August 2015)
        •	 The first report, ”Towards a National Housing Strategy” is a detailed analysis of the housing situation in
           Romania, and provides a host of recommendations aimed at addressing the gaps in the sector. It aims to
           help establish the foundations for Romania’s forthcoming National Housing Strategy. The solutions – policy,
           legal, institutional, and financial – aim to make the housing market work more effectively through the more
           efficient use of government resources.
        •	 The second report, ”Coordination of State and EU Funds,” complements the main housing sector assessment
           by providing an overview of how public and EU funds have been used in this sector and how the two funding
           sources could better complement each other. In addition to streamlined programming in the housing sector,
           proposed action steps include ways of establishing and funding the proposed National Housing Fund.
        •	 Finally, the third report on ”Program Prioritization and Projects” outlines what should be the priorities in the
           housing sector under a comprehensive Action Plan. Recommendations include streamlining a number of
           housing programs, and discontinuing and reviewing some of the existing ones.

In addition to these outputs, the Bank team also organized a number of knowledge dissemination events, aimed at
collecting feedback from all interested stakeholders. Over 700 participants benefited from these workshops, including:
Regional Development Agencies’ staff, local and county authorities (as applicants/beneficiaries of EU and State-
funded infrastructure programs), regional water operators, civil society groups, private companies (construction,
design, engineering, etc.), and members of the academia. See Annex 2 for the list of workshops, main topics, and a
snapshot of the feedback received.5

9. The purpose of this final synthesis is to communicate the main findings and recommendations corresponding
to all four components of the current technical assistance. This summary is organized as follows: diagnostic (what
are the main challenges?); recommendations (what are the proposed targeted strategies and action steps?); and next
steps (what next?), also serving as a roadmap for tracking progress against the recommendations made through this
work. The diagnostic section also includes a number of updates to the final reports submitted earlier in the process,
reflecting recent legislative and policy reforms undertaken by the MRDPA and the GoR in the context of this work,
particularly with respect to the implementation of the National Local Development Program (PNDL).

                    There are major gaps in the coordination of public infrastructure
    1               investments in Romania, both across administrative levels and across
                    sectors / jurisdictions
10. Coordination refers to the capacity of different stakeholders to work together for achieving specific goals.
There are two reasons to coordinate public infrastructure interventions: to reduce costs and to increase benefits.
For example, if two or more authorities are implementing investment programs that have the same goals and target
the same beneficiaries, they are likely duplicating their efforts and missing out on cost-saving opportunities through
consolidation of operations. The same goes for beneficiaries who, for a variety of reasons, choose to finance their
infrastructure projects through more expensive funding sources (e.g., state budget funds instead of EU structural
funds). By the same token, lack of coordination implies failure to leverage synergies across different investments.
If a new school or hospital gets built, the road connecting to it should also be rehabilitated. If a county finances a
particular county road, the neighboring authorities may want to consider financing a county road that connects to
that investment. Coordination makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts.

11. In truth, the need to coordinate is inescapable in many ways – both vertically (across administrative levels) and
horizontally (across sectors and/or across jurisdictions). Regarding vertical coordination, very few local governments
have the capacity to support the investments they need entirely from their own funds, especially in countries that have
not decentralized fully. Based on prudent capital expenditure margins, more than three in four communes in Romania
can only afford to rehabilitate one road and one school during the 2014-2020 programing cycle.6 Local government
units simply do not have the financial and human resources needed to address the basic infrastructure needs of local
communities, so other actors need to intervene to fill the gaps – regional authorities (in countries where regions have
formal administrative powers, which is not yet the case in Romania), the national government (through a variety of
state-budget-funded programs), or supranational authorities like the European Union. As for horizontal coordination,
very few investments depend on a single sector: roads cross railroads and power lines, wastewater treatment plants
influence the quality of water bodies, schools and hospitals function well only if there is sufficient demand for their
services and hence proper connectivity with people in surrounding areas, etc. The simple but important point is that
proper coordination of public investments is a must in any policy context.

12. This is not to say that coordination is a given – it is challenging, time-consuming, and may require institutions
giving up individual decision-making power in favor of a collective forum of stakeholders. Counties, cities, towns, and
communes across Romania have their own mandates, carry out their own attributions, and deliver their own services
to constituents. Subsidiarity ensures that decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizens. Particularly for
smaller value projects that local authorities can cover from their own budgets, it may not be possible or even desirable
for the national government to influence how such investments are designed and implemented. Even in the case of
the PNDL and other similar programs, central-level stakeholders are in fact financing functions and services that
are in the local domain. It is thus hard for higher-level strategies to translate directly into local and county projects.
They cannot be imposed; instead, special conditions and incentives are needed to make the perceived benefits of
coordination exceed the costs.

13. At the same time, to paraphrase a local saying, Romania is too poor to afford not to coordinate properly.
With resources flowing from the central government and from the EU, rather than from own resources through local
taxation, there has been a tendency to overinvest and invest sub-optimally into objectives that do not always generate
the appropriate economic returns (”cathedrals in the desert”). In Romania, over 80% of the capital spending in the
public sector is done by local authorities (including through EU funds and central government transfers). There is little
coordination across ministries: each key ministry appears to have its own ”investment program,” usually resembling
simple earmarked transfers for capital investments from the central to the local level. The MRDPA manages the
bulk of funding for supporting local-level investments. For its part, the Ministry of Finance has its own role to play in
managing fiscal risks and ensuring that expenses committed to through various investment instruments can indeed
be afforded under national budget constraints.

                                •   Poor quality (lack of objectives, budget, priorities, indicators)

                                      • Lack of clear separation for areas of intervention
                         • Investment programs vs. capital transfer mechanisms (criteria, procedures)

                                           Infrastructure Projects
                • The sequence of projects is poorly designed (delays in rehabilitation of public utility networks)
                        • Missed opportunities of leveraging economies of scale (lack of integrated projects)
                                           • Lack of adequate monitoring and evaluation
14. There is broad consensus – in policy circles and beyond – that there are major gaps in the coordination of
public infrastructure investments in Romania, at all levels. Perhaps the most often cited examples refer to the
inefficient sequencing of investments, whereby a newly rehabilitated road is damaged by subsequent public works
related to the rehabilitation of utility networks. Such situations often result in media articles and public outrage
regarding the inefficient spending of taxpayer money. In effect, this simple example is indicative of the broader
challenge of coordination faced by public authorities in Romania, across all phases of an investment’s cycle: from the
development of a strategy to the design of an investment program to the financing, implementation, and monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) of individual infrastructure projects.

15. First, the cross-sectoral and sectoral strategies that should guide the allocation of scarce public resources
often demonstrate room for improvement. Coordination challenges often originate in the large number of existing
sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies, with overlapping and unclear objectives. There are no clear standards for
developing such documents. Strategies are not easily accessible, so they are hard to refer to and correlate with, and
typically remain broad wish lists, without specifying: clear priorities, budgets, implementation timeline and action
steps, and M&E indicators. There is no institution explicitly mandated to review all available strategies and decide
how they ”fit” together and what their policy and budgetary implications are. Equally important, there are no M&E
procedures for the strategies developed to decide on whether they are needed, whether they are appropriate, and
whether their goals are fulfilled.

16. Second, state-budget-funded investment programs like the PNDL are not always properly designed, and
a systematic effort to coordinate intervention areas is lacking. Typically, state-funded programs have no
strategic document at their foundation and they are not guided by a clear operational framework. Much of the
poor coordination, duplication, and inefficiency can be traced back to the failure to clearly demarcate and synergize
types of interventions between and among EU and state-funded investments. In addition, procedures are more lax
under state-budget programs than those applicable to EU funds (e.g., simpler applications, largely based on technical
                                                                                                                    8

documentation only; quicker disbursement of funds; fewer monitoring visits and audits; etc.). This generates the risk
of crowding out structural instruments, while Romania remains last in EU funds’ absorption (52.59% at the end of
January 2015, with less than one year to go to spend the balance).7

17. Third, the prioritization of state-budget-funded projects relies on financing criteria that remain vague,
subjective, and opaque, and project selection is much less rigorous than under EU structural funds. There is usually
no clear algorithm for deciding among a variety of proposed investments. Moreover, state-budget-funded programs
operate on annual budgets, so there is a lot of instability and priorities may shift from year to year, which discourages
larger and more strategic investment programs. Instead, what happens in practice is that there is a significant and
ever-growing portfolio of new and ongoing investment projects, in various phases. Without a defined budget for a
multiannual implementation period and without a list of investments that, once selected, are guaranteed funding
until completion, prioritization is essentially impossible.

18. Fourth, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms at the level of state-funded programs and projects
are rudimentary. There is no systematic tracking of basic key indicators of a program’s performance (number of
completed projects, value of ongoing projects vs. annual budgetary allocation, number of new projects, etc.) or, if
such data exist, they are not made public. No impact assessments are carried out, so it is impossible to determine if
state-budget-funded projects are reaching their objectives or if they need to be adjusted in terms of design and/or
implementation procedures.

19. On top of everything, the overall environment in Romania is not particularly conducive to coordination, for a
myriad of reasons. There is no solid history of collaboration among public institutions. Coordination happens on an
ad-hoc basis, if at all, and there are few formal requirements for public actors to consult with each other and work
together to accomplish common goals. The infrastructure for sharing information and collaborating efficiently and
effectively (e.g., modern and interoperable IT platforms) is largely missing, which means that coordination takes time.
At the same time, public employees are poorly paid; particularly those involved in the design and implementation of
infrastructure projects are very busy with operational tasks and various emergencies. This leaves even less time for
coordination efforts.




       2             State-budget-funded programs lack strategic focus, rigorous selection
                     criteria, and effective monitoring and evaluation

20. State-budget-funded programs reviewed make no attempt to coordinate among themselves and with other
EU instruments, but rather finance a long list of investments, causing overlaps with other programs. This creates
a competitive dynamic among funds, with state-budget-funded instruments often crowding out EU investments
because they finance the same types of interventions under more flexible rules and monitoring. Moreover, there is no
attempt to leverage synergies across different programs. The diagnostic below focuses on the PNDL, but the findings
hold true for all state-budget-funded investment programs.

21. To begin with, there is no formal strategy specific to the PNDL. At the time of its launch, the PNDL was an
important expression of the new cabinet’s commitment to the development of rural infrastructure, as reflected in
the 2013-2016 Governing Program (as approved by Parliament through Decision 45/2012). For example, one of the
key objectives for Romania’s regional development is defined as the financing of a basic package of services for
rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social infrastructure etc., ”for achieving [at least] minimum
standards of living.”8 The same document further emphasizes the need to prioritize public infrastructure projects
to contribute to Romania’s sustainable, balanced development.9 Other than these broad commitments, there are
no defined policy priorities and objectives for the PNDL. The program’s strategic framework is broad enough to
accommodate a variety of projects, without hard constraints around what to finance and in what proportion.

22. The PNDL focuses primarily on roads, water, and sewage projects, but other types of investments (e.g., social
infrastructure, cultural sites, sports centers, etc.) can also be eligible for financing. Article 7 in the GEO 28/2013
(consolidated version) describes the list of intervention areas (similar to ”axes” of EU-funded programs):
   •	 Water supply systems and drinking water treatment plant;

      •	   Sewage systems (networks) and wastewater treatment plant;
      •	   Education units (kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high schools, etc.);
      •	   Healthcare units in rural areas (clinics, pharmacies, etc.);
      •	   Public roads (i.e., county roads, local interest roads, commune roads and/or public roads within localities);
      •	   Bridges, culverts, and/or footbridges;
      •	   Local cultural facilities, such as libraries, museums, multi-functional cultural centers, and theaters;
      •	   Landfills;
      •	   Public, commercial markets, fairs, cattle fairs, as applicable;
      •	   Sports facilities;
      •	   Headquarters of local public authorities and other subordinated public institutions;10
      •	   Tourist infrastructure developed by local public authorities.11
The types of eligible works include construction of new infrastructure, as well as extension, rehabilitation, and upgrading
of existing infrastructure. Essentially, through such broad conditions, the PNDL is able to cover the MRDPA’s entire
vast portfolio of projects – both previously-financed interventions (at various stages of completion) and brand new
investments, by all types of local public beneficiaries (from local councils in communes and cities to county councils).
The lack of strategic focus is evident in the fact that the PNDL has actually expanded its set of eligible interventions,
covering a vast array of potential projects. This has happened in spite of the massive unfulfilled investment needs
in a sector like water and wastewater, where Romania will face EU infringement procedures if it does not make
substantial progress by 2018.

23. Based on the budget allocation among ministries, as agreed at the government level and approved by
Parliament, the MRDPA establishes the PNDL’s total annual budget. Ordinance 19/2015 revamped the way the
program selects projects for financing. Major changes include: (i) a more involved role for the MRDPA in centralizing
and selecting project proposals, with County Councils no longer playing any part in this process; (ii) adoption of a
multi-annual framework for the PNDL, with beneficiaries required to submit estimates for the duration of their
project (there is no guaranteed financing, however); (iii) expansion of the number of criteria, as set through a separate
Government Decision (instead of the PNDL ordinance and the corresponding norms for applying it), though the actual
procedures remain equally vague.

24. Government Decision 624/2015 approved a set of criteria for PNDL project selection:
  •	 Balanced allocation of funding across counties, taking into account at least one of the following ”sub-criteria:”
     demographic data; financial capacity of public authorities; share of ongoing investments in each county (in
     terms of number of projects and their value).
  •	 Type of investment and whether it contributes to achieving European targets in a particular sector. Most likely,
     this would cover investments in water and wastewater systems.
  •	 The project completion stage (as a percentage).
  •	 The date on which the project was signed with the contractor / service provider.
  •	 The number of beneficiaries.

25. There are still significant gaps in how these criteria are defined and implemented. For one, the law is not
clear which of the main criteria are factored into project selection, merely noting that ”at least one of [them] should
be considered.”12 Second, there are no defined weights for individual criteria or for sub-criteria within the main
categories (e.g., number of ongoing projects vs. their funding needs). Third, it is unclear how certain indicators would
be measured in practice, particularly the administrative-territorial units’ capacity to co-finance investment projects.
One proxy that could be used would be non-earmarked revenues as a share of total revenues,13 in the absence of
clear commitments (e.g., local/county council decisions to co-finance particular investments), but the law is silent on
this matter. Fourth, it is completely unclear how a criterion should be scored. For instance, it is better to have a more
advanced project or an early-phase one? Should the date of the contract be more or less recent? Are investments in
counties with many ongoing projects prioritized or, on the contrary, deprioritized? Finally, other potentially relevant
indicators are missing. For example, the PNDL does not seem to take into account a county’s development level,
measured as GDP per capita or the Local Human Development Index (developed by Prof. Dumitru Sandu and proposed
by the World Bank as a measure of development at the county and local levels).

26. At the beginning of 2014, the (initial) funding allocation was roughly equivalent across counties – around
EUR 5 to EUR 5.7 million. On the one hand, this demonstrates the MRPDA’s commitment to making the PNDL funds
available to authorities in all parts of Romania. On the other hand, the outcome may suggest that there is no clear
prioritization of investments based on counties’ different characteristics. By contrast, the ROP 2007-2013 and 2014-
2020 (in draft form, as of August 2014), for example, made specific commitments to less developed areas, allocating
significantly larger shares of funding particularly to the North-East, South-East, and South Regions.

27. The MRDPA makes the final selection of projects that receive PNDL funding in a given year. Once again, the
methodological norms do not define a clear, transparent selection process. The final selection is to be based on ”[the
Ministry’s] own specialized assessments.”14 It is unclear what data are deployed in such evaluations. The finalized list
of interventions is approved through the MRDPA’s Minister Order, including an annex with the full set of projects (for
each of them, the annex simply notes the name of the administrative-territorial unit, the name of the project, and
the sum channeled from the state budget).

28. There are slightly different requirements for applicants with ongoing vs. new projects. For the former, local
authorities need to send to the MRDPA the documents that show the project’s current phase of completion, the
updated value of remaining expenses to be incurrent for the finalization of the intervention, and public procurement
contracts that have been signed previously, including addenda, if any. Upon verification of such documents, the
process can move forward to the contracting phase.

29. For new investment projects, beneficiaries are required to submit to the MRDPA the corresponding technical
documentation. In most cases, this refers to feasibility studies for new interventions or the documentation for
approving intervention works (DALI15) for existing infrastructure. Feasibility studies and DALIs are not eligible for
reimbursement through the PNDL and have to have been developed through the applicant’s own resources, in
accordance with the regulations set by GD 28/2008. GEO 28/2013 also notes that the documentation must prove
that the proposed projects abide by the applicable cost standards. However, cost standards are provided only for
county roads, communal roads, and for water projects. No cost standards are provided for wastewater projects, as
these are considered to require quite different technical solutions from case to case.16

                                            Diagnostic: What are the main challenges?

30. It is worth noting that local authorities who seek to access PNDL funds do not submit formal applications
that are comparable to the complex documents required by EU-funded programs. The bulk of an ”application” is
the technical documentation corresponding to the proposed project – i.e., the feasibility study and/or the detailed
technical design. In field interviews, PNDL beneficiaries express satisfaction with the current system’s simplicity
and relatively quick processing of applications. In effect, under the current system, requiring a formal form with
categories similar to those included in applications for EU funds – e.g., ”project relevance for strategic objectives,”
”economic impact,” ”technical features,” ”social/environmental impact,” etc. – would not add much value. This is
because the actual prioritization and, essentially, the ”preselection” of projects happen at the level of county councils.
The MRDPA only verifies that submitted proposals are in accordance with a set of criteria – it is more of an eligibility
check than a thorough technical and financial evaluation. This is not to say that the technical-economic data related
to the project is not assessed by MRDPA evaluators, but only that projects that make it thus far generally go through
contracting. Even if a proposal initially fails the check, MRDPA staff recommends the necessary improvements to
beneficiaries, enabling projects to move to the next phases (pending the successful resolution of suggested changes).

31. More recently, changes were introduced to the PNDL’s methodological norms to increase the efficiency of
assessing and approving new project proposals. Until June 2014, the technical documentation would be first
assessed by DG RDI within the MRDPA and then sent to the Ministry’s Technical-Economic Council (TEC). Without
the TEC’s formal approval, projects would not be eligible for financing. Citing the low capacity of the TEC to assess
proposals and the long delays incurred in the process, the MRDPA eliminated this step through Ministry Order
1851/2013. Currently, new projects pre-approved for financing through the PNDL only go through an assessment by
the technical unit of the DG RDI, which primarily evaluates the following:
  •	 whether the technical documentation is complete and in accordance with GD 28/2008;
  •	 whether the applicant’s folder includes the local / county council’s decision for approving the project’s technical-
     economic indicators and for ensuring the required co-financing;
  •	 whether the expenditures are properly presented and do not exceed current cost standards.

32. Data show that there is no deliberate effort to ensure coordination of projects across financing sources. As
the figures below show, the current financing criteria for the PNDL do nothing to incentivize beneficiaries to ”link”
these investments with projects financed from EU structural funds. In addition, because of how the PNDL functions
in practice – annual disbursements of funds – preference is given to short road segments that may play no strategic
role in a county / region. A few positive examples do exist – in the North-West and South – but these are rather
the result of a deliberate effort by those County Councils to coordinate investments, or may even be the result of a
fortunate coincidence. It is clear that the PNDL could do more to encourage beneficiaries to design and implement
investments in an integrated fashion (e.g., by granting bonus points to those applicants who demonstrate that their
proposed projects connect with other EU-funded investments).

33. Once the multiannual contract between the MRDPA and local authorities is signed, actual project
implementation can commence. The exact stages will depend on whether the project is new or ongoing. In the former
case, the beneficiary of PNDL funds will have to organize public procurement procedures, in line with the applicable
legislation (GEO 34/2006). In some cases, these procedures take a long time – due to challenges in court, lack of
offers, or other reasons specific to each project – which may aggravate the risk of not using up the funds allocated
for a particular year. If the project is ongoing and construction work has already begun in a previous year (through the
PNDL or a different program), depending on a case-by-case basis, the beneficiary may continue previous engagement
with service providers and contractors.

34. Payments and reimbursements are critical factors for a smooth, successful implementation. Based on the
methodological norms (Articles 16-17), beneficiaries used to submit reimbursement requests first to county councils,
which would then submit a consolidated request for each county to the MRDPA. This system was then changed to
allow beneficiaries to request funds directly from the MRDPA, essentially simplifying the process by eliminating a
step. Some county councils report, however, that local city halls sometimes fail to send them a copy of reimbursement
requests sent to the Ministry, thus requiring repeated requests to keep them in the loop. According to county council
staff interviewed, they want to remain involved to be able to coordinate and monitor the implementation process
in their respective jurisdiction. Based on the latest legislative changes (GEO 46/2015 modified Article 10 of GEO
2/2013), the Ministry approves reimbursement requests in the chronological order in which they are received – the

16
  In practice, MRDPA technical staff use a simple rule of thumb for benchmarking sanitation projects, namely that they should not exceed 1.5
times the cost of equivalent water projects.
                                                                                                                                         12
                              Harmonizing State and EU Funded Projects in Regions | Final Synthesis

principle “first in first out” holds – within the set annual limits and based on the proofs/documents received (“situații
de lucrări”) directly to beneficiaries. Finally, beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of service
providers (i.e., showing that the funds received were used for the intended purpose).

35. In addition, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work progress and reporting updates to county councils
and the MRDPA. The flow of reports is similar to the initial one presented above for financing requests: local beneficiaries
send all documents corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every quarter, county councils send to the
MRDPA a consolidated update on the progress of construction works. Upon request, beneficiaries are required to send
to the MRDPA any document related to the financed project. For its part, the MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring
and controlling the program’s implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives who, together
with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the accuracy of reported data and compare
it to the reality on the ground.

36. The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post-implementation phase – i.e.,
tracking the project’s evolution upon completion. At least based on the methodological norms, once the actual
works are finished, the beneficiary sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the warranty
period expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula documentation (”procesul verbal de recepție
final”) to the MRDPA. Beyond that, the two key post-implementation functions for ay investment program – i.e.,
ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing – appear to be missing at this point in the PNDL’s
evolution. Put differently, there is no formal process for evaluating the impact of completed investments and there are
no institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past, current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL
funds. This is not surprising for a young program like the PNDL; still, going forward, it would be important to set-up
ex-post mechanisms to ensure the continuous improvement of the instrument. Subsequent chapters provide more in-
depth suggestions for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, including through performance and impact indicators.

                                       Diagnostic: What are the main challenges?




   3            The documentation of many projects financed by the MRDPA
                through the PNDL is of poor quality

37. The assessment of a sample of 289 projects submitted to the PNDL reveals several areas of improvement, in
particular some common conformity and eligibility issues. Practically all identified issues are related to the administrative
compliance and quality of application documents needed for the evaluation. This is to be expected, as the current
evaluation process is essentially entirely focused on checking for administrative conformity and eligibility. The list below
includes typical issues encountered, with the aim of signaling to the MRDPA and to local authorities where common gaps
in the documentation exist or where the quality needs to be improved:
   •	 Lack of Supporting Documents / Technical Studies. The field studies (the topographic study, the geotechnical study,
      etc.) and the technical review / control are basic documents required by Government Decision 28/2008. These are
      often missing, which creates problems during the implementation (inadequate technical solution for a particular
      investment, changes in the estimated investment value, changes in technical solutions during implementation,
      delays in construction works, etc.).
   •	 Inadequate/Insufficient Technical Documentation. Two main issues are the submission of the documentation for
      approval of intervention works (DALI) instead of the feasibility study (FS) and the submission of the Detailed
      Technical Design (DTD) instead of the FS. The law clearly stipulates that the FS includes technical and economic
      documentation necessary for executing construction works for new investments, while the DALI is required for
      intervention operations on existing infrastructure (modernization, rehabilitation/consolidation, etc.).
   •	 Incorrect Project Budget (Cost Breakdown). Typical budget-related errors include: (i) arithmetical errors; (ii) VAT
      applied to taxes; (iii) wrong VAT amount; (iv) a format other than the one established through GD 28/2008;
      (v) incorrect registration of amounts in budgetary chapters, typically as a way to lower expenditures so that
      they abide by the set cost standards. Such mistakes can lead to incorrect estimates of the value of investment
      (under/over estimation) with a potentially major impact upon the funds’ allocation process and upon the actual
      implementation of financed projects, particularly if there is a gap in funding.
   •	 Insufficient Cost Breakdown for Main Works. Beyond non-compliance with the legal requirements, providing
      insufficient details on the estimation of the main works in the budget makes it impossible or very difficult for
      evaluators to verify whether the project abides by the set cost standards. Another issue is the lack of correlation
      between the technical description and the budgetary estimation of the same items.
   •	 Lack of Main Drawings. While the law requires drawings from the FS / DALI to include the site plan, the general
      layout, and other plans and general cross sections, the projects’ documentation often lacks these key elements.
      This can lead to major delays in obtaining the Construction Permit and/or to the approval of technical solutions
      that are incomplete and may lead to incorrect evaluations of the built surface, the volumetric analysis, etc.,
      directly affecting the estimated value of the investment.
   •	 Noncompliance with Cost Standards. The maximum values for unit costs are established through Annex 3 of GD
      363/2010, modified through GD 250/2011. The provisions for some investment types are, however, not very
      clear, which can lead to incorrect interpretations by the applicants. The most frequent mistake in applying cost
      standards has been noticed with road infrastructure projects where the MRDPA has only included the ”road
      shoulder,” ”causeway system,” and ”elements for drainage” (i.e., only earth ditches).
   •	 Lack of Documents for Property / Assets. Property documents are requested by GEO 28/2013 for approving the
      PNDL and by MRDPA’s Minister Order 839/2009 for obtaining the Construction Permit. In practice, some
      applicants fail to include them, which can lead to erroneous identification of the estate (built/land) in the
      studies’ area, incorrect technical solutions, and delays.
   •	 Missing / Expired / Incomplete Urban Certificate (UC). Approvals, agreements, and studies related to the planning
      certificate can establish preconditions for starting the investment, so it is vital to obtain these approvals (permits)
      and agreements before the development of the FS, which needs to take into account possible recommendations
      or constraints foreseen by these documents. This was a common mistake in particular for social infrastructure
      for which permits and certificate of urbanism were often missing.
   •	 Local Council Decision Requiring Amendments. According to provisions of article 36, paragraph (4) of Law 215/2001,
      the Local Council ”approves, upon the mayor’s request, technical-economic documentations for local interest
      investment works, under current legal conditions.” In practice, Local Council decisions are often incorrect.
      Common mistakes include: the approved total amount of the investment is insufficient compared to the total
      budget amount; the amount of the local authority’s own contribution is not explicitly mentioned; the amount
      of the own contribution does not cover all ineligible costs. Lack of financial resources associated with the co-
      financing can lead to incorrect financial allocations by the MRDPA and possibly to suspension of works for lack
      of financial resources.
                                                                                                                          14

       4             The designs currently deployed for public infrastructure projects are
                     outdated and inefficient

38. Engineers must follow the regulations and standards in force for any type of construction design related to
roads, water and wastewater infrastructure, or social buildings. According to Government Ordinance (GO) 39/1998
and Law 355/2002, the statute of standards is voluntary, unlike regulations and norms, which are mandatory. Based
on the current standards and norms, the Technical Specifications (TS) are elaborated. They represent the technical
documentation that explains every step of the technological process for the realization of construction elements:
resistance elements, enveloping elements, partition elements, and finishing elements.
TS content is not regulated at the national level, each design company using its own more or less complete TS.
Contractors then usually fail to consider the TS submitted by the designers, as they have their own execution
solutions based on current practice that does not always rely on performance criteria.

39. Unlike other developed countries, Romania is still using technical standards that are 10-20 years old or
even older. The alignment process of Romanian standards to European ones is currently being implemented, but
unfortunately, it takes time and the harmonization is done gradually. Thus, peculiar situations appear when conflictual
standards coexist, or for a specific test/material, the old standard was canceled, without adopting a new one. This
way, the design of Romanian roads cannot be at the same level with the roads designed in developed countries, where
the standards are renewed once every 2-3 years.

40. A related challenge concerns Road Safety Audits (RSAs) and Road Safety Inspections (RSIs), which are
mandatory for all types of roads, starting with January 1, 2015. According to the law currently in force (Law
265/2008) in Romania, every road project needs to be verified for all its stages (feasibility study, detailed technical
design, after construction) by accredited road safety auditors, in order for it to comply with predefined checklists.
Road safety auditors or inspectors must be different and independent of the design specialists who elaborated the
projects.

41. RSAs and RSIs are still not implemented on all road projects as stipulated by Directive 2008/96/EC of
the European Parliament and of the Council. This happens due to multiple reasons: lack of trained professionals
(auditors / inspectors) – only 12 in the entire country; lack of clear regulations regarding the main authority that
is supposed to supervise the audits / inspections; and also the very high prices established by the Romanian Road
Authority (ARR) (e.g., EUR 50,000 per km for new highways, EUR 15,000 per km for national road rehabilitations,
etc.).17 Currently, instead of being independent, auditors are contracted by the designer/constructor, even though this
is against the law.

42. Finally, innovation and research in construction are poorly developed. The main organizations involved in the
research process are: the National Institute for Research in Constructions (INCERC) for civil buildings; the Institute for
Research in Transportation (INCERTRANS); the Technical Roads Studies and Information Center (CESTRIN) for roads
and bridges; and SC PROED SA, SC AQUAPROIECT SA, National Institute for Hydrology and Water Management
(INHGA), Institute for Hydro-energetic Studies and Design (ISPH) for water supply, wastewater, hydrographic, hydro-
technic and hydrologic works. In the field of design of civil buildings, the emphasis on research moved to universities.
The relationship between research and implementation at the level of design / execution companies is not found in
an organized framework at the level of professional associations or ministries (MRDPA, Ministry of Transport, and
Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forestry).

43. Laboratories of private construction companies apply programs of verification and testing under Romanian
and European legislation, aiming to contribute to the harmonization of test methods. Unfortunately, practical
experience of laboratories fails to be disseminated due to interruption of exchange programs organized. The State
Inspectorate in Constructions (ISC) organizes an annual symposium for exchange of experience, which involves the
heads of laboratories and certified road inspectors. At the same time, it organizes a Road Specialists Congress that
allows exchanges of ideas, views, and information in a professional network.

44. Nowadays any new material proposed on the Romanian market (imported or invented) must be approved
based on laboratory testing procedures. Approvals procedures for companies that can issue quality certificates
for materials and the low efficiency of the quality verification system have led to the proliferation on the market of
materials with higher quality certificates than real parameters found. Due to low prices, this market of ”acceptable”
materials discourages producers who respect the quality provided in certificates in the production line. Some European
countries are maintaining centralized quality checking for materials by national laboratories, e.g., France - Centre
Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment (CSTB). A similar structure existed in Romania, the National Research Institute in
Constructions (INCERC), whose monopoly was abolished.

45. The legislative harmonization process is delayed due to the low degree of absorption of new SR EN by design
companies, due to lack of promotion/dissemination. The Romanian Association for Standardization does not benefit
from adequate funds in order to organize regular presentations of newly adopted harmonized regulations. Before
1990, the centralized state ensured a forced implementation of research and innovation in current practice. After 25
years, the Romanian society failed to enable, in the free market, new links between the few R&I centers (institutes or
universities) and the remaining companies operating on the construction market. Various professional associations,
several congresses, national conferences, and workshops organized by the Ministry or other State institutions did not
have continuity in order to become home of constant promotion of new ideas between construction actors in Romania.




     5             There are significant challenges facing Romania’s housing sector:
                   exposure to risks, quality-related, and institutional

                        Deteriorating communist era housing stock
46. Much of the housing stock in Romania built during the communist period is deteriorating due to poor
maintenance. Over 35% of the country’s 8.5 million housing units is in a state of neglect and needs urgent repairs.
Dilapidated housing includes over 10,000 pre-1980 blocks with structural, roof, and heating needs. Home Owners
Associations (HOAs), legally mandated to maintain and manage these buildings, often either have limited technical
or financial capacity to carry out their functions, or lack the sense of ownership or responsibility to carry out
maintenance and improvement activities. Many historic residential buildings are also derelict due to the lack of
maintenance. In some cases, the buildings have been abandoned for years, and the owners cannot be traced.


                                                     Seismic risk
47. Romania’s exposure to earthquake risk is among the highest in Europe, with an estimated 10,577 households
living in 607 residential buildings rated in the Class I (highest) seismic risk category across the country. București
has the highest seismic risk of all European capitals, and is one of the ten most vulnerable cities in the world.
București has 60% of the country’s Class I risk buildings, while over 2,500 residential blocks are unstable (Class I
through Class III risk categories) and need structural strengthening. There are two key problems for the failure of the
17
                                      Diagnostic: What are the main challenges?

seismic retrofitting of buildings through the government loan scheme, namely the lack of ‘necessity housing’ or other
instruments (such as rental vouchers) to facilitate transitional shelter for residents during the retrofitting period, and
the unwillingness of the residents to leave their current homes.


                  Inadequate housing for poor and vulnerable groups
48. Romania has the most ”severe housing deprivation” in the EU-28 countries. The poor and marginalized groups
are often relegated to live in squalid and overcrowded conditions in slums or old ‘blocks-of-flats’ or ill-maintained
social housing units with insecure tenure. Housing conditions vary across the different types of poor settlements in
urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. Urban settlements in inner city areas are by far the worst, with extremely poor
quality housing, little or no infrastructure, and high levels of unemployment and poverty.


                                   Dysfunctional housing market
49. The private sector real estate market is still reeling from the effects of the 2008 crisis, and the developers
who survived bankruptcy are now burdened with unsold housing inventories from the 2008-2010 period. Private
banks have practically frozen construction lending, reducing the production of new housing, especially for the middle
of the market. The main challenge of the new housing construction market is the limited range of housing options
offered and the constraint of affordability (high interest rates of 10-12% or mortgages). Additional issues are the high
space standards specified in the Housing Law (e.g., 58m2 for a one-person home, 81m2 for a 2-person home), and the
threshold of EUR 60,000 under the Prima Casă program (which guarantees a low interest rate). According to unofficial
figures, the rental market could be 15-20% of the housing stock in București and other major cities, and it is largely
informal (without contracts). The very limited supply of ‘formal’ rental housing has high rents, unaffordable for most
middle and low-income households. Another aspect adding to the problems is the high cost of trunk infrastructure for
housing in peri-urban areas, which is passed on to the consumer in the form of higher house prices.


                      Inadequate legal and institutional framework
50. Housing laws, public programs, and institutions are inconsistent and over-lapping. The Housing Law has
been amended nine times since 1996, and some of the amended provisions are today disparate, and difficult to
comprehend or enforce. The lack of an underlying housing strategy to substantiate housing legislation has created
a diverse classification of public housing – for example, Social Housing, Necessity Housing, Youth Housing – which
cannot be used interchangeably to adapt to changing local needs.

51. There are a number of public institutions responsible in one way or another for housing in Romania. The
Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), National Housing Agency (NHA), Ministry of
Labor, and local authorities operate as disparate entities. Public housing programs are deeply fragmented: there are
some twenty-two government programs with almost no coordination or monitoring mechanisms, and inadequate
budget allocations. Most of the projects are not prioritized. Local authorities must provide the serviced land and raise
their own funds to develop and operate necessity or social housing, which puts a serious burden on local finances.

52. There are little to no data available on publicly funded housing at the national or the local level, which makes
it impossible to do a meaningful diagnostic or draw future projections in the sector. The stock of publicly owned
buildings in Romania is not being utilized to its optimal potential partly due to the absence of a comprehensive
inventory of these buildings, and partly due to the lack of administrative and technical capacity to assess the full
potential of these assets and assign uses accordingly.


                  Poorly targeted government assistance in housing
53. Romania’s public housing stock is inadequate, in terms of both quantity and quality. Less than 2% of housing is
publicly owned, and since 1990, less than 10% of new housing has been built using public funds. Public sector housing
subsidies are far too over-reaching to be effective. Government housing programs tend to favor middle and high income
individuals over the poor. Local governments are required to provide social housing for individuals earning below the
National Average Monthly Net Income of RON 1,866 (EUR 380) per capita, an income threshold mandated by the
Housing Law, which also applies to most public housing programs. According to this, however, almost everyone except
the richest 7-8% of the income distribution is eligible apply for social housing.18 The Youth Housing Program, which is
                                                                                                                    18

Picture 1. Multifamily buildings in Class I of seismic risk in Bucharest




among the largest public housing programs in Romania, is not targeted based on income (described more below); the
Land Lots for Youth Program awards higher eligibility ”points” to applicants with higher incomes. Finally, the Housing
Law refers to low income persons, but does not explicitly include socially marginalized or physically challenged people.

54. The bulk of housing subsidies and government programs go to middle-income households as opposed to
the poorest 20-30% of households who need it most. The main housing government programs include the Youth
Housing program (EUR 224 million to date), the Prima Casă loan guarantee (EUR 4 billion since 2009 to date), and
the BauSpar subsidy (EUR 188 million to date), but none provides much benefit to poor households. While the Social
Housing program and other programs are intended for the poor, they have faced issues regarding budget allocations
and implementation. The low prioritization of Social Housing Program is evident from its budget allocation: over a
10-year period from 2005 to 2014, it received EUR 55 million, which is only 20% more than the budget allocation for
the BauSpar subsidy for a single year (EUR 45 million for 2015). The government also provides a VAT subsidy (5%
as compared to the regular VAT of 24%) to individuals purchasing private houses priced below EUR 86,000 or RON
380,00019 – this is another general subsidy awarded regardless of the beneficiary’s income.

55. While local authorities must provide social housing, they have neither the technical capacity nor the financial
means to undertake such projects. Social housing is essentially a ”loss-maker” for local authorities, and so they have
no incentive to build or maintain or increase their social housing stock. Another problem of the social housing is the
way it is allocated to beneficiaries. The eligibility criteria for social housing set at the local level is based on household
members, education level, income, etc., but preference is usually given to those who can pay for utilities, thus, again,
excluding the very poorest.

56. The Youth Housing program under the NHA targets people younger than 35 years, and is not income-targeted.
The government has put EUR 49 million into this program between 2005 and 2014, and in June 2015, another EUR
175 million was approved by the Council of Europe Development Bank to build 6,990 housing units over the next 7-8
years. The implicit subsidy embedded in the program’s rental units includes free land and services, and below-market

   According to the Household Budget Survey of 2012, individual income for the first income decile is RON 0-281 (EUR 0-63) and RON 1201-10740
(EUR 270-2,416) for the 10th income decile.

   This was established by GEO 200/2008, which made an adjustment to the 2003 Fiscal Code to include, among other changes, a reduced VAT
for houses purchased for less than EUR 86,000 (RON 380,000). The land must not exceed 250m2, and the house area should be less than 120m2
(excluding auxiliary buildings).

rents with no term limit for occupancy, which is a disincentive for tenants to move out. Another program targeted
to young people is the Land Lots for Youth program in which plots of land are allocated to beneficiaries, ranging from
150-300m2 in cities, 250-400m2 in towns, and 250-1,000m2 in rural areas.

57. Massive investment is ongoing to improve the energy efficiency of residential buildings. The program on
thermal insulation is among the most active government-supported programs in housing, and the speed at which this
program is implemented deserves commendation. However, the focus of these programs is too narrow, and the quality
of work shows considerable scope for improvement. Moreover, even though legally mandated to do so under GEO
18/2009, this program is not adequately tapping into the potentially huge opportunity to simultaneously improve
common areas and undertake structural seismic retrofitting of the vast stock of old housing. Another problem is the
”top-down” implementation: subsidies from the central and local governments essentially direct the implementation,
and HOA’s maintain only a peripheral role in decision-making or monitoring of construction.

                Build an enabling environment that supports coordination through
 1a             improved trust, accountability, administrative capacity, and information
                systems that talk to each other

58. There are four core principles of an enabling environment for effective coordination of infrastructure
investments: trust; accountability; capacity; and information systems. These cross-themes influence the quality
of the process of coordination for all the dimensions discussed in this report: across administrative levels; across
players/programs; across sectors; across phases of a cycle of investment strategies / programs / projects.

  •	Trust:
     •	 Coordination ultimately always occurs between people – not between amorphous institutions or sectors.
        This is why building a culture of collaboration is quintessential for instilling coordination in the DNA of any
        organization. A key corollary is the need to reduce turnover of critical staff and consolidate capacity.
     •	 The MRDPA should: (i) organize special training programs for staff on how to enhance collaboration; and (ii)
        collect and disseminate good practices from around the country regarding internal (within an organization,
        across various units) and external (across organizations) coordination.

  •	Accountability:
     •	 Coordination should be included in the list of formal responsibilities corresponding to each authority in charge
        of designing and implementing public infrastructure investments. This would trickle down all the way to the
        Bylaws and the required individual staff competencies and performance matrix (”fișa postului”).
     •	 As the line ministry in charge of public administration, the MRDPA should spearhead the ”coordination agenda”
        for Romania’s public sector and hold local authorities and other institutions accountable for their efforts.

  •	Capacity:
     •	 Who will do the challenging work of coordinating across departments/ institutions/sectors/administrative
        levels? This is not a task that can be outsourced, but one that requires active involvement from insiders
        (experienced staff who knows the system and can navigate it across institutional and jurisdictional lines).
     •	 Particularly in the context of low-paid positions in Romania’s public administration, with monthly wages of
        around EUR 400 or lower, experienced specialists are very hard to come by and tend to be in very high demand.
     •	 The MRDPA’s role would be to lead the effort to enhance public authorities’ ability to manage human capital,
        reward/sanction employees, and raise salaries to competitive levels. This would help ensure lower turnover of
        critical staff and allow them to dedicate time to coordination.

  •	Information systems:
     •	 Effective coordination also depends on comprehensive, timely, and accurate information flows among all
        stakeholders involved. Information is power and one cannot manage what one does not measure.
     •	 Romania has not yet aligned databases across public institutions. Even units within the same ministry
        sometimes use incompatible systems.
     •	 The MRDPA’s role would be to develop (in-house or through outsourcing) a common database of public
        infrastructure investments in Romania to facilitate real-time information sharing and coordination.




 1b             Improve the quality of strategies by establishing and empowering a
                Strategy Unit in the Prime Minister’s Chancellery

59. The first step is to develop, refine, and approve a set of coordinated strategies underpinning investment
programs to ensure proper demarcation of intervention areas. The MRDPA cannot directly lead this effort, but it
can support the Center of Government (the Prime Minister’s Chancellery) – which maintains a weak role vis-à-vis line
ministries – to supervise the development of strategies and their implementation through a dedicated Strategy Unit
(SU). The SU would be under the Prime Minister’s direct coordination. Building on current legislation (Government

standards for their development. The SU would also monitor how these strategies translate into investment programs
and further into projects. In particular, the unit would ensure that investment programs are properly designed, with
clear synergies among them, following the example of EU funds. The SU would also play the main M&E role with
respect to the performance of investment programs, tracking key data like annual project completion ratio, annual
increase in ongoing investments, etc. The Prime Minister would thus be able to recommend data-driven adjustments to
current investment programs and, as needed, their expansion / merger / termination, in line with their performance.




  1c              Harmonize state-budget and EU-funded investment programs across the
                  entire investment cycle

60. Most coordination opportunities arise in the harmonization of frameworks and procedures applicable to EU
and state-funded investment programs. The former have introduced a variety of new tools in the Romanian context
(e.g., strategic and integrated planning, rigorous public procurement, monitoring and evaluation of performance, etc.)
and have generated a true shift in the mindset of public sector staff. From hundreds of interviews with local, regional,
and central authorities, conducted since 2012 as part of the World Bank’s technical assistance for Romania’s regional
development, one conclusion holds true at all levels: staff working on EU programs are more motivated, more creative,
and more rigorous in the design and implementation of public infrastructure investments. Romania therefore faces a
great opportunity to leverage the learnings from the implementation of EU funds and replicate them in state-budget-
funded programs.

                               Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

61. Indeed, EU-funded programmes have a much better track record than state-funded programs, despite low
overall absorption rates. As a point of comparison, in 1994, the Romanian Government launched the National Program
for the Modernization of National Roads and Construction of Highways. The Program proposed the modernization of
11,300 km of national roads in 15 phases, by 2014. However, in the 20 years since its start, only 20% of the planned
length was completed, and only 3 of the 15 phases were closed. A similar experience was registered with the Priority
Program for the Development of Highways, or the various state-budget-funded programs started over the years to
finance infrastructure investments at the local level. By contrast, the management of EU funds has improved over
the past few years (as did the absorption rates), and instruments like the Regional Operational Programme (ROP),
managed by the MRDPA, have been good performers even when benchmarked against similar programs in other
Member States.20

62. The suboptimal performance of state-budget-funded programs can be improved through a number of key
elements adapted from EU-financed interventions, with the caveat that proposed measures should factor in
capacity constraints. Indeed, the capacity to process applications and oversee projects is much lower in departments
responsible for state-budget-funded programs versus Managing Authorities of EU structural funds (fewer staff, lower
wages, etc.). Compared to the ROP, for instance, a program like the PNDL is characterized by a larger portfolio of
smaller investments, on average – as shown in chapter 2 – which calls for simpler yet equally rigorous procedures
throughout the project cycle. Equally important, previous assessments of EU funds, including by the World Bank21,
have noted the signs of excessive bureaucratization in how the Romanian Government implements EU regulations, so
it is important to adopt only the elements that work well.

63. The following recommendations are made primarily in relation to the PNDL in this report, but effectively
apply to all state-budget-funded programs:

      •	Anchor the PNDL in a rigorous and stable strategic framework over a longer programming cycle.
         To ensure that limited public funds are deployed to achieve the largest possible impact, it is important to strategize,
         plan, and identify clear priorities. Ideally, the programming period would be the same as for EU funds (seven years
         plus two-three years for finalization of investments). This will not only enable the possibility to finance more
         impactful projects, but it will also foster better coordination and harmonization of all programs – i.e., operational
         programs financing similar investments could draw on a joint strategy and would look to contribute toward the
         same goals. Once the strategic framework is agreed upon, the next step is to develop the operational document
         for state-funded programs – i.e., the Applicant Guide. This would explain the overall rules for implementing the
         program (e.g., the PNDL), offering in-depth descriptions of investment axes and eligible types of interventions,
         eligible expenditures, eligibility criteria (types of beneficiaries), and evaluation and selection criteria.

      •	Adopt multi-year budgeting to enable more strategic investments and finance new investments only when
         funds required by ongoing projects are fully covered.
         Without multi-year budgets, there is little predictability for beneficiaries (their projects may receive funding
         this year and none the next), there is a tendency to finance smaller and less impactful projects (investments
         financed through PNDL 2014 were on average three times smaller than similar projects financed through ROP
         2007-2013 and PNDR 2007-2013), and it is hard to do proper strategic planning (yearly investment programs
         can only finance the projects submitted for financing for that particular year). Especially for a program like the
         PNDL, which in 2014 had a portfolio of nearly 4,000 projects (significantly larger than in 2013), it is important
         to decide what budget can be expected year-on-year to finish (at least some of) the projects started. Multiple
         steps are required, including: rationalization of current portfolio; setting a budgetary baseline covering annual
         costs of all ongoing projects remaining in the portfolio; and allocation of funds for new investments only when/
         if excess resources exist – not just for the first year, but for future years’ baseline as well. The MRDPA did
         take a few steps in the right direction through Government Emergency Ordinance 46/2015, which created a
         multiannual PNDL – at least in theory. Beneficiaries are required to submit multiannual estimates of their
         expenses, though there is no formal requirement for the MRDPA to pay in full such expenditures, even for
         projects with ”multiannual” contracts. It all depends on annual allocations, and there has been no effort to date
         to rationalize the project portfolio and make it financially and fiscally sustainable.

      •	Set a clear, fixed implementation timeline for completing projects.
         Beneficiaries of EU funds know that they have a clear deadline by which they have to use funds, i.e., they risk
         losing those funds if they do not complete the investment in due time. Under state-budget-funded programs

         there is no time restriction and many investments, even small ones, are continued for years on end, drawing
         funds from a limited pool to keep the investment going, often at a minimum effort level. Countless construction
         sites linger around Romania, without a push to complete such works before approving new ones. GEO 46/2015,
         cited earlier, does set a timeline for contracts – four years, with the possibility of a two-year extension. However,
         it is not clear what happens if six years go by and a project is still not finished; there is no mechanism to apply
         corrections, ask for the money back, or otherwise incentivize the beneficiaries to finish the projects on time.

      •	Harmonize eligibility and selection criteria.
         Beneficiaries of EU funds operate within a procedural framework that is clearly defined at the beginning of a
         program and stays relatively constant over the full programming period. In the case of state-budget-funded
         programs, rules are often unclear and, when they do exist, they change every year or even more frequently.
         This leaves room for interpretation and ad-hoc implementation, reducing predictability and transparency for
         program applicants and beneficiaries, for their service providers (e.g., contractors of infrastructure works), for
         the Ministry of Public Finances that needs to budget according to the money spent in a given year, etc. The
         eligibility of investments should be decided based on what can and should be covered along with EU funds – either
         to contribute to the same goals in sectors where needs are too high to rely only on structural instruments (the
         ”equivalency” approach) or to fill gaps left unaddressed by EU funds (the ”complementarity” approach). There
         should also be transparent, fair, and rigorously enforced selection criteria, along with harmonized contracting
         for all applicants.

      •	Direct interested applicants to EU financing first, but build a pipeline of proposals that can be channeled to
         either EU or state-budget funds.
         If a proposed project can be eligible for EU funding (i.e., in sectors where the ”equivalency” approach holds),
         the MRDPA and other ministries managing state-budget-funded investments should first direct applicants to
         EU grants (i.e., the cheaper financing). This may be a question of awareness-raising or it may require a hard
         constraint to only accept an application if it proves that it is either ineligible for EU funds or that it is ”eligible
         but not financeable” (because of EU funds running out under certain axes/intervention areas). In any case, the
         harmonization of rules and procedures will ensure that investments in the pipeline may be eligible for either EU
         funds or the state budget, which would help boost absorption of all available financing sources.

      •	Implement stronger M&E mechanisms at the program level.
         First, the PNDL and other state-budget-funded programs should set performance indicators for the entire
         program (e.g., number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for each sector (length of
         rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with access to water and sanitation, etc.). Second, a list of

                      Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

    clear impact indicators should be defined and monitored (two examples are included in the figure below). Third,
    to enable the monitoring process to run smoothly, a Monitoring Committee should be established, including both
    staff of the MRDPA and representatives of the beneficiaries (e.g., one representative per county). Monitoring
    should also rely on Intermediate Bodies (County Councils, Regional Development Agencies, or another institution
    of choice) and on local communities.

  •	Enforce stronger monitoring at the project level.
    Proper monitoring is the first step in enabling the MRDPA to correct issues promptly as they develop during the
    project implementation phase. For its part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall program monitoring
    role, with specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on a defined methodology (e.g., as mentioned earlier,
    larger/more complex projects should be more carefully scrutinized). Also, the MRDPA should rely on a set of
    independent auditors and/or on more formal Intermediate Bodies for this task. There are two main options for
    fulfilling the IB role: County Councils or Regional Development Agencies (see section 5.3.1. for a discussion of
    pros and cons of the two scenarios).

     •	Harmonized post-implementation procedures.
       The first step in establishing a proper M&E system for the post-implementation phase is to define and agree
       on a set of performance indicators for each financed project. At a minimum, chosen indicators should abide by
       the ”SMART” set of criteria: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-oriented. There is also a need
       to continue monitoring visits in the field for a number of years after the completion of the investment. Again,
       this can be done with the support of independent auditors and/or IBs. Last but not least, the MRDPA should
       leverage the experience of beneficiaries who successfully complete PNDL projects and involve them in dedicated
       knowledge-sharing mechanisms.




     1d          Share good practices of project-level coordination and build the capacity
                 of local authorities across the country

64. At the level of projects, the key to effective coordination lies with the main beneficiary of an investment grant
– i.e., the county/local authority. For all the aforementioned reasons, however, subnational governments lack the
capacity to properly coordinate investments’ planning, implementation, and M&E. The MRDPA should also promote a
set of good practices for local-level coordination, collected from authorities around the country. For example, some
mayors can propose to their local council a sequenced, calculated approach to needed infrastructure investments – i.e.,
making sure that they first invest in underground networks of utilities and only then move on to road rehabilitation.
Consultations with public service providers (electricity, gas, water, wastewater, etc.) are equally critical to ensure that
investment plans are fully correlated.
27
                              Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?




     2a              Design and adopt objective and transparent selection criteria for state-
                     budget-funded programs to maximize development impact

65. There are two main approaches to enhanced coordination through financing criteria: equivalency and
complementarity. On the one hand, harmonized criteria can be equivalent across investment programs. This is
appropriate particularly when the needs in the sector far outweigh the supply of funds and there are also clear
requirements to fund particular investments. On the other hand, harmonized criteria can be complementary across
investment programs. That means that in a given sector one may define from the start of a programming period
the list of eligible types of investments for each fund. Together, these lists should be ”MECE” – mutually exclusive,
comprehensively exhaustive. In other words, there would be no overlaps and, as a whole, the funds would serve the
full range of needs in a sector.

66. The optimal approach varies by sector; there is no one-size-fits-all answer. For example, in the roads sector, the
EU-funded Regional Operational Programme (ROP) 2014-2020 will focus on county roads connecting to the TEN-T
network; the PNDL could take on county roads that do not connect directly to TEN-T, but remain a priority based
on a number of other criteria (e.g., located in the area of a major urban center, high number of beneficiaries, etc.). By
contrast, for the water and sanitation sector, the PNDL should maintain the EU requirements of focusing on localities
over 50 people for water and over 2,000 p.e. for sewage systems, in accordance with Water and Wastewater Master
Plans. Why not focus on localities that are not eligible for EU funds through the Large Infrastructure OP or the PNDR
2014-2020? The answer is simple: the priority lists have already been established by the Master Plans based on clear
criteria, and Romania still needs to fulfill EU-level commitments in the water and wastewater sector. Finally, for social
infrastructure, the PNDL should make sure that it evaluates and prioritizes investments based on criteria similar to
those used by EU funds – these are sensible criteria for making sure that the investments have the desired impact
(e.g., sufficient number of students or patients, adequate focus on marginalized and/or low-income communities, etc.).

67. Fortunately, Romania’s experience with EU funds provides plenty of examples of good practices that should
be replicated for state-budget-funded programs like PNDL:
      •	
     A purposeful focus on coordination: Each EU Member State is required to explain how it will ensure
     complementarities across structural funds, starting with the programming documents approved by the EC
     before implementation can begin. For instance, the Romania-EU Partnership Agreement 2014-2020 clearly
     notes: ”The complementarities identified among European Structural and Investment Funds require an effective
     coordination during planning and implementation […] in order to avoid the overlaps between actions.”23
      •	
     Programming anchored in real needs and priorities: EU-funded programs draw from and correlate with relevant
     strategic documents, both cross-sectoral (e.g., the Romania-EU Partnership Agreement, the Convergence
     Programme, etc.) and sectoral (e.g., the General Transport Master Plan, the National Health Strategy, etc.).
     These priorities are generally stable across time, so stakeholders know what to expect and can plan accordingly:
     what programs finance which types of interventions, under which eligibility conditions, in what timeframe, etc.
      •	
     A predictable and stable timeline, with multiyear budgeting and an effective IT infrastructure: The seven-
     year EU programming cycle (e.g., 2007-2013, 2014-2020) maintains the same strategic objectives, planning
     documents, and implementation procedures throughout. Even if political power alternates in that timeframe, no
     changes occur to EU operational programmes and their corresponding funding once these are agreed with the EC
     in the first year. Stability fosters opportunities to coordinate for enhanced impact. In all this effort, it is critical
     to rely on a functional and effective data collection and data sharing system.
      •	
     A common legal and procedural framework across all EU-funded programs: The Common Provisions
     Regulation No. 1303/2013 was adopted in order to: establish a clear link with the Europe 2020 strategy; improve
                                                                                                                       24
     coordination; ensure steady implementation; and facilitate potential beneficiaries’ access to the funds. All
     programs have similar application procedures and a rigorous, transparent selection process, explained in depth
     in their respective Applicant Guides.
      •	
     Increasingly effective citizen engagement throughout the entire process: from designing a community’s strategy
     to individual project cycles (from pre- to post-implementation). The new Community-Led Local Development
     (CLLD) instrument is a testimony to the increased focus on citizen engagement in EU-funded operations.

68. All these elements are critically important for establishing a solid foundation for coordination and, indeed, they
all affect the choice of financing criteria for the PNDL and other state-budget-funded instruments. A purposeful
focus on coordination means that from the start investment programs are designed to have financing criteria that
are equivalent or complementary, depending on the sector. Financing criteria can also encourage coordination by
prioritizing (e.g., through “bonus points’ in the evaluation process) integrated interventions – i.e., proposals that prove
to be coordinated across sectors and/or across administrative levels. This was the approach of the EU-funded PNDR
2007-2013, and it is the new approach of the ROP 2014-2020 with respect to strategic county roads investments
in each region. When programming is anchored in real needs, it enables the design of financing criteria that deliver
high potential impact and still demonstrate financial sustainability (more on this below). In addition, multiyear
timeline and budget enable managing authorities of EU and state-funded programs to coordinate interventions
over a longer time horizon, reducing the risk of cannibalization between the two types of funding. Finally, a common
procedural framework for all state-budget-funded programs – harmonized with EU-funded instruments – requires
transparent, clear, and specific selection criteria. This would deliver added credibility and broader appeal for state-
funded programs like the PNDL and would also enable projects to move between different pipelines more easily.
Whenever there is sufficient room under EU funds, projects should always be financed through such resources, which
are nonreimbursable (and, hence, much cheaper than state-budget funds).

69. There is one important caveat to the principle that state-budget-funded programs should replicate fully the
practices of EU-funded instruments – in one word: capacity. In truth, resources available to process applications
and oversee projects are much lower in departments responsible for state-budget-funded programs versus Managing
Authorities of EU structural funds (fewer staff, lower wages, etc.). Compared to the ROP, for instance, a program like
the PNDL is characterized by a larger portfolio of smaller investments (the investments financed through the PNDL
2014 were on average three times smaller than similar projects financed through the ROP 2007-2013 and the PNDR
2007-2013), which calls for simpler yet equally rigorous procedures throughout the project cycle. Over 700 people are
involved in the management and implementation of the ROP, which also benefits from a dedicated budget for technical
assistance, whereby it can afford to also hire external evaluators. The PNDL relies on only around 20 people in the
MRDPA and has virtually no budget allocated for hiring external consultants. This also means that a competitive grant
approach whereby beneficiaries across a region / across the country have to compete for available funds is not feasible
under the current PNDL’s capacity constraints. Equally important, previous assessments of EU funds, including by
the World Bank,25 have noted signs of excessive bureaucratization in how the Romanian Government implements EU
regulations, so it is important to adopt only elements that work well and err on the side of simplicity.

70. The methodology deployed to revamp the PNDL’s prioritization and selection criteria is straightforward: (i)
estimate investment needs in a particular sector (e.g., based on statistical data, available cost standards, etc.); (ii)
decide on a formula for allocating funds across counties; and (iii) decide on a formula for selecting/ranking projects
within a county; (iv) identify projects that can be financed by EU funds and guide them to the relevant operational
programme; and (v) arrive at the final pool of projects proposed for PNDL financing. Of course, ongoing and new
investments are treated differently: the former should receive priority and new investments should only be started if
there are sufficient budgetary resources to cover their full costs (not just in the first year, but in every year through
completion). How much the percentage completion rate will weigh in the selection of investments is a decision that
belongs to the MRDPA management. It is likely that no new investments will be funded for a period of time in the
absence of fiscal and financial space to finish ongoing projects in a rationalized portfolio.
71. While each sector calls for its own financing criteria to match its specificities, there are multiple common
categories that these criteria ”test for.” The following are in line with previous Bank proposals to the Government
(as reflected in Emergency Ordinance 88/2013 for the prioritization of significant projects at the national level).
     •	
      First, the criteria proposed in this report test for actual needs on the ground and, by the same token, seek
      to estimate potential impact of proposed interventions, both in terms of numbers and in terms of quality of
      improvement. Potential measures include: technical status (e.g., paved/unpaved road); demand (e.g., traffic levels,
      number of potential beneficiaries, level of development of a particular locality, number of inhabitants/physician,
      school-aged population, etc.); and opportunity (e.g., a road’s proximity to a major urban center).
     •	
      Second, the criteria test for strategic alignment of a proposed project with existing sectoral strategies: for
      example, for water and wastewater, the intervention should be included in the regional Water and Wastewater
      Master Plans.

25
     See the reports on ”ROP 2.0: MA-IB Coordination and Beneficiary Support,” World Bank, 2014.

29
                           Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?


  •	Third, the criteria also include a measure of financial sustainability. This seeks to correct the current issue of local
    authorities disregarding operations and maintenance (O&M) costs related to infrastructure projects financed
    by an EU grant or another form of support from the national government. The Financial Sustainability Indicator
    (FSI) looks at whether a local authority can afford to spend on operations and maintenance related to new
    infrastructure investments given their budgetary standing and trends.
  •	Fourth, to the extent possible, selection criteria should also factor in each projects’ readiness level. As a general
    rule, the more advanced an investment in its implementation, the higher priority it should receive. The are
    important caveats to this, however: (i) some of the projects should not receive any more funding, despite the sunk
    costs, as they were poorly designed from the start (e.g., wastewater treatment plants in very small localities);
    and (ii) the data on project completion rates (as a proxy for ”readiness”) are insufficient, unreliable, and variable
    over the course of a year (since the PNDL functions on an annual basis, a project may have one completion
    rate when funding is allocated, and another completion rate when funds actually make it to the beneficiary,
    as localities often fund projects from their own sources). Project readiness can be deployed by the MRDPA as
    a selection criterion – in addition to the criteria mentioned above – only after rationalizing the current project
    portfolio (i.e., eliminating all projects that should not receive any financing) and after developing a functioning
    system for data collection and analysis regarding project implementation status and completion rates.
  •	Fifth, proposed criteria under each sector seek to enable coordination of PNDL projects with other investments
    funded by the EU and/or the state budget. At a basic level, projects eligible for EU funds should be ”redirected” from
    the PNDL pipeline to an EU operational programme (e.g., ROP, Large Infrastructure, National Rural Development
    Programme) by checking whether the proposed project has been submitted for nonreimbursable financing before
    granting PNDL funding. Moreover, for particular interventions, bonus points can be awarded in the scoring
    process if the applicant demonstrates coordination with other funding sources, other sectors, and other (local)
    governments.

     •	Finally, integrated planning should be encouraged by prioritizing projects included in an Integrated Development
       Strategy, following the model of the EU-funded ROP 2007-2013 (with Integrated Development Plans under Axis
       1) and of ROP 2014-2020 (with Integrated Urban Development Strategies – SIDU – under Axis 4).

72. Annex 1 includes the detailed project selection grids, including detailed criteria and their corresponding
weights, and a list of principles for how coordination between PNDL and EU funds could be ensured. Again, in
addition to what is proposed here, the MRDPA will have to factor in project completion rates and make a decision
regarding the weight of this additional criterion. The proposed lists of criteria for each have been validated with sector
experts and key stakeholders, including potential beneficiaries at the local and county level. The maps reproduced
below show the results of applying the proposed criteria for local-level infrastructure: local roads, health, education,
cultural, and sports infrastructure.

     2b           Support the adoption of actual multi-year budgeting


73. The full adoption of multiyear budgeting in Romania holds great promise for enhancing the coordination and
impact of PNDL investments. The main advantages of a multiannual PNDL would include: (i) strategic focus over
a longer time horizon, meaning more stable policy priorities; (ii) manageable project portfolios, in line with available
resources (i.e., no new projects can begin in the absence of required resources for the full implementation period);
(iii) enhanced predictability across the entire value chain, from the MRDPA to program beneficiaries and project-level
contractors; (iv) improved correlation with current multiannual instruments (EU structural funds); and (v) simplified
procedures and reduced bureaucracy by signing truly multiannual contracts. Indeed, the successful adoption of
multiannual budgeting for investment programs like the PNDL requires a substantial effort from many players, with
the Center of Government and the Ministry of Public Finance (MPF) playing leadership roles, though the MRDPA can
act as a key driver of needed reforms. Keeping in mind the need to triage and rationalize its large and unsustainable
project portfolio, as well as the broader benefits of multiannual budgeting in Romania, the MRDPA has the potential
to become a key driver of needed reforms.

74. It is also true that the culture of annual budgets is strong in Romania – partly because of legal and regulatory
limitations, partly because of mentalities, and partly because of capacity reasons. The Constitution stipulates,
under Article 138, paragraph 2, that ”the Government develops the draft of the budget annually […] and submits it
for the Parliament’s approval.” During field interviews, interlocutors in certain institutions, including in the Ministry
of Public Finance, have noted that this particular article is an important constraint against adopting a full-fledged
multiyear budgeting framework. In practice, for an investment spanning multiple years such as a new bridge in a
city, the City Hall writes up a contract with the contractor and, annually, signs an addendum stipulating the sums
available for that given year. In addition, there are three key capacity constraints worth noting: high unpredictability
on the revenue side due to frequent changes in taxes and unstable (and generally low) collection levels; weak ability of
the Ministry of Public Finance to provide sound economic and fiscal forecasts; and strongly fragmented, rudimentary
IT systems that make it very hard to track programs and projects.26

75. On the question regarding the feasibility of a multiannual PNDL given current legislative and policy constraints,
there are more arguments in favor than against. For one, EU-funded interventions currently ”run through” the
national budget and expenditures get subsequently reimbursed; this suggests that it is possible to have multiyear
infrastructure investment projects even under the status quo constraints of annual budgeting, provided that there
is firm commitment to a clear annual budget allocation. Moreover, the Romanian Law on Public Finances (Law
500/2002), even under its current form, appears to permit multiyear budgeting. Article 4 (5) provides that the budget
may include ”multiannual commitments,” with these commitments defined by Article 2 (14) as ”amounts allocated
to certain programs, projects, subprojects, objectives and the like, which are carried on for a period longer than a
year and give rise to commitment credits and budgetary credits.” As for the annuality provision of the Romanian
Constitution, there is nothing stopping the Government or the Parliament from adhering to multiyear targets, which
is essentially what happens under the Fiscal Responsibility Law (though room for improvement definitely exists). To
follow the letter of the law, the Government would develop and approve a multiyear budget annually, rolling it forward
every year (as it happens in other countries too).

76. What should then be the key elements of a truly multiannual budgeting system for investment programs
like the PNDL?27 First, the multiannual appropriation reserved for a particular investment has to only go to that
investment; otherwise, the same problems will continue: ”drip funding,” delays, inefficient expenditures, and diverting
money from one investment to another. Second – and related to the first condition – is to have a solid project

26
  Over the few last years, an important IT project is under implementation (the FOREXEBUG system). But this does not solve all problems, as it
does not cover public investment projects or the investment programs.
27
   The World Bank has an ongoing technical assistance project with the Ministry of Public Finance on the topic of public investment management,
including the prioritization of infrastructure projects at the national level. Several of the key recommendations made in this report are adapted
to the PNDL and to investments at the subnational level from the ”Draft Report on Strengthening the Link between Prioritized Projects and the
Budget,” Advisory Services of Strengthening Public Investment Management, World Bank, May 2015.

monitoring system, tracking at all times what the projects’ total cost is, what contracts are signed, and when. Third,
the total value of multiannual appropriations for a spending agency must be clearly and credibly defined. This would
require the fiscal-budgetary strategy (Law 69/2010) and the corresponding laws on approved ceilings to define limits
specifically for multiannual appropriations for each major ministry/spending agency (this is not the case, currently).
Under such a system, no new projects could be pursued unless extra budgetary room becomes available for current
and future years, equal to the new projects’ total cost. It would thus be impossible to reshuffle projects within a
ministry’s portfolio (or program, like the PNDL), since each investment would have a clear, dedicated multiannual
appropriation. Last but not least, the system requires strong monitoring and evaluation functions from both within
and outside the MRDPA. The MPF and other audit and control institutions like the Court of Accounts and the
Audit Authority should monitor project allocations and, respectively, corresponding expenditures, while the Center of
Government should regularly evaluate the performance of investment programs.28

77. For its part, the MRDPA can take several steps to facilitate the full adoption of multiannual budgeting
in Romania? For one, the MRDPA should ask to be included in the fiscal-budgetary strategy from 2016 onward.
Currently, it is not one of the ten ministries that are covered by this framework, which means that there is virtually
no multiannual financial planning and no ceilings defined for the main categories of expenditures (including the
PNDL). Moreover, the MRDPA should work with the MPF to promote the establishment of ceilings and multiannual
appropriations for baseline capital expenditures (for the current project portfolio) and new investment projects.
Again, the current system does not make this distinction, which is critical for having a functional model of strategic
prioritization of a limited number of projects.

78. More specific to the PNDL, the MRDPA should consider pursuing the following measures for turning the
program into a de facto multiannual instrument:
     •	
     Conceptualize what the PNDL could look like through 2020 – essentially the time interval matching the EU programming
     period. This is a first step to greater internal discipline in allocating resources to PNDL projects and, in fact,
     does not depend on the Ministry of Finance formally adopting the model presented above. All that is needed is
     sufficient commitment by the MRDPA to stick to a certain split in the funding allocated to the main sectors
     under the PNDL. Assuming the PNDL budget will be at least at 2014 levels, the total envelope through 2020
     would be RON 13 billion – or EUR 2.8 billion.29
     •	
     Next, the MRDPA should rationalize the PNDL portfolio based on budget constraints. The current portfolio would take
     over 15 years to complete, assuming that 2014 funding levels would hold going forward. The rationalization
     should therefore be done for each sector by: (i) deploying the sector-specific criteria (e.g., those listed in chapters
     4-6 of the current report); and (ii) considering project completion status, with more advanced works taking
     priority. Some investments will have to be put on hold, others will have to search for alternative funding (e.g., EU
     funds), and others will have to be canceled.
     •	
     The MRDPA should further set the PNDL baseline (for the budgeted year and for the programming period). This would
     cover all ongoing investments that passed the test (i.e., remained in the portfolio) in the previous step. All these
     projects should be finalized according to their implementation timeline (without intervening on the portfolio of
     ongoing investments to exclude some projects and/or introduce new ones), budgeting properly based on costs
     expected for each year.
     •	
     The MRDPA should consider new investments separately from ongoing projects and only when allowed by the available
     budget envelope. New investment projects should be funded exclusively by the difference between the total PNDL
     budgetary allocation (budgeted year and programming period) and the PNDL baseline (as defined above). These
     projects would be prioritized according to the sector-specific criteria in this report. For all new projects accepted,
     the corresponding planned budget allocations must be included in the PNDL baseline for future years.
     •	
     The MRDPA should develop its IT systems for tracking how projects are performing. This is needed to monitor the large
     number of projects in the PNDL portfolio and know, at all times, which stage they are at, how much money
     they are absorbing, and whether they are on track or face delays. The same database would also capture the
     multiannual requirements of each project in the portfolio, making sure that the total costs are properly reflected
     in the available budgetary envelope.

              •	The MRDPA should strengthen overall monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms to make necessary corrections in
                the financing and implementation of the program promptly. The PNDL should have performance indicators for the
                entire program (e.g., number of projects, total beneficiaries, absorption rates, etc.) and for each sector (length
                of rehabilitated roads, number of additional people with access to water and sanitation, etc.). This would enable
                measuring actual results, in line with the principles of performance-based budgeting (the most advanced form
                of multiannual budgeting, virtually nonexistent in Romania). The MRDPA should also rely on third parties for
                unbiased evaluations of the PNDL’s efficiency and effectiveness, both during and post implementation.

                           Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

Box 2. Recent MRDPA steps toward a multiannual PNDL


  During the course of this technical assistance, the MDRPA took some first steps toward making the PNDL a multinational
  program. However, upon close analysis, it is clear that the measures taken, while welcomed, are insufficient.

  GEO 46/2015 warrants the all contracts signed for financing PNDL investments are multiannual for a maximum duration
  of four years, which can be extended by another two years, Beneficiaries estimate annual expenditures for each financed
  project. Moreover, payments are made on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, which can incentivize beneficiaries to speed up the
  implementation of projects, but also has downsides, as explained below. There are also harsh measures for punishing those
  beneficiaries that deploy funds transferred for PNDL investments toward other activities (e.g., suspension of shared quotas
  of the Personal Income Tax, etc.).

  In short, the benefits of the changes may be two-fold - to be confirmed in practice: increase the predictability of annual al-
  locations (provided that the MRDPA can actually cover the sums requested by beneficiaries annually); and a prioritization of
  payments to projects that demonstrate they can “ absorb “ the money by submitting reimbursement requests diligently.

  The deeper the issues of the PNDL, however, remain unresolved, and some issues may be aggravated by the proposed
  changes. For one, the selection process that chooses which projects get financed (initially) is still opaque and biased. Only
  reimbursement requests are more objectively prioritized based on the FIFO rule. But this may also generate unintended
  consequences: financing projects with low completion rates to the detriment of investments that are almost finished. This
  would only worsen the issue of inefficient financing for investment over very long periods of time.

  More importantly, GEO 46/2015 notes that transfers/payments to beneficiaries are made within the limits of the annual
  budget of the MRDPA. Without having a clear multiannual budget for the MRDPA and PNDL as a whole and without ratio-
  nalizing the current project portfolio - which, as noted earlier, would take 15 years or more to finish - there is still a signifi-
  cant risk of drip funding. The recommendations made earlier to reduce the size of the portfolio, including by suspending/
  canceling investments that do not make economic sense (e.g., sanitation systems in localities of under 2000 p.e.), still hold.
  There are no provisions freezing the financing of new projects in the absence of sufficient budgets, so the problems of the
  past will likely persist, except now the MRDPA will have an idea of what everything costs over a number of years. But this
  obvously does not mean that it can cover these (estimated) expenses.

  Finally, it is not clear what happens after the period of six years expires. Would the projects be cancelled? Would the benefi-
  ciaries have to pay back the money? All that remains to be determined.




 2c              Assess, pilot, and scale up territorial contracts (TCs)


79. Based on the experience of other countries, territorial contracts (TCs) between national and sub-national
entities hold the potential to become a very powerful tool for the coordination of investments in Romania. At
the same time, it is important to recognize that adoption of TCs would be much harder than adoption of multiyear
budgeting, for which a starting point (albeit insufficient) does exist. TCs involve stakeholders from public, private, and
nonprofit sectors, usually at a regional level. They include a vision for that particular territory, with goals, activities
(projects), and performance indicators (for output, outcome, and impact). They can be transactional, shaping financial
allocations through a series of positive incentives and/or sanctions; or relational, trust-based. Most importantly,
territorial contracts have the potential to account for both state-budget and EU funds, setting priority projects and
”dividing them up” between financing sources of various kinds.

80. In the Romanian context, territorial contracts would help mitigate the high volatility of strategic investment
priorities. First, territorial contracts would offer an opportunity to bring stakeholders together – across party lines
and across sectors (public, private, and nonprofit) – and establish a list of priority projects for an entire programming
period. Second, they would be perceived as stronger accountability mechanisms compared to existing documents
(e.g., development strategies). They could have specific sanctions for potential breaches, penalizing those parties that
decide to deviate unilaterally from set priorities. Third, territorial contracts would follow a clear format, requiring
subnational and national authorities to think through a list of priority projects, but also decide early on regarding
                                                                                                                                        36
                             Harmonizing State and EU Funded Projects in Regions | Final Synthesis

funding sources and parties accountable for implementation. This framework would help define, from the start, who
is responsible for what. Fourth, by setting a more stable list of priorities, territorial contracts would reduce the risk
of ”drip funding” and starting more projects than financially sustainable. Finally, this tool would enable authorities
across administrative levels to nurture a culture based on partnership and collaboration, which is very valuable in a
context where ever-more-complex projects require public actors to be increasingly creative and collaborative – not
just across administrative levels, but also across sectors.

81. In addition to strong political commitment, several key principles should be followed for an effective deployment
of TCs in the current Romanian context and, in fact, several of these recommendations hold regardless of
whether TCs ultimately materialize. The first is to integrate – not duplicate – existing planning documents at all
relevant administrative levels (development strategies, spatial plans, programming documents for EU and state-
budget funds, national sectoral strategies, etc.). Ideally, Romania should also have a specific legislation regulating
TCs, either as a new law on (regional) development (per the Polish model of the 2006 Act regarding the principles
of development policy) or as an amendment to the Law on Public Administration as to allow signing and enforcing
agreements between national and sub-national authorities. Moreover, if one party breaches the TCs, there need to
be clear sanctions, while on the positive side projects included in a TC could be rewarded with bonus points during
evaluation processes (whether under EU or state-budget-funded programs) or, in the aggregate, regions that manage
to maintain the same TC priorities for an entire programming period may receive additional transfers from the
national budget. To the full extent possible, the TCs should have the same timeline as EU funds (i.e., seven plus two-
three years) and state-budget funds should also be able to operate in a multiannual framework.

82. The MRDPA, as the ministry in charge with public administration affairs in Romania, should take on the main
role in the adoption of TCs and in creating the aforementioned conditions for their success. Specific steps would
include:
  •	  Create a technical task team responsible for evaluating in-depth the opportunity of adopting territorial contracts in
      Romania. This internal team could also collaborate with outside experts.
  •	  Assemble a group of legal experts and explore requirements, needed changes, etc. This is important to determine what
      can be done under the current legal framework and what changes are needed, if any. It would be particularly
      critical to establish the type of sanctions and positive rewards that could be tied to the adoption of territorial
      contracts.
  •	  Launch a consultation process with subnational governments to test the idea and decide on the optimal structure. This
      could be done through a series of events in each region, enlisting the help of Regional Development Agencies. Of
      particular importance would be to decide who the parties to the agreement could be: for example, the MRDPA
      and county councils, or the MRDPA and Regional Development Councils (i.e., the body that includes county and
      local authorities in a particular region), etc.
  •	  Prepare a full action plan and timeline for implementation. This will depend on generating sufficient momentum and
      buy-in from all stakeholders involved.
  •	  Launch pilot territorial contracts in a number of jurisdictions.
  •	  Monitor and evaluate pilot results and adapt, launch, and implement the model for the national scale. External experts
      should be involved to assess the results of TCs, covering a series of critical areas: legal; technical; policy design;
      and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).




 3a            Improve the technical documentation of investment projects financed
               through state-budget programs

83. A major issue identified during the assessment of a sample of PNDL applications was the poor quality of
the technical documentation. To make sure that the applications follow the requirements, it is recommended that
the MRDPA prepare and provide an Applicants Guide for the PNDL. This guide would provide interested potential
beneficiaries with all the information needed to prepare the application, including available funds, documentation
required, and the type of projects to be prioritized (which may change for different programming periods). The guide
should detail the filling-in manner, the eligibility conditions for the project and the applicant (and for the partners, if
applicable), and should cover compliance, assessment, contracting, implementation, settlement, project completion
37
                           Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

and final payment, the checklist of documents, the assessment grids, the financing contract template, the design,
execution, supervision, performance and audit contract templates.

84. The Applicant Guide would ensure complete transparency of the entire PNDL process and provide a coherent
and fair framework for all applications. The guide for the Regional Operational Programme (ROP) may be used as a
basis for the preparation of the PNDL guide. The documents and forms specified in the Applicants Guide shall bring
rigor in drafting the documentations for the requests for funding and would make the entire process easier, including
during the implementation and upon the project’s completion. The period for assessing the requests for funding is
also expected to become shorter as a result of reducing the number of cases where clarifications are needed during
the assessment process.

85. Once the Applicant Guide will be available, a series of awareness-raising campaigns are necessary to ensure
the document has reached the potential beneficiaries of the PNDL. At least one meeting with the local authorities
should be organized in each county, or a few meetings per region at the Regional Development Agencies may also
work well to promote the funding opportunity. An improved website for the program is also necessary for quickly
providing all relevant documents and information for future and current beneficiaries. PNDL is publicized on the
official web page of MRDPA, which includes Order 1851/ 2013, with all annexes, and GEO 28/2013. Not much other
information about this program is available. The communication around the program and on the financed projects
is a key condition for stimulating potential applicants to prepare and submit projects. The official page of the PNDL
should publish the financial allocations per county, the list of projects contracted for financing (now included on the
website), including the related amounts, and the projects’ implementation stage.

86. A related recommendation is to help strengthen the capacity of PNDL applicants and beneficiaries. The
experience of the EU-funded programs in the 2007-2013 programming period indicates that local authorities need
continuous technical assistance, especially during the project preparation phase. A relative easy way to deliver this
kind of assistance is to set up a help-desk system, either at central level (MRDPA) or inside the intermediary
bodies, if any, depending on the chosen institutional architecture of the management system (for example, Regional
Development Agencies or County Councils could play this role).

87. It is also necessary to increase of capacity at MRDPA level to appraise projects. A systematic training program
could be set-up at the ministerial level, so that the decision on project selection is consistent across the Ministry.
An example could be the approach pursued by Ireland’s Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit. As a key component
of strengthening the country’s public investment management system, the unit has been promoting the delivery
of professional training in public investment management through the country’s Civil Service and Development
Centre. Even countries with long established public investment management systems, like the UK, are giving renewed
emphasis to systematic training: the established UK Major Projects Authority intends to train 200–300 civil servants
over the next five years through its Major Projects Leadership Academy. Among emerging economies, Slovenia’s
public investment management regulation reinforces the importance of developing and maintaining capacities by
mandating the finance ministry to define training requirements and organize training sessions.




     3b          Revise cost standard policies and the Eligible Expenditures Order


88. Implementation of cost standards for infrastructure is imperfect and has posed challenges to beneficiaries.
The intention for deploying the cost standards is praiseworthy as a solution for keeping project costs under control,
as well as to help in planning The problem is that current cost standards are not sufficiently developed and, in some
cases (i.e., wastewater systems), they do not exist at all.30 They also do not reflect updated nominal values (i.e.,
values have not been adjusted for inflation since 2010), or supply and demand fluctuations; and it is also unclear if
comparisons between project values and cost standards should reflect RON or EUR values.

89. Although the technical solutions included in the legislation on cost standards (particularly for the road
infrastructure) are just a recommendation, they are adopted by all applicants. Designers thus choose lower-quality,
cheaper, less efficient technologies, which may result in higher long-term costs. In this context, it is challenging to
30
  The MRDPA currently uses instead a rule of thumb whereby cost standards for wastewater systems are roughly 1.5 times the cost standards
for water supply systems.
                                                                                                                                     38
                                                  Harmonizing State and EU Funded Projects in Regions | Final Synthesis

     adopt new / greener technologies that may come at a premium cost upfront, but which may be cheaper over the
     long term (e.g., if one takes life-cycle costing into consideration). Despite all this, the cost per km still varies quite a
     bit. Thus, for the projects with complete data (88 projects), the average value for road rehabilitation/modernization
     is RON 900,652 per km, with the smallest amount of RON 400,601 per km, for 2.1 km of road rehabilitation in Cluj
     county, and the highest amount of RON 2,612,894 per km, for 21.79 km of street rehabilitation in Constanta county.

     90. Cost standards should be updated or waived completely. In the latter scenario, the authorities could use instead
     a list of reference prices denominated in EUR to make sure that costs are kept under control. In this case databases
     with ranges for local prices for the main materials should be created. In any case, technical solutions proposed should
     be only indicative and designers / beneficiaries should be properly informed that they may adopt alternative options
     that are superior in terms of short / long-term costs and quality.

                                                                                                                                                            1,500-2,000

                                           Price per km for road rehabilitation / modernization (th. RON)

    91. As for the Eligible Expenditures Order (EEO), because the PNDL is in its entirety a state-budget-funded
    program, with money coming essentially from the same source, there is no reason to over-regulate beyond GD
    28/2008. Currently, the methodological norms specify a list of non-eligible expenditures (article 8 (3)), including
    feasibility studies, specialty studies, technical assistance, taxes, etc. The list, as it stands, is arguably a better option
    than what was deployed under the ROP 2007-2013, which defined what can be financed, excluding by default
    anything that was not specifically mentioned in the Order of Eligible Expenditures. In other words, it is nearly always
    better to define what does not qualify for reimbursement, as currently under the PNDL. It may still be worth it,
    however, to look at the list of non-eligible expenditures and decide whether it would warrant an exception.




                     4       Enhance the design of public infrastructure projects in Romania


    92. There are multiple recommendations for improving the design of public infrastructure projects in Romania.
    For one, it is mandatory to align the technical standards in force to European standards, reflecting climate change,
    traffic modifications, and other new concepts environment friendly. Some standards are too old and their content is
    not up to date compared to international best practices.

    93. There should be a switch of the current Romanian classification to a well- structured functional classification
    for roads. This would include relating technical classes and maintenance classes to a revised functional classification
    via design speed and traffic volumes. Functional classes provide continuity for the road’s design features (and
    other road management matters). Functional classification is also important to land uses and helps both the road
    administrations and the road users structure the network.

   39
                        Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

94. The implementation of the Road Safety Audit and Road Safety Inspection should be done according to the
current legislation. ARR should organize technical courses for the accreditation of auditors/ inspectors, but also new
and clear regulations should be established according to the law in force. Another important aspect that should be
considered is related to the prices for a RSA or RSI. They should be revised and adapted to the economic situation
of Romania.

95. Traffic and environmental impact studies should be required when starting a design project, just as geotechnical
and topographic studies are required currently. This way, the solution of new construction, modernization, or
rehabilitation will have better technical support.

96. The implementation of drinking water safety management and food safety systems such as ISO 22000 is
needed. Many water utilities in Europe have chosen to be ISO 22000 certified because this ensures safe healthy
water throughout the entire supply system. Romanian regional water operators should adopt similar measures.

97. Last but not least, the verification of the project should be made by specialists certified as technical verifiers,
different and independent of the design specialists who elaborate the projects. The beneficiaries should be the
ones to contract the technical verifiers, and not include this task into the design phase, which is in fact against the
law. Put differently, practice needs to reflect what the law mandates.




   5            Develop and adopt a National Housing Strategy


98. Improving the functioning of Romania’s public role in the housing sector could significantly enhance conditions
at relatively low costs. These improvements would not only make housing more affordable and of better quality, but
would also rebound to the broader economy as well. The Strategy’s basic principle should be a ‘functional’ housing
market that involves both the public and the private sector.

As illustrated in the figure below, a basic principle of the Strategy should be to aim for a ‘functional’ housing market,
in which:

      •   The public sector plays a key role in providing direct housing assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable
          groups;

      • The public sector actively intervenes in specific themes or sectors facing market failure or negative externalities;
      • The public sector creates incentives to change behavior and leverage private investments for affordable housing
          through ”assisted” market solutions; and

      • The private sector is enabled to serve the housing needs of middle and upper income groups.




                                                                                                                         40

The following set of measures is recommended:


                              A. Urgently initiate seismic retrofitting of
                               structurally unsafe residential buildings
The government may consider prioritizing financial and technical assistance for seismic retrofits of structurally
unsafe buildings. Funding for this program could be through a direct central budget allocation channeled through the
proposed National Housing Fund (NHF), discussed later in the section.

• Develop a Seismic Risk Mitigation Plan for residential buildings categorized structurally unsafe
       First and foremost, a mitigation plan would need to be developed for seismic risk mitigation in residential
       buildings, which outlines a range of approaches to be used under the different scenarios – for example, historic /
       non-historic buildings, level of risk severity, etc. – together with a participatory process to engage with resident
       communities to create awareness and ease the process of relocation.

• Provide transitional accommodation for residents during retrofitting as well as prevent occupation of dangerous
  buildings
      The urgent need for seismic retrofitting will also require a plan to ensure that residents temporarily move out
      of dangerous buildings into transitional shelter. This shelter will need to be provided by the state. Since it will
      take some years to build up an adequate stock of public housing that can be used for this purpose (Necessity
      Housing), other alternatives may be considered in the interim: the government might consider offering other
      more flexible incentives to households to vacate the premises so that improvements can be undertaken - for
      example, rental vouchers to the households temporarily displaced by the retrofitting, with special assistance
      focused on the most vulnerable groups. The voucher amount should ideally be a progressive subsidy that
      targets those most in need.31 Importantly, besides providing alternatives to their current location, a law would
      need to be put in place that proscribes people from living in unsafe buildings.

• Implement structural retrofits
       Once the buildings are vacated, they will need to be retrofitted or demolished and reconstructed – based on
       a thorough technical analysis. Financing for such retrofitting would largely come from the government, with
       a small co-financing element from the resident households, depending on their income levels and the value of
       the property. The subsidy can be progressive – for example, the co-financing requirement for households in the
       lowest 30 income percentile could be zero, while those in the top 30 income percentile could be required to
31
   For example, 100% of established standardized market rent for households in the bottom 30 income percentile; 90% for households in the 31-50
income percentile; 80% for the 51-75 income percentile and so on.
41
                         Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

       contribute up to 30-40% of the cost of repairs. The resident household’s contribution could take the form of an
       interest-free loan (as is the case under the current seismic retrofitting program). For properties with commercial
       or other monetary potential, the private sector may be encouraged to participate through incentives such as
       tax breaks, placing liens on valuable but risk-exposed property, etc. The construction of additional public
       housing (to be used as Necessity Housing), as needed, might be executed by the NHA, based on its experience
       in undertaking large-scale housing projects.


           B. Prioritize improvement of old housing and neighborhoods
•   Improve the quality of communist-era housing
       There is lack of awareness among the public regarding the law which requires HOAs to maintain the common
       areas of their buildings. The law and the obligations of the occupants needs to be spelled out more clearly and
       disseminated more widely. At the same time, enforcement is key, and it is critical that ownership ‘obligations’
       that correspond to ownership ‘rights’ be clearly spelled out and implemented. At the same time, it is important
       to provide the necessary support to HOAs – and more specifically to poorer households who are members of
       these HOAs – to ensure that the cost of repairs is manageable. To this effect, partial grants or co-financing
       covering a significant portion of the cost of repairs may be given to HOAs that meet certain eligibility criteria,
       and this could be done from a window under the proposed National Housing Fund (NHF, described under section
       H). The contribution of the HOA (20-50% of cost of repairs) may come from cash reserves of the HOA, if
       available, or through a loan from a commercial bank which is guaranteed by the NHF. Additional grants may be
       given to poor households for example, those earning below the median income, to ensure that their cost burden
       for housing and all utilities combined does not exceed 30-40% of the monthly income.

• Improve the quality of historic buildings and neighborhoods
       The NHF could provide financial assistance to owners of historic residential buildings/ dwellings – both HOAs and
       individual households – to undertake improvements of these structures. As in the case of non-historic buildings
       described above, this could take the form of a grant, or a loan with a large co-financing element because, as
       mentioned, the cost burden may often be too high for individuals or HOAs to bear, and the improvement of
       such buildings is in the larger public interest. The financial assistance would be most effective if linked to a
       technical assistance component

• Link energy efficiency (EE) / thermal insulation program with general building improvement
       Repairs of common areas in multifamily buildings should ideally also be tied to measures for improving energy
       efficiency as well as seismic/structural safety. The massive financing made available for EE measures offers a
       significant opportunity to instill a culture of building maintenance more generally. The EE program offers the
       largest pot of money for the housing sector in Romania, and may be used as a means to foster this sense of
       ownership and responsibility– this support for creating interested participants is essential and will be cost-
       effective and sustainable in the long term.


            C. Prioritize housing assistance to the poor and vulnerable
•   Provide security of tenure and protection from illegal evictions
       There is a need to accelerate land tenure programs, especially in poorer neighborhoods – possibly by introducing
       alternative land tenure instruments – e.g., renewable occupancy permits until they receive a legal title. It
       would be advisable to subject all evictions to checks and balances to determine whether they are justified;
       appropriate legislation needs to be developed to this effect. Legislation should also be developed to allow NGOs
       to represent a community in the case of forced evictions.

• Use a customized approach and expand the menu of options
       TA one-size-fits-all approach can often fail to target the poor and vulnerable. The government could consider
       expanding public sector housing assistance beyond ”social housing” to include a menu of options that are
       not just more appropriate for the recipient households and their lifestyles, but also more value-for-money for
       the government, more equitable, and more sustainable. A range of housing-related interventions – such as in-
       situ infrastructure upgrading, site-and-services, subsidized rental housing – may be considered for poor and
       marginalized communities, linked with finance, community participation, and income generation.


                                                                                                                      42
                            Harmonizing State and EU Funded Projects in Regions | Final Synthesis


• Improve targeting of subsidies for EE programs
      Public grants used to reduce the economic burden on citizens, such as for insulation measures, should be
      targeted first at the poorest and most disadvantaged citizens – such as those living in social housing. Similarly,
      special ‘allowances’ funded by the state may be awarded to lower-income households in private buildings who
      are ‘forced’ to participate in insulation programs because a 2/3rd majority has been reached in the vote to
      participate in the thermal insulation programs..

• Apply a participatory approach to housing
      The government may consider adopting two basic elements in all housing programs targeted to the poor:
      (i) Emphasize ‘process’, not ‘product’, with a systematic, sustained and structured engagement with the
      communities to identify the appropriate interventions and to build ownership; and (ii) Encourage inclusive
      developments, and retain the social fabric, especially in the case of the poorest and most vulnerable households.

• Designate ”Improvement Areas”
      For certain segments of the population, the goal of meeting current building standards will take time to
      realize. Meanwhile, their priorities may place a higher value on space than, for example, services. It is, therefore,
      recommended to permit building to alternative, lower standards in such cases. This can be done by designating
      ”Improvement Areas”, within which different standards are applied. Such regulations should ensure compliance
      with the ‘hard’ components (standards for structural stability, day lighting and ventilation, basic sanitation)
      but be flexible in terms of the ‘soft’ components (e.g., building materials, finishes of walls, doors/windows, roof
      etc.), which can be upgraded over time.
• Factor in utility expenses in housing subsidy calculations
      The current subsidy on social rental housing mandating that the rent not exceed 10% of household income
      is not appropriate for households in the lowest three income deciles – because utility costs make housing
      unaffordable. For these households, a subsidy ensuring that the household does not pay more than 10-15% of
      income on the housing and utility bills combined would make housing more affordable. Also, the problem of
      incoming tenants of social housing ‘inheriting’ the debt of previous occupants may be rectified by changing the
      law to make the debt and the account linked to the person, not the property.
• Include a separate program for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and disabled
      The Housing Law specifically defines disabled persons for state assistance, and the disabled and elderly are
      identified as vulnerable groups targeted by the Law on Combating Marginalization through Housing. However,
      public support in terms of providing adequate housing for these special groups has been limited thus far. They
      will require specific investments and programs in line with European Standards, such as improving accessibility
      for those who are disabled or have with limited mobility, and mandating special features for the elderly.


                            D. Improve the social housing program
• Make social housing financially viable for local authorities
      Current policy for social housing subsidizes the rent payable by setting it at 10% of the family income,
      irrespective of the cost of the dwelling. This level is much lower than the share used in wealthier countries
      which often require a contribution level of 30%. The low level means that buildings designed for social housing
      will always be a net drain on the finances of the local authority, which is a significant disincentive for them
      to develop more units for this purpose. While 30% may be too high, 10% is almost certainly too low a figure –
      especially for households in the 40-50th income percentile. What would be more appropriate is a policy that
      subsidizes the family and not the house, and could help reverse the disincentive: setting the rents at a level
      that recovers more of the costs of the development, day-to-day maintenance, and management costs would
      also be more sustainable. Funds from the national government could make up the difference for poor tenants
      with income insufficient to pay the rent.

• Revise criteria for social housing allocations
      Criteria established by local authorities that give priority to those with education or on the basis of home
      domicile hurt the poor and vulnerable who typically lack education and often do not have the necessary
      (residency) registration papers. It is important to streamline these criteria, and to mandate that allocation of
      social housing be done on the basis of transparent and published criteria.



43
                         Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?


• Narrow the income eligibility band
       Eligibility based on the ‘average’ income skews due to outliers. As mentioned earlier, currently, households with
       incomes that place them higher in the income distribution than the top 10th of the population are ”income”
       eligible for social housing and other housing subsidies. In most economies, only the bottom 2 or 3 income deciles
       are eligible for subsidies, but this should be reviewed in light of incomes and housing costs in Romania. A more
       targeted eligibility threshold is the ‘median’ net monthly income (50th income percentile). Subsidies should be
       targeted at those most in need, with much stricter criteria applied through a regular review of incomes, and
       other means tests.


    E. Facilitate the production of affordable housing by the private sector
• Incentivize and leverage private funds for ‘affordable’ housing, both private and public
       Affordable housing could be encouraged by local authorities offering Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and
       Development Agreements (DAs) for the delivery of private ‘affordable’ housing, and even public housing. This
       public housing may then be used as ‘social housing’ or ‘necessity housing’ – similar in concept to NHA’s youth
       housing, but built with private investment and centered on a more demand-responsive approach. In addition,
       local authorities are well-positioned to actively upgrade and refurbish existing public buildings for use as public
       housing (or other uses) through PPPs and DAs. This can start with creating a comprehensive inventory of
       relevant public assets (buildings) to be converted into social housing. Local authorities may obtain loans or grants
       (or a combination thereof) to pay for the above options through a financing window under the proposed NHF.
       Many European countries boast robust co-operative housing sectors that offer an affordable midpoint between
       fully private housing and fully public housing both for tenants and also for governments that can encourage
       co-operatives with limited subsidies. Housing Cooperatives can serve the function of a developer or a registered
       social landlord. As a developer they are well-placed to provide a higher quality of private and communal life
       at a competitive cost because they are geared towards providing affordable housing to members rather than
       maximizing profits for developers. Sometimes, these organizations develop only for rent. They might develop
       only for rent for their members, or may build for a wider public, including social housing, thus alleviating the
       cost and management burden from the public sector.

• Review and reform the Prima Casă guarantee program
       The Prima Casă program may serve its purpose better through improved targeting to lower income creditworthy
       homebuyers who would otherwise not be able to get a mortgage loan in the market. One way to do this is
       to limit the span of eligibility to lower middle income households (say, people in the 30th to 50th income
       percentile), and at the same time, removing the house price threshold – which, as it currently stands, is not only
       a ”free-for-all” subsidy, which is inefficient, it is also having a distortionary effect on the market.

• Review and reform the rental housing policy
       The lack of formal rental housing and the growth of the ‘grey’ rental market in Romania is a major deterrent to
       labor mobility. It causes difficulties for new families, and inflates the rents of the limited stock available. While
       there is little available data for the rental market, sector expertise indicates that the policies pertaining to
       rental housing need to be reformed. Several measures may be considered to this effect, for example, removing
       tax disincentives for rental housing, reforming the rental policy which currently leans in favor of the tenant, and
       introducing a landlord-tenant dispute resolution mechanism.


                        F. Revise and Complete the Legal Framework
•   Introduce a new Housing Law
        While it is the case that the Housing Law has been revised with an excessive frequency, the current Housing
        Law needs to be nevertheless be replaced by something that establishes a more general framework. The
        new law will need to clarify the obligations of homeownership that correspond to the rights that have been
        distributed. Without this clarification it is unlikely that HOAs will take on the role of maintaining and improving
        the housing stock. The new Law would also refine income eligibility criteria for social housing and other public
        housing programs in a more general way, while simultaneously establishing more appropriate and lower housing
        standards, and refining the role of the NHA. Among other things, the new law will need to mandate that public
        money be used to assist either those who have insufficient income to meet their housing needs, with priority
                                                                                                                         44
                             Harmonizing State and EU Funded Projects in Regions | Final Synthesis

       for those most in need, i.e. the poorest 20% to 30% of the population, or those – such as emerging HOAs, or the
       elderly in seismically risky housing – who with minor assistance can undertake high social return activities. For
       greatest effectiveness this latter step should be accompanied by the establishment of a National Housing Fund
       (described below). Whether that Fund should be defined in the new Housing Law, or as a separate legislation is a
       matter of legislative efficacy. However, it should be emphasized that the governing regulations for an effective
       Housing Fund are themselves complex.

• Introduce a legal framework that proscribes living in unsafe structures
       It will be important for the new Housing Law to ensure that families currently at risk are not left at risk.
       This means clearly stating under the new Law that unsafe structures be vacated, and tied with a clause
       that ensures adequate support from the government to the affected households, both in terms of temporary
       resettlement – either in the form of government provided public housing or in the form of cash vouchers with
       which the households can access private housing for rent. The law may also require that unsafe buildings –
       historic or non-historic – that have been lying vacant for more than a certain period of time (say, 2 or 3 years)
       be compulsorily acquired by the government (or local authorities), and retrofitted or torn down.

• Consolidate the various categories of ”public housing”
       The current distinction between ”social housing” and other housing built or managed by the public sector needs
       to be reconsidered such that all housing provided by the state, for whatever purpose, is designated public
       housing. Families lacking the means to pay the economic rent and utility costs of such housing (for example,
       those who are currently eligible for ”social housing”) could be given income support. This move will achieve three
       important objectives: make it economically viable for Local Councils to erect and manage public housing; make
       public housing supply more responsive to the prevailing demand – for example, any single public housing unit
       could serve as a ‘necessity’ house or a ‘social’ house or housing for any other special group; and prevent social
       housing from becoming socially damaging ghettos where only poor people reside.

• Improve space and building standards for dwellings
       The current standards as prescribed under the Housing Law legislate on the size of house required by a specific
       number of occupants. This is unrealistic in two senses: firstly because family size changes from year to year,
       and secondly, because it prevents families from making spatial adjustments in order to achieve other economic
       objectives. It is advisable that such a standard be omitted from the Housing Law. Regarding building and space
       standards more generally, the existing regulations regarding minimum room sizes, window sizes, ventilation,
       sanitation etc. may be retained. However, alternative building, planning and sanitation regulations will be
       required for areas designated as informal settlements or incremental/self-build housing.


                             G. Strengthen institutions at all levels
•   Strengthen the Housing Department and its mandate at the national level
       At present, MRDPA has a duty to prepare the national level budgets for the programs implemented by the
       government for housing, and play an advocacy role to justify the maximum possible allocations. However, there
       is little recognition of the broader effects that a more proactive housing policy could have on economic growth
       and social inclusion. The spatial legacy of the communist-era construction has an extraordinary effect on the
       nation’s potential. Addressing these problems will require resources and greater policy attention. Ultimately,
       of course, the MRDPA will need to ensure that the funds benefit the more needy sections of the population,
       and are properly accounted for. MRDPA’s coordination role among the various public and private stakeholders
       needs to be strengthened, including maintaining a consolidated housing database. A housing department at
       the General Directorate (GD) level is proposed that would have responsibility for programs in energy efficiency,
       HOAs and maintenance, accessing finance, monitoring, evaluation, and data collection. Such a strengthened
       housing department can provide training to specialists at the county level, who can then provide support to
       local authorities in energy efficiency standards and procurement, social housing, asset management, housing
       finance, and other key areas.

• Clearly define and strengthen the role of local councils
       The current policy requires the local council to construct social dwellings instead of providing incentives for
       them to refurbish existing public buildings for residential use. The refurbishing of existing public buildings
       into social housing is allowed by the Housing Law; however, it is not effectively implemented – for example,
       conversion from other uses to residential use may not always be properly done, or the sanitation and other
45
                       Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

      underlying infrastructure may be inadequate. Local councils are, in principle, well-suited to provide serviced
      land and need to engage in PPPs with HOAs, Housing Cooperatives, and private sector developers to provide
      social housing, but their technical and financial capacity in the housing sector needs to be improved. It is
      recommended that county councils take a stronger lead in identifying housing need and coordinating local
      councils’ five year housing plans, while local councils be assisted to access funds and technical assistance in
      developing public housing.

• Reform the role of the National Housing Agency
      Public institutions in the housing sector would benefit from a reform process so that they are positioned
      to serve as ‘enablers’ of an efficient housing system, rather than ‘providers’ of housing (especially housing
      targeted to the non-poor). In particular, the role of the National Housing Agency (NHA) requires reconfiguration:
      from a constructor of Youth Housing to an overseer of the construction of Necessity Housing (to temporarily
      accommodate residents of these risky buildings undergoing retrofitting), and as a leader in seismic retrofitting
      projects.

      The NHA could also play a role in public sector programs for which local authorities lack the skills to design or
      implement, in which cases it would be appropriate for the NHA to step in. The NHA may establish a division
      that serves as a technical assistance arm for Local Councils. This division would include architects, financial
      analysts, engineers, urban planners and community development / social workers, and would take the lead in
      designing and implementing such programs, or in advising and training local staff in that field.


                   H. Reform Financing Programs and Mechanisms
• Establish a National Housing Fund
      A potential solution to some of Romania’s blockages in the production of affordable housing could be the
      establishment of a dedicated National Housing Fund (NHF). The Fund would be a centralized source of
      government support for developing the affordable housing market through targeted financial support. The
      Fund could consist of several specific funding windows accessible by both private and public sectors. It could
      serve to consolidate the existing labyrinth of programs into a more coherent, consistent public role. The overall
      objective is to increase the availability of good quality, energy efficient, affordable housing while providing
      it in a transparent, efficient way. This could be for rental housing, or for affordable homeownership, or for
      improvement of residential buildings or neighborhoods. The Fund would support new housing and rehabilitation
      of existing housing stock.

      The NHF could have a social function and, as such, would require public funds. However, if it is to successfully
      develop a multi-year long-term investment strategy for housing, it needs independence from the political
      process and stable funding sources. A major objective of such a fund would be that current, poorly-targeted

                                                                                                                    46

     and highly expensive subsidies would be retargeted to encourage the greatest output for public expenditures.
     That is, the expenditures would be designed to leverage other resources – e.g., beneficiary contributions and
     private finance – as well as minimize the government taking on responsibilities and/or risks in ways in which
     it does not have comparative advantage.

     The Fund would be managed at the national level, but would have a strong regional presence also as the key
     link with local authorities that serve as the main delivery point for social housing at present. Some windows
     under the proposed Fund would be run as national schemes; others would be run as local schemes under
     local authorities, and administered through private banks serving as financial intermediaries for these housing
     finance products. Local authorities might also provide a contribution or co-financing (<10%), with the bulk of
     the financing coming from the Fund.

• Redirect existing programs / subsidies
     Youth Housing program. The Youth Housing program has been successful in terms of scale (approximately 30,000
     units delivered to date) and is a good tool to attract youth to growing cities, in principle. However, the massive
     per unit public expenditure involved in the construction of new housing for the non-poor is a questionable use
     of limited government resources: it channels scarce public resources away from people who most need the
     assistance. While providing housing for Romania’s youth in urban centers is a valid policy objective, the current
     programs are not necessarily achieving this objective. At the same time, poor households who are left out of the
     public assistance agenda will not be able to contribute to the economy without targeted assistance from the
     government, a foregone opportunity that outweighs any economic windfall represented by the current Youth
     Housing.

     Abolishing this program should first take the form of ceasing construction of new Youth Housing, and stopping
     the sale of Youth Housing. Selling these units effectively removes stock from the already too small pool of
     public sector housing, while continuing to rent them for extended contracts means that the same residents
     benefit from the subsidy year after year. These should be retained as rental housing stock to be used as one
     or more of the following: (i) revenue generating assets with market-price rents that can help cross-subsidize
     the cost of existing social housing or raise funds to construct new social housing; (ii) rental housing targeted
     to lower income households who can pay the current rents; (iii) housing for the youth at subsidized rates, but
     with a cap on the number of years it can be occupied by any single household (e.g., 3-5 years); or (iv) ‘transition’
     houses for residents of buildings undergoing seismic retrofitting.

     BauSpar subsidy. The BauSpar (saving-for-housing) product offered by two leading banks has been relatively
     successful in inducing people to register accounts eligible for the subsidies, with over 300,000 savers between
     two private banks in 2015. However, it is not having its intended impact of expanding housing loans: only 5% of
     savers are exercising the option to take out a housing loan after the ‘saving’ period elapses. Also, the subsidy
     element of this program is not well-targeted: anyone can apply for a BauSpar product and benefit from the
     subsidy of EUR 250 per customer annually. Many of the accounts probably would have existed without the
     subsidy. From 2005 to 2015 the programs budget has exceeded RON 841,590,738, representing an average
     government liability of RON 84,159,074 annually for the last ten years. This program could be better designed
     to target the savings subsidy for home improvement and mortgage loans to those earning below the national
     median income. The remaining subsidy could thereby be re-allocated towards a small home improvement
     loan guarantee program, which would be accessible through all banking institutions rather than just the two
     currently administering the BauSpar program.

     VAT subsidy. The VAT subsidy for purchase of houses would be much more effective if targeted by income level,
     for instance to people earning below the national median income. The additional revenue thus generated (from
     otherwise ”lost” VAT) could be allocated to other priority areas discussed in this report, including public housing
     and seismic retrofitting.

     National Program for Thermal Rehabilitation of Blocks of Flats. This program duplicates another parallel program
     financed with EU funds. A significant proportion of works are perceived as sub-standard by end beneficiaries
     and even by primary stakeholders in the program (HOAs and local authorities). The program could continue in
     a redesigned form and be financed under Window 5 in the proposed NHF to first target social housing stock.
     This would achieve an enhanced impact for low-income households, considering the consequent reduction in

47
                       Recommendations: What are the proposed strategies and action steps?

      utility bills, but also alleviate pressure on local authorities that are responsible for those units. The program
      can be further improved by establishing co-financing or grant mechanisms linked to household income. These
      grants – targeted to poor residents or low income households – are especially important in buildings with a
      high percentage of poor or low income households. In such situations, the 20% financing commitment becomes
      a major financial burden. Grants to cover these costs could be obtained from Window 9 under the NHF.
      Coordination of thermal insulation work with other major upgrading interventions such as seismic retrofitting
      (structural strengthening) and district heating system upgrades is also necessary. In this way the benefits of
      thermal insulation investments will be fully realized by both reducing leakage in the district heating systems as
      well as ensuring that the thermal insulation will not need to be redone if and when upgrades to older buildings’
      structural framework are implemented. The proposed NHF could provide a centralized platform for monitoring
      such interventions based on sequential disbursements of funds.

      Energy Efficiency of Blocks of Flats and Rehabilitation of Heating Plants in Cities. Two types of investments in the
      program portfolio on energy efficiency are recommended for continuation with EU funding (Energy Efficiency
      of Blocks of Flats under ROP, and Rehabilitation of Heating Plants in Cities under OPLI). Given the amount of
      EU funding for such works, it is recommended that government funding be directed to complementary types of
      investments (e.g., consolidation works). For the program for Energy Efficiency of Blocks of Flats under ROP, the
      funding line was limited to certain eligible beneficiaries based on city population for the period 2007-2013 with
      preference given to larger cities, regardless of implementation capacity. The funding can be extended to other
      cities, regardless of whether they are county residences or not. The limiting for the next period will be detailed
      in the Applicant Guide. In addition, contractors for such works can be pre-qualified and warranty measures can
      be instituted for a maintenance period. The quality control problem of current interventions can be addressed
      by pre-qualifying contractors and instituting warranty measures for a maintenance period.

      The Green House Program. Aimed at reducing air pollution by installing solar panels and thermal plants for
      residential structures, this program can continue in a redesigned form and be financed by Window 5 under the
      proposed NHF. Redesigned prioritization for this program could encompass better evaluation of applications in
      order to take into consideration particular conditions of the housing unit, since there are differences in wind
      and solar potential across Romania. The program could also be expanded to collective housing units and public
      buildings such as schools, hospitals, nurseries, etc.

      The District Heating Rehabilitation Program. This program can also continue due to the serious challenges in
      the provision of affordable heat through old and inefficient district heating systems. This could be positioned
      for funding under Window 8, coordinated with investments through Window 5 of the proposed the NHF.
      The prioritization of continuing energy efficiency programs should consider aspects such as: primary energy
      savings, rate of connection to the centralized system, duration of project implementation and payback period
      of the investment, compliance with environmental protection, and the ratio of the amount of investment to
      the number of connected apartments.

• Better utilize public buildings to their full potential: Asset Management Strategy
      One of the most useful ways to raise revenue for housing programs is through a more efficient use of existing
      public buildings. First and foremost, an inventory of all publicly owned buildings is needed, at the central and
      local levels – including the youth housing stock, heritage buildings, social housing, and any other vacant or
      derelict public buildings. Once this is done, an Asset Management Strategy should be developed, to help public
      authorities determine the best use of these assets. Some of these – particularly the historic buildings (owned
      or acquired because they were lying vacant for an extended period of time, as suggested above) – might be
      revenue generating assets that could potentially finance some of the subsidy programs in the housing sector,
      including public housing.

                                                Practical Prioritization of Projects
99. As the final list of proposed investment projects for the 2014-2020 programming period is defined, authorities
at all levels have at their disposal the Investment Guides produced as part of this technical assistance work.
These cover three key areas: county roads; water and wastewater systems; and local roads and social infrastructure
(education, health, culture, and sports). Each Investment Guide includes a detailed set of maps for each county,
showing where current assets are (from roads to schools, hospitals, cultural centers, etc.) and where investments
might be better targeted upon application of the set of proposed prioritization criteria.32 The same guides also
distinguish between projects that may be financed from EU vs. state-budget-funded programs, thereby facilitating
coordination among these various funding instruments.

100. By all measures, the guides are a unique collection of data at the level of counties and territorial administrative
units, and can serve as a very practical tool for choosing the most impactful and needed investments. For one,
managing authorities of state and EU-funded programs can rely on these Guides in the evaluation of proposals
submitted for financing. For their part, local/country authorities can also use the information in the guides to select
the projects that they would like to see financing for. Civil society watchdogs and other stakeholders can also monitor
projects actually chosen for funding versus other potential projects. Transparency can thus contribute to the goal of
making the most out of the limited investment resources available to public authorities.

101. The maps reproduced below are examples of what is included in the Investment Guides. The chosen example is
Covasna County, and the maps cover: county roads, communal roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure
(education, health, culture, and sports). The prioritization follows from the application of the criteria proposed in this
technical assistance.

                                                 Roadmap for Action
102. There are a range of proposed targeted strategies and key action steps resulting from the technical assistance
work under all four components of this program. The recommendations span different areas – policy, legal, financial,
and institutional. Whether in roads, water and sanitation, social infrastructure, or housing, it is obvious that Romania
shows significant room for improvement in terms of how it defines, selects, finances, implements, monitors and
evaluates, and coordinates its public infrastructure investments. The next sub-section summarizes the main proposed
steps, including a potential timeline, the role of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, and
the difficulty of implementing the recommended actions. It also serves as a roadmap for monitoring and evaluating
progress.

                                                               Recent Progress
103. The MRDPA had access to a draft version of the criteria recommended by the World Bank team in time to
rethink the design of the PNDL for 2015. With respect to the PNDL’s funding allocation by counties, by and large, the
PNDL 2015 (as of August 2015) follows the World Bank proposals, with some notable exceptions.33 The key point is
that the MRDPA still needs to adopt a clearly defined, transparent formula for allocating funds between counties. As
for allocation by sectors, the 2015 split is closer to the Bank team’s proposals than in the previous year. The MRDPA
has triaged communal road projects, with a focus on works with a high completion degree, based on interview data.
Also, the program finances more social infrastructure projects (particularly new educational infrastructure projects).

104. The Bank team compared the 2015 PNDL portfolio with the priority lists resulting from the application
of criteria proposed in this report. Of the PNDL projects financed in 2015, about 46% (worth about half of the
total allocation) were also on the Bank’s list. But the program also financed 979 ”non-priority” projects (i.e., in the
initial project portfolio of around 4,000 interventions there were other proposals that should have received funding
before these 979 projects). Around 14% of PNDL 2015 represent investments in non-priority sectors, i.e., sectors
that, in the opinion of the World Bank, should not be the focus of the PNDL. These include investments in tourism
infrastructure, city hall buildings, communal markets, or other hard infrastructure for which it is difficult to devise
clear prioritization criteria (e.g., investments in bridges and investments in local roads, usually determined on a case-
by-case basis like in the aftermath of a flood). Finally, there are also 367 investments in the 2015 portfolio (roughly
15%) that should probably not be financed. These are typically water and wastewater projects inherited from previous
investment programs and are either too small in scale (e.g., wastewater systems in localities with less than 2,000
people equivalent) or could be eligible for EU funds (e.g., Large Infrastructure OP).

  For example, Botoșani and Cluj received significantly less funds than what was proposed by the Bank (around RON 11-12 million less). By
contrast, counties like Bistrița-Năsăud, Constanța, and Iași received significantly more – around 11-16 million RON more.

                                                       What next?

105. It is important that for the 2016 financial exercise some of the lessons from the current exercise be
internalized to enable enhanced coordination and harmonization of interventions – and, hence, higher development
impact. Ideally, the PNDL should focus on finalizing a triaged version of the current project portfolio, with a particular
attention paid to projects with a high priority score, while at the same time identifying potential solutions for the
projects that should technically not be financed by the PNDL. For example, water and wastewater projects that
could technically be covered by OP Large Infrastructure 2014-2020 should be funded from this OP. The same goes
for county roads and social infrastructure that can be financed by the ROP 2014-2020. All this comes back to the
need to improve coordination among investment programs and projects in Romania. The MRDPA has begun taking
some steps in the right direction with the 2015 programming of the PNDL, but in truth a lot more can and should
be done to promote effective coordination among investment programs and a more strategic project selection and
prioritization process.

106. One positive recent development is the move to a multiannual PNDL, though there are serious limitations
to the current framework. As explained earlier, a multiannual PNDL only solves part of the current challenges and,
if followed through, may increase the predictability of disbursements from one year to the next. But the deeper issue
of unsustainable project portfolios remains; there has been little rationalization of the current portfolio, and nowhere
near where it should be in order to expect that projects would actually get finished in the set six-year timeline.
Moreover, the new FIFO rule for disbursements may create adverse effects in terms of funding early-phase projects
(as opposed to projects nearing completion, which should get priority).


                                             Key Success Factors
107. Keeping in mind the high stakes of sound public investment coordination and prioritization in Romania, the
challenges of implementing the proposed reforms remain high. As noted throughout this report, investment needs
at local and county levels far exceed available resources. This makes funding allocation schemes tough to design and
implement based on objective and transparent criteria, particularly given a persistent mentality of ”asking from the
center” often based on political and personal connections. But the good news is that this is starting to change with
the availability of EU funds, which are truly ”a new way of doing business” for subnational and national authorities.
They require clear and fair rules, rigorous implementation and monitoring, and a sharper focus on results and impact.

108. What are the main success factors for adopting the proposed reforms for harmonizing EU and state-funded
investments?

• Strong political will and commitment:
      Funding allocation decisions have inevitable political economy implications. Strong leadership at the Center of
      Government and at the MRDPA is needed to change the paradigm of how state-funded programs have worked
      for years, moving things toward the ”EU-funds model.”

• Ownership:
      Related to the first point, public authorities should demonstrate ownership over the proposed measures –
      whether they decide to follow them entirely, in part, or in some adapted form. This is critical for ensuring that
      particularly measures that require patience and only deliver long-term results actually get implemented and
      are followed through.

• Technical expertise and strong capacity:
      Some of the proposed action steps are complex for any country, and they are particularly tough to accomplish
      given current capacity constraints of Romania’s public administration. Reform programs like multiannual
      budgets, territorial contracts, a revamping of housing funds, etc. require access to specialized technical know-
      how and strong administrative capacity at all levels.

• Transparency:
      This is fundamental to improve the current functioning of strategies, programs, and projects. It enables all
      stakeholders – including civil society groups – to monitor progress and call out deviations from the set course.
      A culture of transparency and data sharing takes time to build.

                                                        County Roads
The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for county road projects across different counties in Romania.
This follows the current PNDL model in that each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the
program. The table below, however, proposes a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a clear,
specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.

Once the funding is allocated between counties, the next step is to decide on which specific projects should receive
financing. The following table includes a number of criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in county roads.
This model can be applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the former, since the PNDL’s current project
portfolio far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also be deployed to sort through existing projects
and reach a manageable portfolio size (by suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In addition, the
completion rate of an individual project can and should be taken into account for decisions regarding which investments
the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion in raking projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends
on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of the PNDL. As for new projects, these would only be approved and launched
if there is sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all ongoing projects are accounted for. This space must
exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent years, through the project’s completion.

  Using the priority list prepared under Step 1, and subtracting the

   If available funding for a particular county suffices to cover the

 •	 Should funding be available even after this allocation, the
    remaining funds will be allocated to ”average” county road links
    that have been modernized already (i.e. they have an asphalt
    concrete coverage).
    County councils have provided information on the state of the
  roads (i.e. ”good,” ”average,” ”bad”) and on the surface coverage of
                              county roads.
 According to GD 363/2010, the cost standard for the rehabilitation
               of 1 km of county road is EUR 273,855.

                                                     Communal Roads
The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for communal road projects across different counties in
Romania. This follows the current PNDL model in that each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope
for the program. The table below, however, proposes a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a clear,
specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.

                                         Water and Wastewater Systems
The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for water and wastewater projects across different regions in
Romania (in most cases, these ”regions” covered by Regional Water Operators cover only one county). This follows the
current PNDL model in that each county receives a share of the total budgetary envelope for the program. The tables
below, however, propose a significant improvement over the status quo by setting a clear, specific, and transparent
formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.

Once the funding is allocated between counties/”regions,” the next step is to decide which specific projects should
receive financing. The following tables include a number of criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in
water and wastewater, respectively. This model can be applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the
former, since the PNDL’s current project portfolio far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also
be deployed to sort through existing projects and reach a manageable portfolio size (by suspending, postponing, or
canceling some investments). In addition, the completion rate of an individual project can and should be taken into
account for decisions regarding which investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion
in raking projects (i.e., % weight in final score) depends on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of the PNDL. As for
new projects, these would only be approved and launched if there is sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope
once all ongoing projects are accounted for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent
years, through the project’s completion.

                                              Social Infrastructure
The first step is to decide on the allocation of resources for different types of social infrastructure across different
counties in Romania. This follows the current PNDL model in that each county receives a share of the total budgetary
envelope for the program. The tables below, however, propose a significant improvement over the status quo by
setting a clear, specific, and transparent formula, including criteria for allocation of funds.

109. Once the funding is allocated between counties, the next step is to decide which localities should receive
financing within each category of social infrastructure (i.e., education, health, etc.). The following tables include a
number of criteria for prioritizing and selecting investments in these various types of social infrastructure. This model
can be applied to both ongoing and new investments. Regarding the former, since the PNDL’s current project portfolio
far exceeds available resources, the criteria noted below can also be deployed to sort through existing projects
and reach a manageable portfolio size (by suspending, postponing, or canceling some investments). In addition,
71
                         Annex 1: Detailed Project Selection Grids and Criteria for PNDL Investments

the completion rate of an individual project can and should be taken into account for decisions regarding which
investments the PNDL will keep in its portfolio; the importance of this criterion in raking projects (i.e., % weight in
final score) depends on the MRDPA’s preferences, as manager of the PNDL. As for new projects, these would only
be approved and launched if there is sufficient room in the PNDL budgetary envelope once all ongoing projects are
accounted for. This space must exist not only for the first year, but for all subsequent years, through the project’s
completion.

The World Bank teams organized a total of 24 knowledge dissemination workshops across the country to present to
nearly 700 public investment beneficiaries and other relevant stakeholders the key findings and recommendations
covering the four components of the project. Eight seminars were organized in September and October 2015 in all
eight regions in Romania to present and discuss the main solutions for better prioritizing public investments and
applying appropriate coordination mechanisms among strategies and different programs financed from the state
budget and EU funds (Component 1). During a number of four seminars organized in October 2015 in the South
West, North West, North East, and București-Ilfov regions, the World Bank experts presented and discussed the key
findings and proposals following the assessment of the project portfolio of the National Local Development Program
- PNDL (Component 2).

In addition, two workshops organized in October tackled the innovative designs and technologies for public
infrastructure investments (Component 3), while a couple of seminars held during the summer presented the main
proposals on how to improve housing conditions in Romania (Component 4).
