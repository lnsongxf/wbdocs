Key Characteristics of Aggregation Case Study
                       AGUAS DO RIBATEJO, PORTUGAL
Context               •	 High-income country

                      •	 Aggregation covering urban and rural areas

                      •	 Medium level of WSS performance

Purpose               Performance, professionalization, environment benefits, equity

Scope                 WSS functions and services

Scale                 •	 Administrative boundaries

                      •	 Localities covered: 7

                      •	 Population covered: 139,853 inhabitants for water and 96,654 for wastewater

                      •	 Connections: 74,875 for water and 55,035 for wastewater

                      •	 Coverage: 96 percent for water and 66 percent for wastewater

                      •	 Network length: 2,051 km for water and 1,035 km for wastewater

Process               Voluntary and Incentivized (EU funds)

Governance            •	 Delegated (40 years)

                         transferred by each municipality

                      •	 Asset transfer: Asset transferred from municipalities to the aggregated utility through lease agreements without a
                         rent payment but with maintenance obligation. These transferred assets remain the property of municipalities.

                      •	 Liability: No liability undertaken
