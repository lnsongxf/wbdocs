This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       Obtain a notice of pre-approval of the company name

       The applicant picks up the application for company name pre-approval
       from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC), or
       otherwise, downloads the form from AIC’s Web site. The applicant can
       be the representative designated by all the shareholders or the agent
       entrusted by all the shareholders. The completed application form shall
       be signed by all shareholders of the company. The application form
       together with the business licenses or other registration certificates (if
       the shareholders are companies or other eligible entities) and the
       photocopy of the identity card of the individual shareholders shall be
       filed with the AIC. Effective July 1, 2004, enterprise name registration

       applicant goes directly to the AIC, a proposed company name is
       approved or rejected on the spot. This is newly regulated by Article 24
       of the aforementioned measures and is implemented in practice.
       However if the application is made through mail, fax, email, etc, the
       proposed company name will be approved or rejected within 15 days.

      Since July 2010, it has been possible to use the "parallel application and
      review" process in most districts of Shanghai. The entrepreneur can
      submit the documents for business license, certificate for quality and
      technology and state and local tax at the same time at one window. All
      the application forms can be downloaded from SAIC’s website. The
      agent at the window will scan all the documents and send them
      electronically to all relevant agencies. The business license is approved
      first and the two other agencies can give their approval immediately
      after. They are notified online once the business license has been
      approved. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the
      National Development and Reform Commission on Cancellation,
      Suspension and Exemption of Certain Administrative Charges issued on
      December 23, 2014 and effective on January 1, 2015, the registration
      fee for enterprise establishment has been cancelled since January 1,
      2015.

      1/ BUSINESS LICENSE:
      To obtain registration certification, the company must file a completed
      application form along with the following documents:
      • Notice of approval of company name
      • Lease or other proof of company office.
2     • Articles of association, executed by each shareholder                      11 days       no charge

      • Appointment documents and identification documents (certifying
      name and address) of the directors, supervisors, and officers.
      • Appointment documents and identification documents of the
      company’s legal representative
      • Other documents as required by the authorities

      According to the new administrative rules, application forms may be
      downloaded from the local government authorities’ Web sites.
      Statutory time limits were introduced for acceptance of application
      documents and for registration decision making, which differs
      according to the form of application. Documentation requirements for
      company registration were standardized. The Registry is now required
      to publicly display them.

      According to Article 52, if an application is filed (by letter, telegraph,
      telex, fax, email, or electronic data exchange), the Company Registry
      must, within 5 days of receiving the relevant application documents and
      materials, decide whether to accept the application. If the application
      documents and materials are incomplete or do not meet the statutory
      requirements, the Registry must inform the applicant, within 5 days, of
      all contents subject to supplementation and correction.

      According to Article 54, if the organ in charge of company registration
      must verify the application documents and materials, it shall decide

      whether to approve the registration within 15 days of acceptance. In
      other cases, the organ must decide whether to approve the registration
      on the spot or within 15 days of acceptance.

      According to Article 55, if the organ decides to approve a company
      registration, it shall issue a “notice on approval for establishment
      registration” and inform the applicant to collect its business license
      within 10 days.

      2/ ORGANIZATION CODE CERTIFICATE WITH THE QUALITY AND
      TECHNOLOGY SUPERVISION BUREAU:
      The company must apply for the organization code certificate within 30
      days of obtaining the business license, by filing a completed application
      form with the Shanghai Organization Code Management Center (a
      branch of the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau) along with
      the following documents:
      • Business license (original and one copy)
      • Identity card of the legal representative (one copy)

      The cost for Organization Code Certificate is exempted for micro or a
      small size companies. For other companies, the cost of CNY 120 shall
      apply, which includes a technical service fee of CNY 82, a production
      cost of IC Card of CNY 20 and a production fee for the original and
      duplicate copy of the certificate of CNY 10 and CNY 8, respectively.



      3/ REGISTRATION WITH LOCAL AND STATE TAXES:
      The tax registration procedures have been simplified since 2004 with
      the implementation of the Administration Measures of Tax Registration,
      issued by the State Taxation Bureau. Two separate taxation authorities
      still exist (the state taxation bureau and local taxation bureau). However,
      company founders are required to file tax registration only once, to
      either of these two authorities. The statutory time limit is 30 days from
      the date of receiving the registration application.

      The company must file the tax registration form and the initial tax
      reporting forms. Together with those forms, the company submits for
      review the following documents:
      • Business license certificate (original and one copy)
      • Organization Code Certificate (original and one copy)
      • Articles of Association and Shareholders' Agreement (one copy)

      representative and the head of the financial department (one copy)

        office or the AIC website. The completed application form should be
        signed by all shareholders of the company. The application form
        together with the business licenses or other registration certificates (if

        (that is, the new Enterprise Name Registration Administration
        Implementing Measures or qi ye ming cheng deng ji guan li shi shi ban
        fa). According to the new registration rules, if the applicant(s) goes

        on the spot. This is newly regulated by Article 24 of the aforementioned
        measures and is implemented in practice. However if the application is
        sent by mail, fax, email, etc., the proposed company name will be
        approved or rejected within 15 days.

      Commercial warehouses do not need approval by the Civil

      design of the warehouse for registration and filing. This needs to   10 days       no charge

      be prepared by an authorized supervision agency.

      Hire an authorized supervision agency

      BuildCo must hire a supervision agency to supervise and ensure
      the quality and safety of the construction.

      There is no uniform price for hiring a supervisor. The cost should
      be calculated as follows:
      1. Designing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project design
      is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as 0.44 %
      (1,279,322 x 0.44%= CNY 5,629) of the budgetary estimate of the
      project design.
      2. Building and repairing step: if the budgetary estimate of the
      project building and repairing is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the
*6    cost is calculated as 3.3% (1,279,322 x 3.3% = CNY 42,217.6) of       1 day      CNY 169,810
      the budgetary estimate. The new value is CNY 42,217.6 + CNY
      5,629 = CNY 47,846.6. Additionally builders need to pay CNY
      78,036.00 (CNY 60.00 per square meter) for designs to be
      presented to the People's Civil Defense office.

      These calculations are according to the Notice on the Standard
      of Industry-Directed Price for the Construction Supervision
      Agency Fees of Shanghai’ (Hu Jiang Jiang Xiezi [2001], No. 20,

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

       The property transfer procedure in Shanghai and most other cities starts
       from following steps:

       1. The parties negotiate and agree on a sale and purchase contract
       relating to the transfer of property. There is a standard sale and purchase
       contract formulated by government authorities but the parties can revise
       the contract by supplementary terms or supplementary agreement.
       However, the standard sale and purchase contract can be revised or
       supplemented with the supplementary terms or a supplementary
       agreement as appendix.                                                                         Deed tax: 3% of

      Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party
      is entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned
      land, there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right”
      and the “allocated land use right”. The difference is that the granted land
      use right is limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land
      use right is usually given for free with no time limit, but for specific
      purposes only. A private party also may transfer to another private party
      the granted land use right. The allocated land use right cannot be
      commercially transferable before being converted into granted land use
      right. In this case, the land is used for commercial purposes. Usually land
      for commercial use is owned by the State, and the relevant land use right
      is the State-owned land use right. As to the term of the land use right in 26 calendar days
      this case the buyer, who will use the land for commercial purposes, will     (simultaneous

      granted land use rights at the end of the 40 year period by paying to the
      State the additional land price) minus the period from the granting date
      from the State to the date of the transfer to ABC. If the land is zoned for
      industrial use or warehousing use rather than for commercial use, the
      maximum land tenure should be 50 years.

      There is a standard form sale and purchase agreement formulated by
      government authorities and is required to be used in practice. The
      contents of the standard form agreement may be revised or
      supplemented by way of a supplemental agreement attached to the
      standard form agreement as appendix. The sale and purchase agreement
      needs to be printed at designated printers. Such printers are only
      available at licensed real estate brokers and the property registry offices.

      Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party
      is entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned
      land, there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right”
      and the “allocated land use right”. The difference is that the granted land
      use right is limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land
      use right is usually given for free with no time limit, but for specific     5 working days

      maximum land tenure should be 50 years.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
     Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless
       membership is mandatory.
The business:
     Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).

LABOR MARKET REGULATION
Job quality
Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
