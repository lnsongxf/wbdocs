         I.    PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE GOVERNMENT FINANCING ROLE

Introduction

1.      The objective of this Operational Note is to provide an introductory review of a specific form of
government financial support to Public Private Partnership (PPP) investments, referred to as “viability
gap financing” (VGF). Section II discusses the public policy rationale for government support to PPPs.
Section III provides an overview of where VGF fits within the continuum of the different financial
support instruments that a government can deploy in support of PPPs and how VGF mechanisms can be
structured and implemented to address different objectives, constraints, and opportunities that may exist
within the policy, institutional, and market environment for PPP investments. Section IV concludes with
some guidance to Task Managers as to the issues to address in providing advice and/or financing support
to VGF instruments.

2.       The Note is the result of a cooperative effort between the Finance and Private Network Sector
Global Practice on PPPs, the World Bank’s Africa Region Finance and Private Sector Department, and
the PPP Practice in the World Bank Institute, with input also from parallel work being done out of the
Sustainable Development Network Infrastructure Hub, based in Singapore. It is the second of two
Operational Notes prepared as an initiative to bring succinctly prepared technical advice to Bank staff and
government counterparts on different aspects key to the effective development of PPP programs. The first
Operational Note, published in June 2013, focused on the issue of PPP fiscal commitment and contingent
liability management and should be viewed as a complement to this Note, as much of its content is
immediately applicable to issues addressed herein.

3.      This current Operational Note arose out of an increasing engagement with different countries,
particularly in Africa and Asia, interested in scoping out options by which governments can efficiently
and effectively - with due regard to key “Value for Money” and affordability considerations - address
constraints that they face in mobilizing the right mix of financing for PPP investments. The Note is the
product of ongoing technical work being carried out in the context of a number of Bank operations,
associated analytical studies and presentations, and previous analytical work done in the recent past, as
summarized in Annex 1. It has been further enhanced by conferences that have brought together
governments with active and embryonic PPP programs that have discussed the diverse financing
instruments employed to leverage private sector and donor engagement. The first of these Conferences
took place in Washington, DC in June 2012. The most recent, on which much of the content of this Note
was generated, was hosted by the Government of Kenya in Nairobi in June 2013.

4.      The annexes provide additional key information integral to this Operational Note. Annex II lists
some of the principal forms of risks to be mitigated in PPP projects. Annex V contains a glossary of key
terms and concepts. Annex III comprises examples of specific existing projects that utilize government
financing instruments and Annex IV provides some details on different VGF structures in place in
selected countries.

Review of the Theory

5.       Government support for PPPs can be occasioned for a number of public policy reasons. The
overall objective is to augment the supply and quality of public services – in this instance, relating to
infrastructure or social service sectors. Infrastructure services are well understood to play a critical role in
economic competitiveness and are an essential input to economic growth that generates income and jobs.
The mobility and connectivity that infrastructure makes available to a population can generate a wide
range of positive economic and social externalities which, combined with a role in fostering growth,
constitutes a strong prima facie public good argument for government intervention to augment

                                                       1
                 OPERATIONAL NOTE: VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS


infrastructure investment. In the case of social service provision, there is again a strong public good
rationale for accelerated investment – notably in terms of health cost savings, productivity, and labor
market efficiencies. There is also a good rationale for social services, insofar as individual choice would
result in lower demand for these services with subsequent wider economic and social costs, thus
justifying government intervention to increase supply and demand through targeted government support.

6.       Table 1 provides further details on public policy rationales that can motivate a government to
make financial contributions to PPPs. It can be seen that the fundamental motivations are the same as
would apply to any public investment decisions. This is as it should be. The intent is to determine the
public interest driver for deploying public funds in support of projects for which there would also be a
return to private investment. PPPs are a particular form of solution to the broader government challenge
of generating financing and delivering key services required for socioeconomic development that would
not otherwise be provided by private actors in the market. These “contributions” can, as will be described
later in this Note, come in different forms, via debt, grants, guarantees, equity, and fiscal instruments.
Decisions as to which instrument to use will be a function of a number of factors, including, in addition to
the public policy objective, the specific requirements of the project to be financed and the political, legal,
and institutional context in which the government is operating.

Capturing Externalities: Public funding to increase the   Where the provision of a service provides utility not just to the direct consumer
level of service and/or lower the price to the direct     of that service, but generates a positive externality to other members of a
consumer.                                                 society. For instance, the provision of improved sewage services will not just
                                                          contribute to the person paying for the service but, by way of a general
                                                          improvement in sanitary conditions, will also have positive benefits for the
                                                          wider community.
Addressing Social and Political Constraints on Prices     Prices that can be charged for infrastructure and/or social services can be kept
and Profits: Public funding may be required for a         below cost to meet social equity reasons and foster increased levels of demand
government to achieve twin policy goals of increasing     (i.e., the merit good rationale). It can also be the case that the government is
service provision and meeting social or political         price-constrained because it is not politically possible to charge at cost-
objectives that constrain pricing policy.                 recovering levels.
Redistributing Resources to the Poor: The                 A pro-poor policy to deliver infrastructure or social services to particularly
government may seek to provide funding to target          vulnerable or marginalized members of society unable to pay for the service
services to particular segments of the society.           that often requires use of “smart subsidies,” whereby the provider gets paid to a
                                                          greater or lesser extent based on performance measures (e.g., number of
                                                          households reached with water and sewage services, numbers of children
                                                          enrolled and in class, etc.).
Overcoming Market Failures in Providing                   PPPs are long-term commitments. Financial and capital markets can lack the
Infrastructure Financing: Public funding can be           longer term maturity instruments or, due to information asymmetries, the

factors that accompany long-term investments which        finance this sort of long-term and information-constrained risk, or channel
cannot be adequately priced by the market.                sources of funds (e.g., pensions, insurance) towards these sorts of infrastructure
                                                          assets. This can push financing costs beyond what can be absorbed
                                                          commercially.
Mitigating Political and Regulatory Risk: Government      PPP contracts frequently involve a government obligation in the form of a
can be required to address a subset of the wider          regulatory action (e.g., adjustment of tariffs), off-take and annuity payments,
market failure to price certain government-sourced        repatriation of profits, currency convertibility and agreement not to
risks. It specifically relates to information             expropriate. Where the private sector party has uncertainty regarding
asymmetries associated with certain government            government readiness or capacity to honor these obligations, additional
obligations under a PPP contract.                         coverage is required.
Pursuing Strategic Interests: Governments can also,       Equity positions may also be taken by government to assure that it shares in
for strategic economic reasons, seek a direct             any project upside returns1 (namely where project returns exceed the financial
shareholder status in a PPP.                              projections estimated in the original contract).

                                                          A government may also deem it important to signal a retained ownership to
                                                          counter electorate perceptions that the private sector is gaining too much
                                                          control of public assets or where government entities conclude that better
                                                          project performance can be realized through a shareholder versus a regulator
                                                          role.

7.      What is the private sector role in the context of this public policy and merit good rationale? The
sought-after benefits of involving the private sector in the supply of public services are principally a
combination of time preference, financing, and the expertise that the private sector partner can bring to
the investment:

      In terms of time preference, the government objective is to draw on private sector financing
     capacity to change the time profile of investments. More specifically, it is to increase the level of
     investment over the shorter to medium term relative to what could be achieved given existing and
     near-term public sector budget headroom.

      In terms of financing, governments look to reduce the initial public sector cost of the investment
     by having the private sector – through a combination of equity and debt financing – meet some of the
     principal capital and downstream operating costs. Based on an agreed rate of return arrangement
     between private sector and government, the private sector partner would recoup this investment with

1
  While such equity positions are often called 'sub-equity' with a kick in returns clause in the case of an upside, sharing in upside
return can also be assured through contractual arrangements without an equity investment. Most often a government decision to
take an equity position in a PPP is a combination of the strategic, commercial, and political environment as portrayed above.

                                                                     3

     profit from revenues obtained over an agreed period of the PPP contract. These revenues can flow
     from user fees and /or government payments (most generally referred to as annuity or availability
     payments). There is also the objective by obtaining private investment to achieve a lower all-in
     lifecycle cost of the infrastructure. A key determinant with respect to this objective will be the relative
     cost of public versus private sector borrowing costs.

      On the expertise side, the government may lack key skills and experience to deliver the service,
     whereas a preferred private sector provider would have both the track record of performance in the
     areas required and additional flexibility to recruit expertise as needed.

8.      The net outcome sought is faster expansion and delivery of better quality and lower cost service,
both in terms of construction/operational performance and cost management/predictability arrived at
through an allocation of different risks (an indicative list is provided in Annex II) between the private and
public sector parties. Determining the most appropriate government financing instrument - given the case
is made that there is a public policy rationale for intervention - depends firstly on whether the underlying
project structuring challenge is one of addressing Project Risks or of closing a Viability Gap, as
described below:2

      Addressing Project Risks: There are a number of circumstances where, while the project would
     be otherwise commercially viable, there are nevertheless certain risks that the private sector sponsor
     cannot effectively measure and price due to the higher levels of uncertainty imbedded in the risk.3
     This can encompass all the risks listed in Annex II and others. Of particular note in this instance are
     political and revenue risks. In the case of the former, the commercial viability of a project may
     depend on certain government policy actions or agency performance – for instance relating to
     adjustments on a Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) commitment or timely fulfillment of off-take
     obligations (which will raise the issue of financial strength and stability of state-owned off-takers or
     payors). Revenue risk arises in the case of fees charged to the end user (versus a PPA off-take
     arrangement with a government entity, as would be the case for an independent power producer –
     IPP), where there is: (i) no track record of user fee charges (i.e., a greenfield road, or where
     previously no toll was charged); (ii) no historically based traffic forecasts (even when there are
     thorough and rigorously developed traffic forecast figures and willingness to pay estimates); (iii)
     wider macro-economic uncertainty that may impact demand. Where robust demand data is lacking a
     private sector sponsor may seek government guarantees to offset the risk.

      Closing a Viability Gap: A “viability” gap can exist where, due to social equity (ability to pay)
     considerations or social contract (willingness to pay) factors, user fee rates cannot be set at levels that
     would alone ensure a commercially viable project. In this instance for public and/or merit good
     reasons (wider economic returns in excess of the financial returns), a government may decide to
     intervene with support to ensure that the project proceeds. VGF provides government support to

     commercially viable. The goal is also to leverage private capital (and expertise) for creating public
     infrastructure, keeping the cost of infrastructure facility at affordable levels for the users.

  As will be seen in some of the project examples provided, structuring can require attention to both risk and viability gap issues.

  Uncertainty is an essential element of risk; however, the level of uncertainty may be higher in certain cases, which results in
higher costs as the higher risk perception gets factored into projected costs.

  I.e., projects with suitably high economic rates of return. The most commonly used indicator for economic viability is the
project Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). The EIRR includes all the economic costs and benefits - the monetary benefits,
as well as positive and negative externalities which are not captured by the financial IRR (FIRR).
5
  When the project is not financially viable, the PV of the revenues is not sufficient to cover the PV of all project costs including
a reasonable rate of return for the investors. This essentially means that the project is not bankable. Financiers will not lend to it
unless the viability gap is closed and equity investors will also be loath to invest.

Overview of Government Financing Options

9.       There is a range of different ways that a government may choose to support a PPP project
financially to address risk and viability challenges. Broadly speaking, this covers guarantees, equity, debt,
grant and fiscal instruments; and other forms of support such as through other contractual clauses
pertaining to risk allocation. These are summarized in Table 2, together with some examples of such
financing support globally and some of the pros and cons associated with these different instruments.
Many of these instruments have been used consistently in PPPs in developing countries since the
inception of their PPP programs, given problems in availability, tenure, and cost of financing. However,
in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, similar support programs/instruments are being used more
commonly in developed countries as well. A more detailed summary of some of the projects referenced in
the table is provided in Annex III.

10.     Table 2 and the examples referenced reflect a number of considerations about government
financing of PPPs, such as:

    (i) There are many different types of investment – whether in developed, emerging, or developing
          economies – where private financing and expertise are forthcoming only with the added input of
          different types of government support;
    (ii) Political, fiscal, and financial considerations are intertwined in decisions relating to which
          projects to support, to what extent, and how;
    (iii) Multiple instruments are being used by governments, including on the same projects. The result is
          often not the optimal financial structuring, but rather the most feasible one, given the interplay of
          the above considerations.

                        II.     VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS – ISSUES AND PRACTICES

The Different VGF Instruments

11.     The array of different financing instruments that can be deployed by governments, as outlined
above, all merit detailed exposition. However, this Operational Note focuses on issues of rationale,
design, institutional structures/frameworks, current international practices/frameworks, and overall pros
and cons of one particular genre of government support: viability gap financing. This focus derives from
the recent growing interest that a number of African, East Asian, and South Asian countries have shown
in developing VGF mechanisms as a principal means to support PPP investments, as well as an increasing
appetite to finance such mechanisms through World Bank operations.

12.      This section begins with a review of the different ways in which VGF can be structured to more
efficiently address different project financing requirements. It then details some of the budget approaches
that can be taken to its operation and the factors that can determine which approach is adopted in a given
country. A summary of the key aspects of the different types of VGF instruments/approaches is detailed
in Table 3. In practice, these different forms of VGF can be combined together with other government
support mechanisms, as will be seen with the project examples and summary of some of VGF
mechanisms currently being used by governments, as provided in Annex III and IV, respectively.

commitment, depending on the operational cost being

Service Payment (based on service standard)

not being available (for instance, a lane is closed for
maintenance in a way not compliant with terms of the
concession contract).

Availability payments may or may not be used in
conjunction with tolling/user charges. There is the
need to differentiate between availability-based
payments where: (a) the government is the sole user
and buys the services for itself, not on behalf of any
end-user, and does not or cannot charge tolls/user
fees; and (b) the government pays but the services are
utilized by the general public (and not by government
directly), on whom government may or may not levy
user fees.

In practice, however, in many cases the payment
mechanism consists of a combination of availability-
and usage-based payments, as either of these used
singly could result in skewed incentives for the private
party. A combination methodology could be used to
optimally allocate the demand risk between the public
and private entities.10

Demand and Output-Based Payment
                                                           -   This can be used for full transfer of demand risk to the private party;

The government pays the provider based on a pre-
specified output and rate.11

13.      The suitability in a given country of these different approaches will depend on a range of factors.
First, the optimal payment mechanism is also largely determined by the economics of the project and how
risk can be allocated and translated into the financing structure and the contract. In addition, as will be
discussed subsequently, factors such as the nature of a country’s PPP pipeline of projects (some sectors
are more suited to VGF approaches than others), political economy factors (including legal authorizing
environment, legislative and executive, budgetary framework and processes, as well as inter-ministerial
bureaucratic dynamics) play an important defining role, as does the capacity of the public sector to handle
different approaches.


10
   The Rota Lund PPP Project in Minas Gerais uses a payment mechanism for subsidy whereby the formula for the monthly
payment includes the initial availability-based bid amount but varies this amount based on usage (and as a consequence revenues
collected by the private party).
11
   An example very similar to usage-based payments is the payment mechanism adopted for the solid waste project in Minas
Gerais, where payment is based on the amount or tons of solid waste delivered to the landfill by the private party, with the per ton
rate being the bid variable. Other performance indicators are effectively factored into the payment formula.

                                                                  25

14.     While grant payment mechanisms may be provided upfront or on an ongoing basis, each of these
payment mechanisms has its own distinctive features and associated advantages and disadvantages. While
upfront payment during construction is simple as it helps avoid administrative costs related to ongoing
payments as well as longer-term commitments that may be prone to political economy issues, it could
subject government to an increased private sector performance risk, as the private provider extracts its
margin during the first phase, high-expenditure construction period without the incentive to maintain
performance at the same level during implementation. This risk can be mitigated through the use of
instruments such as performance bonds, upfront equity requirement, performance-based disbursements of
the upfront payment, and a strong contract management framework. An upfront payment is fixed and is
generally not changeable (i.e., it does not have the provision for conversion to debt at a later point in time
should there be an upside in revenues), unlike availability payments which can be calibrated based on
changes in variables such as interest rates, inflation, etc. This can, however, be tackled through the use of
revenue share beyond a pre-agreed level, conversion to debt, or variation in contract term. Upfront
payments would also entail greater fiscal commitments in a shorter stretch of time, and do not defer
government expenditure on infrastructure over longer periods of time. This can ultimately mean fewer
projects for a country. Longer term payments, on the other hand, expose the private entity to a higher
degree of political risk and lead the private sector to factor an additional risk margin into its price.

15.      While in some cases, there may be no direct grant financing of the specific PPP project itself,
there could be several related public investments which may be linked directly to generation of
demand/revenues for the PPP project.12 In such cases, if the publicly invested and privately invested
projects are taken up simultaneously, the private entity may be subject to commercial risk arising out of
delays in the associated public projects; and there could be inbuilt protections in the contract against
failure of the government to successfully complete these projects. In still other projects, to help improve
the viability of the project, land is made available at a nominal or low price; or commercial exploitation of
land is allowed in order to raise additional revenues as discussed in the case of the Hyderabad Metro and
Hyderabad International Airport projects. In almost every case, the ownership of the land remains with
the government while the private entity is given the right of use of the land for the specific purpose stated
in the contract. However, tying land use revenues and infrastructure PPP projects is a matter fraught with
possible implications of windfall profits which the government may not be able to either control or assess.

16.      While PPP programs in different countries were seen to initially adopt one or the other of the
above instruments predominantly, a distinct change is visible in recent times in countries with larger PPP
programs; governments are increasingly realizing the pitfalls of relying on one instrument and trying to
adopt a balanced approach to the VGF instruments used based on projects and circumstances, so as to
take advantage of the strengths of each while diminishing the magnitude of the associated risks and
perverse incentives. The Indian Viability Gap Fund program, while providing in theory for instruments
based on needs, used the upfront capital grant in most projects post-2005 after having more or less
abandoned the annuity instrument. The PFI in the United Kingdom started out almost solely using
availability-based payments and shadow tolls. In recent years, there has been a diversification of grant
instruments used. For instance, the UK Mersey Gateway Project has a service commencement lump-sum
payment, paid immediately after commissioning of the project, as well as availability payments over
project life linked to toll revenues.


12
  Examples of this could be PPP port terminals where the road or highway link to the port is being built as a fully publicly
funded project, or a silo project where the rail siding and linking rail line are being built through public funding or a highway
project where the surrounding road connections are being built through public funding. In these cases, the publicly funded
projects contribute directly to the demand for the PPP project. Another example is the Solo-Kertosono Toll Road Project in
Indonesia, of which a part of the road of about 60 km length will be built through government funding while a length of 120 km
will be built through PPP mode. However, any delay in the public section of the road has the potential to adversely affect the
demand on the PPP road.

17.      In school construction and operations programs in India, the construction grant as well as regular
operational grants are being used together. In its proposed health sector pilots, the Government of India is
considering a combination of upfront and usage-based payments. In the Miami Port Tunnel in the United
States (see Annex III), the two instruments are used together – a construction grant as well as availability
payments. Where standardized approaches by governments are desirable for administrative simplicity and
due to capacity constraints, the need to incorporate a variety of options based on categorization of risk
profiles of projects is increasingly evident.

18.     VGF can be delivered on an ad hoc project-by-project basis or by way of a more structured
programmatic approach. The preferred administrative option will depend upon a combination of factors,
including the sector, number and nature of projects, a country’s budget planning framework, and its
technical and management capacity.

19.      First there is the consideration of administrative cost efficiency. Where there are a large number
of similar projects in each sector and the sectors of focus are limited as well, a more structured approach
can help package and process projects quickly and can help scale up the project portfolio more rapidly, as
in the case of India. Where there are fewer projects and each project is very different from the other, or if
there are many projects with different requirements from a wide range of sectors, a structured approach
might prove to be more of an impediment, especially if it does not provide adequate flexibility in terms of
instruments or entails an administrative cost overhead not justified by the volume of private sector
funding that it serves to mobilize. For example, Australia and British Columbia have a fairly mature PPP
program but with a very limited number of projects, each of which is very different. The state of Minas
Gerais in Brazil is another example where the subsidy arrangements have been developed case by case
based on specific project needs, with individual project contracts outlining the mechanisms, levels, and
terms and conditions for the provision of government support. These jurisdictions have preferred to
develop and support projects in a variety of ways without a specific administrative framework. The case-
by-case approach might result in more customized solutions and more innovation, but at the same time it
will generally require a more mature, competent, and established government budgetary oversight
capacity. A case-by-case approach, which can entail high levels of discretionary decision making can,
without this established budget management competence, risk exposing the budget to distortionary and
insufficiently assessed fiscal commitments.

20.     The second principal consideration is one of budgetary certainty, especially where ongoing
payments are made through project life. Governments may use various methods to make grant financing
available. The financing can either be earmarked for VGF and allocated to a specialized statutory non-
lapsing fund or it can be appropriated through the budget annually or at other appropriate periodicity with
unspent amounts reverting back to government at the end of the fiscal year. A dedicated fund minimizes
the uncertainty associated with funding, but requires capitalization which, to the extent that this is
provided by government, can place a significant upfront fiscal burden on government.

21.      The Fund Model: A well-established example of a capital fund for infrastructure subsidy
payments is the FONADIN in Mexico.13 The FONADIN (the National Infrastructure Fund) was
established in 2008 with a contribution of US$3.3 billion funded by the Farac (the highway re-
concessions program14) and the Finfra (the infrastructure investment fund). The fund is managed by the

14
   The highway concessions in Mexico were bought off from the private sector when the risk became unbearable for the
government and were then restructured and resold to the private sector. The FONADIN was set up from the amount received
from the sale.

                                                            27

National Development Bank of Mexico, the Banobras. It sells multiple products, including guarantees,
loans, and subsidy products, with the earnings from loans, guarantees, and other products funding the
subsidies. FONADIN is not funded by the national budget and is not subject to the same laws as the
budget in terms of disclosure of information, although it is expected to provide regular reports on its
performance. The fund structure usually needs a dedicated administrative set-up, but can also be
implemented within the existing government set-up, depending upon the level of complexity as well as
size. The funds when not in use for funding VGF would need to be used productively and must be
invested for the purpose of earning returns, to avoid the opportunity cost of idle, unused funds. However,
funds based on a one-time contribution alone either have to close when all funds have been expended as
grant financing or must have non-grant products or other forms of investment to generate returns to
replenish the fund on a self-sustaining basis.

22.     One of the other advantages of such funds over budgetary appropriations is that they can also tap
into other sources of funding. One example of this is under the Sindh (Pakistan) VGF Rules 2012 where
funds from multiple sources are used to finance the VGF.15 Another example is the Project Facilitation
Fund16 proposed to be set up under the Kenya PPP Act 2013, which envisages multiple sources of funding
such as budget appropriations, grants and donations, tariffs and levies on projects and success fees paid by
companies and is expected to be set up as a statutory fund within the National Treasury.

23.      The Budgetary Allocation Model: In a number of countries, including in particular the Indian
VGF scheme that has been in operation since 2005, PPP grants are funded through annual budgetary
appropriations based on expectations of disbursals of installments to projects in any given year, with
unutilized amounts at the end of the fiscal year reverting to government. In this instance, it is not
necessary to capitalize a fund at the outset, but rather meet obligations as they fall due through the regular
budgetary management process. This implies a lower upfront budgetary outlay and, in principal, a high
level of scrutiny is already in place due to the annual reporting requirements associated with the budget
appropriations process. On the other hand, the fact that the funds are not earmarked beyond the current
fiscal year can constitute a risk to private operators dependent on the VGF cash flow to meet financing
obligations on the PPP project. The extent to which this risk is a significant deterrent to private
investment will be a function of the overall confidence that the private sector has in the predictability of
the country’s budgetary apparatus and its reliability, based on past track record.

24.      There can be methods other than using a capitalized fund or annual budget appropriations to
address “reliability of funding” concerns. Brazil funds subsidies through a one-time budget appropriation.
However, as funding is categorized as interest payments for which annual legislative approval is not
required, it is possible to provide a multi-year commitment without giving rise to the uncertainty
associated with budget appropriations process. Other ways can be financing through non-recourse bond
issues that may be paid back by a public entity through revenues earned from the project either annually
through coupon bonds or one time at a later stage in the project term through zero-coupon bonds. The
choice of zero-coupon or coupon bonds would be based on the revenue profile of the project. In case the
revenue profile of the project does not support the repayment, the payment is guaranteed by the state, in
which case it is effectively non-recoverable grant funding by government.

25.      Table 4 provides a summary comparison of the pros and cons of funding through a one-time
capitalized fund structure as opposed to the annual budgetary process.

Finance Department.

Internal Stakeholders and Institutional Set-up and Processes

26.     The institutional set-up and processes for VGF play an important role in its implementation. The
concession/ subsidy/ payment agreement in PPPs is usually between two parties, but several stakeholders
are involved in the VGF process. It is essential to recognize early the need to involve all stakeholders in
the development of the VGF mechanism and understand the institutional dynamic between these parties
and its implications for VGF operation. While there are differences in the institutional structure and
dynamics across these stakeholders in countries, the key players that affect or are affected by the VGF
process are commonly observed to be as follows:

(i)         The Line Ministry or Implementing Agency. The identification and preparation of projects
            including pre-feasibility, detailed feasibility studies, and project structuring are undertaken by the
            ministry or agency in charge of the project. For example, in India the line ministry and agency
            responsible for the identification, preparation and development of national highway projects are
            the Department of Roads, Transport and Highways (DORTH) and the National Highway
            Authority of India (NHAI). The line ministries and implementing agencies are also responsible
            for project procurement and contract management once the project agreement is executed. In
            Brazil, this phase of the work is done by the implementing agency with support from the PPP
            Unit. In Mexico, the line ministry will be working closely with FONADIN. In Colombia, the
            National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) does the work of procurement of projects. In Honduras,
            Coalianza undertakes project procurement on behalf of the line ministries and agencies while
            contract management is carried out by the line ministries, with Coalianza evaluating and
            monitoring project implementation.

(ii)        The Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance plays a key role in most countries in the
            review and approval of requests for subsidy, as well as appropriate budgeting for the subsidies. In
            Colombia, the Ministry of Finance plays a key role in the review of requests for subsidies. In
            South Africa, the PPP unit is part of the National Treasury, with major functions centralized in
            the unit. In Mexico, the Investment Unit of the Ministry of Finance must approve a project before
            it comes to FONADIN for subsidy. In India, the PPP cell that reviews proposals is a part of the
            Department of Economic Affairs, which is one of the five departments of the Ministry of Finance.
            In addition, whether the country uses a capitalized fund structure or a periodic budgetary
            appropriation, the Ministry of Finance is closely involved in the establishment and continued
            replenishment of the fund/ budget head in most countries.

17   Where the budget cycle is multi-year, funding can be made available for more than a year through budgetary appropriations.

                                                                29
                OPERATIONAL NOTE: VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS



(iii)   PPP Unit. In most countries, the PPP Unit plays the coordinating role by preparing the guidance
        to ministries on VGF policy, processes, and procedures and templates for use in the preparation
        of requests for subsidies, and by assisting ministries actively in the preparation of proposals. The
        PPP Unit also can act as a secretariat to the approving body and manage the VGF processes and
        monitoring and evaluation of VGF, as is planned in the case of the Kenyan model. The location
        of the PPP Unit within the government apparatus can vary. The most common option is to house
        this in Ministries of Finance, although there are stand-alone options reporting to the Head of
        State, as is the case for the Nigeria Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC)
        and the Agence de Promotion de l’investissement et grands travaux (APIX) in Senegal.

(iv)    National Planning Department/Commission/Council. National Planning Departments in
        countries are responsible for planning the development process and funding issues. In some
        countries, these play a key role in the process of reviewing and approving subsidies for
        infrastructure projects. In Colombia, the National Planning Department is responsible for
        reviewing the proposals for subsidies jointly with the Ministry of Finance, as is also the case in
        India, where the Planning Commission is involved in the review of proposals for VGF.

(v)     Inter-Departmental Committees/PPP Committees. The approval process for subsidies of any
        kind in countries usually involves a number of departments, such as the Ministry of Finance for
        the financing, guarantees, and liabilities angle, the Legal Department for the scrutiny of the legal
        clauses of agreements/contracts, the Planning Department from the programmatic and
        developmental angle, and the line ministries or implementing agency for preparing and
        explaining the business case. For the purposes of subsidy approval, countries have found it
        convenient to work through inter-departmental committees that bring all of the above departments
        together. In Brazil, an inter-departmental committee approves subsidies; in India, the Empowered
        Institution and the Empowered Committee, both of which are inter-departmental committees,
        approve VGF up to a certain pre-specified limit; and in Colombia, the National Council on Fiscal
        Policy (CONFIS) and National Council on Economic and Social Policy approve subsidies for
        projects. In Kenya, legislation has given the mandate for approval of subsidies to the PPP
        Steering Committee.

(vi)    Technical/Advisory/Financing Body. Specialized technical bodies/institutions separated from
        the government departments but constituted as public entities could also carry out most of the
        functions related to the subsidy and project approval processes in PPPs along with the concerned
        ministry or implementing agency. This is the case in Mexico, where FONADIN, as discussed in
        an earlier section, has been constituted as a public entity with a specialized set-up consisting of
        business units, responsible for generating business jointly with the implementing agencies, and
        other specialized units for reviewing and approving requests for subsidies. In the UK, the PUK
        and later IUK, now a part of the HM Treasury, played a role in helping ministries and
        implementing agencies with business development advisory and transaction advisory services.
        Similarly, there are the Partnerships Victoria in the state of Victoria in Australia and Partnerships
        British Columbia in the state of British Columbia in Canada. In 2012, the Colombian government
        set up the National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) for handling transport infrastructure PPPs. The
        advantage of such specialized bodies is that they bring the substantial technical and financial
        expertise difficult to achieve or retain in a government department.

(vii)   Audit Agency. A country’s national audit agency forms a key part of the accountability
        mechanism in a VGF process. In most cases, there is audit after the fact for VGF. The audit might
        be confined to the approval process and the appropriateness of the subsidy. Audit may also extend
        to the implementation of the project accessing VGF. The process of audit is highly evolved in

                                                     30
                   OPERATIONAL NOTE: VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS


           some countries such as the United Kingdom. In other countries, such as India, there is less clarity
           within the VGF scheme regarding audit of the process and projects. While many PPP contracts
           provide for accountability mechanisms like audit and outline the extent of access to
           documentation of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for the purpose of audit, it is much more
           desirable to outline the framework for audit of projects accessing VGF and the VGF process itself
           within the rules/guidance relating to VGF for greater clarity, either by directly outlining the
           details or by reference to such rules/clauses in other related rules/standard contract
           provisions/specific contract documentation pertaining to individual projects.

(viii)     Budget Office. The Budget Office examines the requests for budget and fixes ceilings for the
           VGF, including annual appropriations and indicative amounts for future years given that payment
           of subsidies is often over a longer term period, ranging anywhere from 3-30 or more years.

(ix)       Economic Affairs Office. The overall funding availability for various purposes including
           subsidies is assessed at the macro-level by the Economic Affairs Department based on what the
           Budget Office/ Department comes up with ceilings for different purposes/budget lines, including
           for the VGF, which would have its own budget line.

(x)        Debt Management Office. The Debt Management Office carries out the work of assessing,
           recording, measuring, and managing the fiscal commitments18 arising out of the payments of
           subsidies, where these are paid over a long period of time and beyond the normal budgetary
           cycle, as well as contingent liabilities arising from other forms of government support. While
           Debt Management Offices are often housed within the Ministry of Finance, they can also be
           stand-alone entities reporting directly to the President/Prime Minister.

(xi)       Accountant General. The government needs to ensure proper accounting and accountability
           systems for the VGF in which the office of the Accountant General is normally involved. The
           Accountant General’s office is also involved in the opening of fund account and reporting
           systems associated with funds.

(xii)      Public Financial Management Information Systems Office. In countries where computerized
           information systems are well developed, the Information Systems Office involved can help in
           generating consolidated reports relating to the VGF and fiscal commitments and enable
           appropriate monitoring of these.

27.        Some key lessons in the management of stakeholders in the VGF relate to the following:
          Creating clarity in the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder in the VGF process;
          Starting early the process of implementation of the VGF framework to ensure adequate capacity
           by the time VGF starts disbursing. This capacity building should target all the stakeholders in
           terms of understanding of PPP as well as the VGF;
          Ensuring that the VGF process is embedded in the existing accountability frameworks and
           processes used by internal stakeholders, where possible;
          Ensuring that these frameworks are up to international standards; and
          Ensuring that the PPP Unit has a communication strategy with regard to internal stakeholders.

28.     Creating appropriate processes for VGF assessment, approvals, disbursals, and monitoring and
evaluation, including fiscal commitment management arising from such support, is key to the long-term
sustainability of such support to projects. The VGF process can be divided into the following stages.

Lessons Learned to Date on VGF mechanisms

28.    In assessing the pros and cons of different VGF mechanisms, the following considerations are
paramount. Each is considered separately in the subsequent paragraphs.

     (i) Determining an optimal subsidy level as a percentage of the national budget at the programmatic,
           sector, and project levels; this may need to be different for different sectors given differing
           requirements and national priorities;
     (ii) Designing a VGF framework consistent with the country’s budget framework and PPP project
           approval processes, including the establishment of accountability frameworks for implementation
           (i.e., disclosure, accounting, auditing, and monitoring); and
     (iii) Consideration of affordability issues (i.e., pre-existing financial commitments and contingent
           liabilities as well as the new financial commitments created by each project).20

   IDC stands for Inter-Departmental Committee. While the nomenclature might be different in different countries, involvement
of various departments in a single approving committee/ team has given good results in terms of coordination and speed of
processing of cases.

commitments and contingent liabilities.

29.      On Optimal Fiscal Commitments: One of the most important lessons learned from looking at
VFG mechanisms in different countries is that the level of subsidy should be market determined at the
project level, as far as possible. Different sectors and different kinds of projects within sectors may
require varying levels of support that need to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Upstream assessment
work is essential to arrive at estimates of likely VGF demand for each project and allow the government
to address “value for money” and affordability considerations, as well as provide the information
essential to effective negotiation with private sector. But the added cost and pricing discipline that comes
with the introduction of a competitive process is hard to replicate in technical and financial estimation
exercises. This has been evidenced in the case of the Indian program, where private sector bidders have
offered “negative” subsidies to win bids for PPP projects that, based on technical and financial feasibility
studies, originally indicated that a 20% VGF requirement.21 At the same time, one must underscore the
pitfalls of the market assessment method, which may result in an agreement signed on the basis of
extremely aggressive bids22 in cases where the public entity has not done its homework properly.
Especially in a situation where historical data do not exist, there could be a case for optimal risk sharing
so that benefits and costs of risk events are shared optimally between parties.

30.      In addition, governments must check if there are other ways to close the gap. For example, in the
Dakar-Diamniado toll road project, the government made substantial efforts to find the optimum toll level
to maximize revenues and reduce the viability gap. Risk allocations can also be better handled where a
project can be separated into phases, as in the case of the Ruta del Sol project, where the project was
broken into three projects with different structuring of risk, especially demand risk. In other situations, we
find that relatively low levels of equity financing can be used to reduce costs. The use of caps in country
frameworks is common to ensure that overall level of support on a single instrument or all instruments
together is limited, but there is no single best practice example to draw on. Caps have mostly been ad hoc
and applied uniformly across sectors. An exception to this is in South Korea where different caps apply
for different sectors based on the government's assessment of generic project characteristics in given
sectors. From a conceptual point of view, but always more elusive to determine accurately in practice, is
the point at which additional subsidy is judged not to provide value for money.

31.      It may help for governments to have caps at overall programmatic and/or sector level to ensure
that the government does not commit to more than it can afford from the point of view of fiscal prudence
and debt sustainability. Governments often have a level determined from time to time by Parliament of
the stock of explicit guarantees or debt they can maintain. It may help to determine from time to time the
maximum level of fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities governments can take in the context of
PPPs, given that government needs to maintain fiscal space for other purposes. The design of the VGF
should preclude budget uncertainty to the extent possible. This is one reason why revenue guarantees,
which were popular in the earlier phase of PPPs, are less sought after with greater use of fixed or variable
payments where the government's fiscal commitments are known.23

32.     On VGF Structures: On the structure of the funding mechanism, a decision on whether
budgetary appropriations are used or a separate fund is set up would be based on a number of
considerations. First and foremost, it would be determined by a country’s existing fiscal capacity and its
pre-disposition to establishing statutory funds and/or ability to operate a VGF scheme within an existing
administrative and budgetary framework. The establishment of a statutory fund, for instance, would
involve legislative action that may not be desirable or feasible given other legislative priorities and/or

21
   In the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, more than half a dozen projects which the government bid out with 20% in-principle
approval of VGF brought in “negative grants” (share paid by the private sector to the government upfront where it perceives a
surplus over the contract period after covering costs and making a reasonable return for equity investors).

timelines anticipated for the passage of an enabling Act. Another set of considerations would be the
pipeline of projects that a VGF mechanism is anticipating and the sectors it is likely to target.
Convenience and efficiency will be important criteria, including cost and time implications. If the pipeline
is limited and/or the targeted sectors have a relatively modest estimated VGF requirement, then providing
subsidies through annual budgetary appropriations may be the more suitable option.

33.      On Approval, Oversight, and Accountability Framework: A VGF mechanism needs also to
be compliant with a rigorous approval, oversight, and accountability framework. Value for money and
affordability assessments would need to be conducted at feasibility stage. Fiscal commitments would need
to be accounted for in the budget process through reflection as appropriations in the annual budget and as
indicative amounts in a country’s medium- or longer-term budgetary framework. In addition, the contract
management framework associated with PPP projects needs to be substantial to ensure value for money
through project term. Audit and disclosure mechanisms will further add to the credibility of the process.

34.     Meeting these objectives and ensuring that public financing to PPPs is managed through a
transparent and accountable system will be key to its credibility within government and with private
sector investors and potential international partner contributors. From the private sector perspective, a
well-structured VGF mechanism will signal tangible government intent and implementation capacity that
can more effectively serve to leverage private investment. For international partners, effective
management from appraisal through implementation stages and attention to outcomes and their objective
measurement will be principal determinants of any readiness to contribute. And for the government’s own
value for money requirements, the VGF should be structured to ensure subsidy disbursements are linked
to performance milestones and investors' own equity to mitigate the government's risk/exposure.

                               III.    KEY MESSAGES FOR TASK TEAM LEADERS

35.     This Note has sought to address the following questions to assist TTLs working on PPP financing
issues:


                         Box 1: Key Questions for TTLs on PPP Financing Issues

         What is the rationale for government financial support to PPP projects?

         What are the instruments available to governments to contribute to the financing of PPPs
         and what are the factors to consider in determining which instrument to deploy?

         What have been some of the approaches and experiences internationally in providing public
         support to PPPs?

         What are some of the key considerations in selecting, designing, and managing different VGF
         approaches to PPP financing?



36.      In moving forward on design work, project teams should pay close attention to the following
upstream “enabling conditions” for government support to PPPs. A checklist of factors to be addressed in
preparation and implementation phases is provided below for TTLs’ reference. A bibliography of relevant
reports, website references, and training courses is also included as Annex I.

37.      On Enabling Conditions for Effective Government Financing: There will need to be evidence
of a government technical and administrative capacity to implement given instruments efficiently. In the
absence of a track record of transactions successfully reaching financial close and implementation
proceeding smoothly with government funds being transferred to the project in a timely and accountable
fashion, this evidence will depend on the degree to which the private sector perceives the key government
departments: (i) coordinating effectively together; (ii) ensuring a strong prospective pipeline of
transactions; (iii) consistently following well-defined and predictable operational arrangements in the
deployment of government funds in line with legislative and regulatory guidelines; and (iv) having
requisite expertise resident in the principal implementing entities of government. Some of the key
indicators by which the government can show its fulfillment of these pre-conditions are detailed in Table
6.

             Box 2: Factors to Address in Selecting and Designing Government Financing Instruments

         Assessment of the likely portfolio of PPP projects, sector, type of project, principal risks, and revenue sources
          and levels to determine whether government support is best provided via guarantees, risk-sharing contract
          clauses, equity, debt or subsidy, or an optimal combination of these.
         What are the principal policy drivers from the government’s perspective?
         Assessment of the levels and duration of support required; in terms of level of support should there be a cap,
          should the cap be disclosed to the private sector, and what should be the basis of the cap?
         Assessment of whether the chosen instrument/s is/are compatible with sector policy and regulations.
         Assessment of whether the chosen instrument/s is/are sufficiently flexible to allow for and manage at least
          some of the major changes in economic and financial variables over contract term.
         Does the PPP pipeline have sufficient volume to justify the establishment of a “facility” – be it for equity
          investments, guarantees, or subsidies, or do the market conditions merit a more ad hoc project-by-project
          approach.
         Can an approach based on a pre-established framework provide sufficient flexibility to cater to different
          needs of projects?
         Does the government/National PPP Unit have sufficient capacity to handle more complex instruments?
         Does the private sector have the capacity to share risks and which risks can it effectively share?
         Is the aim to attract domestic or other financiers and do domestic financiers have the required capacity/
          appetite to finance projects?
         Would the considerations of domestic versus foreign capital investments affect the choice of support
          instrument and its design?
         What is the level of risk perception of financiers towards the different instruments under consideration?
         What are the broader legislative and fiscal considerations and implications for different financing options?
         What are the institutional processes at preparation stage that can be used to assess these implications ?


39.     At the Implementation Stage: Box 3 summarizes the arrangements that should be in place for
effective implementation:

                              Box 3: Factors to Address for Effective Implementation:

         Clearly defined processes and procedures for implementation.
         Robust methodology for assessment of requirement of support at feasibility stage.
         Methods to ensure at feasibility stage whether the support is fiscally affordable for the government from the
          point of view of the fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities that may arise out of such support.
         Open and transparent bid procedure with, if possible, a market determination of the support required.
         Reliable budget allocation system at program level.
         Streamlined disbursement procedures at project level to ensure timely payments.
         Disbursement of funds as required against well-defined performance measures.
         Clear procedures for performance monitoring of contract.
         Clear audit procedures for performance and financial audit of projects and processes.
         Ongoing monitoring, measurement, and management of fiscal commitments and contingent liabilities arising
          out of government support at project and portfolio levels.
         Systematic disclosure through (annual) published reports of project progress, fund deployment, projected
          commitments, and contingent liabilities.




40.      The development of PPP financing instruments is a multi-disciplinary task. It requires TTLs to
put together teams that combine: (i) sector-specific expertise relevant to the pipeline of actual projects to
be funded; (ii) budget and fiduciary know-how of the specific country; and (iii) private sector and
transactions and project structuring expertise.

              ANNEX III: USE OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN PRACTICE - SUMMARY OF PROJECTS

The Dakar-Diamniado Toll Road Project, Senegal26

The road sector is a priority infrastructure sector for the Government of Senegal due to issues of heavy
congestion in and around the demographically and economically fast-growing city of Dakar. The Dakar-
Diamniado Toll Road was conceived to reduce congestion and improve access. It is the first PPP toll road
in Senegal and is expected to have a substantial economic and social impact for the country. The first
section of the road was commissioned in 2011 with commencement of tolling operations. The Dakar-
Diamniado Toll Road Project is a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract with revenues coming partly
from user fees. However, the project was found to be financially unviable based on financing from
traditional sources of debt and equity and revenues from user charges alone. The solution adopted is
detailed below.

The gap in project viability has been overcome through subsidy financing by the government. However,
this was preceded by other support and structuring mechanisms. A decision was taken to build the
highway in two phases, with 100% financing and procurement by the Government of Senegal for the first
phase of the project and a 30-year concession with public and private sources of financing for the second
phase. The overall cost and financing for the project are summarized in Table 7.

The decision on phasing was based on traffic projections and viability estimates. The total cost of the
second phase PPP project is US$307 million with US$181 million (60%) provided by the public entity
and US$126 million (40%) provided by the private party. The private financing part of the project,
excluding the grant financing, has an approximate debt-equity ratio of 2:1 with 13% equity as a
proportion of total PPP project cost. The viability gap for the second phase of the project was reduced
through optimum toll levels based on survey results on maximum toll acceptability of users and through
careful construction of the risk matrix. In addition, to maximize revenues, a mixed toll design was
adopted, with an open length of highway with fixed toll and a closed length with variable tolling but with
an alternate freeway available to users. The toll rate caps are fixed by government with a provision for
periodic reviews. By limiting the higher return that equity requires relative to debt, the low level of equity
also effectively kept the cost of capital lower than it might otherwise have been. The private party
mobilized its proportion of financing through a 10-year debt (2014-2024) obligation, as well as in the
form of equity.

The main bid parameters, among others, were the amount of subsidy required, the guarantee amount
required, and the extent of risk sharing acceptable to the bidder, given an internal rate of return (IRR) of
20%. The government provided for sharing the demand upside through profit-sharing clauses applicable

beginning the 16th year if revenues exceeded specified levels. Traffic, design, construction, financing, and
operation and maintenance risks have been allocated to the private party while the government bears the
site risk and any risks arising out of non-payment or delayed payment of grants. Risk of performance by
private party was mitigated without driving up costs too much through the requirement of bank guarantee.


The Ruta del Sol Project, Colombia

The Ruta del Sol project in Colombia is a major road project that links the capital with areas of major
economic activity. It is a combined greenfield and brownfield project structured into three contracts. In
March 2009, the Government of Columbia approved an approximately US$3.5 billion subsidy
contribution to the Ruta del Sol project to help finance construction and part of operation and
maintenance costs and to help concessionaires leverage additional resources for construction. The project
was structured as three separate smaller projects rather than one large project to minimize project risk in
the aftermath of the financial crisis, when private sector appetite for infrastructure investments was
expected to be low. The project was awarded in 2009-10 and achieved financial close soon after. A
summary of the project is provided in Table 8.

A unique feature of this project is that the payment mechanism, bid parameter, and risk allocation do not
have a uniform structure for all the sectors. Sector 1 is the greenfield part of the project, where traffic
estimates were unknown at the time of project development and biding, making the potential demand risk
extremely high. Sector 1 was, therefore, structured as an availability payment-based, 7-year concession
with separate construction and operation payments. The traffic risk is totally borne by the government for
Sector 1, taking into account the private sector’s lack of appetite for taking on demand risk in a secto r
with no historical traffic data. The bid parameter used was the lowest present value (PV) of government
payment, subject to a pre-stated cap. The site risk and geological risk were retained by the government.
While this sector is tolled, the user charges are collected by the concessionaire on behalf of government
and handed over to government. Since the demand risk was totally borne by government, this concession
had a limited fixed term of 7 years.

Sectors 2 and 3 were brownfield projects based on redevelopment and improvement of existing projects.
These two sectors had well known traffic numbers and therefore, were structured as toll-based
concessions with government subsidies making up for the viability gap. The bid parameter is the lowest
PV of toll revenues and government payments, with the concessions having a variable term based on
achievement of the revenues by the concessionaire. The demand risk is borne by the private entity, but is
mitigated by the variable term, which ensures that the private entity is able to recover its investment. The

site risk and geological risk have been retained by the government based on prior negative experience of
risk allocation to private party. The subsidy for these sectors has the following features:

        The concessionaire will receive a subsidy payment based on the construction performance,
         measured monthly during the construction period of five years;
        Performance measures were defined as: (a) at least 10 km of continuous new road; and (b) at least
         10 km of existing road with improved geometry. Each stretch of 10 km will give the
         concessionaire the right to receive a portion of the construction subsidy; and
        This subsidy will be paid during the first 10 years only and includes a pre-stated cap on the
         subsidy amount that Government will pay.


Hyderabad International Airport Limited, India

The Hyderabad International Airport Limited (HIAL) in India was conceived to cater to increasing
demand for international airport services in the state of Andhra Pradesh, which had over the years seen a
growing expatriate community from the Middle East as well as the United States. It was also expected
that the airport would meet part of the demand from neighboring states due to its convenient location in
central India. The new project was conceived as a greenfield international airport project with the existing
airport ceasing operations after the commissioning of the new airport. However, pre-feasibility studies
showed a significant gap in viability with conventional financing mechanisms and revenues through user
charges alone. The government sought to make the project bankable through various support mechanisms
in addition to a sponsoring authority/ contracting agency grant. HIAL is a joint venture (JV) between the
private parties GMR and Malaysia Airport Holding Behard (MAHB) and the public entities - the
Governments of India (Airports Authority of India Limited) and Andhra Pradesh. This is a “Design,
Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer” (DBFOT) arrangement and an example of government financing
using multiple sources; i.e., equity, interest-free debt, grant financing, and land lease at a nominal cost.
The project was commissioned in March 2008.

The total project cost at financial close was Rs. 2478 cr (approximately US$490 million). Of this, Rs.
1993 cr (approx. US$398 million) was financed through debt financing by various banks. This includes
Rs. 315 cr (approx. US$63 million and 16% of the overall debt financing) coming from the state
government as interest-free loan payable in five equal annual installments after a moratorium of 16 years
from start date. Figure 1 illustrates the sources of debt financing in HIAL.

In addition, VGF of Rs. 107 cr (approx. US$20 million) was provided by the sponsoring authority, the
Airports Authority of India Limited, and the Governments of India and Andhra Pradesh contributed equal
levels of equity, amounting to a combined 26% of overall investment costs (Figure 2). Total government
direct financing support to the project (equity, interest-free loan, and grant) was at Rs. 520.28 cr (approx.
US$104 million), approximately 20% of total project cost. Other types of support provided comprised: (a)
approximately 5,490 acres of land were provided at Rs. 155 cr (approx. US$30 million); (b) stamp duty
and registration fees were waived on the transfer of land; and (c) sales tax was waived on all construction
material by the state government and tax was exempted for a period of 10 years on all profits and gains of
the project.

Sources of revenue for the airport are user charges from airlines and passengers, including a user
development fee (UDF) levied on passengers. The concession period of 30 years from commissioning
date can be extended for another 30-year period. Risk allocation is of the routine type seen in most Indian
PPP projects, with the major risks such as demand, construction, performance, and financial risks,
transferred to the private party, but with substantial subsidy and non-subsidy support by the national and
provincial governments.

The Incheon Expressway Project, Republic of Korea27

The Incheon Expressway Project was built as the sole transportation connection between the Seoul
Metropolitan Area and the Incheon International Airport. The successful bidder, the New Airport
Highway Co. Ltd. (a consortium of Samsung Corporation and others), was responsible for the
construction and then maintenance of the Incheon International Airport Expressway for a total period of
30 years. The project financing was through debt and equity provided by the private party and a
construction subsidy provided by the government for a total cost of US$1.4 billion. Government also
guarantees a minimum level of revenues to the private party. It was commissioned in 2000. Figure 3
provides a summary of this financing arrangement.

The contract provides for extension of term as well as revision of toll rates, should demand fall below the
projected traffic by more than 20% in any year of operation. A minimum revenue guarantee operates at
20% below the projected revenues to mitigate the demand risk. However, any losses between 0 and 20%
of projected revenues are borne by the private party. The demand risk is, therefore, shared by the two
parties. The risk for government is high in the case of revenue guarantees, but when government builds
the revenue guarantee into contract period flexibility and provisions for tariff variation, the government's
own risk is reduced to an extent. This structure does leave open the possibility of more significant
contingent liabilities if revenues fall substantially. In this situation, contract period extension and tariff
hikes may not be able to fill the gap and actual payments would have to be made by government. In the
case of the Incheon expressway, the actual traffic was approximately half of that projected. The
projections in the agreed financial model showed that traffic on the expressway would be around 100,720
vehicles/day. However, the actual average daily traffic as of April 2002 was only 51,597 vehicles/day. As
a result, the minimum revenue guarantee (MRG) clause in the contract, which guaranteed up to 80% of
projected revenues, was activated. The actual traffic figures have not increased much between 2002 and
2012: 51,815 vehicles/day in 2011 and 52,970 vehicles/day in 2012, a marginal increase.

Silo Project, Madhya Pradesh, India29

The Government of Madhya Pradesh has embarked on a series of eight silo projects to increase the state’s
grain storage capacity. The state established the Warehousing & Logistics Policy in 2012 to promote the
silo projects. The first of these projects, sponsored by the Madhya Pradesh Warehousing & Logistics
Corporation, includes the construction and operation of four steel silo complexes to hold 50,000 MT of
wheat at Pathari Haweli in the district of Vidisha. The Madhya Pradesh project is being implemented
under a DBFOT model with contract duration of 30 years. The concessionaire will be responsible for
unloading, debagging, cleaning, drying, storing, bagging, and loading and for vehicle turnaround. The
expected cost of each project is Rs. 30 cr. The concessionaire will bring in equity and debt financing.

Multiple government support instruments have been used to make this project financially feasible for the
private provider such as:

        Provision of land: Land of up to eight acres will be provided for each of the projects. The
         original project also provided for use of a small part of the land up to one acre for agri-related
         services, such as flour mills and farmers’ convenience stores, to be provided on payment; i.e., to
         serve as revenue earners for the project.

                        OPERATIONAL NOTE: VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS


            Upfront and operational grant: A maximum VGF of 20% of the total project cost is expected to
             be provided by the state government and an additional 20% under the Government of India ’s
             scheme for supporting PPPs in infrastructure. The payment of grant will be made after the private
             provider brings in 100% of his equity. The grant payments will be pari passu with debt
             installments over the construction period and a part of the grant payment will be paid during the
             operational phase, with each installment equal to 5% of the total grant support.
            Ten-year supply of wheat guarantee: This is provided by the public authority which will have
             exclusive use over this period. This is a demand guarantee with the government paying the fixed
             charges whether or not it uses the capacity. After the period of 10 years, the public authority may
             continue to use the services, or if there is no demand or there is a policy change by the
             government, the public authority may de-reserve a part of the total capacity. The private provider
             can then use the de-reserved capacity to provide storage services to anyone in the market and
             recover revenues. A part of the revenues would then be shared by the private provider with the
             public authority.
            Regular availability payments for the guaranteed quantity for ten years: The payment has
             three components: (i) a fixed charge equal to Rs. 75.5 multiplied by the availability of storage for
             the month; (ii) a variable charge for the food grains actually stored at Rs. 0.50 per quintal per
             month; (iii) a service charge as agreed for unloading and debagging at Rs. 2.25 per quintal to be
             paid on the weight handled.

The demand risk is fully covered for the first 10 years given that the government will pay for all the
capacity. Demand risk begins in the 11th year due to the clause on de-reservation, although the risk is
moderated given that the private grain businesses are likely to require storage space. These are small
projects, but the structuring of the government support keeps open the idea of full or partial use by the
private sector as well as a revenue share if usage changes from public to private.

Mersey Gateway Bridge, United Kingdom

The Mersey Gateway Bridge project is a 1-km, 6-lane toll bridge over the Mersey River, linking the
Central Expressway in Runcorn with the Eastern Bypass and Speke Road in Widnes. In addition to the
bridge, the project also includes improvements to approach roads along the route of the project. The
sponsoring authority for the project is the Halton Borough Council (HBC). While it is a new (greenfield
project), it is being built 1.5 km east of the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge, with the objective of relieving
the traffic congestion on a bridge designed for 8,000 vehicles/day that is currently carrying an estimated
80,000 vehicles/day.

The project30 is contracted under a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) arrangement, procured on
a fixed price basis. The project term will be 26.5 years from commissioning. According to current
estimates, toll revenues will cover about 70%. Government will cover the balance using a combination of
various types of support, such as:

       Government guarantee: The guarantee will be for 50% of the senior debt of the project up to £270
        million31 and is expected to help Merseylink tap the project finance market at better terms. It is part of
        the UK Guarantee Scheme32 initiated under PF2 to stimulate the project finance market for
        infrastructure projects.

                    OPERATIONAL NOTE: VIABILITY GAP FINANCING MECHANISMS


   Availability Payments: Availability or service payments will be paid after commissioning of the
    project over the operational period of the contract out of the toll revenues as well as an annual grant to
    the HBC from the UK Department for Transport that has been capped at £14.55m. This will be a
    graduated, decreasing resource Availability Support Grant funding over 12 years starting in 2017-18
    (following the opening of the bridge) to 2028-29. In addition to the Availability Support Grant
    committed, the government through the DfT has undertaken to provide Additional Availability
    Support if required and “to stand behind any shortfall to the level of toll revenue required to meet
    Halton’s financial obligations,” according to the parliamentary written statement on contingent
    liabilities delivered on March 10, 2014. 33
   Lump Sum Grant: The DfT will provide a grant of £86m to the Halton Borough Council as part of
    the development budget of the project to cover the costs of land assembly and advance works
    remediation.

The variety of instruments used can be linked to the government’s direct objectives. The guarantee
support of up to 50% of the senior debt is expected to enable financial close in what has been a weaker
project finance market in the United Kingdom since the global financial crisis and is part of the larger
objectives of the UK government to reactivate the project finance market through the UK Guarantee
Scheme. This support is considered essential for the project to obtain financing, given that the project
continues to have an estimated 30% viability gap in its financial model and, while there is a traffic track
record due to the existing Silver Jubilee Bridge, demand risk exists as the project is based on traffic levels
that entail a growth beyond trend. To address this, part of the grant is paid upfront at service
commencement. But to also take into account the high probability that traffic numbers will take time to
develop, availability payments will be made for a certain period, to be assessed through periodic reviews
of actual toll revenues so that the government is able to fully utilize the upside in revenues.

The Port of Miami Tunnel Project United States

The Port of Miami Tunnel project in Florida in the United States includes a tunnel, roadway work, and
bridge-widening work. It will link the Port of Miami with the MacArthur Causeway and I-395 on the
mainland and has the following objectives:

    (i) Improving access to the Port;
    (ii) Improving traffic safety in downtown Miami by routing heavy traffic away from the city; and
    (iii) Facilitating development plans in and around Miami.

The project almost did not happen due to the 2008 financial crisis. Initial equity providers for the project
backed out and with the disappearance of the monoline insurance market and the weakening of the private
activity bond market, Florida Department of Transportation used the Transportation Infrastructure
Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) federal loan program for financing the project. The project sponsors
are FDOT, Miami City, and Miami-Dade County, all three sharing the capital costs of the project. Miami
Access Tunnel, LLC (MAT) is the private partner, which has equity participation by Meridiam
Infrastructure Finance, S.a.r.l. and Bouygues Travaux Publics, S.A. The private partner will be
responsible for the construction and operation and maintenance of the tunnel. The project achieved
financial close in October 2009. The construction is expected to be about 55 months and, thereafter, there
will be an operation period of 30 years, with the contract expiring on October 15, 2044.

The project uses multiple government support instruments for the project, including fixed payments
during construction totaling US$100 million, a final construction completion payment of US$350 million,
a TIFIA subordinate loan of US$341.5 million, and annual availability payments of US$32.5 million over
a 30-year period. The TIFIA loan repayments are scheduled to begin only after completion of senior debt
service in 2015 to the 10 senior lenders for the project - BNP Paribas, Banco Bilbao Bizcaya Argentina,
RBS Citizens, Banco Santander, Bayerische Hypo, Calyon, Dexia, ING Capital, Societe Generale, and
WestLB. Accrued interest on the TIFIA loan will be repaid out of availability payments from 2016 until
2023, when principal amortization of the TIFIA loan begins, again to be paid from the availability
payments. The tunnel will not be tolled.

              ANNEX IV: INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES OF GOVERNMENT VGF ARRANGEMENTS

India

The scheme for support to PPPs in infrastructure in India: (i) is administratively simple; (ii) fixes
government fiscal commitments upfront; (iii) captures the upside through revenue-sharing mechanisms;
and (iv) uses annually appropriated funds. The Government of India pays grants to PPP projects during
the construction stage, linking these to construction/performance milestones, debt disbursements, and
equity paid-in. The total amount of grant paid is based on the present value of the viability gap presented
by the specific project, including a reasonable return to the investor, calculated using lifecycle estimated
revenues and costs and a prescribed discount rate. The private party is expected to bring in sufficient
equity and debt financing of its own. Financing is made available to PPP projects that are implemented by
a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) with at least 51% private equity. The project is normally expected to
have at least 20% equity to total project cost, although this is not a rigid requirement. The project must
provide a service and earn a large proportion (at least 60%) of its revenues from user charges.

The concerned Government/statutory entity seeking a VGF allocation for a project is required to certify,
with reasons: (i) that the tariff/user charge cannot be increased to eliminate or reduce the viability gap of
the PPP; (ii) that the project term cannot be increased for reducing the viability gap; and (iii) that the
capital costs are reasonable and based on the standards and specifications normally applicable to such
projects and that the capital costs cannot be further restricted for reducing the viability gap.34 Financing
under the VGF is limited to 20% of the project cost; however, the public entity sponsoring the project can
provide up to a further 20% as additional grant. The 40% cap is not varied under normal circumstances.

Upfront grants mitigate the risk of returns to the investor to an extent, while keeping the government's
own fiscal risk limited as payments are fixed and known in advance. The PPP contract, in some cases,
provides for a sharing of revenues on the upside, so that the private party does not capture the entire
windfall should actual revenues exceed estimated revenues. The demand risk of the private party is
mitigated in some contracts through clauses allowing term variance35 based on actual user charge
revenues (excluding grants) earned. The government is subject to the risk that the private entity will not
perform in the case of upfront viability gap financing, which is mitigated in the case of India by requiring
100% equity to be paid in before making the first installment of grant payment available and making
grant payments proportionate to debt installment payments made by the lead financier to the SPV.

VGF is made available by the Government of India through its budgetary resources. Budget provisions
can be made on a year-to-year basis, linked to likely demand for disbursements during the year. There is
no pre-specified cap on the amount of subsidy that can be disbursed in any given year. However, fiscal
space and pipelines do constitute natural limits to the amount of subsidy that will be drawn down. In the
first year of operation of the program, budgetary provision of US$40 million (Rs. 200 cr) was made. The
total VGF support during any year is based on the estimated requirement for disbursals during the given
year.

Grant disbursal processes can add to the risk of delays by their complexity. In India, grant financing
agreed to is paid by the Ministry of Finance to the lead financier in installments as required. The lead
financial institution in turn disburses these amounts directly to the project rather than going through the
procedures within various ministries or levels of government. There are no separate provisions for
varying/recovering the VGF should total project costs be below expectations. However, since disbursals
are made proportional to debt disbursals, and banks require financial statements and cost incurred

statements of private entities before disbursing debt, the VGF payment would essentially get curtailed
should costs be lower than stated in the financial model approved as part of the bid package.

The VGF program also provides for payment mechanisms other than upfront lifecycle VGF spread over
the construction stage, but in practice this does not appear to have been used. India has not used either
equity or other forms of support under this program. However, as seen from the airport example provided
earlier, the government has provided other forms of support to PPP projects under its other programs. The
IIFCL, which is a 100% government-owned and -guaranteed entity, supports PPP projects through
financing 20% of the total debt. It is also working on a credit enhancement facility that will provide
various kinds of credit enhancement instruments for use in PPP projects. The Government of India has
provided up to 26% equity financing in the case of four major airport PPP projects in the country as well
as for power distribution companies structured as joint ventures. Equity, debt, and grant financing
combined in the same project have so far been used only in specific projects in the transport and other
sectors.

Mexico36

FONADIN (Fondo Nacional de Infraestructura or the National Infrastructure Fund) is an example of a
capital fund formed by combining the assets of two pre-existing infrastructure funds, the FARAC (Fondo
de Apoyo para el Rescate de Autopistas Concecionadas) and the FINFRA (Fondo de Inversion en
Infraestructura). The initial capitalization of FONADIN was at US$3.3 billion. FONADIN: (i) is
administratively more complex than India's VGF as it combines various forms of subsidy and non-
subsidy support; (ii) uses performance-based payments; and (iii) is independent of the budget cycle.

FONADIN consists of a number of support products through the use of which the viability gap of a PPP
project can be effectively narrowed/closed. These products are categorized into recoverable as well as
non-recoverable products. Under the “non-recoverable” category, grants are provided that can finance: (i)
viability gaps; (ii) studies; and (iii) sub-equity paid into projects. “Recoverable” products include: (i)
equity (what is termed as risk equity by FONADIN as opposed to sub-equity); (ii) subordinate debt; (iii)
guarantees of different kinds; and (iv) investment into equity funds which in turn invest in infrastructure
PPP projects. For each of these, a pre-set cap signifies the maximum payable into any single project.
Subsides paid into a project cannot exceed 50% of total project cost (Figure 4).

Projects can be supported when they have significant private sector involvement and generate the
remaining proportion of revenues through the levy of user charges. They are required to have a minimum
of 20% equity as a proportion of total project costs to mitigate government's risk and ensure private party
performance. In addition, the subsidies are disbursed according to timelines prescribed in each contract.
Subsidy is determined through an open and transparent system of bidding with the criterion of lowest
subsidy required. Grants payments are made by FONADIN to the private entity through the line ministry.
While the FONADIN is housed in the Banobras, its operations are completely separated from the other
financing operations of the Banobras to prevent conflict of interest issues.

South Korea

South Korea uses a variety of subsidy payment mechanisms, based on structuring needs of projects. This
includes: construction grants, lifecycle cost-based grants, and other types of guarantees. These are
financed through regular budgetary appropriations. A unique feature of the construction subsidy support
in South Korea is the separate caps provided for different sectors, unlike the practice in other countries
where general caps are applicable across sectors. For the roads and ports sectors, with the exception of a
few categories of port projects, the applicable cap is 30%, whereas for rail projects a cap of up to 50% is
provided. Subsidies are determined through bids as is the case in almost all other countries. Subsidy
payment is spread over the period of construction and is linked to achievement of pre-specified
milestones. In addition, the government also provides for payments to projects for lifecycle costs,
calculated separately as payments linked to capital investments in the project and those linked to
operation and maintenance costs. These payments are spread over the contract period. Various types of
credit guarantees are also provided to PPP projects to enable them to access financing at lower rates than
they would otherwise have been able to, thus helping to reduce the viability gap. South Korea provided
minimum revenue guarantees as an instrument of support but discontinued use in 2009, preferring to
support PPPs through alternative instruments.

Brazil

Brazil provides for subsidy payments to infrastructure in the form of grants invested in the project as
VGF, grants for project preparation, and guarantees against non-payment of grants by government. The
amount of grants approved in any year cannot exceed 3% of total state or federal revenues. Brazil neither
uses simple annual appropriations like India nor has a separate fund as established by Mexico. It follows a
system whereby the total subsidies approved for projects in any particular year are appropriated from the
annual budget, but are categorized as interest payments and, as such, are a non-discretionary obligation of
government.

Grants to be paid to projects are determined on the basis of an open and transparent bidding process
where the bid criterion is the lowest level of grant required. Grant disbursements are made directly to the
concessionaire/private entity by the PPP unit based on request by the line ministry and the receipt of a
report on achievement of milestones by the independent verifier concerned. The Brazilian government has
also set up a Federal Guarantee Fund with an asset size of US$3.4 billion. This fund guarantees subsidy
payments by the public entity to the private entity for federal initiatives. It is not available to sub-national
government payments.

                                              discounted costs of the project, including repayment of debt, and a reasonable rate of return for the investors. The
                                              Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR, as opposed to EIRR) and the Net Present Value (NPV) are the indicators of

 Lead Financier                                The main financier in a syndicated debt financing transaction, who finances a substantial proportion of the total
                                              debt, selects co-financiers, and takes key decisions on the transaction.
 Lease                                        Leases are generally public-private sector arrangements under which the private operator is responsible for

                                          collateralized bond.
 Negative Subsidies                        Pre-specified payments, usually determined by bid, made by the SPV operator to the public authority from the
                                          surplus revenues expected or earned from a user charge-based PPP project.
 Non-compete Clause                        A standard contract clause in PPPs by which the government agrees to not build, or allow to be built, competing
                                          infrastructure for a part or the entire duration of the contract or till a certain level of demand is achieved.
 Payment Guarantee                         This is commonly used in power sector PPPs (IPPs) where the government guarantees the off-taker’s obligation to
                                          pay.
 Performance-based Payment                Payment based on the achievement of a pre-specified performance milestone.
 Performance Bond                         A bond issued by a financial institution guaranteeing performance at agreed levels by the PPP SPV. A performance
                                          bond can be partially or fully forfeited in the event of performance failure.
 Performance Indicators                   A pre-agreed set of measures that are used to compare performance to established benchmarks in PPPs.
 Public Private Partnership                PPP refers to arrangements, typically medium- to long-term, between the public and private sectors whereby some
                                          of the services that fall under the responsibilities of the public sector are provided by the private sector, with clear
                                          agreement on shared objectives for delivery of public infrastructure and/or public services. 39
 Revenue Guarantee                         The government guarantees the PPP SPV a pre-specified level of demand (e.g., tonnes of grain in a PPP grain
                                          storage project, traffic in a PPP toll road) or revenues (e.g., when revenues fall below the pre-agreed level, the
                                          government pays the difference).
 Revenue-sharing Mechanism                The government and the PPP SPV share the revenues from toll/user charges. In a typical PPP, the revenue share
                                          may begin only after total revenues reach a pre-agreed level. However, this may be different based on the revenue
                                          profile of projects.
 Risk                                      An uncertain event which when it happens may affect the cost of a project.
 Risk Allocation                           Placing responsibility for a risk with a party through a contract.

                                          increase over time in accordance with an indexation formula.40
 Special Purpose Vehicle                  A bankruptcy remote entity formed for the purpose of financing and managing specific assets.
 Sub-equity                               An equity instrument that gets a return only if the actual realized IRR is higher than the estimated IRR.
 Subordinate debt                          Debt that has a lower priority in terms of repayments relative to senior debt. It is paid after claims relating to
                                          senior debt have been paid in full.
 Take Out Financing                        Take Out financing is used to replace shorter-term loans in infrastructure PPPs, usually after completion of
                                          construction, although these could be used at any point of time. These serve to increase loan terms where the
                                          financier may be unwilling to lend longer term at the outset but will do so when the risk profile of the project
                                          changes with time or achievement of a specific milestone.
 Unitary Payments                          A single annual, quarterly, or monthly payment made to the PPP SPV/private entity for the services provided. This
                                          includes the capital as well as the operational components.

Upfront Equity Requirement   A requirement by government/ financial institution that the private entity expend a part of or the full equity before
                             it becomes eligible for grant/debt installments.
Usage-based Payment           A payment mechanism whereby the government pays the PPP SPV the agreed rate for every unit of service
                             consumed.
Variable Payment              A payment mechanism which consists of payments that vary based on some specific related variable, such as
                             volumes of service actually provided.
Variable Term Contract        The contract term is based on a specific variable which is pre-agreed, such as the present value of total revenue
                             earned. In a variant of this, the contract has a fixed term but includes a clause that allows for either reducing or
                             increasing the contract term based on actual revenues vis-à-vis projected revenues.
Variable Tolling              Tolling that has rates which vary based on time of day or congestion.
                             Grant funding provided by governments to close financing gaps in PPP projects where there is a favorable
                             Economic Rate of Return (ERR) but the Financial Rate of Return is insufficient to attract private financing. This
                             occurs where the present value of the revenue flow from a project does not cover the present value of the costs of
Viability Gap Financing      the project, including a reasonable rate of return to the investors.
                             A bond which can be redeemed for face value at maturity but does not pay a coupon or regular interest. The
Zero-coupon Bond             earning from this instrument is based on the extent of discount at purchase.
