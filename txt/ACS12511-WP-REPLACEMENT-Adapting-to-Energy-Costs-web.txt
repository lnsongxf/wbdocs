BOX 1. WHY USE MIXED METHODS TO ASSESS IMPACTS OF ENERGY REFORMS?

Combining qualitative and quantitative research to examine the impacts of energy tariff reforms in ECA has
heralded various benefits. In some cases, qualitative research generated knowledge that can be used to improve
the relevance of quantitative research. For example, it confirmed that the energy expense burden for a large
number of households is concentrated in the 3–6 coldest months of the year. Collecting expenditure data
separately for the heating and nonheating seasons can paint a more accurate picture of the challenges presented
by growing energy tariffs to the household budget, compared to average annual spending.

FGDs also add depth to findings, revealed through quantitative data, and are useful when considering appropriate
policy solutions. In Serbia, where utilities struggled with low collection rates for services in certain communities,
FGDs showed that many households were unable to cope with high interest rate payments, which perpetuated
a cycle of debt and nonpayment. Similarly, in Turkey’s southeastern region, where payment rates for energy
were disproportionately low, qualitative research revealed a range of political and socioeconomic factors that
augmented mistrust towards energy providers, and affected households’ willingness to pay. A ‘social compact’
approach was piloted in this region to improve trust as well as collection rates.

Qualitative and quantitative information can sometimes lead to controversial findings. Exploring these
contradictions provides insight into people’s perceptions that drive their attitudes to the reforms. For example,
many FG respondents in this research have provided consistently inflated estimates of the share of their income
spent on energy sources. This could partly be attributed to their desire to emphasize that energy expenses present
a serious burden to the household. However, researchers also observed that respondents tend to consider only
their sources of steady formal income (salary, pension) when estimating the share of energy expenses, not
informal or seasonal work, self-produced food, and so on. Their anxiety over the prospect of rising tariffs was
strongly tied to unpredictable incomes, as many households have begun to rely increasingly on incomes form
migration and informal work, which may fluctuate over time.

     II.         HOUSEHOLD VULNERABILITY TO
                 ENERGY TARIFF INCREASES




    The impacts of rising energy tariffs on households depend on a variety of factors. These include
    household income and income security, the type of energy source used, the household’s
    location and ability to substitute energy sources, the type of housing, and the availability and
    cost of energy-efficiency measures. Urban households are often more directly affected by the
    elimination of subsidies for gas and district heating, since they use these sources more often.
    At the same time, poor rural households also face an overall high energy burden. Although they
    are not affected by district heating tariff increases, rural and semiurban households are often
    hit harder by increased electricity prices, as they may use electricity more intensively to heat
    water, for house plot irrigation, and as a supplementary heating source. In all countries, certain
    social groups, such as elderly, single-parent households, and ethnic minorities, seem to be
    more vulnerable to energy tariff increases than others.

     BOX 2. VARIATIONS IN ENERGY SOURCES USED BY COUNTRY

     The energy use patterns described above are true for most countries in the region—urban households
     use gas or district heating for heat, networked or bottled gas and electricity for cooking, and electricity for
     lighting and powering appliances; small-town and rural households use either electricity, or wood, coal, and
     biomass fuels for heating and cooking and electricity for lighting and appliances.

     Infrastructure developments and resource availability, both domestic and imported, account for some
     differences across countries or regions. In Kyrgyzstan and northern Tajikistan, the wider availability of
     coal makes it a preferred heating and cooking source in rural areas; in most of the region’s other countries,
     however, wood is the primary fuel in rural and semiurban locations. In Tajikistan, due to political tensions
     with Uzbekistan, networked gas is no longer used for heating or cooking; with the exception of a small
     minority of apartments in the capital, the district heating network has stopped operating in most areas
     due to unavailability of gas and the resources needed to maintain the network. As a result, urban Tajik
     households rely almost exclusively on electricity for all household needs. Similarly, the southern region of
     Croatia has relied primarily on electricity for heating and cooling, as the gas network does not cover this
     region extensively, and firewood is not as readily available in this part of the country. In Bulgaria, networked
     gas covers a minority of household consumers, and is therefore rarely used as a heating source.

     Sarband. Sarband is a small urban area in Khatlon province of Tajikistan. The income of this four-member
     household (which includes a husband, a wife, a two-year-old daughter, and a grandfather) consists of the
     wife’s salary as a janitor at the local school and the grandfather’s pension. The husband, an accountant
     by training, was the family’s main earner until 2012, when he was laid off due to budget cuts. He borrowed
     money from friends and relatives and went to Moscow to work in a beer factory. In his first 10 days on the
     job he hurt his arm and was unable to continue working. He returned to Tajikistan, working occasional
     jobs. He is unwilling to return to Russia, as this would require significant investment in travel costs with no
     guarantee that he can earn more. With the loss of his salary and no remittances, the family’s expenses for
     energy and other utilities (water, garbage collection) now reach 43 percent of their income in the summer
     months and 96 percent of their income in the winter months. To cope with this burden, the family borrows
     food from a local shop, negotiates with electricity controllers to delay payments, and has sold valuables
     such as the wife’s gold jewelry.

     Dushanbe. The family lives in an apartment in Dushanbe, the capital city of Tajikistan. The household
     consists of an elderly couple, their two sons, two daughters-in-law, and grandchildren (other sons and
     daughters live in separate households). The household relies primarily on remittances from the two sons,
     who work in Moscow (approximately 1,944 Tajik Somoni/month), and on the disability pension of the
     father (400 Tajik Somoni/month). In 2012 the father underwent foot surgery, which significantly strained
     the family budget. The sons returned to Dushanbe to take care of their father and stayed for four months,
     foregoing their earnings in Russia. Due to their location and the fact that they live in an apartment building,
     electricity is the household’s only source of energy. Usually electricity bills comprise 2 and 7 percent of
     their monthly budget in summer and winter, respectively. However, due to medical expenses and loss of
     remittances this past winter, they have exceeded the family’s capacity to pay on time. The household has
     had to negotiate with controllers to delay payments in order to avoid disconnection. The family has also
     significantly reduced food expenses, mainly on meat, to be able to pay their electricity bills.

BOX 4. THE 1988 EARTHQUAKE ZONE IN ARMENIA

In Armenia, low-income residents of the 1988 earthquake zone are among
the most vulnerable consumers. This group faces high levels of overall
poverty and income insecurity. Many men from the area have migrated
to find work, resulting in a large number of female-headed households
with scarce employment opportunities and access to land. The condition
of some of the dwellings makes it difficult to apply effective energy-
efficiency measures. Respondents from Shirak and Lori, the two regions
most affected by the earthquake, still live in temporary housing that was constructed by the government
following the earthquake. These houses are poorly insulated and residents commonly use basic but
inefficient insulation methods, such as taping off windows, vents, and doors, and placing extra rugs on the
floor and walls. As a female respondent from Lori states, “It seems we live outdoors; wind is in the house,
rain is in the house.” Moreover, residents in these settlements almost exclusively rely on electricity, as their
houses are not connected to the gas network and poor ventilation and degraded building structure make
it dangerous to use stoves to burn wood and manure. Thus, while many groups in the country would be
strongly affected by rising energy costs, these households are expected to be exceptionally vulnerable due
to their already challenging socioeconomic status and living conditions.

     BOX 5. MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION GROUPS IN TAJIKISTAN

     In Tajikistan, some population groups are especially vulnerable to high energy expenses due to their level of
     income. These groups include single mothers (especially those without remittance income), large families,
     pensioners who live alone without family support, people with disabilities, and doctors and teachers in
     rural areas. The majority of FG respondents mention that urban and rural single mothers are the most
     vulnerable groups. The number of female-headed households has increased due to growing numbers of
     men who migrate to Russia (and Kazakhstan) for work and abandon their families at home. Female heads
     of household often have little education, few marketable skills, and several children to support. Female-
     headed households live in poor conditions and do not receive extended family support.

     Respondents also mention that large families are vulnerable to high energy costs. Traditional Tajik families
     usually have more than three children, which increases household expenses and makes it more difficult to
     afford energy. Elderly men and women who are no longer employed, or men and women with disabilities,
     are also vulnerable to high energy costs. Pensions are not enough to cover all basic needs. According to
     Tajik social norms, after marriage, women live with their in-laws and contribute to their husbands’ extended
     families; they are rarely allowed to help their own elderly or sick parents. Therefore, respondents frequently
     note that pensioners and people with disabilities who have only daughters, or no children, face more
     difficulties meeting daily needs. In rural areas, doctors and teachers, despite their professional credentials,
     are also among the most vulnerable population groups. These groups receive very low salaries, lack
     farming income, and have few opportunities to earn extra income sources in rural areas. As a result, they
     have difficulty paying for energy.

BOX 6. THE ROMA POPULATION IN BULGARIA, ROMANIA, AND CROATIA

In Bulgaria, Romania, and Croatia, marginalized Roma report greater difficulties in coping with energy
expenses. Roma respondents in Bulgaria estimate that they spend between 50 and 70 percent of their
income on energy expenses—much more than non-Roma respondents. Marginalized Roma across the
sample state they often purchase firewood in small quantities through the winter, which results in a higher
price overall. They also tend to purchase or collect lower quality fuels; buy cheaper wood scraps instead
of higher-quality wood; collect wood pallets from construction sites and old furniture from dumpsters; or
regularly burn used diapers and other waste materials that do not provide adequate heating but generate
harmful fumes in the house. Marginalized Roma often live in dwellings that are poorly insulated, which
further prevents them from adequately heating their homes.

The Roma also consider themselves particularly vulnerable to tariff increases in part due to ethnic
discrimination they experience from social assistance offices and in the labor market. In Croatia, Roma
claim that they experience discrimination when applying for social assistance. They find themselves visiting
social care centers several times and filing additional forms, yet are still ultimately rejected for assistance.
Roma also often work seasonally, which limits their access to social assistance. Roma women also state
that their vulnerability comes partly from the fact that their families are larger than non-Roma families.

     Due to limited ability to change energy sources and consumption patterns, energy tariff
     increases affect basic aspects of well-being such as nutrition, health, and comfort. Both low-
     and middle-income groups experience these impacts, with outcomes being starker for the
     poor. Poor and rural residents have a more limited range of coping strategies and are more
     constrained in their ability to employ energy-efficiency measures due to a lack of information
     and financial barriers. Their ability to save energy without encroaching on basic necessities—
     especially for the poor—is limited.

BOX 7. NONPAYMENT IN SOUTHEASTERN TURKEY

Conflict and tension in southeastern Turkey, where the majority of population is Kurdish, caused citizens
to not pay electricity bills and the government to not invest in electricity infrastructure in the region prior
to privatization. At 70 percent, southeastern Turkey had the highest electricity nonpayment and loss
rates in the country at the time of privatization. Reasons for such rates are inadequate and inefficient
infrastructure; inability to pay; outstanding debts; dissatisfaction with the electricity service; weak relations
between the citizens and the state; and learned behaviors. The distribution company does not calculate
payment and loss rates separately however; they both fall under the category of “unaccounted electricity.”
Key informants argue that because of the region’s inefficient infrastructure, some of the losses are
caused by system deficiencies, and consumers alone should not be held responsible for high loss rates.
Nevertheless, in the consumer satisfaction survey, 30 percent of respondents indicated that they know
someone in their close environment who does not pay their electricity bills regularly or who uses electricity
illegally. Illegal electricity use includes various illicit actions. Low-income households use techniques




                                                                                                                    24
     such as placing the meter inside homes where distribution company staff cannot read it. Industries and
     small-scale businesses use more sophisticated methods such as stopping or slowing down electronic
     meters and installing software to manipulate meter readings. FGDs and key informant interviews reveal
     that the industrial sector and regional small businesses are the most prominent users of unpaid electricity.
     Respondents mention that business owners bribe energy company employees to avoid fines for illegally
     using electricity and nonpayment. A respondent working in the industrial sector points out that “when an
     employee from the service provider comes to read the meter, he gets a bribe from my boss.” According to
     the consumer survey results, learned behaviors and the idea of not being obliged to pay are also important
     reasons for nonpayment in commercial communities.

     Many households in the southeastern region use electricity as a primary or a supplementary source of
     heating. Electricity is also used throughout the year to heat water. Poor households use electricity for
     cooking and switch to portable gas only when electricity is not available. More than half of the respondents
     report that the inability to pay is the primary reason for nonpayment. As a respondent from Sanliurfa states,
     “The problem is lack of economic means and low income. How can somebody working for a minimum
     wage pay for high electricity bills?” In rural areas, 92 percent of respondents believe that people do not
     have the financial resources to pay for energy expenses. Rural residents often use electricity for agricultural
     irrigation, which is highly expensive. For that reason, most of the farmers use electricity illegally and the
     number of unsubscribed irrigation wells in the region is high. According to the electricity distribution
     company, 95 percent of farmers in the southeastern region use electricity they do not pay for; 49 percent of
     the population works in agriculture, making it the main source of income in the region. The Southeastern
     Anatolia Project (GAP in its Turkish acronym), a regional development project comprised of irrigation and
     energy projects, has mainly benefited large landowners who were able to increase their yield with irrigation
     opportunities heralded by GAP. However, more than half of the irrigation projects were not realized, and
     farmers without a formal system of irrigation were left with the option of using electricity for pumped water
     irrigation. As a farmer from Sanliurfa states, “A farmer receives electricity bills of 50 thousand TRY more or
     less for a well. If he manages to harvest 50–60 tons of cotton, he can only earn 25–30 thousand TRY for
     this. How could he pay the bill?” During FGDs, rural respondents emphasized that they are unable to pay for
     electricity due to high bills that result from the accumulation of debts. As a respondent from Mardin said,
     “I would be ready to be imprisoned for ten months only if I knew that my debt was going to be cleared.”
     Eighty-eight percent of rural respondents indicate that restructuring the debt payments and installment
     plans would prevent illegal use. Rural respondents also suggest establishing fixed prices per irrigation well
     according to the size of the irrigated area and power of transformers.

     In the consumer survey, 64 percent of rural households and 26 percent of urban households indicate that
     dissatisfaction with the electricity service is the second most important reason for nonpayment. During
     FGDs, respondents complain about voltage fluctuations and unexpected power outages.

     The region’s political context has also contributed to nonpayment. Southeastern Anatolia has suffered from
     a protracted conflict situation, which has resulted in a lack of trust between citizens and the government and
     low levels of infrastructure investment. Key informants suggest that there are politicized neighborhoods in
     the region, where citizens kept the distribution company staff away and fought against forced connections.




25
Residents of these areas argue that they have been treated as “second class citizens” by the state, and
have received low-quality services for many decades. Residents believe they are entitled to free electricity.

FGDs also revealed growing conflicts between the groups that pay for electricity and those that do not.
Resentment toward nonpayers is particularly common in new urban communities built next to or within
existing pockets of poverty. Payers state they carry the burden of nonpayers.




BOX 8. NONPAYMENT IN ALBANIA

In Albania, the electricity provider identified low collection rates as an important problem and stated it
is committed to fighting against nonpayment “without any tolerance.” Consumers who do not pay their
bills risk being disconnected. However, according to qualitative research findings, the electricity company
struggles to enforce payments due to the dire situation of poor households. As a female nonpayer from
Milot puts it, “[The electricity company] knows that we don’t even have money to buy bread.”

The primary reported reason for nonpayment in Albania is the inability to pay. During FGDs, respondents
stated that they cannot afford to pay for electricity due to unemployment and the inability to cope with
basic needs such as buying clothing and school supplies for their children. As a female nonpayer from
Rrashbull put it, “Whoever is concerned about being able or not to produce daily bread doesn’t care about
paying for electricity.” Beneficiaries of social assistance point out that their monthly electricity bills and
spending on wood and gas exceed the monthly cash assistance they receive. Respondents suggest that
increasing cash assistance, even in small amounts, would help poor families pay their electricity bills. A
female nonpayer from Milot said, “I would only start paying for the electricity if the government gave my
family US$300 per month as cash assistance.” The belief that electricity should be free to poor people is
common among nonpayers, who argue that the state has failed to help poor households and that social
assistance mechanisms are insufficient to cover essential expenses.

Respondents also mention the sector’s accountability failures as a reason for nonpayment. The prevailing
feeling among nonpayers is that they are “being cheated” by the electricity company. Nonpayers argue they
are charged more than the actual quantity of electricity they consume. As most of the respondents have
limited access to their meters, they believe their meters are not accurately read. A female payer from Milot
stated, “The electricity company employees come whenever they want to check the meters and write as
much as they want in the bill.” In some neighborhoods, nonpayers claim that their meters are intentionally
altered to run faster and record higher-than-actual electricity consumption levels.

In places with historically inadequate collection rates, the main reason behind nonpayment is related to
the extent to which the nonpayment phenomenon is spread in the community. Respondents state that they
stopped paying their bills because they did not trust that other citizens would pay their share. They felt
it was unfair and pointless to do so, especially when people of higher socioeconomic status did not pay




                                                                                                                 26
     their bills. During FGDs, respondents stated that people with acquaintances and money are able to obtain
     electricity supplies illegally. A female respondent from Rrashbull claimed that “families that live in very
     good conditions and even have air conditioning in their houses pay as much as me who uses electricity only
     for lighting and uses gas to cook.” Furthermore, a male nonpayer from Bicaj stated, “If hotels with 15 floors
     do not pay their bills, why would I pay?”

     Respondents in the Bicaj and Kukes regions associate their nonpayment with the construction of the Fierza
     Hydroelectric Power Station that was completed in 1979 in arable lands that used to belong to communities.
     The population of Kukes was displaced to a new location, and nearby villages lost significant amounts of
     arable land for which they were not compensated. This is why a majority of the population has not paid for
     electricity in the past two decades.




     BOX 9. NONPAYMENT IN SERBIA

     In Serbia, FG respondents state that nonpayment is related to poverty and debt accumulation. The most
     vulnerable households illegally connect to power systems or they illegally collect wood from forests by
     the river. People do this despite knowing they may be fined or face prison sentences. Similar to Turkey
     and Albania, where nonpayment is a problem, in Serbia poor households do not consider using electricity
     illegally as stealing, and believe they are entitled to free electricity. Respondents blame the state for failing
     to help poor households and for the constant price increases and exorbitant interest rates. Poor households
     justify illegal use with the mantra, “Stealing from thieves is not stealing.” Poor residents of Belgrade who
     live in urban town settlements mention that although they do not use illegal electricity due to a lack of
     technical possibilities, they would if they could. As a poor respondent from Belgrade put it, “We’ve reached
     such a point that I would be prepared to steal electricity. I’m honest, but I’m forced to. If the state is not
     ashamed, why would I be. Is the state ashamed of its citizens living the way we do? There are much greater
     thieves in this state than I would be if I stole electricity.”

     Collecting wood is risky and includes the problem of transportation. Most poor households lack vehicles
     and use either a bike or a wheelbarrow to transport wood, which requires help from their acquaintances
     and is very difficult and tiring. Moreover, people also quarrel and physically fight with each other over the
     distribution of found wood.

     Most of the FG participants, particularly the vulnerable and households with school-aged children or
     younger, are forced to postpone electricity bill payment. In rural areas, not paying for electricity is described
     as the most efficient measure, since using electricity is not as necessary because wood is used to heat the
     home and prepare food. In urban areas, there are two approaches to not paying electricity bills. Citizens
     with a lot of debt do not make minimum payments, because the interest on the debt exceeds the minimum
     monthly payment amounts. The amount of debt related to interest is one of the most frequently registered




27
complaints. Respondents say it is impossible for them to settle their debt since after a month or two of
nonpayment in winter, they enter the vicious circle of earning “interest on interest.” Respondents whose
debt is below 30,000 dinars try to pay at least something to prevent disconnection. As one recipient of
social assistance stated, “I pay at least a little bit every month, so although my debt is more than 24,000
dinars, they do not touch me and I didn’t receive a warning note.” If respondents in debt are disconnected,
they try to reconnect to the power network on their own. Respondents mention two ways of reconnecting:
using wires from the electricity pole and unsealing the electricity meter that was previously sealed by the
power company. In such cases, respondents worry about the illegal connection starting a fire, and of being
arrested and sent to prison.

      IV.       ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND
                ENERGY-SAVING BEHAVIOR




     Households take active measures to minimize their energy consumption in order to save money.
     Low-income households do this by reducing the amount of space they heat, using energy
     sparingly, and adopting basic low-cost insulation measures. These measures impact their
     quality of life, but result in marginal savings. Middle-income households are more proactive
     about making more advanced energy-efficiency improvements and switching to new energy-
     efficient appliances. They note that their energy bills more substantially reflect these measures.




     46.	 Households consistently adopt energy-         eschewing the use of household appliances
     saving behaviors as a way to cope with energy      and frequently do work manually, such as
     payments. As a result, most respondents do         using a broom instead of a vacuum cleaner,

      V. SOCIAL ASSISTANCE AND
         PROTECTING ENERGY AFFORDABILITY




     Social assistance is an essential mechanism through which governments can mitigate
     negative impacts on rising energy costs for the poor. Findings from this research confirm that
     cash benefits are an important form of support for households that receive them. This study
     highlights areas where existing social assistance programs can be strengthened to facilitate
     access for vulnerable groups, based on respondents’ observations. The research notes that
     variations in the degree to which social benefits cover energy expenses across different groups,
     due to local circumstances, influences citizens’ trust in social assistance as a support measure
     in the face of rising tariffs. Lastly, this research affirms findings from previous studies that
     mitigation policies to offset the negative impacts of tariff reforms extend beyond those covered
     by last-resort assistance programs and include a large share of poor households. Support
     for pro-poor energy-efficiency programs, job creation, and income growth are all considered
     essential mitigation policies by respondents in this research.

               OF ENERGY INSTITUTIONS




     Public opposition to reforms is equally rooted in concerns for affordability, as it is in ones
     regarding governance and accountability. Governance and accountability concerns relate to
     the direct interaction with energy providers, e.g. quality of service, billing transparency, resolving
     grievances, citizens’ ability to express themselves as consumers, and seek their rights. They also
     relate to concerns about overall management of the sector, and their trust in the government’s
     ability to put in place reforms that benefit all. Public opposition to reforms also stems from
     deficiencies in information, mostly related to misunderstanding the justifications for reform.

The research presented in this report complements prior quantitative research on the poverty
and social impacts of energy subsidy reforms. Its findings can inform the development of more
socially sustainable energy reforms. First, qualitative findings underscore the need to develop
comprehensive solutions to support energy affordability for vulnerable groups. Coping with
high energy costs may have long-term negative impacts on health, nutrition, and overall well-
being, and affect poor as well as some middle-income households. Helping households reduce
their energy consumption without compromising their basic needs could minimize these
impacts. Second, this research highlights the need for governments and energy providers to
ensure wider acceptance of reforms by (i) improving citizens’ awareness of the rationale for
reforms; (ii) committing to high transparency; and (iii) improving the way they communicate
about improvements in sector governance. Thirdly, findings highlight the importance of
strengthening clarity regarding consumer rights and obligations, introducing accessible and
effective customer services, and enforcing strong grievance and redress mechanisms. Lastly,
findings indicate that citizen feedback is necessary to understand and address the poverty and
social impacts of reforms.

       BOX 10. USING MANURE AS ENERGY

       More than 50 percent of respondents (most of them residents
       of rural areas) reported using manure to supplement wood
       for heating, due to rising costs of other energy sources. The
       respondents prefer wood to heat their homes because of its
       availability and relative affordability. Manure that is collected
       from one’s own stock is almost free and can help further reduce
       heating payments. However, respondents complained about the
       smell and filth that results from burning manure.
                                                                             A pile of manure prepared for heating.

     BOX 12. BENEFICIARIES OF SOCIAL ASSISTANCE PREFER CASH

     Beneficiaries of cash subsidies are mostly female-headed households and families with many children.
     These respondents state that they spend most of the assistance on expenses for their children. Families
     usually apply for assistance at the beginning of the school year, when they incur higher expenses
     associated with preparing children for school. The assistance is mostly spent on clothes and footwear—
     the substantial purchases that the household is normally unable to afford. They also spend assistance on
     food or medication. Respondents state that they prefer cash assistance because it is flexible and can be
     used for different purposes.

BOX 13. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND ENERGY PROVIDERS

An FGD respondent from Bobruisk interacted with the service provider regarding high heating bills. When
he asked for clarification, the charging procedure was explained to him. He was told that every section
of the building had its own meter and that billing was based on this metering. The building in which he
lives is special because there are nonresidential tenants at the first floor (that is, a bank and shops). The
meter is common in the apartment; it measures the heat consumed by the nonresidential tenants and the
private apartments. The respondent was told that the nonresidential tenants are charged higher tariffs.
He was unsatisfied with this explanation. He believes that the service company charges the tenants more
compared to nonresidential tenants. The service provider did not provide information on the method used to
distribute the expenses among the apartments and the nonresidential tenants. Because of this experience,
the respondent does not trust the service provider.
