        GPOBA’s mandate is to fund, design, demonstrate, and document OBA approaches to
improve the delivery of basic services to the poor in developing countries. Its primary objective
is to mainstream OBA approaches within projects carried out by other development practitioners,
including developing country governments, international financial institutions, bilateral donors,
and private foundations. To date, OBA approaches have been tested in every developing region
and applied in the following sectors: energy, water and sanitation, health, solid waste management,
education, and information and communication technology. OBA projects have taken diverse
approaches, each featuring a unique design and financial model, incorporating lessons from
international experience. Pilots have been implemented in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas,
employing public and private operators, public-private partnerships, nongovernmental
organizations, and community organizations as implementing agencies and service providers. As
of September 2014, GPOBA’s portfolio consisted of 40 projects and US$190.7 million in
commitments for subsidy funding and ongoing technical assistance activities, demonstrating that
OBA can deliver a diverse range of services and lasting results for the poor.

                              Executive Summary

In many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, the unfortunate reality is that a high percentage of
households cannot afford the electricity connection costs charged by the utility company. Among
developing regions, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for nearly 45 percent of people without
electricity (table ES.1). The majority of those without electricity reside in rural areas.
Surprisingly, only 1 in 8 people in rural Africa has electricity. In the case of Ethiopia, only 10
percent of rural areas had electricity service in 2014, while the overall electrification rate had
reached just 23 percent, meaning that 70 million people in that country were still without power.
This remains true even 20 years after publication of the forward-looking policy book, Rural Energy
and Development (World Bank 1996). It also continues despite the call today by the United
Nations and other donor organizations for sustainable energy for all (UN 2011).

        The electricity connection costs in Sub-Saharan Africa are high compared to the rest of the
world (Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013); thus, only providing access to electricity may not be
enough to assure high rates of rural electrification. It is also necessary to assist poor households
with the cost of adopting an electricity connection. In the past decade, some countries have
initiated programs to lower connection costs, making electricity affordable to even their poorest
populations. The implication is that the utility companies must begin to think beyond access.

        In Ethiopia, an output-based aid (OBA) project was designed to do just that. The idea
behind the program was to increase the affordability of connection costs for poor rural consumers
so that greater numbers of people within reach of the electricity lines could partake of the many
benefits of rural electrification.

The Output-Based Aid Approach in Ethiopia
Under the Universal Electricity Access Program, launched in 2005, the Government of Ethiopia
(GoE) already had a goal of increasing the rate of household electricity adoption in rural towns
and villages that already had service. In 2007, the World Bank–funded Electricity Access Rural
Expansion Project (Phase 2) was initiated to assist the GoE in developing a sustainable program
for expanding electricity access in rural communities (World Bank 2013a). As part of the World
Bank project, the GoE agreed to allow customers to pay for the electricity connection fee over
time, thus making electricity adoption more affordable for rural populations. This component of
the project would be financed as part of a Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA)
grant, in the amount of US$8 million. The GPOBA grant augmented the World Bank project by
helping the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), the country’s vertically integrated
power utility, to finance connection fees by subsidizing the interest rates on loans to poor
customers. The GPOBA grant provided 43,000 poor rural households (some 215,000 people)
formal connections to grid-based electricity, representing 75 percent of the country’s total
connections during 2011–13.

        The US$75 connection charge levied by EEPCo is quite reasonably priced for Ethiopia’s
middle-class households, representing slightly more than 3 percent of annual family income
(averaging $470 per capita), but places a strain on the budgets of poor rural households. To make
connection fees affordable, GPOBA-participant households were required to make a down
payment of just $15 or 20 percent of the $75 connection fee. The remaining $60 balance would
be paid in small installments (about $1 per month) over five years. EEPCo, in turn, would receive
a subsidy of $35 per household from GPOBA to cover the interest rates of financing the connection
charges. In addition, each participating household would receive two free compact fluorescent
lamps (CFLs) so that monthly electricity bills would be more affordable for poor households.

         The GPOBA financing scheme was made available about 18 months after the community
first received electricity service to prevent subsidizing wealthy households that could afford to pay
                                                 xii
the upfront fees. It was assumed that those who could afford electricity would pay the full US$75
immediately, and thus the delayed introduction of GPOBA subsidies would be better targeted to
poor households. The approach appears to have worked. Many households without electricity
had the opportunity to gain access to service under the GPOBA financing scheme. Many of the
poorest households got indirect connections once the access programs reached their village.

         As part of the GPOBA program, a monitoring and verification (M&V) survey was
conducted to assess the impact of the intervention on households in rural Ethiopia. This impact
evaluation study is one of only a few rigorous attempts to understand the outcome of rural
electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa. The GPOBA program covers five diverse regions spread
throughout the country: Oromia; Amhara; Tigray; Benishangul-Gumuz (BSG); and South Nations,
Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR) (map ES.1).

       The household samples were taken from regions with high concentrations of GPOBA-
connected households, which extended from central Ethiopia north toward the border with Eritrea
and west toward Sudan. These regions comprise many of the country’s most highly populated
areas where rural electrification programs will be most active in the coming years.

Impact of GPOBA Intervention on Connection Rates
The aim of the GPOBA program was to assist in accelerating the pace of household electricity
connections, thereby increasing the effectiveness of village and town electrification. In this regard,
                                                      xiii
the project was quite successful. By 2013, for all surveyed villages and towns in the five study
regions, the overall share of GPOBA households among households with electricity had reached
nearly 42 percent (table ES.2). However, this overall penetration rate does not reflect the large
differences in regional penetration rates, ranging from 9.3 percent for the surveyed villages and
towns in Amhara to 69.5 percent for those in Oromia. That said, the GPOBA project succeeded
in accelerating household adoption of electricity in the five study regions.

        Many of the new households with electricity had indirect household connections.
Households indirectly connected to the electricity grid adopted electricity by stringing lines to their
neighbors’ houses and paying them fixed charges based on their number of appliances. The high
number of new indirect household connections can be directly attributed to the expansion of
service to the villages and towns covered under the GPOBA program. Indirectly connecting to
electricity through households with a formal meter was attractive for a variety of reasons. Some
households had lost hope of being able to obtain a direct connection serviced by EEPCo, and thus
turned to getting electricity from next door. Despite the problems encountered (e.g., dangerous
wiring to their homes), this meant that many of the poorest households could get immediate service
by using a neighbor’s legal (metered) connection. They avoided the long process and formal
requirements of obtaining a meter from EEPCo. Some survey respondents mentioned that, as
applicants for obtaining a metered connection, they had to show a land ownership certificate to
EEPCo. Households with indirect connections avoided such delays. Moreover, EEPCo’s
regulations do not allow electricity connections for non-concrete houses due to safety reasons. For
those families living in households made of substandard materials—usually the poorest customers
in the villages and towns—taking an indirect connection was their only available option and thus
these households benefited the most from indirect electricity connections.

        It should be noted that taking an indirect connection was not a matter of reducing monthly
electricity costs. Generally, such households paid higher prices through fixed charges for lights
                                                      xiv
and appliances, highlighting their willingness to pay for electricity. However, they avoided
administrative delays and having to pay the upfront fees to initiate service.

        The number of households connected directly to an EEPCo meter was actually lower than
that of those obtaining electricity indirectly from other households. The metered connection rate
for all households was just over one-third of households, which was quite similar to the rate of
indirect connections. The total cumulative direct and indirect connections for a village averaged
more than 67 percent (figure ES.1), meaning that the effective number of rural electrification
connections was more than double the numbers reported by EEPCo.

        Despite some positive features of indirect household connections, there were also
drawbacks. The main ones were poor technical household installations, dangerous wiring, and an
uncontrolled number of indirect connections to a single meter. In one case, 12 households were
indirectly connected to a single household with a metered connection. In another, the wires
connecting the households were hanging dangerously low. Poles that could be easily toppled
carried wires from one house to another. Thus, even though the indirect connections were
convenient, many were based on poor installation practices. Also, even slight delays in bill
payment could sometimes lead to an arbitrary cutoff of service.1

Household Energy Use and Impact of Electricity
Electricity is a necessary but insufficient condition for development. The benefits of rural
electrification invariably result from the use of some type of appliance or machinery. Thus, it is
necessary to trace the pathways of electricity and its eventual social and economic impacts. For
example, electricity provides improved household lighting (Nieuwenhout et al. 1998), which
immediately increases children’s study hours (Barakat et al. 2002; World Bank 2002; Unnayan
Shamannay 1996); this, in turn, improves school attendance and higher educational attainment for
children. Community or street lighting provides higher levels of community illumination during
evening hours, but the real benefit is a greater sense of security.

        The successful adoption of grid electricity first means having access to a reliable and
inexpensive electricity supply. Consumers then begin purchasing a variety of electric appliances,
such as light bulbs, radios, television sets, space coolers/heaters, cooking devices, and other small
machines. The next step is that these appliances produce results (e.g., more light, allowing for
longer study hours or increased home production; greater access to information and entertainment;
more comfort; better food preservation; more efficient cooking; and more motive power for
productive uses (World Bank 2002; IEG 2008). At times households use small cooking devices,
such as hotplates or electric coils, for heating water. In the case of Ethiopia, people sometimes
cook with the electric injera mitad (essentially a round hot plate for cooking traditional breads).
In some instances, electric lighting and small grinders allow people to prepare food more
efficiently, thereby freeing up time for other activities (World Bank 2004).

Changes in Appliance Use

The use of appliances can result in intermediate outputs (e.g., extended study time, longer hours
of operation for home businesses, better business knowledge, and more efficient business
operation). These intermediate outputs can lead to such final development outcomes as improved
education, better health, and higher income. Taking the education benefit as an example of this
process, one finds that increased study time due to electric lighting can likely result in better school
performance. In the long run, this leads to higher educational attainment and ultimately higher
income. A fairly large body of literature, beginning with Mincer (1974), discusses the returns to
education. Similarly, many studies have focused on the productive uses of electricity. The main
findings of such studies are that complementary conditions, such as active markets and available
credit, are needed in order to realize the full benefits of rural electrification (Cabraal, Barnes, and
Agarwal 2005; Asaduzzaman, Barnes, and Khandker 2009).




                                                  xvi
        Electricity offers households new opportunities, including improved quality of household
lighting, enhanced flow of information, and better communication opportunities. Households
purchase new appliances so that they may realize such benefits. The availability of electricity
enables households to purchase a wide array of appliances. Of course, they will be limited by their
income; however, even the poorest households value the purchase of new appliances.

       In the Ethiopia study, most households have not had electricity for long. The GPOBA
households have had electricity for only one or two years. Even the EEPCo households have not
had electricity for much longer. It is well established that households accumulate new appliances
over the years. After expending income to purchase appliances in a first wave, they will save
money and plan for later purchases. Thus, the results of this survey are a snapshot of this first
round of purchasing household appliances.

         The use of household energy for lighting, cooking, and communication has already been
examined. The question is which electric appliances produce such better outcomes (table ES.3).
We know that 100 percent of households with electricity have incandescent lamps or CFLs. The
GPOBA program stressed the use of CFLs by providing households two free lamps when they
adopted a GPOBA connection. Despite logistical problems in providing these lamps under the
program, more than half of GPOBA households had CFLs. A surprising finding was that 47
percent of EEPCo-connected households also had this type of lamp. The incandescent lamps were
still quite popular because they stayed lit even with voltage drops. Perhaps due to the significant
voltage fluctuations in the service areas, both EEPCo and GPOBA households had a high level of
incandescent lamps. Only a small number of households without grid electricity had electric lamps
since these households had to use either batteries or solar home systems (SHSs) for lighting.

        Many households with electricity appreciate the impact that rural electrification has on
communications. Mobile phones are found in about three-quarters of rural households that have
electricity and in just less than one-fifth of households without electricity. Households without
electricity often charge their phones at charging stations or in a neighbor’s home. Radios and
cassette players are also popular in homes with electricity. Nearly half of homes with electricity
have plug-in radios, compared to one-quarter for homes without electricity. No doubt, those
without electricity use expensive batteries to power radios. Even after a short period of having
electricity, about one-third of households purchase a television set. This surprising finding attests
to the popularity of television for obtaining news and entertainment. Very few households without
electricity have television sets.

           Note: Households without electricity are in villages with electricity. Some households in this category
           have electricity from other sources, such as batteries or PV solar home systems (SHSs).
           Communication equipment can be run on batteries.


       Most other appliances have not yet been purchased, owing to the short time that the
surveyed households have had electricity. The most surprising appliance purchase was the electric
injera mitad—a hotplate for cooking traditional Ethiopian flatbread—which is used by nearly 5
percent of rural households with electricity. Costing about US$100, this hotplate draws quite a bit
of power. A similar number of refrigerators have been bought. The purchase of these two
appliances could have a profound effect on rural household cooking practices.

Changes in Living Patterns

With better lighting, communication, and entertainment, family members no doubt change their
time-use patterns, especially during the evening hours. In the survey, questions were asked about
the two main activities of household members before and after adopting electricity. These
questions were asked of men, women, boys, and girls in the households. Although households
were likely to do more than two things in an evening, focusing on the two main activities uncovered
some patterns of social change resulting from the rural electrification project.

        In households without electricity, the main activities of men involved discussions with
family members and tending to cattle; more than one-quarter indicated that they went to sleep early
in the evening (figure ES.2). But this living pattern changed once electricity was adopted. After
obtaining electricity, men still tended cattle. However, because they did not have to go to sleep
early, they had time for other activities. The main change was the increase in television viewing,
from almost zero before electrification to about one-quarter after adopting service—about the same
number as those owning a television set. No doubt, more households will be viewing television
in the future as sets become more common in villages and towns with electricity. Perhaps due to
the availability of better lighting, men’s family discussion time increased significantly. Also, men
tended to listen to the radio a bit more than they did prior to having electricity.

 Note: The question asked only for the top two main activities of households before and after electrification. The figures are the
 main activities (% responses after electricity minus before electricity). The % figures are only for households with electricity
 answering the question; the others were treated as missing values.


        The main activities of women before having electricity differed quite a bit from those of
men. Interestingly, however, the changes due to adopting electricity were quite similar. Overall,
women’s main activity was domestic work, including cooking. After adopting electricity, women
did not go to sleep as early as before, and they did less domestic housework, which freed up time
used for activities that were quite similar to those of men. More women in households that adopted
electricity watched television and participated in family discussions. Thus, the main change for
men and women in rural households that adopted electricity related to communication. Light
allowed households to stay up longer and participate in family discussions. For those households
with televisions, nearly all men and women watched it as a main activity in the evening.

        The living patterns of children in homes without electricity differed from those of adult
household members. The main difference was that, before electricity, children studied after dark
by the dim light of kerosene lanterns. Between one-quarter and one-third of children in households


                                                                                                                                 xix
without electricity studied in the evening. Otherwise, they participated in family discussions and
went to sleep early.

        Once a household adopted electricity, children’s evening study time (both boys and girls)
increased by about 15–20 percent, reaching well over half of all households with electricity. More
boys and girls watched television in the evening, but the figure was only about 10 percent,
compared to over 20 percent for adults. Thus, television viewing does not appear to substitute for
study time. The number of boys and girls that went to sleep early declined significantly for those
living in households that adopted electricity. For girls, the increase in study time may also be
attributed to a decline in doing domestic chores during evening hours.

        Television viewing offers useful information that can enhance the productivity of inputs
used in household production, leading to increased income. Family members gain knowledge and
awareness of events and activities that are socially beneficial. Furthermore, according to the focus
group discussions (FGDs), women gain awareness of reproductive health issues, which can
empower them in household decision-making. Such changes are expected to contribute to the
improved welfare of all household members. FGD participants also wondered whether electricity
would bring new services to their community, including the opening of business establishments.

Impact on Businesses and Public Institutions

Rural electrification is not just important for rural households; it is also essential for business
development. This study finds that the benefits of electricity are quite pervasive for household
businesses, private companies, and public institutions. As a result of having electricity, households
engage in home production and sometimes even add on to their homes to sell groceries or other
retail goods. Existing small businesses immediately adopt electricity, which permits them to stay
open for longer hours and display their goods in an attractive manner. Some even buy additional
appliances, such as refrigerators and cooking devices, to better serve their customers. Businesses
are also established because of new opportunities created by the availability of electricity in
villages and towns. Generally small in scale, rural businesses provide a wider range of community
services and generate income for their owners.

       Many public institutions have adopted electricity to improve their services for the
community. Unfortunately, about half of them cannot afford electricity for lack of a budget to
cover the expense. This issue might be addressed by local governments as they gain more
experience with having electricity in their towns and villages. Summing up, electricity not only
has significant social impacts for households; it also plays an important role in the economic
development of communities.

Recommended Policies and Way Forward
One paradox of rural electrification is that high rates of electricity adoption, along with good
pricing policies, are necessary to make programs financially sustainable for the utilities over the
long term. For subsidies, a general rule of thumb is to have cost-covering fees that are fair to both
customers and the electric utility company and to provide financial assistance to new customers
desiring to adopt electricity through either loans or subsidies on household connection costs.
Lowering the upfront costs of connection will free up cash for customers to purchase appliances,
which means a higher level of household benefits from electrification and a better revenue stream
for the utility company due to greater electricity use.

        It follows that high adoption rates result in better prospects for the financial viability of the
electric utility companies. The converse also holds true. Programs with low initial rates of
adoption and thus lower revenue streams for the utility companies—like many of those found in
Sub-Saharan Africa—make it more difficult for the utility companies to maintain electricity lines
and provide quality service. Thus, it is in the financial interest of the utility companies to strive
for high electricity adoption rates and encourage the purchase of appliances by rural households.

        In Ethiopia, the rural electrification program is still in its initial stages. This study’s surveys
identified the following key policy areas for encouraging greater adoption of electricity and
improving the country’s overall rural electrification program.

       Raise the overall price of electricity to reflect the cost of service after taking into account
        any capital cost subsidies for extending service to rural areas. Having subsidies for new
        connections is a good policy, but Ethiopia’s extremely low electricity price makes it
        difficult for the utility to recover its costs, thus causing problems for rural electrification as
        a business. Since poor households do not represent a significant revenue stream for the
        service provider, it is crucial that the design of OBA schemes ensure sufficient incentives
        for utilities to reach low-income households.

       Have simple and effective mechanisms for targeting the poor. In this GPOBA program,
        targeting was achieved by combining geographic criteria with self-selection methods. The
        targeting was consistent with the Ethiopian government’s policy of providing equity and
        broad geographical coverage for its rural electrification access program.

       Facilitate house wiring in both standard and substandard housing. One major issue
        identified in this study was EEPCo’s policy of connecting only those homes made of
        concrete, which frustrated many poorer households who were ineligible for electricity
        service. They, in turn, decided to string wires to a neighboring house with a legitimate
        meter. Most of the problems involving indirect household connections could be avoided


                                                    xxi
    by developing standard waterproof ready boards for installation in houses constructed of
    substandard materials.

   Officially connect households with indirect electricity connections. Ethiopia’s
    electrification rates could be higher if more attention were paid to finding ways to service
    poor households. Switching from indirect to officially metered connections would mean
    lower electricity prices for such households; in turn, they would consume and pay for more
    electricity, which might help to improve the utility’s financial condition.

   Provide credit, encourage appliance adoption, and promote intersectoral synergies.
    Given the expense of putting up poles and transformers and stringing wires, the investment
    could be optimized by implementing complementary programs that encourage greater use
    of electricity. This might include ensuring that electric appliances are available for local
    purchase. Also, many of the world’s most successful rural electrification programs have
    included close cooperation between ministries and agencies that provide other types of
    development assistance, including education, agriculture, and rural development.
    Promoting such intersectoral synergies would not only improve the impact of rural
    electrification; it would also increase the financial benefits for EEPCo due to higher levels
    of electricity use.

   Focus on women-headed households. In most countries, women-headed households are
    generally among their poorest groups. In the five rural regions of Ethiopia covered by this
    study, women-headed households comprised just over 15 percent of the population. These
    households often cannot afford the upfront costs of electricity; at the same time, they are
    quite responsible about paying their bills. The connection subsidy program should attempt
    to identify and support women-headed households for program participation. In Ethiopia,
    the results of a gender-focused GPOBA program could be integrated into the utility’s
    standard operating procedures.

   Make meters more readily available to prevent delays in providing customers with service.
    The survey found that a shortage of electricity meters had led to delays in signing up new
    customers. This issue could be easily resolved by diversifying the sourcing of meter
    supplies and allowing them to be imported. Inexpensive and reliable meters are readily
    available from other countries.

   Decentralize and lower the cost of bill collection. Generally, the best practice is to have
    the electricity company develop low-cost ways to collect bills. This might include making
    payments possible at local banks or public institutions or through local contacts in the
    community (e.g., village leaders) or money transfer using mobile phones. Other more
    technical options might include the use of load limiters or prepaid meters.


                                             xxii
      Provide better-quality CFLs or other, more efficient lighting options. According to the
       survey and FGDs, the CFLs provided under the GPOBA scheme did not work well under
       the low-voltage conditions found in most villages and towns. Future programs need to
       consider alternative lighting options, including light emitting diodes (LEDs), that work
       under periodic low-voltage conditions.

      Provide technical assistance and loans for businesses. Many successful rural
       electrification programs encourage business development by providing new business loans
       and assistance in setting up businesses to take advantage of electricity. In addition,
       assistance could be given to promote electricity-driven appliances that would make life
       easier for people in rural areas. Such complementary programs would increase EEPCo’s
       revenues and result in a greater socioeconomic impact for rural communities.

      Connect public institutions. This study found that only about half of the public institutions
       in newly electrified villages and towns adopted electricity. The connection and use of
       electricity by public institutions should be subsidized; however, the responsibility of
       subsidizing electricity should not be placed on EEPCo. Rather, the government should
       consider it as a normal budget cost of providing public services. The electricity used by
       public institutions can provide the utility a stable source of revenue for serving rural areas.

        To implement these innovations, a specialized institution within the power company might
be needed to deal with the challenges of rural electrification (Barnes 2007). The world’s best
electricity programs have set up specialized institutions, either within or outside of the main utility,
to deal with the problems involved in rural electrification. They have also featured a firm
government commitment to the program, along with a clear plan for system expansion that avoids
political influence. In addition, most successful programs have had a high enough electrification
rate that distribution companies obtain revenues by pursuing customers instead of government
subsidies for system expansion. Also, many traditional distribution companies have adopted low-
cost distribution methods (e.g., single phase). If geography permits, single wire earth return
(SWER) systems can drastically reduce distribution costs. They also lower the initial barriers to
adopting electricity and emphasize the community’s early involvement in the program.

        Providing electricity in rural Africa is a long-term investment, making it imperative that
the electric utility companies be given appropriate incentives to serve rural areas. In rural Ethiopia,
the GPOBA intervention was an important first step in focusing the state electricity company on
providing service to some of the country’s poorest people. But certainly this is not the last step.
The future of rural electrification in Ethiopia depends on the ability of the government and EEPCo
to make a serious commitment to adopting the principles of successful rural electrification
programs and working together to provide electricity for all of Ethiopia’s people. Mainstreaming
results-based financing (RBF) in access programs is one option aimed at making connections
affordable to the poor while keeping the utility accountable for quality connection service.
                                                  xxiii
        Even some of Ethiopia’s poorest populations have demonstrated a willingness to pay for
electricity service. Tackling the problems inherent in implementing the rural electrification
program will not be an easy task. To address the problems it encounters in providing electricity
to its rural areas, Ethiopia needs to find solutions that will not financially harm its electricity
company. Once this is accomplished, the electricity provided to rural areas will have a high level
of benefits for Ethiopia.

          1. Beyond Access: Encouraging
          Household Electricity Adoption

Sub-Saharan Africa trails all other developing regions in household electricity access, accounting
for nearly 45 percent of the world’s people without electricity. Across the subcontinent, less than
one-third of households have electricity. The rate of rural electrification is less than 15 percent,
compared to about 70 percent worldwide. Even in urban areas, electricity has reached only about
three-fifths of residents. By contrast, urban electrification rates exceed 90 percent in most parts of
the world. Projected population growth in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to
outstrip growth in rural electrification, despite increasing percentages of rural populations with
electricity. As a result, the absolute numbers of those without access to service will continue to
rise, thereby widening the electricity gap (IEA 2010, 2011).

Slow Rates of Access Expansion and Household Adoption
Various factors have accounted for the slow rates of electricity access expansion and household
adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa (Zomers 2001). In many countries of the region, conservative
distribution utilities have persisted in traditional policies that emphasize service extension in urban
areas, which are more profitable than remote and sparsely populated rural areas. In addition,
power-supply shortages and network deficiencies may have weakened the utilities’ incentives to
pursue access. Furthermore, plans to extend electrification to rural areas have often been subjected
to political pressure, which, more often than not, has prevented the utilities from charging cost-
recovery tariffs. The result has been a draining of the investment capital needed to extend
electricity service, leaving the utility companies in a chronically weak financial position (Zomers
2001). Moreover, poor targeting of subsidies has often allowed wealthier customers to enjoy
subsidies they do not need (Komives et al. 2005; Foster and Briceño-Garmendia 2010).

         In many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, initial connection rates in villages newly added
to the electrical grid are as low as 10–20 percent of possible connections, and that number increases
quite slowly over time. At present, the utilities lack incentives to expand service in areas where
customers cannot afford the upfront connection charges. Making things worse, low load factors
result in returns on investment that are too low to justify the substantial costs of extending service.
Even in urban areas, where the cost of extending service to new customers is comparatively low,

                                                  1
 many utility companies provide service only to those households wealthy enough to cover all
 connection charges in full and in advance.

         Although the rate of electricity access today is still low, significant progress has been made
 in recent decades. In 1970, 1.75 billion of the 2 billion people living in rural areas of developing
 countries were without electricity (World Bank 1996). During the 1970s and 1980s, that number
 grew to well over 2 billion, owing to population growth and meager international efforts involving
 rural electrification programs (Barnes 2014). In that period, incremental growth in the number of
 people with electricity was not even keeping pace with population growth. Finally, during the late
 1980s and early 1990s, the number of rural people in developing countries without electricity
 started to decline, due mainly to significant programs in China, India, and Thailand. By 2010, that
 figure had further declined to about 1.3 billion (table 1.1).

         The unfortunate reality is that, in many countries of Sub-Saharan Africa—even in those
 communities with electricity—a high percentage of households cannot afford the upfront
 connection costs charged by the supply companies. The resulting low rates of rural electrification
 create serious obstacles to the region’s development, given that electricity is a necessary condition
 for development (IEG 2008; World Bank 2002). The significant loss in welfare benefits ranges
 from opportunities for studying at home, improved communication via television and radio, and
 better health to the creation of new jobs and productivity gains for businesses. Because electricity
 access improves school attendance, deficits in access may also represent a loss in the development
                                                               2
of human capital (Khandker, Barnes, and Samad 2009, 2012a, 2012b). Surprisingly, only 1 in 8
people in rural Africa has electricity. This remains true even 20 years after publication of the
forward-looking policy book, Rural Energy and Development (World Bank 1996). It also
continues despite the call today by the United Nations and other donor organizations for
sustainable energy for all (UN 2011).

        According to 2014 data, Ethiopia has a large gap in electricity access between urban and
rural areas. Most large urban areas have nearly universal electricity coverage. In large towns, 95
percent of people have electricity, compared to 83 percent of people in small towns. However, the
situation differs markedly in rural areas. According to the most recent Living Standards
Measurement Study (LSMS) Survey, only 9 percent of people living in truly rural areas (i.e.,
excluding small towns) have access to electricity. This study covered some of Ethiopia’s larger
regions (table 1.2).

        The implication is that, up until now, the country’s rural electrification policies have
favored urban areas. This is common for countries in the first stages of promoting electricity
access because demand for electricity will be higher in urban areas and more financially rewarding
for the utility companies. However, this situation hampers development and quality of life in rural
areas. In response, Ethiopia has been exploring ways to promote electricity adoption in rural areas,
including a pilot program of output-based aid (OBA) that would lower the upfront expenses
associated with connection costs.

Thinking Beyond Access in Rural Africa
Many electricity companies in Sub-Saharan Africa are well aware of the benefits of making
connection charges affordable to their customers, and some have initiated programs to lower those
charges through subsidies or credit schemes (annex 1). In many countries, fully subsidized
connection programs have been supported by donors.2

        However, given the scale of the effort required to achieve universal access in Sub-Saharan
Africa and the financial challenges already faced by the region’s utilities, subsidies should be
carefully structured to improve poor households’ access to electricity without distorting energy
markets (box 1.1).

    Box 1.1 Criteria for Assessing Subsidy Policies

    When making decisions about which groups to target for subsidies and their form, eligibility
    criteria, and financing, policies must be carefully assessed, using three main criteria:
    ∙ Efficacy. This means ensuring that the subsidy reaches those for whom it is intended—the
    poor, who would not otherwise have access to electricity—rather than allowing it to reach
    wealthier households who would connect to the grid without a subsidy.
    ∙ Efficiency. This refers to structuring the subsidy so that it encourages service provision at
    the least cost. Often energy-sector restructuring projects do not consider how to improve
    energy access while, at the same time, maintaining effective financial policies to support the
    financial viability of the utilities.
    ∙ Cost-effectiveness. This ensures that the subsidy achieves social goals at the lowest
    program cost, while providing the utilities incentives to serve poor and rural populations.
    Sources: World Bank 2002; Barnes 2007; Barnes and Halpern 2000.


        Some of the newer subsidy programs in such countries as Kenya, Liberia, Senegal, and
Uganda have been based on results-based financing (RBF) or output-based aid (OBA),3 meaning
that subsidy payments are disbursed on the basis of pre-agreed and independently verified outputs,
such as functional household connections, internal wiring or distribution of energy-efficient lamps,



2
  Full connection subsidies, like overly broad consumption subsidies, may distort the markets for electricity and,
because they are limited in scope, may not be well targeted to the right populations. Political interference in selecting
the villages that benefit from subsidies may foment dissent among villages that are passed over. Even within a given
village, distinctions between consumers (those labeled “poor” and therefore eligible for a subsidy versus those
excluded from the subsidy) can create dissension.
3
  Results-based financing (RBF) is a concept comprising a range of public policy instruments, whereby incentives,
rewards, or subsidies are linked to the verified delivery of pre-defined results. OBA, one of the better-known RBF
approaches, aims to make access to basic services affordable to the poor. An OBA subsidy is reimbursed to the service
provider upon verification of the outputs (in this case, electricity connection).
                                                           4
and billing cycles (annex 1). OBA strongly emphasizes the targeting of low-income households
based on various criteria, including geographic region, means-testing, or community-based
evaluation (World Bank 2005).

        The distribution of electricity—whether for social or productive uses—is a capital-
intensive enterprise, and the cost of providing household connections can be quite high. Charging
new customers one-time, upfront fees to recover service connection costs can constitute a powerful
disincentive to many people who wish to obtain electricity, but cannot afford the upfront costs
(Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013).

        Striking the right balance between making it easier for households and small commercial
enterprises to gain access to grid electricity and ensuring the financial health of the distribution
companies is a challenge (Maurer and Nonay 2009). But it has been proven that careful planning
to expand electricity access can be aligned with ensuring the utilities’ financial sustainability and
operational efficiency (Barnes 2007; World Bank 2010a; AEI 2012). In most countries of Sub-
Saharan Africa, this goal is achievable, but key policy issues must be addressed.

        Broadly speaking, tariffs must be high enough to allow the utilities to recover their costs
and finance new investment, but not so high as to frustrate demand and deny access to poor
households that consume small amounts of electricity (subsistence consumers). This dilemma can
be resolved by implementing graduated tariff structures, whereby unit costs rise with higher levels
of consumption. Similarly, connection charges must be high enough to reimburse the utilities for
the connection cost, and financing solutions should be explored to address customer affordability
issues.

        The pricing of electricity—particularly the relative advantages and disadvantages of
various tariff structures—has been the subject of a vast amount of research. In addition, many
projects have focused on the importance of improving generation and distribution systems to
improve service reliability. In terms of distribution, much research has focused on low-cost system
design, but connection charges have received much less attention, even though high connection
fees are a significant deterrent to poor consumers that desire to connect to a network.

Ethiopia’s Output Based Aid Experience
Over the past 15 years, Ethiopia has focused on raising electrification rates, mainly by extending
the national grid system to more villages and towns. Yet the number of households without
electricity remains quite high. By 2014, the country’s overall electrification rate had reached just
23 percent, meaning that 70 million people were still without a connection (table 1.1). Yet this
rate was about 8 percent higher than the 15 percent rate in 2007. This increase can be attributed,
in part, to recent efforts to lower barriers to household adoption in villages and towns with
electricity service, as well as the growing use of electricity in urban areas. As of 2014, more than

                                                 5
85 percent of people in urban areas had electricity, but the rate of rural electrification remained at
just 10 percent. Thus, one of the main challenges for Ethiopia is increasing electricity access in
rural areas.

GPOBA Program Background

The World Bank–funded Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project (Phase 2) was implemented
in 2007 to assist the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) to develop a sustainable program for
expanding access to electricity in rural communities (World Bank 2013a). As part of the project,
an OBA program provided grants to make the adoption of electricity more affordable for rural
populations.

        The overall objective of the rural electrification project was to support broad-based
economic development and, over the long term, help alleviate poverty. The project was
implemented by the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), the country’s vertically
integrated power utility. In 2007, EEPCo had about 1.13 million customers, representing only
about 17 percent of the population. During GPOBA grant preparation in 2007, only 33 percent of
the population in Addis Ababa, the nation’s capital, had electricity. Despite these low numbers,
Addis Ababa accounted for more than 60 percent of total electricity consumption at that time. In
the other urban areas, the electrification rate was only 20–30 percent. Obviously, in rural areas,
where 85 percent of the population resided, the electrification rate was much lower, at just 2
percent.

        Before the GPOBA grant program commenced, the GoE in 2005 launched the Universal
Electricity Access Program. This umbrella program, which would be implemented by EEPCo,
aimed to increase the coverage rate from the 2007 17 percent level to 50 percent over a five-year
period. It envisioned connecting virtually all rural towns and villages to the grid within a 10-year
horizon. To this end, in 2005 the GoE proposed allocating approximately US$2.0 billion (about
17 billion Birr) over 10 years. This was a significant investment for EEPCo, representing about
16 percent of its overall investments for the corresponding period. With those resources, the
Universal Electricity Access Program was to be able to provide access to 4.8 million new
customers, representing a population of more than 22 million.

        One of the challenges of the Universal Electricity Access Program was the low connection
rates in rural communities. While some new customers could afford the upfront fee of about
US$75 to connect to the grid system, many others considered the fee too high, preferring to forgo
an electricity connection. As part of the World Bank Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project
(Phase 2), the GoE agreed to allow customers to pay for this fee over time, thus lowering the
financial barrier to adopting electricity. This project component would be financed as part of a
Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) grant facility.


                                                  6
Program Goal and Objectives

The goal of the GPOBA program was to make electricity connections more affordable for the poor,
thus enabling higher numbers of poorer households to adopt electricity. To accomplish this, the
utility provided loans to finance the connection fees; households, in turn, made monthly
repayments, which were included on their electricity bills. The GPOBA intervention was limited
to rural areas being provided electricity by EEPCo for the first time during the years 2013–15.
This program was considered a new way to promote higher connection rates in these communities
being provided electricity service. The expectation was that, if the project succeeded, providing
loans to lower connection costs for poor households would become a future standard practice for
EEPCo.

        Under the earlier Universal Electricity Access Program, Ethiopia had the goal of increasing
the rate of household electricity adoption in rural towns and villages newly connected to service.
The GPOBA intervention augmented this program by helping EEPCo to finance connection
charges. Previously, households had to pay the US$75 connection charge to initiate service. Rural
households participating in the GPOBA project were allowed to pay this amount over five years.
The process worked as follows: Households were required to make a down payment of $15,
representing 20 percent of the $75 connection charge levied by EEPCo. The remaining $60 would
be paid in small installments of about $1 per month over five years. EEPCo, in turn, would receive
a subsidy of $35 per household from GPOBA to cover the interest rates incurred financing the
connection charges. This interest would not be charged to the households, who would only pay
the $75 spread out over five years. In addition, each GPOBA-participant household would receive
two free compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), which would make monthly electricity bills more
affordable for poor households.

         To avoid subsidizing wealthier households and better target the poorest ones, the
availability of GPOBA financing was, by design, delayed for about 18 months after the community
first received service. The reasoning was that wealthier households, who could afford to pay the
upfront $75 fee, would adopt full service right away.

        This GPOBA technique appears to have worked. The results of an impact assessment
analysis reported in this study show that increasing numbers of households adopted electricity
because they could spread out the connection cost over time. In the GPOBA communities
surveyed in 2011, 37 percent of households adopted electricity. That same year, an additional 18
percent of households adopted electricity, agreeing to pay the upfront fees over time, with interest
rates financed by GPOBA. This meant that a total of 55 percent of households in the GPOBA
communities adopted electricity, a relatively high figure compared to other communities in
Ethiopia and even internationally, where initial connection rates are about 30 percent. By program
completion in 2013, that adoption rate had risen to 68 percent of households, mainly due to the
expansion of electricity connections made possible by GPOBA financing. Although many of the
                                                 7
poorest households are still without electricity, numerous households have been able to adopt
electricity under the GPOBA financing program.

        According to the household income data from the impact survey in this study, for the
poorest 20 percent of households participating in the GPOBA program, about 7 percent of yearly
income would be spent on the monthly connection charges over five years. This figure compares
to 42 percent of a year’s income for the same group paying the full US$75 connection fee upfront
(table 1.3). Obviously, for higher income groups, the monthly charges spread out over five years
would represent an even smaller percentage of yearly income.

                   Note: Because the income in the survey was underreported, the actual
                   percentages are probably even less.


       It should be kept in mind that the GPOBA and EEPCo connections differed only in terms
of the upfront costs and provision of two free CFLs. The GPOBA grant innovation allowed
customers to make monthly payments, thus making connection charges more affordable, while
EEPCo still connected and serviced households following the usual practice of full upfront
payment of connection fees. Although the recovery of connection charges through spreading them
out over monthly bills is not yet common practice in Sub-Saharan Africa, some countries are
experimenting with trial programs (annex 1).

Challenges and Achievements

The GPOBA grant program’s original goal of connecting 228,571 households (about 1.34 million
people) was not achieved. The moratorium on new connections in 2008–10, in response to power
supply constraints resulting from poor hydrology and delays in the commissioning of dams, slowed
the utility company’s momentum; thus, it had difficulty restarting the program at the same level it
had achieved prior to 2007. In addition, the Ethiopian government decided to sole-source the
supply of meters to support local industry development; however, the appointed local firm was not
                                                     8
up to the task and failed to deliver on time. As a result, EEPCo ran out of meters, and all access
programs were interrupted from April to December 2012, at which time the sole-source decision
was reversed. In early 2013, EEPCo was able to procure meters from alternative sources and
resume project implementation.

       Taking the ambitious electricity promotion targets into account, EEPCo employed external
resources to install a significant number of new connections, which adversely affected the quality
and safety of connections. The independent verification agent hired by the World Bank to certify
outputs for subsidy disbursement under the GPOBA grant observed that, in some instances, EEPCo
was not in full compliance with GPOBA technical and safety requirements, which delayed
disbursement of funds. The independent verification agent also noted that distribution of CFLs
was limited due to the utility’s lack of storage capacity. EEPCo initiated measures to address these
challenges; however, because grant disbursements were made based on verified results, the
revenues expected by EEPCo under the program lagged behind.

           Note: Actual EEPCo connections include all GPOBA connections.

         Despite these implementation difficulties, the GPOBA program accounted for about 75
percent of the total connections in Ethiopia over its two-year implementation period (2011–13)
(table 1.4). The pace of the GPOBA program accelerated year by year. Starting in June 2011, a
total of about 7,000 households were provided new metered connections. In the second year, this
figure doubled to more than 14,000 and reached nearly 22,000 by the third year. Thus, despite the
late start-up, a total of about 43,000 households (some 236,000 people) received an electricity
connection through EEPCo under the GPOBA program. Moreover, these figures do not take into
consideration the large number of indirect household connections. As discussed below, taking
these unofficially connected households into account raises the number of households that
obtained electricity as a result of the GPOBA intervention to 90,000.
Impact on Connection Rates

The GPOBA grant contributed to the effectiveness of village and town electrification by
accelerating the pace of household connections. By 2013, the overall share of GPOBA households
among those with electricity averaged about 42 percent for all surveyed villages and towns in the
five study regions (table 1.5).

                     percentage of total new EEPCo connections for the five study regions.


       However, this high overall electricity penetration rate masks large differences in regional
penetration rates, which ranged from 9.3 percent for the surveyed villages and towns in Amhara
to 69.5 percent for those in Oromia. That said, the GPOBA project succeeded in accelerating
household adoption of electricity in the five participating regions.

Program Timeline

Although the World Bank project and GPOBA program were approved in 2008, they encountered
difficulties from the start. Ethiopia depends on hydropower and is thus vulnerable to drought.
Hydropower projects scheduled to come online in 2008 were delayed due to poor hydrology. As
a result, the GoE placed a moratorium on new electricity connections due to power shortages.
Therefore, the timeline for all World Bank electricity access projects, including the GPOBA
program, were scaled back. This unfortunate delay reduced the number of connections possible
under the GPOBA intervention (box 1.2).

         Despite delays, the GPOBA grant program achieved a higher level of electricity adoption
rates in Ethiopia during 2011–13, compared to other access projects. The independent verification
of outputs and socioeconomic development impact evaluation study were carried out at the same
time. The independent verification survey, based on actual connections achieved by EEPCo and
satisfactory billing over three months, was necessary for disbursement of GPOBA grant funds.
The impact evaluation study, which measured the impact of those achievements, included baseline
surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), and a final impact evaluation survey. The goal of the
surveys was twofold: (i) to provide an assessment of the program impacts and (ii) to offer policy
guidance for future work. The main findings of these surveys are described in the subsection
below.

   Box 1.2 Timeline of the Ethiopia GPOBA Program

   2008       The World Bank–funded Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project (Phase 2),
              including the GPOBA grant component, is initiated. Several power-supply
              projects in Ethiopia are delayed due to poor hydrology.
   2009       The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) places a moratorium on new electricity
              connections due to shortages of electricity supplies. The World Bank project is
              delayed and the project end date is extended.
   2010       New power-supply projects are finally completed, and new supply gradually
              becomes available in Ethiopia.
   2011       The GoE lifts the moratorium on new electricity connections. The World Bank
              project and GPOBA program restart, with an end date of 2013. (The GPOBA
              program is extended through June 2013.) GPOBA verification and baseline
              surveys are initiated. The baseline for the impact evaluation survey is started.
              EEPCo begins connecting new households under the World Bank project and
              the GPOBA program.
   2012       EEPCo runs out of meters in April. The Ethiopian government delays
              procurement of meters and, in December, begins contract negotiations with a
              local meter supplier.
   2013       The World Bank project and GPOBA program are completed.
   2013–14    GPOBA baseline and impact evaluation surveys and background reports are
              completed.

Key Findings

Accelerated Rate of Rural Electrification. The GPOBA program accelerated the rate of rural
electrification in villages where the intervention was made available. By the program’s close in
2013, nearly 90 percent of new households adopting electricity were GPOBA participants,
attesting to the program’s popularity. For communities participating in the GPOBA program, this
expansion reached 68 percent of households in the villages, including many poorer households
who could not otherwise afford the upfront costs of an electricity connection and house wiring.

        High Number of Indirect Connections and Willingness to Pay. The project M&V survey
found that many households had connected to electricity indirectly; that is, they had wired
(sometimes dangerously so) to a neighboring house with a legitimate meter. While households
with informal connections paid no upfront costs for electricity, they typically paid a fixed fee per
light or appliance. This resulted in higher monthly costs compared to regular EEPCo service
(chapter 3). Thus, these households demonstrated a high willingness to pay for electricity service.



                                                11
         Business Adoption of Electricity. Once a community had access to power service, all
businesses adopted electricity. This finding supports the important role that electricity plays in
businesses. However, there was limited support for accelerating business development, suggesting
the need for technical assistance to further improve the development impact of the rural
electrification program.

        Household Appliance Adoption. Households purchased a wide array of electric appliances,
but complained that both brands and types of appliances were limited in local stores. Since the
impact of electricity is exclusively through the use of appliances, it would be important to
encourage local shops or new businesses to carry more items. This might be accomplished
indirectly by facilitating end users’ access to financing, perhaps through microfinance institutions
(MFIs) or credit lines

        Delayed Electricity Adoption due to Meter Shortage. A shortage of meters during the
project was a significant barrier to achieving higher rates of rural electrification. This shortage
was caused, in part, by the sole-sourcing of meters to a local manufacturer that could not deliver
on orders. Currently, the utility is exploring the use of multiple meter suppliers to provide more
timely support to the access programs, as well as connection innovations (e.g., load limiters and
prepaid meters).

         Cost of Internal Wiring. Households must pay for internal wiring, which is an obstacle to
electricity adoption for poor households. One option for resolving this issue is the use of ready
boards, a less costly technology, for poor households. If internal wiring is financed through
GPOBA schemes, an outreach campaign is recommended on this additional responsibility of the
utility.

        Low Price of Electricity. The price of electricity in Ethiopia is among the lowest in Africa.
This national policy has ramifications for the financial health of the utility and the continued rollout
of the rural electrification program. EEPCo expressed reservations about expending significant
resources on bill collection, given the small revenue streams from rural communities with
electricity. Higher prices for electricity would increase the profitability of bill collection and
provide a greater financial incentive for the utility to promote rural electrification with enough
revenues to cover O&M expenses.

Summary
The connection costs in Sub-Saharan Africa are high compared to the rest of the world
(Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013). In the past decade, some countries have initiated efforts to lower
these costs so that electricity is affordable for even their poorest populations. In Ethiopia, the
US$75 connection fee is quite reasonably priced for a middle-class household. With a per capita
income of only $470 a year, this amounts to slightly more than 3 percent of family income.
                                                  12
However, for poor households in rural areas, even $75 is a strain on their budgets, amounting to
more than 40 percent of one year’s income. As a result, the GoE, in collaboration with the World
Bank, decided to find way to reduce the impact of high connection fees on electricity adoption.
The result was the GPOBA scheme carried out through EEPCo to provide loans for connection
costs. The goal was to make the adoption of electricity more affordable for Ethiopia’s poor rural
households by spreading out connection cost payments. The availability of loans for connection
costs was delayed by 18 months after the community received electricity to ensure that poorer
households would receive the loans and accompanying subsidies. The GPOBA subsidy of $35
covered the five-year interest on the loans offered through EEPCo so that households would not
have to pay more than the $75 connection fee. In the next chapter, we examine the socioeconomic
features of households in the GPOBA program study regions.

      2. Socioeconomic Characteristics of
                 Study Regions

The Ethiopia GPOBA impact evaluation study is one of the first rigorous attempts to understand
the impact of connection charges on household adoption of electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa.4 It
is also among the first studies in Sub-Saharan Africa to examine the impact of rural electrification
shortly after households adopt electricity. To date, evaluating the impact of electricity on
development in Sub-Saharan Africa has garnered little attention. Most evaluation research in the
region has been based on electricity use rather than its actual impact on households (Bernard 2012).
This study breaks new ground, being among the first to provide evidence of the impact of
electricity for development. The lessons learned will help other countries seeking to assess the
value of promoting lower connection costs for their rural populations just now gaining access to
electricity. The GPOBA program implemented in 2011–13 was spread throughout most of rural
Ethiopia, including some of the country’s poorest and most highly populated regions. Because
many of the towns and villages covered are located in areas with low levels of education and little
access to roads and other infrastructure services, obtaining a representative sample for the impact
evaluation survey was quite challenging. In the end, the survey team covered 22 towns in five
regions that are representative of Ethiopia’s rural areas with poor infrastructure (annex 2).

Key Features of Study Regions
The GPOBA program covered five diverse regions spread across Ethiopia where rural
electrification programs will be most active in the coming years (table 2.1). These regions cover
most of the country’s rural population. Household samples were taken from areas with high
concentrations of GPOBA-connected households, extending from central Ethiopia to the northern
border with Eritrea and west toward Sudan (map 2.1).

 The recovery of connection charges through monthly payments over time is not yet common practice in Sub-Saharan
Africa, though some countries are experimenting with trial programs (annex 1).

        Oromia. With a total population of about 27 million (2007 figure) and a large land area
(284,538 km2), Oromia is Ethiopia’s largest national regional state, sharing borders with nearly
every region except Tigray. Oromia is known for its coffee production, representing more than
half of Ethiopia’s total coffee production. Most of the country’s livestock (cattle and horses), as
well as beehives, can be found in this region. Rural households occupy small agricultural plots of
about 1.2 ha on average, which is only slightly above the national average. About three-quarters
of the region’s people have farm-related jobs.

        Amhara. Located in northwestern Ethiopia, the Amhara region has a population of 17
million, nearly 90 percent of whom live in rural areas. The region is fairly densely populated, at
about 108 people per km2, with an average rural household size of 4.3 members. Most people
derive their incomes from agriculture. Like Oromia, Amhara is known for its coffee production,
which amounts to nearly half of the country’s total coffee production.

       Tigray. Located in northern Ethiopia, this national regional state has about 5 million
people, nearly 80 percent of whom live in rural areas. Tigray is Ethiopia’s third most densely
populated region, with an average of 119.1 persons per km2. The average rural family size is 4.6
members. As in many other rural areas, subsistence agriculture is the main source of household
income.

Ethiopia. It is also one of Ethiopia’s most ethnically diverse regions. Nearly 85 percent of BSG’s
nearly 1 million people live in rural areas. The region’s population density is about 20 persons per
km2, making BSG the country’s most sparsely populated region. Even so, rural household size is
quite similar to that of other states, at about 4.5 members on average. Owing to its relatively
abundant agricultural land, BSG has attracted immigrants from the northern highlands.

         South Nations, Nationalities, and People’s Region (SNNPR). Located in southwestern
Ethiopia, SNNPR is one of the country’s larger and most rural regions. Some 90 percent of its 14
million people live in rural areas. It is also one of Ethiopia’s most densely populated regions,
averaging about 140 people per km2. The average household size is slightly higher than for other
regions, at about 4.8 members. Like other regions, the main source of income is agriculture-
related.

Socioeconomic Features of the Sampled Areas
The five study regions are fairly representative of the socioeconomic characteristics of rural
Ethiopia. The household survey focused on rural areas that were either without electricity or had
been recently provided service. As expected, the sample shares some of the more general
characteristics of poor households in Ethiopia. The 760 households in the sample are spread
throughout the five regions. These surveyed households represent a total of 4,148 family members,
including 1,858 children under the age of 13 years (table 2.2). Although the number of family
                                                      16
members varied widely (from 1 to 13), the average household size among those interviewed was
5.5 members. This is slightly above the national average, perhaps reflecting that the sampled
households are, on average, somewhat poorer than those in other regions.

Education

Ethiopia faces many social and political obstacles that have restricted progress in education for
many years. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), most people in Ethiopia believe that work is more important than education. The
typical pattern is for people to start work at a very early age with little or no education. Although
school attendance is gradually improving, some parents still cannot afford to send their children to
school. Children in rural areas are less likely to attend school than those in urban areas.

        Nevertheless, progress on education is evident from the survey. Children are more likely
than their parents to have formal education. Among the household members in the survey without
any formal education, two-fifths are adults (figure 2.1). As in many other developing countries,
primary school is the highest level of education attained among most household members. Among
the 40 percent of household members who have achieved a primary education, many are children,
compared to only about 25 percent for household heads. Only about one-third of household heads
have any form of education. As might be expected, female literacy is much lower than for males.
Only a very low percentage of household members in the sampled regions have attended secondary
school or college.

Occupation

Agriculture accounts for nearly 41 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in Ethiopia (CSA
2007). In rural areas, many economic activities are dependent on agriculture; these include
marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Overwhelmingly, agricultural
production is done by small-scale farmers and small enterprises. Even a large portion of
commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. The principal crops
include coffee, pulses, beans, oilseed, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables.

       The survey found that household heads were generally employed, but many family
members had no formal work. About one-third of household members over the age of 15 had no
source of income. For those that did work, farming accounted for the main source of employment
income. Other popular forms of work included small trade businesses, casual labor, and salaried
employment (figure 2.2). These varied sources of income are common throughout rural areas of
Ethiopia.

         By income source, there was little difference between households with and without
electricity. For the impact evaluation, this situation presented an ideal sampling opportunity; that
is, if the employment patterns of households with and without electricity had differed, this would
have introduced a source of bias into the comparison between the two groups. Because both groups
had similar employment patterns, analysis of the impact of electricity on other socioeconomic
behavior was less problematic.

Household Income

Ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries, with a GNP per capita income of only US$383 in
2013. Its measure for GNI purchasing power parity (PPP) was somewhat higher, at $1,380 per
capita, but still reflects its poor status (table 2.3). These figures are representative of both urban
and rural areas, meaning that rural households in the impact evaluation survey have even lower
income levels.

        Results from both the baseline and impact evaluation surveys confirm that residents in the
GPOBA study area are poorer than the national averages. The most likely explanation is that the
national averages cover both urban and rural areas. In addition, the limited number of income
questions in the baseline and impact surveys likely underestimated cash income. In 2014, the
average annual cash income was US$851 per household, which increased (table 2.4). Regional
variations in income are also quite dramatic. Tigray has the highest income level, at more than
twice that found in BSG. Of course, the PPP income would be higher, but this still illustrates that
the study regions are quite poor. Even in the wealthiest survey regions, households are surviving
on less than $100 per month. As imprecise as these numbers are for both the surveyed areas and
nationally, the obvious conclusion is that households in the new areas being connected to the
national electricity grid are poor.

        Clearly, such low levels of income impact the affordability of electricity connections. For
the households in the survey, those directly adopting GPOBA connections and from EEPCo’s
regular expansion program have higher levels of income than those without electricity (table 2.5).
This finding is quite common among most developing countries since wealthier households can
better afford the expenses associated with having electricity, including connection costs. Even
households in nearby control villages without electricity have higher levels of cash income than
households in villages with service that have not yet adopted electricity. It is little wonder that
such households, with a monthly income of only about US$65, have difficulty affording the $75
connection charge, given that this amount represents close to 10 percent of their yearly cash
income. Nearly 70 percent of households in the rural communities with electricity adopted service,
meaning that many poor households have adopted electricity; however, they have adopted
electricity in lower numbers compared to better-off households.

        The survey questions underestimated the actual amount of yearly cash income for
households in the survey areas.5 Informal evidence from the survey suggests that many
respondents have intentionally underestimated their cash income. Indeed, in a number of cases,
estimates of household income provided by respondents were inconsistent with the quality of their
homes or number of household appliances. However, this underestimation is expected to be
consistent across households in the survey; thus, comparisons among household groups should
remain valid. It can be concluded that the study areas are quite poor, regardless of the income
measure.

Conclusion
The World Bank–supported Ethiopia GPOBA program was well targeted toward rural
communities without electricity, including poor households in some of the country’s poorest areas.
The findings show that household income was earned mainly from small farms and casual labor.
The income level of the sampled households was well below national averages and was
accompanied by low levels of education. The next chapter describes the evaluation carried out to
assess whether the GPOBA intervention succeeded in promoting electricity adoption among some
of world’s poorest people.

  Underestimation was even greater for expenditures. Although the impact evaluation survey included detailed
questions on energy expenditures, other expenditures were lumped into broad categories. As a result, in this study’s
survey, cash income was used to classify households by income class. Although there are absolute errors, the
comparisons between groupings should be similar since the errors would be similar for all groups. Cash income also
aligns better with income figures from other national surveys.

      3. Connection Costs and Electricity
                  Adoption

Given the low level of electrification in rural Ethiopia, expanding the grid system to more villages
and towns is one obvious way to raise electrification rates. Another important way is to promote
electricity adoption among households without service in villages and towns with coverage.
Compared to other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, which has some of the world’s highest
electricity connection charges, Ethiopia’s connection charge of US$75 per household is modest.
Despite the country’s low income level of $470 per capita GDP, the cost of an electricity
connection is quite affordable for middle-class households. But for many poor households in rural
areas, the connection charge is beyond reach. Thus, an important challenge for the country’s rural
electrification program is finding ways to increase household connection rates among poor
households.

        This chapter assesses the role of the GPOBA intervention in accelerating electrification
rates in rural Ethiopia by providing financial assistance to lower connection costs and thus
encourage adoption among poor households. The section below provides a historical overview of
electricity connection rates in Ethiopia. This is followed by an assessment of the impact of both
the GPOBA-assisted scheme and the EEPCo national expansion program.

Expectations for EEPCo and GPOBA Programs
The World Bank has been involved in assisting Ethiopia’s power sector for the last 15 years.
Initially, this assistance was mainly confined to upstream power generation and transmission
projects. Since 2002, however, access expansion programs have been initiated under the World
Bank’s Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project. Under the initial IDA-funded energy access
project, launched in 2003, EEPCo accelerated geographical coverage of the network and received
funding for the needed meters, accessories, and connection cables to ramp up customer
connections. By 2008, the utility company was connecting 300,000 customers per year (figure
3.1). EEPCo also enjoyed a stable financial situation, which enabled it to cover the funding of its
operational costs.

        Unfortunately, the scale-up in electricity access being implemented by EEPCo faced major
challenges in 2008. That year several large power-supply projects were delayed due to drought,
as discussed in chapter 1 (box 1.2). Given that power supply was unreliable due to poor hydrology
and delays in commissioning dams, the Ethiopian government decided to delay implementation of
electricity access projects, placing a moratorium on expanding new connections (with the
exception of some unavoidable ones) to help rein in the pace of electricity demand growth until
new power plants could be brought back into operation. Figure 3.1 shows the dramatic reduction
in the number of new EEPCo customers that resulted. After the power-supply projects were
completed in late 2010, the moratorium on new electricity connections was lifted. In early 2011,
EEPCo and the World Bank agreed to restart the second phase of the electricity access program,
complemented by GPOBA grant funds. Growth in new electricity connections resumed, albeit at
a much slower pace, owing, in part, to EEPCo’s limited stock of meters for connections.

        Starting in 2011, the GPOBA plan was to reach 230,000 households—more than 1 million
people—with new electricity connections (table 3.1). In addition to improving household
connection rates, another goal of the GPOBA scheme was to distribute about 450,000 energy-
efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to ensure that electricity was affordable to even the
poorest households. Also, the efficiency of the CFLs would mean that the new power requirements
for EEPCo could remain at modest levels.

     a. Fiscal year 2008 is half a year.


       Under the GPOBA grant component, it was anticipated that the connection rate for new
households in villages with electricity would increase by about 20 percent. This would be
accomplished by spreading out the upfront connection expenses for household adoption (table 3.1).
As will be seen later, these projections were optimistic.

Popularity of Indirect Household Connections
The remarkably high numbers of new indirect household connections can be directly attributed to
the expansion of service to the villages and towns covered under the GPOBA program. Indirect
electricity connections to households with a formal meter were attractive for a variety of reasons
related mainly to ease of access and service. Some households had lost hope of being able to
obtain a direct connection serviced by EEPCo, and thus turned to getting electricity from a
neighboring household. Despite such problems as dangerous household wiring, many of the
poorest households could get immediate service by using a neighbor’s legal (metered) connection.
Some survey respondents mentioned that they took an indirect connection in order to avoid
EEPCo’s formal requirements of obtaining a metered connection (e.g., having a land ownership
certificate) and delays, which sometimes dragged on for months. Households that benefited the
most from indirect electricity connections were families living in non-concrete houses—usually
the poorest customers in the villages. An indirect connection was their only available option since
EEPCo’s regulations prevented non-concrete houses from receiving a connection for safety
reasons.

                                                             25
       Taking an indirect household connection was not a matter of reducing monthly costs,
however, highlighting these households’ willingness to pay for electricity. Generally, such
households paid higher prices for electricity through fixed charges for lights and appliances. But
they avoided having to pay the upfront fees to initiate service. Indirectly connected households
paid about US$0.26–$0.52 per bulb a month. Depending on the hours of use, this was $0.10–
$0.30 more per kWh than the amount paid by directly connected households. Payments were more
expensive for households in neighborhoods with few official direct (metered) connections, and
were most modest in areas with many official connections. Most indirectly connected households
could use such electricity for lighting, charging their mobile phones, and listening to the radio, all
of which was negotiated with the household that had the officially metered connection.

         According to the final impact evaluation survey in 2014, the number of households
connected directly to an EEPCo meter, including those with the GPOBA subsidy, were actually
fewer in number than those obtaining electricity indirectly from other households. The connection
rates for meterd and indirectly connected households were quite similar. The total cumulative
direct and indirect connections for a village averaged about 55 percent in 2011 (figure 3.2),
climbing to over 67 percent by 2014 (figure 3.3). Thus, for rural communities provided with
electricity service, the electrification rate increased about 12 percent between 2011 and 2014.
Also, due to indirect connections, the effective number of rural connections was more than double
that reported by EEPCo. It is worth emphasizing that all indirect connections were found to be
connected to households with meters; thus, the officially metered electricity consumption involved
little electricity theft.

              Note: The photo on the left illustrates octopus wiring, a dangerous practice typical of the
              poor installations among hook-up households. Unfortunately, this practice is common under
              the GPOBA program. The photo on the right shows a dangerously low-hanging electricity
              line in Gogeti, SNNPR.


        Along with the benefits of indirect household connections, there were drawbacks. The
main ones were poor technical household installations, dangerous wiring, and an uncontrolled
number of indirect connections to a single meter. In one case, 12 households were indirectly
connected to a single household with a metered connection. In another, the wires connecting the
households were hanging dangerously low (figure 3.4). Poles that could be easily toppled carried
wires from one household to another. Thus, even though indirect connections were convenient,
many were based on poor installation practices. Also, even slight delays in bill payment could
sometimes lead to an arbitrary cutoff of service.

Customer Satisfaction with EEPCo Electricity Service
Households participating in the GPOBA program experienced lower initial connection costs as a
result of the scheme’s grant funding, which spread out payments over time. After installation,
however, those connections were serviced by EEPCO. Therefore, differences between GPOBA
and EEPCo households were only marginal in terms of customer satisfaction with electricity
service provision.

        Overall, customers were satisfied with the services provided by EEPCo. About 95 percent
of the households surveyed indicated they were very or somewhat satisfied with the service
provided by the utility company. Nearly 80 percent of households thought the electricity tariff
was quite affordable (figure 3.5). These positive sentiments, expressed during a difficult period
characterized by significant power reliability issues, may have reflected people’s satisfaction with
having electricity service in their community for the first time, as opposed to their prior use of
kerosene and candles for lighting. The survey indicated that people overall were quite happy to
obtain an electricity connection.

        The main customer complaints were power outages, delayed meter installation and bill
collection, and unclear billing and payment procedures (figure 3.5). Many towns experienced
service interruptions. Frequent power outages—lasting from 30 minutes up to an entire day—
resulted in dissatisfaction with electricity service. Households pointed out that voltage fluctuations
had caused considerable damage to electrical equipment (e.g., bulbs, radios, TVs, and mobile
phone chargers). According to participants in focus group discussions (FGDs), village water
supply had become dependent on electricity. With power cuts, both the household use of
electricity and the water supply became problematic. Power cuts also reduced the income of rural
businesses with electricity. In one town, where a group of youth had organized a bakery and pastry
business, frequent power outages prevented the group from producing the necessary volume of
baked goods, resulting in the new business facing bankruptcy.

        Because many villages and towns were scattered in remote areas, EEPCo had difficulty
reaching villages for proper meter reading, which encouraged the practice of estimating meter
readings. This meant that households often paid estimated bills and feared the uncertainty of
billing amounts, particularly since indirect connections could sometimes push their bills into a
higher tariff regime. Many customers were unhappy with the inability of EEPCo’s staff to provide
satisfactory explanations about their electric bills.

Conclusion
The GPOBA program was quite successful in providing new incentives for households to adopt
electricity. No doubt, the Ethiopian government’s 2009 moratorium on new household electricity
connections adversely impacted the rate of rural electrification that could have been achieved by
the late 2000s. The 2007 envisioned goal of reaching 1 million people was not achieved. Even
so, the program connected an increasing number of households over its two-year duration.

        The surprising finding for both the GPOBA and EEPCo expansion programs was the high
number of new households that were indirectly connecting to the grid system through their
neighbors. The main reasons for the high number of indirectly connected households were (i) low-
quality housing materials not in compliance with EEPCo regulations, which excluded many poor


                                                 30
households from participation and (ii) a meter shortage caused by EEPCo’s sole-sourcing of meter
production and delays in GPOBA program rollout.

        For every new metered connection, more than one additional household was adopting
electricity by extending a wire and connecting informally to a neighboring house. This was not
electricity theft because the electricity used went through the neighbor’s household meter.
Indirectly connected households paid metered households a fixed fee, based on the number of
appliances used. Many indirectly connected households would have been willing to adopt a formal
metered connection if it had been easily available, especially since they had to pay their neighbor
a higher price for electricity. These average monthly bills, which quickly added up, could have
paid for an official connection.

        Generally, households were quite satisfied with the electricity service they received under
both the GPOBA scheme and the EEPCo expansion plan. The main problems were related to
frequent power cuts, unclear billing procedures, and poor-quality line extensions for indirect
connections. The next chapter examines how electricity changed the pattern of household energy
use in rural Ethiopia.

   4. Patterns of Household Energy Use

Much research has been conducted over the past several decades on the changes in energy-use
behavior that occur after households adopt electricity for the first time. Electricity adoption will
have an impact on the other fuels households use in their daily lives (Modi et al. 2006; O’Sullivan
and Barnes 2006; World Bank 2002, 2007b, 2011b). In some cases, households will make a direct
substitution of electricity for other types of energy. In other cases, electricity will permit them to
use existing sources of energy in alternate ways for cooking and other household activities.
Electricity generally replaces kerosene for household lighting unless electricity service is
unreliable during evening hours. New appliances, including televisions and radios, will increase
access to mass media and will connect isolated rural areas to the rest of the region and country.
This chapter explores the impact of electricity adoption on households in the five study regions of
rural Ethiopia by examining changes in their energy-use and expenditure patterns.

Usage Before and After Electricity Adoption
The impact evaluation survey for the Ethiopia study regions found that electricity adoption
generally led to many changes in household energy-use patterns. Virtually all households that
adopted electricity used it for lighting, adopting either compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) or
incandescent lamps (table 4.1). Households without electricity rarely used these types of
appliances for lighting, meaning that their previous primary lighting fuels (i.e., kerosene and
candles) were used far less once electricity was adopted.

        Batteries are generally an expensive form of electricity, costing US$20–40 per kWh. Given
the much cheaper cost of electricity, households were found to switch to plug-in radios and
televisions once they adopted electricity. Among households with electricity, 45 percent owned
radios or cassette players. For those without electricity, only 23 percent owned these types of
appliances, which presumably were battery-run models.

       After households adopted electricity, most did not use it for cooking. Interestingly,
however, the better-quality lighting from electricity led to some changes in cooking patterns, as
discussed below.

Household Lighting

In the Ethiopia survey regions, households without electricity traditionally used hurricane lanterns
or kerosene wick lamps made of used cans as their primary lighting source. For households that
adopted electricity, candles often served as a backup lighting source. Flashlights also served as a
form of backup lighting, and were used when people left their homes during evening hours.
Households with electricity used various types of lights, including fluorescent tubes, incandescent
light bulbs, and energy-saving CFL bulbs.

        Based on a survey recall question, 9 out of 10 respondents in households with electricity
remembered using kerosene as their primary lighting source.6 However, after electricity arrived
in the households, only about 1 in 4 households continued using kerosene for lighting. Candles
were a significant source of lighting both before and after households adopted electricity, and were
the main source of backup lighting for households with electricity (table 4.2).

 The recall question was “What are the three most freque ntly used energy sources (for lighting) in your household
before and after electrification.”

           a. Figures are for the top three fuels used by the surveyed households for lighting.


        Prior to electrification, households required a fuel that combined both lighting and heating
for cooking activities. It appears that about one-quarter of households with a new electricity
connection no longer used wood for these purposes as they had done before electrification. Also,
households that used charcoal as a cooking fuel required some additional form of high-quality
lighting since charcoal emits little light. Better lighting was now made possible by electricity.

        As part of the GPOBA scheme, households were to be provided two free CFLs.
Unfortunately, this program component suffered from the untimely delivery of CFLs to EEPCo’s
local offices and insufficient communication on the utility’s responsibilities under the program.
Only about 30 percent of households indicated they received CFLs under the GPOBA program,
and only about half of the GPOBA households ended up using them (table 4.3).

                      a. n.a. = not applicable.


       The use of CFLs also suffered due to voltage fluctuations in the rural grids. Under low
voltage, the lamps sometimes would not start up and, due to extreme voltage fluctuations,
sometimes failed. As a result, the CFLs were unpopular, even among the households that received
them for free. After a short period of time, about one-third of the households that were given the
CFLs decided not to use them. Those households generally replaced the CFLs with incandescent
bulbs, which were readily available in the village and cheaper than CFLs.

     Note: The results for actual annual expenditures are based on those households that received CFLs under the GPOBA

       Theoretically, the use of CFLs instead of incandescent bulbs had great potential for saving
both energy and money, while providing consumers more lighting. Assuming that the GPOBA
households had used their 1.84 CFLs (11 W each) for five hours per day, each household would
have saved up to 226 kWh per household each year. At the prevailing EEPCo domestic tariff, this

                                                           36
would have represented an annual financial savings of about US$7 per household. Thus, if all
GPOBA households had actually received the two free CFLs and used them, the energy savings
of the GPOBA households alone would have been nearly 60,000 kWh per year (table 4.4).

        Unfortunately, the savings potential of the CFLs was not realized. Contrary to the original
plan, only about 48 percent of GPOBA participant households received two CFL bulbs as part of
the scheme’s connection package. In addition, only about one-quarter of the households receiving
the CFLs decided to replace them with new CFLs once they wore out. Even the limited number
of households using CFLs suffered from frequent power outages and service interruptions. In
effect, only one-fifth of the projected savings of 60,000 kWh per year was achieved by the CFL
program component.

Cooking

A common misperception is that electricity adoption will significantly change household cooking
practices in developing countries. The reality is that people have been using firewood for cooking
for thousands of years. In most countries, the advent of electricity does not significantly change
customary cooking practices. Like rural communities in many other developing countries,
Ethiopia’s rural villages and towns were found to use firewood to meet much of their daily cooking
needs both before and after adopting electricity (table 4.5). Firewood is often collected from the
local environment, requiring no cash expenditure.

        However, owing to the low price of electricity in Ethiopia at just US$0.02 per kWh—
among the lowest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa—some rural households in the five study regions
(about 1 in 10 households) adopted the injera mitad (electric hotplate for cooking traditional
breads), which has impacted their cooking patterns. But due to unreliable power supply, the
households that purchased this cooking appliance have complained of not being able to use it
regularly. Once the power-supply situation improves, more households may switch to cooking
certain items using electricity, given the country’s low domestic electricity tariff.

         Summing up, the main cooking patterns did not change in the study regions after
electrification, which is consistent with findings elsewhere. Wood is still used by 9 out of 10
households in rural Ethiopia both before and after electrification. In addition, the survey found
that 11–19 percent of households use kerosene or other fuels (e.g., agricultural waste products) for
cooking.

Television and Radio

Communication is an important benefit of rural electrification programs. In rural areas without
electricity, most communication is local, with the exception of communication using battery-
powered radios. In many developing countries, cell phones are also becoming a mainstay of rural
communications. Radios and cell phones do not require much electricity; but the monthly expense
for batteries, depending on their use, can be substantial. Electricity provided by batteries is quite
expensive, sometimes reaching US$40 per kWh.

        In rural Ethiopia, few households in the surveyed villages and towns owned televisions
prior to electrification; however, many had radios. Out of the 760 households surveyed, only 15
had a television set, while nearly 150 owned a radio. The radios were almost exclusively powered
by dry-cell batteries. The televisions, which required a bit more power, were powered by
generators, 12-V car batteries, or photovoltaic (PV) solar home systems (SHSs).

        The pattern of television ownership changed dramatically after electricity adoption. Once
households had a grid connection, a significant number immediately purchased a television set.
For households receiving electricity through other EEPCo programs, nearly half adopted a
television (table 4.6). For GPOBA-participant households, the television adoption rate was closer
to one-third.

        It should be kept in mind that GPOBA households have only had electricity for about two
years, and most have had service for a year or less. With time, it is expected that increasingly
more households will adopt televisions, as has been common in other developing countries. Thus,
one major change in communication that occurs in Ethiopia as a result of rural electrification is an
increase in information and entertainment through the availability of television.

        Prior to electrification, about one-half of households had radios powered by dry-cell
batteries. Even for households that did not adopt electricity under the GPOBA project or EEPCo
programs, more than one-third still used this type of radio (table 4.7). With the advent of
electricity, the proportion of households using dry-cell powered radios dropped from about one-
half to less than one-third. Also, some new households that did not have radios in the past
purchased plug-in radios after they adopted electricity. Among the households that adopted
electricity, the number with a radio was about half of those with electricity service.

        In other countries, the adoption of television has sometimes led to a decline in the number
of radio users. The higher quality and unique nature of television has a tendency to replace the
time spent listening to radio. This has not yet happened in Ethiopia, as both televisions and radios
have increased in number. However, as increasingly more people purchase televisions, a modest
decline in radio listening might be expected in future years. The impact of the availability of
entertainment, news, and other types of communication made possible by television often extends
beyond the family that owns the television set to include neighbors and relatives that often stop by
to watch favorite programs.

Consumption and Expenditures
Access to electricity provides new opportunities for communication, social activities, and
productive uses. Good lighting means that households can socialize in the evening. Information
flow is improved through having television and radio. The possibility of charging mobile phones
or perhaps accessing the Internet can link rural households to the world outside of their villages.
However, this new demand for better living conditions can also lead to increased household cash
expenditures. In this section, we examine the impact of rural electrification on household energy
expenditures.7

Monthly Household Income and Energy Expenditure

The monthly income and expenditures reported in this study are probably somewhat low. The
main sources of income and expenditure were captured in the impact evaluation survey, meaning
that some minor sources of household income were omitted. As might be expected, the yearly
household income in rural Ethiopia is slightly higher than expenditures (table 4.8). Those
households that had electricity for a longer period of time (EEPCo households) had higher incomes
than more recent electricity adopters (GPOBA households). Likewise, all households with
electricity had higher incomes and expenditures than those without electricity. No doubt, this was

  During the impact evaluation survey, some difficulties occurred in gathering correct electricity consumption data
from households. The main reasons were corrupt or broken meters and irregular collection of electricity bills, along
with informal household connections. However, the information provided suggests the approximate levels of
household electricity used in the survey areas.

a self-selecting process. Households with higher incomes can better afford an electricity
connection and the monthly charges for adopting electricity.

        Both household incomes and expenditures rose between the 2011 and 2014 surveys. Given
the short period between the surveys, these increases should not be attributed to the impact of
electricity, and are more likely due to inflation. The survey figures are not adjusted for inflation,
and the rising cost of living played a significant part in increasing household energy expenditure.
Also, a high percentage of GPOBA households were selling electricity to their neighbors who
could not obtain direct metered connections. These additional charges to households would show
up as reported income and expenditure for those households that had adopted electricity.
Furthermore, at the time of the survey, there was an increase in ground-transport costs to rural
areas for commercial fuels (e.g., kerosene, firewood, and charcoal), which significantly increased
the delivered costs of such energy sources.8

        Despite the survey issues and recent high rates of inflation in Ethiopia, the final survey
results are fairly consistent with other worldwide energy surveys. The overall findings are that
purchased energy accounts for an average of about 20 percent of household income (table 4.9).

          a. Households without electricity are in villages with electricity.


        In villages without electricity, the household income spent on energy is a bit lower,
probably because such households collect more fuels for cooking and are slightly poorer than those
in villages with electricity. The high percentage of income spent on energy is partly because the
survey measure of income is in cash; however, in rural areas, much income is in-kind, which is
not measured by the survey. Farmers sell a small portion of the grain they produce in the local
market. If this were included, the percent of income spent on energy would be somewhat lower.
In contrast to income, commercial energy sources all involve cash expenditures.

Electricity

Electricity from the grid is quite affordable for rural households, accounting for just 2–3 percent
of all expenditures and only about 10 percent of all energy expenditures (table 4.9).9 These
findings agree with other international household energy studies, which indicate that households
spend 2–5 percent of their income on electricity. As households in rural Ethiopia transition to



9
  Electricity consumption data was available for only 21.8 percent of the 107 households surveyed because many
surveyed households had an inaccurate meter or were lacking bills.
                                                               42
electricity, their other energy expenses do not decline by much. It would have been expected that
kerosene for lighting would be significantly reduced. But kerosene was used in similar amounts
by households with and without electricity. Perhaps the kerosene saved from lighting in
households with electricity was repurposed for cooking, as well as used as a backup power supply.

        For electricity, the GPOBA households spent about US$1.30 on their average monthly
electricity consumption of about 12 kWh per month. The EEPCo households used an average of
15 kWh and paid about $2.20 per month. These results were confirmed by the baseline survey for
all households, which indicated the average monthly expenditure for electricity was about $2.60
per month.10

        Households in rural Ethiopia generally considered that the price of electricity was
affordable. This was not unexpected since, by international standards, Ethiopia’s electricity price
is extremely low, at about US$0.02 per kWh. More than 80 percent of households with electricity
considered the price of electricity as reasonable, while only slightly more than 10 percent thought
it was priced too high (figure 4.1). When asked how much they would be willing to pay for a
reliable supply of electricity, households responded they would be willing to pay $2.20 per month,
which is quite similar to the amount already being paid by EEPCo households but much higher
than the $1.30 expenditure of GPOBA-participant households. Thus, there may be room to
increase the price of electricity among poor households that are not extremely poor.

        Households were generally satisfied with EEPCo’s customer service and tariff
affordability; however, power reliability did not fare as well (figure 4.1). More than 90 percent
of the households surveyed indicated they were satisfied with customer service, and over 60
percent said they were satisfied with tariff affordability. But less than 10 percent were very
satisfied with power reliability, meaning that 30 percent were either dissatisfied or very
dissatisfied. Typically, during a country’s first years of rural electrification, most households
indicate they are satisfied with electricity service, mainly because they are making comparisons
with their situation before electricity arrived in their communities; therefore, satisfaction with
service reflects customers’ happiness in having been able to adopt electricity service. Having 30
percent of households with new electricity service dissatisfied with power reliability is quite a
large percentage.

Kerosene

Kerosene is an important fuel in rural Ethiopia, used either for lighting or cooking. It is commonly
sold in small plastic containers, called “Fanta-bottles,” containing about 330 ml. In Ethiopia, the
average price of such containers of kerosene is about US$0.40–0.60 (8–12 Birr). People in rural
Ethiopia are aware that kerosene lamps are polluting. About 70 percent of the surveyed households
affirmed that kerosene lamps had a bad odor and gave off poor light.

        The household consumption of kerosene in Ethiopia is fairly low compared to other
countries. The amount of kerosene consumed by rural households is about 2 liters per month (table
4.10). One explanation for the low level of kerosene use is the way it is priced in communities.
People purchasing smaller amounts are usually charged a higher price. In the study villages, the
average price per liter was slightly more than US$1 (23 Birr), but the price for 1 liter varied
considerably between $1 and $2, depending on local availability within the village. In more remote
areas, many households complained about the high price of kerosene. Forty-five percent of the
surveyed households stated that kerosene is not readily available in their village and is quite highly
priced.

        One explanation for the increased kerosene expenditure is the way it is priced in the
communities. People purchasing smaller amounts are usually charged a higher price. In the study
villages, the average price per liter was slightly more than US$1 (23 Birr), but the price for 1 liter
varied quite a bit between $1 and $2, depending on local availability within the village. Many
households that lived in more remote areas complained about the high price of kerosene. Forty-
five percent of the surveyed households stated that kerosene is not easily available in the village
and that it is quite highly priced.

Batteries and Candles

Batteries and candles are an alternative to electricity for lighting. About 65 percent of the
households studied used batteries for lighting or radios. These households purchased an average
of three batteries per month, spending about US$1.20. Candles were used for lighting or as backup
fuel in case of power outages. Candle-using households typically used 4–6 candles per month,
spending about US$1.00 on average. Due to the irregularity of electricity service, many
households with electricity found it necessary to continue using candles and batteries as backup
fuels in amounts not much less than those spent by households without electricity. As documented
in other developing countries (e.g., Banerjee et al. 2015), improvement in the power supply, no
doubt, would mean more people using electric radios and lighting and thus would result in a
significant decrease in the use of batteries and candles.

Firewood, Charcoal, and Gas

For cooking, the surveyed households typically used firewood, charcoal, or gas. Firewood, used
by two-thirds of the surveyed households, was the most important household energy expenditure.
Households either collected it from nearby common-access land or bought it in the local market.
Firewood was sold in bundles and donkey loads (equivalent to about 60 kg of wood) or truck loads.
The majority of households indicated they typically purchased 4 bundles or 2 donkey loads per
month. The average price for 1 donkey load was US$3.00–$5.50. For households that used
firewood, the estimated average monthly expenditure on wood was about $8.00.

        The use of charcoal for cooking or heating was found to be less common than firewood,
and its availability in the rural markets was somewhat limited. Even so, about 25 percent of the
surveyed households used charcoal. Charcoal cannot be collected from the local woodlands;
instead, all of it is purchased in the commercial market. As a result, households that used charcoal
spent an average of about US$8.00 per month on this fuel. It should be emphasized that this
amounts dwarfs that spent on electricity. Finally, the use of bottled gas was uncommon in rural
areas of Ethiopia.

Conclusion
The promotion of electricity in rural areas of Ethiopia has had a significant impact on how
households use energy. Predictably, the largest shift in energy use involved household lighting.
Households that adopted electricity were extremely satisfied with the improvements in household
lighting made possible by electricity. They perceived that kerosene did not provide enough light.
Also, most households indicated that kerosene use was somewhat polluting. After adopting
electricity, households generally used fewer batteries, somewhat less kerosene, and less wood for
lighting. A surprising number of households indicated that they had television. The use of plug-
in radios also became popular after electricity arrived in communities in rural Ethiopia.

        Electricity is also quite affordable in rural Ethiopia, comprising only 2–3 percent of total
income, a figure fairly typical of many developing countries. However, rural households in
Ethiopia have many other energy expenditures, especially those related to cooking. Purchased
energy accounts for up to 20 percent of household income. Also surprising was that some
households with new electricity service use it for some cooking, most likely because of the
extremely low price of electricity in Ethiopia. Electricity’s affordability, combined with its
significant impact on rural households, means that rural electrification is an important development
program for the country. Given electricity’s low price and household impact, it is little wonder
that some households that could not obtain an official meter from EEPCo adopted electricity
indirectly by connecting to a neighbor with an official meter.

        The major benefits of electricity for households in rural Ethiopia were household lighting,
communication, and, to a more limited degree, cooking. In order to further examine changes in
energy use, the next chapter takes a closer look at the more general welfare benefits of electricity
for people living in rural Ethiopia, including education, health, and changes in family social
interactions.

     5. Impact on Household Quality of Life

The adoption of electricity is important for improving rural households’ quality of life. The use
of electricity not only is substituted for less efficient fuels, but also establishes a resource that
quickly changes life in rural households. Electricity provides better access to information, more
avenues of communication, enhancement of social activities, and increased productivity.
Televisions, radios, and cell phones all link rural households to the world outside. At the same
time, electricity increases the demand for new or improved electrical equipment. In social terms,
women and children benefit the most from rural electrification. Rural households use electricity
initially for lighting, which allows for evening reading and study for schoolgoing children.

Electricity and Appliance Ownership
Electricity is a necessary but insufficient condition for development. The welfare benefits from
rural electrification invariably result from the use of some type of appliance or machine. Thus, it
is necessary to trace some of the pathways of electricity and its eventual social and economic
impacts. For example, electricity provides improved household lighting (Nieuwenhout et al.
1998), which immediately increases children’s study hours (Barakat et al. 2002; World Bank 2002;
Unnayan Shamannay 1996); this, in turn, improves school attendance and higher education for
children. Community or street lighting provides higher levels of community illumination during
evening hours, but the real benefit is a greater sense of security. Figure 5.1 illustrates the probable
pathways leading to welfare impacts for households and individuals. These pathways are complex,
and no doubt there are others that have an impact on socioeconomic development.11

        The adoption of grid electricity first means having access to a reliable and inexpensive
electricity supply. Consumers soon begin buying a variety of electric appliances, including light
bulbs, radios, television sets, space coolers/heaters, cooking devices, and other small machines.
The next step is that these appliances produce results, such as more light, which allows more study
or home production, more access to information and entertainment, more comfort, better food
preservation, more efficient cooking, and finally more motive power for productive uses (World
Bank 2002; IEG 2008). At times, households use small cooking devices, such as hotplates or
electric coils, for heating water. In the case of rural Ethiopia, people sometimes cook with the
electric injera mitad (hot plate for cooking traditional flatbread). In addition, in some instances,
electric lighting and small grinders allow people to prepare food more efficiently, thus freeing up
their time for other activities (World Bank 2004).

        The use of such appliances, in turn, can create intermediate outputs, such as extended study
time, longer hours of operation for home businesses, better business knowledge, better health, and
more efficient business operation. These intermediate outputs can lead to final development
outcomes, such as improved education, health, and income. In the case of education, for example,
children’s increased study time due to electric lighting results in better performance at school; in
the long run, this leads to higher educational attainment and ultimately higher income. A fairly
large body of literature, beginning with Mincer (1974), discusses the returns to education.
Similarly, the productive uses of electricity have been the subject of many studies. The main
findings are that complementary conditions, such as active markets and available credit, are

                                                  48
necessary to realize the full benefits of rural electrification (Cabraal, Barnes, and Agarwal 2005;
Asaduzzaman, Barnes, and Khandker 2009).

        Even small businesses can take advantage of electric lighting and appliances. The use of
electricity in small retail shops or food stores can mean longer business hours and refrigeration.
Conceptually at least, the pathways of electricity’s impact on both outputs and outcomes can lead
to gains in household income and productivity. This chapter focuses on appliance ownership,
people’s perception of improvement in energy services, use of electricity in small businesses,
improvements in education, and other impacts of rural electrification.

Electric Appliance Ownership

Electricity offers new opportunities for households, including improved quality of household
lighting, enhanced flow of information, and better communication. In order to realize such
benefits, households purchase appliances. The availability of electricity enables households to
purchase a wide array of appliance types. Of course, households will be limited by their income,
but even the poorest ones value the purchase of new appliances.

        In the Ethiopia study, most GPOBA households had enjoyed electricity for only one or two
years at most, and EEPCo households had not had electricity for much longer. It is well established
that households accumulate new appliances over time. After expending income to purchase
appliances in a first wave, they save money and plan for later purchases. Results of the impact
evaluation survey thus provide a snapshot of this first round of purchasing household appliances
in rural Ethiopia.

        While chapter 4 examined the use of household energy for lighting, cooking, and
communication, here we examine the adoption of electric appliances that produce better
development outcomes (table 5.1). We know that 100 percent of the households with electricity
in this study have incandescent lamps or compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). The GPOBA
intervention has stressed the use of CFLs by aiming to provide all households adopting a
connection under the program two free CFLs. Despite the logistical problems in providing these
lamps, more than half of GPOBA-participant households had CFLs. More surprising, 48 percent
of EEPCo households also had CFLs (table 5.1). Perhaps due to significant voltage fluctuations
in the service areas, both EEPCo and GPOBA households had a high level of incandescent lamps.
For households without grid electricity, a small number had electric lamps that used either batteries
or solar home systems (SHSs) for lighting.

           Note: Households without electricity are in villages with electricity. Some households in this category
           have electricity from other sources, such as batteries or PV solar home systems (SHSs).
           Communication equipment can run on batteries.


        Many households with electricity appreciated the impact that rural electrification has on
communication. About three-quarters of rural households with electricity had mobile phones, as
did approximately one-fifth of households without electricity, who often charged their phones at
charging stations or in neighbors’ homes. Radios and cassette players were also popular in homes
with electricity. Nearly half of homes with electricity had plug-in radios, compared to one-quarter
of homes without electricity (table 5.1). No doubt, those without electricity used expensive
batteries to power their radios. More surprisingly, one-third of households purchased a television
set shortly after connecting to electricity, attesting to television’s popularity for obtaining news
and entertainment. In contrast, television sets were seldom found in households without
electricity.

        Predictably, most other appliances had not yet been purchased, given the short amount of
time that the surveyed households had had electricity. Surprisingly, however, the electric injera
mitad had been purchased by about 5 percent of rural households with electricity (figure 5.2). This
hotplate draws quite a bit of power, costing about US$100. A similar percentage of rural
households had bought refrigerators. Purchase of these two appliances could have a profound
impact on household cooking practices in rural Ethiopia.

           a. Households without electricity are in villages with electricity; some households in this category may
           have electricity from other sources (e.g., batteries, PV solar home systems [SHSs], or indirect
           connections).


        The purchase of household appliances requires cash. About half of the surveyed
households with electricity had purchased appliances during the past 12 months. Nearly 50 percent
of households with electricity had made a new appliance purchase in the past year. Among those
surveyed, the average amount spent on new appliances during the past year was US$96 for EEPCo
households and $70 for GPOBA households (table 5.2). The lesser amount spent by GPOBA
households can probably be explained by their somewhat lower income levels, compared to those
that had connected during the first round of connections for the community prior to the GPOBA

program. The amount of money spent by households was wide-ranging, from less than $10 to as
much as $800.

        While remittances and loans from friends and relatives might explain how the high level of
appliance purchases was made during the study period, the availability of electricity made this new
wave of appliance purchasing possible, underscoring the need for rural electrification programs to
think beyond provision of wires and poles. That is, thinking must extend beyond the necessary
conditions for development to those appliances that provide the development benefits resulting from
rural electrification. The impact of the rural electrification program might be greater if a
microcredit program allowed households to spread out payments for electric appliances. This is
not to say that subsidies are necessary for promoting household appliances. Rather, the financing
of appliances, like the financing of initial household connections, could perhaps be supported by
microfinance institutions (MFIs).

Household Opinions on Electricity Benefits

Households with electricity in rural Ethiopia have a quite favorable opinion of the benefits of rural
electrification. When households were asked to agree or disagree with the statement “being
connected to the grid has resulted in benefits in terms of better lighting,” more than 95 percent
agreed and few disagreed (figure 5.3).

                            Being connected to the grid has resulted in benefits
                                               in terms of:
                        … better indoor air quality
                                  … better lighting
              .. reduced kerosene consumption
                 .. reduced battery consumption
                       … less energy expenditures
                                 … better security
                     … better socializing of the HH
                  .. reduced candle consumption
                                   … better health

                        … better income situation
                      … better working conditions
                                           Agree      No Opinion    Disagree

       Taken alone, this result was not surprising; however, households’ perception of benefit did
not stop at lighting. They believed that electricity was responsible for better indoor air quality,
reduced kerosene consumption, and generally less expenses for energy. In addition, they felt more
secure and perceived their health to be better, perhaps due to the better indoor air quality.

        Opinions on electricity benefits were also favorable in terms of attitudes toward economic
opportunities. More than 60 percent of households agreed that “being connected to the grid has
resulted in benefits in terms of better income and working conditions.” However, opinions toward
working conditions were less positive than those related to the quality of life within households.
This is not unexpected since it generally takes longer for economic development to have an impact
on quality of life, compared to the purchase of household appliances. This is not to say that
electricity will not eventually benefit the local business community in rural Ethiopia. But new
jobs and economic opportunities cannot be expected to develop overnight, and generally require
longer periods of time to have a full impact.12

Social Impact of Electricity
Until a severe storm affects power supply lines, most people in developed countries do not consider
the importance of electricity in their lives. This is not the case for those in rural areas of such
developing countries as Ethiopia, where the vast majority of people have never had electricity.
This fact was a major advantage for assessing the social impact of rural electrification. Because
this impact evaluation study was conducted only a few years after households adopted electricity
for the first time, the memories of living without power were fresh in their minds.

        This section examines the opinions of people in rural Ethiopia about life before and after
the arrival of electricity. These include opinions about how having electricity has changed their
time use and living patterns, improved their children’s education, and made them feel safer and
more secure.

Changes in Living Patterns

With better lighting, communication, and entertainment, family members no doubt changed their
time-use patterns, especially during evening hours. Survey questions were asked about the “two
main activities” of household members (men, women, boys, and girls) before and after adopting
electricity. Focusing on the two main activities of household members during evening hours
revealed patterns of social change resulting from the rural electrification program.

       In households without electricity, the main evening activities for men involved discussions
with family members and tending to cattle (table 5.3). More than one-quarter of men indicated

     This issue is more fully addressed in chapters 6 and 7.
                                                               53
they go to sleep early in the evening. After adopting electricity, men still tended cattle; however,
because they did not have to go to sleep early, they were able to do other activities. The main
change was that television viewing increased from about zero before electrification to about one-
quarter after adopting service (about the same percentage as those owning a television set). No
doubt, more households will view television in the future as sets become more common in villages
and towns with electricity. Family discussion time also increased significantly for men, perhaps
due to the availability of better lighting. Also, men tended to listen to the radio a bit more after
electricity was adopted.

        The main activities of women before having electricity differed markedly from those of
men. Interestingly, the changes due to adopting electricity were quite similar. Overall, women’s
main activity was domestic work, including cooking. Like men, their living patterns changed after
adopting electricity. Women also did not go to sleep as early as before. They also did less domestic
housework, freeing up time for activities that were quite similar to those of men. More women in
households that adopted electricity watched television and participated in family discussions.
Thus, the main change overall for adult men and women in rural households that adopted electricity
related to communication. Better lighting allowed households to stay up longer and participate in
family discussions. For those that had televisions, virtually all men and women watched it as a
main activity in the evening.

        The focus group discussions (FGDs) conducted as part of the household survey revealed
that the adoption of electricity reduced the amount of travel time necessary for purchasing kerosene
                                                               54
and charging mobile phones. For households without electricity, the charging of mobile phones
is difficult and time consuming. Shops and nearby households in the villages offer mobile charging
services for a fee. Once households adopted electricity, phone charging was done less expensively
in the home.

        In households that had not yet received electricity, the living patterns of children and adults
differed. The main difference was that children studied after dark by the weak light provided by
kerosene lanterns (table 5.4). Between one-quarter and one-third of children in the surveyed
households without electricity studied in the evening. Otherwise, they participated in family
discussions and went to sleep early in the evening.

        Once a household adopted electricity, evening study time increased by about 15–20 percent
for both boys and girls, reaching well over half of all households with electricity. More boys and
girls watched television in the evening, but the number was only about 10 percent, compared to
more than 20 percent for adults. Thus, television does not appear to substitute for study time. The
number of boys and girls that fell asleep early declined significantly for households that adopted
electricity. For girls, the increase in study time may also have been caused by a decline in time
spent doing domestic work during evening hours.

        The FGDs confirmed the changes observed in the household survey. According to the
FGDs, the adoption of electricity encourages households to buy televisions or radios. Television
offers useful information that can enhance the productivity of inputs used in household production,
leading to increased income. Family members gain knowledge and awareness of events and
                                                              55
activities that are socially beneficial. Furthermore, women may gain awareness of reproductive
health issues, which can empower them in household decision-making. Such changes are expected
to contribute to the improved welfare of all household members. FGD participants also wondered
whether electricity would bring new services to their communities, including the opening of
business establishments.

Better Education

That more children are able to study once a household adopts electricity means that it is important
for children’s education. The improvement in children’s education, in turn, is important for their
future income as they reach adulthood and for the country overall, which will benefit from a more
educated population.

        Electricity’s estimated benefits for education have been well documented for developed
countries and, to a lesser extent, for developing countries. Intuitively, one knows that education
can lead to higher streams of future income over an individual’s lifetime. Such intuition was
formalized in Mincer’s classic model for analyzing the income returns of education, which
established that additional education leads to higher incomes (Mincer 1974). Education is more
like an investment than a consumer good. This study does not estimate the future potential gains
from education, but it does analyze the change in student study patterns that result from their
households adopting electricity.

         There is accumulated evidence on the strong positive relationship between rural
electrification and education. In Bhutan, for example, a household survey conducted in 2010 found
that rural electrification increased children’s evening study time by 10 minutes and grade
completion by three-quarters of a year (Kumar and Rauniyar 2011). In Brazil, a recent study on
county-level electrification (made possible by a hydropower dam) suggests that countries
achieving full electrification see a 22 percent drop in illiteracy, a 19 percent reduction in the
population with less than four years of education, and an increase of 1.2 years in schooling
completion (Lipscomb, Mobarak, and Barham 2013).

        Building on this evidence, some recent studies using advanced statistical techniques have
established the causality between electrification and educational outcomes by controlling for the
possibility that those with higher levels of education are more likely to adopt electricity (Khandker,
Barnes, and Samad 2012a, 2012b, 2013). In Bangladesh, both boys and girls in households with
electricity spent more time studying and had higher levels of grades completed in school. Also, it
does not appear that the source of electricity mattered, as children from households with
decentralized sources of electricity in Bangladesh (SHSs) and Nepal (community micro-hydro
systems) also studied longer than those living in households without any form of electricity. The
implication is that electrification indeed contributes to better education.


                                                 56
        The opinion of recent household adopters of electricity in Ethiopia mirrors the findings of
numerous studies in other developing countries indicating that rural electrification has positive
impacts on both the number of hours children study and their participation in school. In fact,
according to the FGDs and survey questionnaire, households adopting electricity in rural Ethiopia
have high hopes for their children’s education. About 95 percent of those households with
electricity think that electricity will improve the educational possibilities of their children (table
5.5). Even the surveyed households without electricity had a positive view of the relationship
between rural electrification and education.

        The optimism of households with electricity was borne out by changes in the location and
hours of children’s study. Households still without electricity or those who could recall life before
electricity reported that between one-fifth and one-third of children studied outdoors to take
advantage of daylight for reading (table 5.6). After households adopted electricity, many more
children were able to study indoors. After electricity adoption, about four-fifths of children studied
at home, while the number studying outside dropped to zero. Thus, the survey confirms that the
study environment for children living in homes with electricity improves as a result of improved
household lighting.

        Not only did the place of study change in households with electricity, children’s evening
study time increased (table 5.7). For households who could recall life before having electricity
and those still without it, children studied approximately two hours per night. After adopting
electricity, children tended to study a full extra hour (three hours per night). This difference is
likely to impact not only current school performance, but also the likelihood that children will stay
in school. Better prepared students are often perceived positively by teachers. Other international
studies have confirmed that school attendance increases with the adoption of electricity by rural
households.

       It should not be overlooked that the quality of primary and secondary schools might also
be enhanced after electricity reaches a village or town. Schools can be equipped with computers,
copy and printing machines, multimedia equipment, and other services. In some urban villages,
educational television programs have been offered as a result of the town having power service.

        Having electricity for children’s study time has some possible negative consequences.
FDG participants worried that direct satellite television and cinemas may impact children’s
educational performance by taking time away from study. These worries were not substantiated
by the survey, which documented an increase in children’s study time and television viewing as
their main activities in the evening, which resulted from doing less household work and going to
bed later. Therefore, the findings that electricity has a positive impact on children’s education in
rural Ethiopia are buttressed by other international evidence, as well as the impact evaluation
survey of children’s study hours. Adult household members are in close to unanimous agreement
that electricity has a positive impact on children’s education.

Health and Safety

In general, households in rural Ethiopia think that rural electrification improves health and safety.
In most developing countries, cooking smoke is thought to have the greatest impact on household
health. In contrast, households in rural Ethiopia were more aware of the health problems caused
by smoke from kerosene household lamps, including eye and throat irritation. In most countries,
improved lighting is much appreciated for improving safety, especially if towns and villages have
street lights. In Ethiopia, street lighting was not included in most villages under the program;
however, many beneficiary households had a lamp installed outside the house.

      The FGDs identified lighting as the main reason that health and safety improved in rural
households with electricity. Replacing the dim light of smoky kerosene lamps with non-polluting

                                                           59
electric lights was perceived to reduce indoor air pollution (IAP).13 With better-quality lighting,
it was possible for women to spend less time cleaning. Electricity also improved the efficiency of
cooking during evening hours. The FGD participants agreed that women and young children in
households with electricity had fewer respiratory and related illnesses. Also, the use of electric
lights reduced fire hazards caused by kerosene lamps.

        When the surveyed households were asked about lighting in their homes, their responses
clearly reflected their opinion about the superiority of electricity (table 5.8). Nearly 90 percent of
the households with electricity agreed with the statement “Lighting is quite adequate in my home.”
For those households without electricity, who no doubt were dependent on kerosene, less than 5
percent thought they had adequate light in their homes to meet their needs. In fact, respondents in
villages without electricity unanimously agreed that non-electricity lighting sources were
inadequate for their needs.

        For those households with electricity, a set of questions was asked on the benefits of
electricity from the grid (table 5.9). These households were also asked to agree or disagree with
the statement “Being connected to the grid has caused benefits in terms of better lighting, reduced
kerosene consumption, and better security and health.” On average, the households had strong
positive feelings about the benefits of electricity from the grid. This included both the households

connected by EEPCo and those under the GPOBA program. More than 90 percent of households
considered electricity to be related to better indoor air quality, better lighting, reduced kerosene
consumption, and the use of fewer candles. In addition, households held the opinion that electricity
would lead to better security and health of family members.

              Note: The responses for EEPCo and GPOBA households gave quite similar results, so the
              categories were combined.


        One unusual finding from the FGDs was that those areas with street lights were more
attractive for both formal and informal taxi service. Some taxis began operating in areas that were
lighted with electricity. Before village electrification, taxi and Bajaj drivers were not willing to
come to the villages without electricity, probably because they feared various security problems.
Now they offer their service till late in the evening.

         It should be cautioned that the opinions about the benefits of electricity may have been a
bit inflated due to the recent adoption of service. Compared to spending evenings in darkness or
by the dull light of a kerosene lamp, those who adopted electricity may have exaggerated its
benefits. However, the households with electricity in rural Ethiopia were able to clearly identify
the benefits of electricity, and, in the years to come, will come to think of it as a normal part of
their everyday life.

Conclusion
The social benefits of rural electrification include changes in living patterns, improved education,
possibly better health, and better home security. At least this is the opinion of the households that
have adopted electricity under the GPOBA and EEPCo programs. The goal of the GPOBA
program was to make it possible for households that could not afford the cost of a connection to
be able to obtain the benefits of rural electrification right away, and then pay for those benefits
over time.
                                                       61
        When asked who benefited most from the GPOBA program, more than 80 percent of
village respondents indicated that it was poor households. This spurred a higher rate of
connections in villages under the GPOBA program, paralleled by a wave of electricity appliance
purchases—mainly additional household lights, plug-in radios, and televisions. Probably due to
the low price of electricity, some households were even purchasing hotplates and injera mitads for
cooking bread. According to the opinions of those questioned, these appliances, in turn, had an
impact on a household’s quality of life, including improved reading and education, improved
comfort, and better health.

        The overall improvement in the quality of life for people living in rural areas depends on
the number of people actually adopting electricity. The GPOBA scheme’s goal of making
connections more affordable was much appreciated by most participating households. One survey
respondent stated that “the rich can pay the whole amount, and we are benefited by long-term
payments.” Another said that, due to the GPOBA program, his household could get electricity
“like a rich household.”

         Some might question why households who could afford to buy a television set could not
afford to pay for an electricity connection. The reality is that household savings are quite meager
in rural areas of Ethiopia, and only one-third of households in the study regions purchased a
television set. For some households, being able to spread out connection payments over time
helped to make the TV purchase affordable. Televisions were watched not only by the families
that purchased them, but also by their neighbors and relatives. This suggests that such programs
as the Ethiopia GPOBA project perhaps should be extended beyond electricity adoption to include
the purchase of important appliances in order to maximize the development benefit of rural
electrification.

       In this chapter, the social benefits of rural electrification have been analyzed and proven to
be extensive. However, electricity can also be used in productive enterprises. The next chapter
examines the financial and economic benefits of rural electrification in Ethiopia in the context of
household enterprises and business development.

           6. Productive Use of Electricity

People often equate the productive use of power with machinery. While driveshaft power is
certainly important, myriad other uses of electricity can provide economic benefits for businesses
in rural areas. High-quality lighting can lead to longer business hours and therefore higher income.
The use of refrigeration in small rural restaurants and food shops can be important for preserving
food and maintaining a healthy environment. The production of home artisan goods can provide
women with additional income to support their families. Thus, the productive use of electricity is
not limited to machinery.

        This chapter reviews the impact of electricity for home production, small businesses, and
larger enterprises in rural Ethiopia. The next section examines small-scale businesses, most of
which are conducted inside or alongside homes. Subsequent sections investigate somewhat larger
rural businesses with locations separate from the home.

Household Production and Small Business
International experience has shown that rural electrification can stimulate many new household
businesses in rural areas. Without complementary programs, however, the creation of new
household production or related businesses is modest at best (Barnes 2014; Asaduzzaman, Barnes,
and Khandker 2009; Barakat et. al. 2002; Cabraal, Barnes, and Agarwal 2005; Dinkelman 2011;
Meier et al. 2010; World Bank 2002). After all, not every household has the personal initiative or
financing necessary to start a business. Also, businesses tend to be quite modest endeavors (e.g.,
local food vendors, kiosks, teahouses, and crafts production). In many countries, the majority of
business owners are women who produce and sell home goods.

       Although rural Ethiopia has had electricity for only a few short years, many home-based
businesses and independent stores have sprung up in villages and towns with electricity. The
number of home-based businesses or those providing additional household income from outside
the home totals about 6 percent of EEPCo or GPOBA households (table 6.1). The additional
household income provided by these electricity-using businesses was in a range of US$25–$34 per
month, or about $1 per day, which is typical for home-based businesses around the world. While
this amount of money may not seem like much, it can make the difference between a household

                                                63
living in or out of poverty. For other developing countries, about 10–20 percent of rural
households have additional business opportunity. Not unexpectedly, these figures are
comparatively higher, reflecting the much longer period that communities in these countries have
had electricity (World Bank 2002, 2008b). Given that rural communities covered in the Ethiopia
impact evaluation survey had only had electricity for a little over three years, it is likely that the 6
percent figure will grow in the coming years.

         Note: Missing values were assumed to have zero new businesses as a result of adopting electricity.


         Many of the new small businesses are taking advantage of improved lighting. Only about
11 of the 33 households with new businesses have purchased new equipment for a business
activity. Of these, five households indicated they had added on to their house, four purchased a
refrigerator, two purchased a pool table, one purchased equipment for a tea business, and another
bought a grain mill. The value of the new investments ranged from only US$11 to more than
$1,000 for the purchasing households. Nearly half of the businesses started as a result of rural
electrification; they were not due to any special equipment, but did take advantage of better-quality
lighting provided by electricity.

        Many households in villages and towns with electricity had ideas about a future business.
In fact, about half of the households under the GPOBA and EEPCo programs had considered
starting a new business. The most common business concepts were small shops, food vending,
hair salons, woodworking shops, and cafes (table 6.2). Most of these households were thinking
about the future, but did not yet have the means to start such businesses. This is in stark contrast
to people living in households and nearby villages without electricity, who had not even started to
think about starting a new business. Clearly, having electricity service in a village opens up a
range of business possibilities for rural households.

        a. Households not responding were assumed to have not been asked the question (because they were not living
        in communities with electricity) or had no business ideas.


         Business owners participating in focus group discussions (FGDs) appreciated that
electricity facilitated the attraction of more customers and that customers generally stayed longer
in their food shops and cafes. Customers would eat, drink, and watch television in the cafes, thus
improving sales and income for the business owner (figure 6.1). According to the survey, women
gained income by running small kiosks or shops with electricity that sold local food and drinks.
Most of these businesses did not use electricity directly to prepare food, but the value of better
lighting and sometimes television would attract customers.

       For charging mobile phones, the rural electrification program had the effect of moving
charging services from shops into people’s homes. Prior to the rural electrification program, most
people with mobile phones had to travel many miles to charging stations outside of the village.
After the rural electrification program, households with electricity started charging their
neighbors’ mobile phones to earn extra money. This arrangement was also convenient for their
neighbors without electricity, saving them time and travel expenses.

        One type of home business—indirect electricity connections—was a direct result of
problems with the rural electrification program. As previously indicated, many homes without
electricity in villages and towns with power service took advantage of connecting to service by
stringing lines to their neighbors’ homes. Households with an indirect connection paid a higher
price for electricity, based on fixed monthly fees for the appliances in their homes. For example,
in the Benishangul-Gumuz (BSG) region, a female-headed household charged a fixed monthly fee
of US$0.75 per bulb to neighbors without electricity. As a result, after paying EEPCo for
electricity, she made a small profit of about $3 per month. Thus, the inefficiency of the program
in installing meters had resulted in new businesses for “electricity entrepreneurs” charging higher
prices for electricity with no connection charge. This was not a unique case as every household
with a legitimate meter spawned about one addition household with an informal connection.

Private Businesses
As part of the survey, local administrators were asked about the impact of village electrification
on private business establishments in their communities. The objective of this assessment was to
estimate the proportion of businesses with electricity and to examine whether village electrification
had played a catalytic role in the establishment or significant upgrading of private businesses.

       This section investigates the impact of rural electrification for business development on a
somewhat larger scale than the household level. The communities included in this assessment all
had electricity with no control villages. Thus, this section should be treated as a descriptive
analysis of business development for villages and towns with electricity.

Description of Businesses

The business survey was conducted in the same villages and towns as those in the household
impact evaluation study. The 22 villages and towns in the study represented both rural and semi-
urban areas; thus, the majority of businesses were small service firms (e.g., local liquor shops,
kiosks, retail shops, tea rooms, barber shops, grain mills, restaurants, and bakeries). In addition,
there were a small number of woodworking and metalworking shops. In all, there were 2,557
private business enterprises in the 22 towns and villages with electricity (table 6.3).

        The majority of the study villages and towns were provided with electricity under the
Universal Electricity Access Program, of which GPOBA is a part. Nearly all businesses in this
study gained access to electricity only after the Universal Electricity Access Program came to their
village. The few exceptions were some towns with municipal mini-grids that may have existed
prior to the national grid program. Therefore, more than four-fifths of private businesses had
electricity provided by EEPCo or through indirect electricity connections.

        One would expect close to 100 percent use of electricity by private business enterprises,
given that electricity plays a crucial role in improving business productivity and profitability.
Business owners also expressed an ability and willingness to pay for electricity service. Business
owners and local administrators explained that the reason 17 percent of private businesses were
without electricity was that they could not obtain a connection from EEPCo due to the shortage of
electricity meters and other necessary materials, and these explanations were confirmed by
EEPCo’s district managers. This situation illustrates the significant role that quality of electricity
service provided by the power company plays in both household and business adoption of
electricity, which can impact the level of productive use in a community.

  Note: This is an overlapping but not identical list compared to table 6.3 on households deriving income from businesses
  with electricity. The villages and towns are the same as those for the household survey, except that the two control villages
  without electricity were excluded from the analysis. The figures for all regions are the average per region, except as
  otherwise noted.


        Many rural electrification programs in Sub-Saharan Africa are just now reaching small
towns, and Ethiopia is no exception. Thus, the average number of businesses per surveyed village
or town is quite high, at 116. But this average tends to hide many important differences among
the five study regions. The highest number of private businesses per village or town were reported
for Amhara (235), followed by Oromia (148) and SNNPR (106), with lower numbers in Tigray
(54) and BSG (31) (table 6.4).

        Residential homes and business establishments generally are not separate entities. Such
small businesses do not pay a separate tariff because, for the most part, they are either housed on
the premises or in extensions added to existing residences. Homes with private businesses often
are the first to adopt electricity from the grid. Businesses are not only a high-end electricity market
niche; they also informally help to expand the reach of electricity within rural villages and towns




                                                               68
by serving local customers. Thus, the distinction between business and household rural
electrification in rural Ethiopia is quite blurred.14

        The productive uses of electricity in rural Ethiopia are quite varied. Small businesses serve
a variety of consumer needs. However, certain business activities stand out, including cell phone
charging, sale of cold drinks, grain milling and woodworking. Of course, lighting helps these and
many other businesses, including cafes, restaurants, and barber shops.

        Because of the short time that the villages and towns have had electricity, few businesses
are engaged in manufacturing, and they are small in scale. This pattern is similar to that of many
other developing countries; that is, with development, many villages and towns begin specializing
in agricultural production, while others become growth centers with commercial services that cater
to the surrounding villages. Nevertheless, the survey revealed some interesting examples of
businesses using electricity for manufacturing applications, including woodworking and
metalworking.

Cell Phone Charging
Information and communication technologies, including cell phones, have made considerable
inroads in rural Ethiopia. The impact evaluation survey indicates that cell phone ownership had
reached 1.4 cell phones per household. Before village and town electrification, all cell phone
charging in the five GPOBA study regions had to be done in the nearest town with electricity,
usually located about 10–20 km away. After electrification, mobile phone charging constituted a
major business opportunity. For example, in Ura village, a general retail shop established after
village electrification recognized the business opportunity to charge cell phones for households
that had not yet connected to electricity service (figure 6.2). The shop charges about eight cell
phones per day for a fee of US$0.10 per two-hour charging session, equivalent to an additional
$25 in monthly income.

     This aspect of rural electrification requires more attention from the electricity authorities.

     Note: In the lower-left corner, a wooden board used for charging cell phones is visible among other goods sold in the
     village retail shop. The photo on the right shows multiple sockets affixed to this innovative charging board.


        The commercial electricity tariff is quite low, at US$0.04–0.06 per kWh, depending on
level of electricity use.15 This low rate, combined with the little energy required to charge mobile
phones, has made cell phone charging a profitable business. Of course, this business opportunity
will decline once greater numbers of households adopt electricity.

        In each surveyed village with electricity, an average of 13 shops provide cell-phone
charging service. Customers are those without electricity—including households with indirect
connections—from both the same village and nearby ones without service. Households with
indirect connections generally are not allowed to use electrical devices for services other than
household lighting. Therefore, once villages are provided with new electricity service, cell phone
charging can become a significant income stream for businesses and households with a sanctioned
meter.

Sale of Cold Drinks
Refrigeration and cooling of beverages became a significant business after a village was connected
to the grid system. Though some selling of beverages may have occurred before the use of
refrigerators, electricity has made it possible to expand the existing beverage market, as well as
offer new products (figure 6.3).

  The lowest tariff rate of US$0.02 per kWh is for households that use little electricity; for households that use higher
levels of electricity, the tariff rate is $0.04 –0.06 per kWh.

        One of the new products, locally known as jelati, is a frozen mixture of water, sugar, and
flavoring. Licked like an ice-cream cone, these flavored ice cubes are a favorite refreshment
among children. Jelati is usually sold to customers who visit a store; but one innovative shop
owner subcontracted children to sell his product throughout the village.

         According to one shop owner, market demand for beverages has grown by several times
since the arrival of electricity service in his village. He had been selling beverages before
electrification, but after purchasing a new refrigerator, sale of cold beverages increased
significantly. He further stated that customers prefer cold beverages, particularly during the hot
season. Also, electric lighting enables his shop to stay open for longer hours in the evening. He
plays music in his shop so that it is both convenient and entertaining for customers to purchase
their supplies or enjoy their cold beverages.

Grain Milling Service
The village FGDs identified electric grain milling as one of the most significant achievements of
village electrification (figure 6.4). The introduction of grain milling service benefited women’s
lives in important ways. In rural Ethiopia, women and girls are responsible for food processing
(i.e., from milling to cooking and serving food). Before village electrification, they had two
options for transforming grain into flour. One was to manually grind the grain themselves, and
the other was to transport it to the nearest diesel-run grinding mill. The latter option, often using
loaded donkeys as pack animals, involved drudgery and was time-consuming; also, diesel engines
for milling grain were about 30 percent more expensive than those using electricity.

    Note: Pictured on the left are women queuing up to have grain milled. The photo on the right demonstrates the use
    of the milling machine.


        In some rural villages without donkeys, women and girls even had to travel 15–20 km
carrying 20–30 kg of grain on their backs. According to villagers, the introduction of electricity-
driven mills has relieved village women and girls of the drudgery involved in transporting grain
for milling or milling it themselves. Also, there were health and safety risks associated with
traveling to grain milling services located in distant communities. The FGD participants believed
that having electric grain milling service in their villages saved them a considerable amount of
time and effort, which could be used for leisure, family welfare, and other productive activities.

Sawmilling and Woodworking
Wasgebeta, a newly electrified village in SNNPR, located about 20 km west of the zonal capital
of Hosaena, is rich in timber resources. Prior to having electricity service, all of Wasgebeta’s
timber was exported to Hosaena for processing and the manufacture of furniture, meaning that all
of the village’s inhabitants had to depend on Hosaena for their furniture. Once electricity arrived
in the village, several new businesses involving sawmilling and woodworking developed (figure
6.5).

        Additional businesses were developed in Wasgebeta after electricity. These included tea
rooms, local liquor shops, and restaurants. Some existing shops were improved and expanded,
giving the village a new face. An owner of a small sawmilling shop commented, “When electricity
came to our village, it did not come alone. Rather, it came along with all sorts of opportunities, of
which I grabbed one.”

Complementary Electricity Services

In newly connected villages, electricity plays a vital role in catalyzing development. Beyond better
household lighting, electricity unlocks a range of new social and economic opportunities. This is
not to suggest that electricity is a panacea for all development problems facing a village. Realizing
new opportunities to the fullest extent possible requires more than just providing a village with
electricity. In rural Ethiopia, the GPOBA survey results confirm that complementary services are
quite important for enhancing the program’s impact.

       most in your village?”
       a. In this column, cells with n.a. = not applicable.


       When asked “What kind of problems in order of importance has the household had with
the connection in the last six months?,” the two main problems cited by electricity customers were
lack of street lighting and a place to purchase new appliances (table 6.5). Surprisingly, most
households did not cite power reliability as a significant issue. To a limited degree, households
were of the opinion that more electricians needed to be available in the villages. Such problems
should lessen once a community has had electricity for a number of years.

         Many important complementary support services could facilitate the benefits of electricity
for those that have recently been connected to the grid system. There is a need for local electricians
to help with electronics installation, indoor wiring, and maintenance and repair. Clearly,
households would like to have street lights for local safety and local appliance shops where new
appliances would be available for them to purchase as needed. These would include refrigerators,
satellite dishes, TV sets, commercial phone-charging equipment, equipment for barber shops and
hair dressing, and electric injera mitads.

         For business development, innovative financing mechanisms, such as those involving
microfinance institutions (MFIs), need to be promoted at the village level so that loans for working
capital can be extended for newly emerging businesses. The adequacy of power reliability, which
is also important for businesses, was not among the highest concerns of the EEPCo and GPOBA
communities. These and other services are necessary for businesses, but electricity is also

important for public institutions in the communities.                        This aspect of the impact of rural
electrification is examined in the next section.

Public Services and Institutions
Despite their bureaucratic slowness, public institutions—from schools and public health clinics to
agricultural offices and the postal service—perform critical tasks for society. The importance of
public institutions was clearly demonstrated in the five GPOBA study regions of rural Ethiopia.
In the 22 villages and towns with electricity, the number of public offices totaled 314, or about 14
per community. Religious institutions were the most numerous, comprising 24 percent or nearly
4 per village (table 6.6). Strictly speaking, these are not public institutions; however, they are
important for the community.

        The other public institutions were quite diverse, ranging from administrative offices and
police stations to potable water supply centers and schools. The regions covered also had farmer
training centers, teacher/extension agent residences, and health centers/clinics. The services
offered by these public institutions were diverse, ranging from peacekeeping to providing farmers
information for better agricultural production.

         Given the importance of electricity for enhancing the services provided by public
institutions,16 EEPCo’s district managers worked with the rural electrification project to ensure
that expansion of the national grid system took the location of public institutions into account.
Because public offices were included in rural electrification planning, more than half of the public
institutions and social services in the surveyed areas adopted electricity, either through an official
meter or an indirect connection from a nearby institution with power service.

        Even so, only about one-half of public institutions in the surveyed villages and towns have
adopted electricity, which is low compared to private businesses, more than four-fifths of which
have power service. The main reason for the low rate of electrification among public institutions
in rural areas is a lack of finances to cover connection costs and electricity expenses. Unlike rural
businesses, public institutions are not rewarded for their additional productivity due to electricity
because most public services are free of charge. For private businesses, electricity increases
income and thus makes electricity affordable. By contrast, public institutions must get by on the
same amount of public subsidy whether or not they decide to have electricity.

        Electrification rates for public institutions varied widely between study regions, as well as
between sites within regions. The highest rates were found in Amhara (82 percent) and Tigray (77
percent), followed by BSG (44 percent), Oromia (38 percent), and SNNPR (34 percent) (figure
6.6). Even higher variations in adoption rates were observed within regions. Serawat and Shebta
villages had 100 percent adoption rates, while Gamera and Kuen had rates of only 55 percent and
30 percent, respectively. The lowest rates of electrification, at less than 24 percent, were observed
in Lalisa Yesus, Bertasami, Gogeti, and Aroji Serdo villages.

  For example, electricity in health centers allows for the preservation of vaccines and other medicines. In schools,
electricity provides better-quality lighting and powers appliances used for educational instruction.

        At present, the majority of public institutions and social service facilities are using
electricity mainly for lighting. However, electricity could bring a whole gamut of services to
villages beyond lighting, such as powering medical equipment, refrigeration, communication
devices, equipment for vocational education and training (VET) instruction, and street lighting.

        The Bambasi Health Station in the BSG region is among the few public institutions in the
surveyed villages and towns that have started using electricity for more than just lighting. There
electricity is not only being used to refrigerate medicine; it is also provides an array of other
important services, including powering basic medical equipment (e.g., microscopes, sterilizers,
and various small-scale laboratory equipment) (figure 6.7).
                                                                                    77
        After Bambasi village was provided with electricity service, the health facility was able to
provide a higher level of services, including desperately needed maternity care. According to
Bambasi Health Station staff, the new electricity service not only brought the community better-
quality health services. It also meant that people with serious illnesses would not have to travel
far (45 km) to reach more qualified health facilities, as they had done in the past.

         One should recall that this survey was completed only about two-three years after
communities had first been provided with electricity service. As previously mentioned, it takes a
longer period of time for the impact of electricity to fully mature. Now that the basic electricity
infrastructure is in place, socioeconomic impacts will expand over time. In the coming years,
public institutions will adopt more electricity devices, including telecommunications equipment
and computers. At this point, it is important to provide complementary services for the rural
electrification program. Development is an incremental process, but the possibilities of
development are enhanced by the provision of new electricity service to rural villages and towns.

        The burden of paying for electricity used for public services should not fall on the power
company. Rather, the government is responsible for electricity service and should treat it like any
other budget item. It should provide the public institutions financing for adopting electricity; this,
in turn, will result in the utility company having a more attractive revenue stream from the
community, enabling it to provide better overall electricity service.

Conclusion
This chapter has shown that the benefits of electrification for the development of household
businesses, private companies, and public institutions are pervasive in rural Ethiopia. As a result
of having electricity, households engage in home-based production and sometimes even add on to
their homes to sell groceries or other retail goods. Existing small businesses immediately adopt
electricity, which permits them to stay open for longer hours and display their goods in an attractive
manner. Some even buy additional appliances (e.g., refrigerators and cooking devices) to better
serve their customers. Businesses are also established because of new opportunities created by the
availability of electricity in villages and towns. Most rural businesses are small in scale, but they
provide a wider range of community services and generate income for their owners.

        Many public institutions in the surveyed villages and towns have adopted electricity to
improve their services for the community. Unfortunately, about half of them still cannot afford
electricity due to the expense. This is an issue that might be addressed by local governments as
they gain more experience with having electricity in their towns and villages. To conclude,
electricity not only has significant social impacts for households; it also plays an important role in
the economic development of communities.

 7. Policies to Improve Ethiopia’s Rural
         Electrification Program

The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) component of the World Bank–sponsored
Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project (Phase 2) has been extremely important for providing
poor and lower-middle-income households in rural Ethiopia incentives for adopting electricity.
The GPOBA program accomplished this by allowing households to pay off connection charges
over a five-year period. GPOBA program grants covered the interest on those loans so that
households only had to pay the loan principal, arranged through EEPCO, the national power utility.
When participant households were asked why they might recommend the program to others, most
cited lower cost and saving money as important benefits. One family indicated it could save money
by having electric lights and avoiding kerosene expenses. Another indicated that being able to pay
over time would help them use money for other purposes. They also believed they could enjoy
the benefits of electricity like “those that are rich.” Most of the negative comments about the
program centered on problems attributed to EEPCo electricity distribution. These included
intermittent power supply, unavailability of meters for those applying for a connection, and
infrequent electricity bills.

        The goal of the GPOBA intervention was to make the benefits of rural electrification
available to a much larger proportion of Ethiopia’s rural population than was being reached by
EEPCo through the national grid rollout program. Under this regular expansion program, the
connection charge was unaffordable for most poor and lower-middle-income households, many of
whom faced prohibitive requirements for housing materials and bureaucratic hassles, which may
have discouraged them from obtaining service. As a result, many households indirectly adopted
electricity from a neighbor with a sanctioned meter. Others simply did not adopt electricity. The
consumer survey revealed that people in rural areas are quite willing to pay for electricity, even at
higher unofficial rates paid to their neighbors. Unfortunately, in villages with electricity, many
barriers still block poorer households’ ability to obtain a connection.

       It should be kept in mind that, while connection rate programs are quite important, they are
only one part of an overall sector strategy to promote rural electrification (Barnes 2007). The
success of rural electrification also depends on other important sector issues, which cannot be
                                                 79
ignored. These might include having a dedicated institution or division of the electricity company
implement rural electrification programs. In Ethiopia’s case, the rural electrification program is
implemented more generally by EEPCo as a state-owned enterprise. Under the Universal
Electricity Access Program implemented by EEPCo, the Ethiopian government financed 80
percent of connection costs, with the remainder funded by EEPCo. Other issues include
appropriate pricing policies and financial incentives for the electricity company to service rural
customers. Community support, proper planning, promoting productive uses of electricity, and
having lower-cost system designs are also vital for a rural electrification program to thrive.

        This chapter examines the impact of the GPOBA intervention on electricity connection
rates in rural Ethiopia and the socioeconomic benefits that resulted from rural households having
electricity. Also, it recommends policies that can result in higher connection rates for those living
in villages with electricity, as well as higher welfare impacts for households that adopt electricity.
Before turning to these issues, the next section highlights the project’s major achievements and
challenges.

GPOBA Program Achievements and Challenges
Generally, the GPOBA program can be considered a success. Participant households were quite
appreciative that they could spread their initial payments out over time. Some families even
indicated that, by not having to spend cash upfront for a household connection, they were able to
purchase new appliances. It is expected that such purchases, over time, will increase the welfare
benefits of having electrification for rural households.

        The GPOBA scheme achieved high numbers of total connections. The GPOBA program
was quite successful, given the challenging sector context in which the utility operated. During
the short time it was active (2011–13), the program dispensed financing of connections through
EEPCo. In the surveyed areas, the share of GPOBA households reached nearly four-fifths of all
EEPCo connections, amounting to about two-fifths of all households in those communities.17
Beyond the GPOBA connection intervention, much work is needed to ensure universal adoption
of electricity once a village or town has power service. As the surveys revealed, there is pent-up
demand for having a metered connection owing to a meter shortage, which has curtailed the ability
of many households to officially adopt electricity service.

       GPOBA subsidies were well directed. During the first 18 months after a village or town
received electricity service—when many of the better-off households adopted electricity—
GPOBA financing was not available. Delaying its availability allowed many more poor and lower-

     One should also note that including indirect household connections would significantly increase these figures.
                                                           80
middle-income households to take advantage of the interest-rate subsidy for loans, which allowed
them to spread out connection charges over five years.

        Program effectiveness varied widely by region. In Oromia, more than two-thirds of
households adopted electricity, compared to less than one-tenth in Amhara. Altogether, nearly
100,000 households—close to half a million people—adopted electricity under the GPOBA
program. About one-half of these were households with indirect connections, many of which
lacked concrete houses and are among the poorest people in these rural areas. For officially
metered connections during the 2011–13 period, three-quarters of the 57,000 families provided
with electricity (43,000 families) took advantage of the GPOBA program.

       The GPOBA subsidy expanded electricity coverage. The GPOBA intervention helped
EEPCo to shift the focus of its regular grid expansion program toward poor households. The
increased participation of poor and lower-middle-income households was quite remarkable, given
the many program delays caused by EEPCo.

       As previously discussed, the original project objectives were not reached due to the 2007–
10 government moratorium on new connections, power supply problems, and a shortage of meters.
As mentioned, the latter problem was caused, in part, by using a sole-source local contractor that
could not deliver on time. In addition, the surveyed households indicated that EEPCo offices often
did not provide bills on time. Some households feared having to pay large estimated bills after
months of not having received a proper bill.

        Many households have taken indirect connections from their neighbors. The biggest
surprise from the surveys and focus group discussions (FGDs) was that many households were
taking an indirect (metered) connection from their neighbors since, for safety reasons, EEPCo’s
policy did not allow houses made of substandard, non-concrete materials to obtain a connection.
The indirect household connections were not electricity theft because the electricity ran through
another household’s electricity meter. The problems were that households paid a higher monthly
price for electricity than metered households and much of the wiring was poorly done and, in some
cases, dangerous.

        The CFL program requires modification. The goal of the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL)
program within the GPOBA project was a good one. CFLs use less electricity for lighting than
traditional incandescent lamps, which can make lighting more affordable for poor rural
households. According to the survey, however, many customers were dissatisfied with the CFLs
due to low voltage levels, which, in some cases, prevented the CFLs from even starting up; thus,
no light was provided. Such problems could be solved by using an electronic ballast that corrects
for voltage fluctuations; though somewhat more expensive, this option might be considered for
future programs. Moreover, if internal wiring and lighting components are included in subsidy
programs, an effective information campaign should be carried out.

                                               81
         Electricity-sector problems reduced the impact of the GPOBA scheme. One of the greatest
challenges for the GPOBA program was caused by Ethiopia’s power situation. Just as the
Electricity Access Rural Expansion Project (Phase 2) was beginning, the Ethiopian government
directed EEPCo to halt all new connections due to a drought-related power shortage. As a result,
the GPOBA program and other World Bank–sponsored access projects were delayed for more than
two years. When the GPOBA program finally resumed in early 2011, priority was given to filling
the significant backlog of orders (about 0.5 million) for customers who paid the full connection
charges. Thus, EEPCo connections under the GPOBA grant were not started until June 2011.

        The monitoring and verification (M&V) and impact evaluation surveys indicated that
information about the GPOBA project flowed poorly to EEPCO’s field offices. Local EEPCo
offices often lacked even basic knowledge about the program. In some cases, households that had
already applied for an EEPCo connection later switched to applying through the GPOBA program,
perceiving that the implementation process would be faster. This suggests that some better-off
households, frustrated with the slow speed of EEPCo, tried to qualify for the loan, more for the
purpose of obtaining a faster, rather than a more affordable, connection.

Impact of Electricity on Rural Households
This study found that the impact of electricity on Ethiopia’s rural areas is similar to that found in
many other developing countries (Barnes 2014). After adopting electricity, households enjoyed
better lighting. Households that adopted electricity used more appliances, watched television, and
worked and socialized more in the evening. In contrast, households without electricity tended to
listen to battery-powered radios, participate less in family discussions, and generally go to sleep
early. Schoolgoing children in households that adopted electricity changed their study location
from outdoors to indoors and studied for longer periods of time. The impact of electricity was also
quite extensive for rural businesses. Contrary to conventional thinking that electricity must be
used in machines and power tools to provide productive-use benefits, this study confirmed that
business lighting is an often unheralded productive use of electricity. The impact of rural
electrification was quite similar for GPOBA-participant households and those connected through
EEPCo’s regular expansion program.

        Electricity adoption improves household lighting. The adoption of electricity for
household lighting drastically reduced households’ use of kerosene lamps. Households that
adopted electricity kept some kerosene lamps as a mobile form of lighting and as a backup lighting
source, along with candles. Interestingly, kerosene use did not decline in the rural Ethiopian homes
with electricity, probably because it was being used more as a cooking fuel in the evening. Some
households in the survey believed they had reduced their lighting costs after adopting electricity.
Besides improving reading and socializing possibilities, electric lighting may make it possible to
prepare meals in the evening. Some better-off households in the survey region adopted electric

                                                 82
injera mitads, which are convenient for preparing traditional bread. All of these factors might
mean a reduction in wood and charcoal used for cooking.

        Women benefited from electricity. In many households, women used lighting during the
evening hours to produce crafts that they could sell for extra income. Most communities had a
grain mill, which was considered quite important for women. Instead of grinding grain by hand,
women could now bring it to an electric-powered mill, where it would be processed into flour.
This saved the women a significant amount of time in food preparation. Also, electricity improved
community health services that were particularly important for women and kept them from having
to travel long distances for health checkups, especially during pregnancy. In addition, some
women were able to help their children study in the evening.

        Better household lighting improved children’s education. Evidence from the surveys and
FGDs indicated that having better-quality lighting in the home means that children can study
longer during evening hours. Without electricity, most study time for both boys and girls was
outdoors or by the dim light of a kerosene lamp. Based on recall questions, households that
adopted electricity indicated that, compared to the earlier time without electricity, children’s study
location moved from outdoors to indoors and their study time increased by about an hour per night
(table 5.7). The time elapsed since receiving electricity was just one or two years; thus, households
could accurately recall conditions before they adopted electricity. This additional study time might
well impact these children’s educational performance, making it less likely that they drop out of
school (Khandker, Barnes, and Samad 2012a, 2012b, 2013).

       Mobile phone charging at home saved time. Many people in developing countries now
own mobile phones, and rural residents in Ethiopia are no exception. Before adopting electricity,
households had to take their cell phones to charging stations often located miles away from their
homes. After adopting electricity, the phones could be charged at home, which eliminated travel
time and expense. Households that had not yet adopted electricity also benefited from having a
nearby neighbor or store that could charge their phones (figure 6.2).

        Televisions and radios improved communication and entertainment. Television sets were
purchased by about 4 out of 10 households with electricity. Watching television became a main
activity during evening hours. TV provides news and entertainment for rural people, integrating
them into the nation and even the world. In areas without electricity, the expense of batteries to
power televisions was prohibitive. After a community had electricity, television became an
inexpensive form of entertainment. In comparison to televisions, the number of plug-in radios
increased significantly in rural households, but listening to them increased only slightly, perhaps
because of the increase in television viewership. Also, households with electricity adopted
numerous plug-in radios, which reduced their battery expenses.



                                                 83
        Rural businesses improved services due to electricity. Nearly all existing rural businesses
adopted electricity once it became available in the community. Lighting was the main benefit,
with only a few businesses using electricity for food preparation, cooking, and refrigeration.
Businesses used electric lighting for a variety of purposes, including displaying merchandise,
lighting premises, and illuminating signs. With electric lights, businesses could stay open longer
during the evening hours.

        The impact of rural electrification was quite similar for GPOBA-participant and EEPCo
households adopting electricity. The main difference between a GPOBA and EEPCo connection
was that the GPOBA connection was paid for over time rather than upfront at the time of
connection (the GPOBA households also received two free CFLs). Once a household adopted
electricity, it was serviced by EEPCo. Thus, most changes in household behavior due to electricity
were the same, regardless of whether service was adopted through EEPCo or the GPOBA program.

         However, the GPOBA program had a higher welfare impact than the EEPCo program
because it reached more households and accelerated appliance adoption. Many households that
took advantage of the five-year connection loan under the GPOBA scheme would not otherwise
have been able to adopt electricity service. Thus, in villages with new electricity service, the
GPOBA program accelerated the rate of electricity adoption. Nearly 100,000 households,
including 40,000 official and 60,000 indirect connections, were able to enjoy the benefits of rural
electrification sooner rather than later. Finally, the FGDs and impact evaluation suggest that, due
to spreading out connection costs over time, GPOBA households did not have to defer the purchase
of electric appliances due to cash shortages. This, in turn, would deepen the impact of
electrification in rural Ethiopia.

Policies to Improve Connection Rates and Impact
One paradox of rural electrification is that high rates of electricity adoption, along with good
pricing policies, are necessary to make programs financially sustainable over the long term. A
general rule of thumb on subsidies is to have cost-covering fees that are fair to both customers and
the electricity company and to provide financial assistance to new customers desiring to adopt
electricity. This can be done through providing loans for disbursement of subsidies for household
connection costs or recovery of connection charges through tariffs. Lowering the upfront cost for
customers will free up customer cash to purchase appliances, which means a higher level of
benefits for the connecting households and a better revenue stream for the electricity company
resulting from higher electricity use.

        This means that high adoption rates result in better prospects for the financial viability of
the electricity companies. The converse is also true. Programs with low initial adoption rates,
typical of those found in Sub-Saharan Africa, make it much harder for the electric utility to have
the necessary revenue to maintain lines and provide quality service. Thus, it is in the financial
                                                 84
interest of the utility companies to strive for high electricity adoption rates and encourage the
purchase of appliances by households in rural areas.

        In Ethiopia, the rural electrification program is still in its initial stages. The monitoring
and verification (M&V) and impact evaluation surveys identified key policy issues to encourage
greater adoption of electricity and better overall policies for the rural electrification program.

Recommended Policies

Raise the overall price of electricity to reflect the cost of service after taking into account any
capital cost subsidies for extending service to rural areas. Also, incorporate other best practices
into the distribution sector to promote rural electrification. Ethiopia’s low electricity prices cause
problems for rural electrification as a business. The electricity price for rural households is
extremely low, making it difficult for EEPCo to recover its costs. The price for those consuming
50 kW or less per month is about US$0.02 per kWh. Even at the level of 400 kWh, the price of
electricity is only $0.03 per kWh. This means that the rural electrification program loses money
on every new customer. Consumers have little incentive to conserve electricity, and EEPCo has
little incentive to provide the necessary operation and maintenance for rural lines. In the future,
this will likely cause a decline in the quality of service.

        Have simple and effective mechanisms for targeting the poor. In this GPOBA program,
targeting was achieved by combining geographic criteria with self-selection methods. The
targeting was consistent with the Ethiopian government’s policy of providing equity and broad
geographical coverage for its rural electrification access program.

        Facilitate house wiring in both standard and substandard housing. One major issue
identified in this study was EEPCo’s policy of connecting only those homes made of concrete,
which frustrated many poorer households who were ineligible for electricity service. They, in turn,
decided to string wires to a neighboring house with a legitimate meter. Most of the problems
involving indirect household connections could be avoided by developing standard waterproof
ready boards for installation in houses constructed of substandard materials.

         Officially connect households with indirect electricity connections. Ethiopia’s
electrification rates could be higher if more attention were paid to finding ways to service poor
households. Switching from indirect to officially metered connections would mean lower
electricity prices for such households; in turn, they would consume and pay for more electricity,
which might help to improve the utility’s financial condition.

       Provide credit, encourage appliance adoption, and promote intersectoral synergies. The
GPOBA scheme could probably be extended beyond wires. Given the expense of putting up poles
and transformers and stringing wires, the investment could be optimized by implementing
complementary programs that encourage greater use of electricity. This might include ensuring
                                                 85
that electric appliances are available for local purchase. Also, many of the world’s most successful
rural electrification programs include close cooperation between ministries and agencies that
provide other types of development assistance, including education, agriculture, and rural
development. Promoting such intersectoral synergies would not only improve the impact of rural
electrification; it would also increase the financial benefits for EEPCo due to higher levels of
electricity use.

       Focus on women-headed households. In most countries, women-headed households are
generally among their poorest groups. In the five rural regions of Ethiopia covered by this study,
women-headed households comprised just over 15 percent of the population. These households
often cannot afford the upfront costs of electricity; at the same time, they are quite responsible
about paying their bills.

        The Power to the People program developed in Lao PDR, which is quite similar to the
GPOBA intervention in Ethiopia, had one key difference: It focused efforts on providing assistance
to women-headed households (World Bank 2008a, 2011a, 2013b). A key underlying concept was
to keep targeted households’ monthly expenditures—for both repayment of the interest-free credit
and electricity consumption—at the same level as their expenditures before grid electrification for
vastly inferior traditional energy (e.g., batteries, diesel lamps, and candles). It was projected that
the monthly savings in household energy expenditure would be enough to allow households to
repay the connection cost in three years. A similar gender-focused program for rural Ethiopia
could be integrated into EEPCo’s standard operating procedures.

       Make meters more readily available to prevent delays in providing customers with service.
The survey found that a shortage of electricity meters had led to delays in signing up new
customers. This issue could be easily resolved by diversifying the sourcing of meter supplies and
allowing them to be imported. Inexpensive and reliable meters are readily available from other
countries.

        Decentralize and lower the cost of bill collection. Generally, the best practice is to have
the electricity company develop low-cost ways to collect bills. This might include making
payments possible at local banks or public institutions or through local contacts in the community,
such as village leaders; one advantage of the latter option is that village leaders could serve as a
contact point between EEPCo and the community for reporting power outages and other
distribution problems. More technical options might include the use of load limiters or prepaid
meters.

       Provide better-quality CFLs or other, more efficient lighting options. The two free CFLs
provided under the GPOBA program were not fully appreciated by the GPOBA-participant
households. According to the survey and FGDs, the CFLs provided did not work well under the
low-voltage conditions found in most villages and towns. Future programs need to include lighting

                                                 86
options that function well under periodic low-voltage conditions. Providing more efficient lighting
options, such as better-quality CFLs or light-emitting diodes (LEDs), would not only be important
for households newly adopting electricity; this could also be part of a broader campaign to promote
energy-efficient appliances in rural Ethiopia.

         Provide technical assistance and loans for businesses. Many successful rural
electrification programs encourage business development by providing new business loans and
assistance on how to set up businesses that can take advantage of electricity. This can be done
through raising awareness of the possible productive uses of electricity, facilitating credit for small
businesses, providing technical assistance on the requirements of running small businesses, and
making sure that appliances or tools common to small businesses are available in the community
(Brüderle, Attigah, and Bodenbender 2011; Finucane et al. 2012). Households in rural Ethiopia
seemed eager to start a new business. According to the impact evaluation survey, they had many
new business ideas, ranging from retail shops to beauty salons and cafes. In addition, assistance
could be given to promote electricity-driven appliances that would make life easier for people in
rural areas. In some countries, promoting the availability of electric appliances accompanies the
extension of electricity to new rural communities. Such complementary programs would increase
the utility’s revenue stream and have a greater socioeconomic impact in rural communities.

        Connect public institutions. Only about half of the public institutions in the villages and
towns with new service have adopted electricity. Once a community has electricity, additional
funds should be provided for government-financed public institutions to adopt electricity. Public
services are generally important for the whole community, especially the poor. With better
lighting and communication and office equipment, such public institutions with electricity should
be better able to serve rural populations. However, the responsibility of subsidizing the electricity
used by public institutions should not be placed on the electric utility company. Rather, the
government should consider it as a normal budget cost of providing public services. The electricity
used by the public institutions can provide the utility a stable source of revenue for serving rural
areas.

Meeting the Challenge of Implementation

To deal with the challenges of rural electrification, it might be necessary to set up a specialized
institution within the power company (Barnes 2007). The best electricity programs around the
work have dealt with the issues involved in rural electrification by setting up specialized
institutions either within or external to the main utility. Successful programs have also featured a
firm government commitment to the program, along with a clear plan for system expansion that
avoids political influence (Barns 2011). In addition, for most successful programs, the
electrification rate was high enough to allow the distribution companies to obtain revenue for
system expansion by pursuing customers rather than government subsidies. Furthermore, many
traditional distribution companies have adopted single-phase and other low-cost distribution
                                                  87
methods. If geography permits, single wire earth return (SWER) systems can drastically reduce
distribution costs. They also lower the initial barriers to adopting electricity and stress community
involvement early in the program.

         To summarize, with better electricity pricing policies, combined with policies to ease both
connection and house-wiring expenses, the number of people in villages and towns with new
service would expand significantly. This would also mean that the utility would gain significant
revenue streams from rural electrification. This, in turn, would allow for greater investments in
customer service and sufficient investments in operation and maintenance of rural systems to avoid
many of the problems caused by power outages. Rural customers would then perceive themselves
as valued customers and, over time, would invest in more appliances. By implementing these
innovations together, Ethiopia would be taking important steps to solve its challenges of rural
electrification.

Conclusion
The impact of household electricity adoption in rural Ethiopia is extremely high and remarkably
similar to that of programs elsewhere in the developing world in the initial stages of promoting
rural electrification. In Ethiopia, rural businesses adopt electricity immediately after electricity
arrives in their village or town. With electric lighting, schoolgoing children can study in the safety
of their homes in the evening, which no doubt results in better classroom performance. Also,
household members can socialize and participate in family discussions during evening hours. With
an electric grain-processing mill in the village, women are spared time-consuming drudgery. Also,
cell phones can be charged locally rather than miles from home. In addition, households that
purchase televisions have access to inexpensive news and entertainment. The main problem for
Ethiopia, like most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, is that it lags in the process of extending
electricity to its rural people.

         Even with these substantial gains, the development impact of Ethiopia’s rural
electrification program could be much greater. One main area in need of attention involves raising
the extremely low price of electricity and planning the system rollout to include communities with
the highest potential for electricity growth. Another main area to address is ensuring that the
electricity provided to rural towns and villages has the highest possible impact for rural
households. This means cooperating with other rural development agencies through coordination
of complementary programs and promoting credit and technical assistance to raise the level of
program impact. Addressing these areas will ensure that the utility has a higher revenue stream
and therefore incentive to provide customers better service and connect more rural households. It
will also ensure that the program has a higher level of socioeconomic impact for Ethiopia.

        The GPOBA program played a vital role in accelerating rural households’ access to these
benefits of electrification. The connection rates of villages participating in the GPOBA program
                                                 88
were higher than those under EEPCo’s regular connection program. Despite the intervention’s
success, obstacles remain in achieving rural electrification rates typical of other countries in the
developing world. According to the impact evaluation survey, the main reasons people have not
yet adopted electricity include frequent power outages, lack of local regional offices or businesses
for bill paying, infrequency of receiving consumer electric bills, lack of an adequate meter supply
to connect those applying for service, and EEPCo’s policy of not connecting non-concrete houses.
Finally, there were delays in EEPCo program implementation resulting from problems faced by
the electricity sector in bringing new generation online.

         Connection-rate programs are an important component of strategies for rural
electrification. However, they are not a panacea for all that ails the power companies in Sub-
Saharan Africa. In addition to low-connection costs, the success of rural electrification depends
on a deep institutional commitment by the government and electricity companies to provide service
to the poor. The electric utilities need to have appropriate pricing and financial incentives to
properly serve rural areas. Low-cost system designs for rural areas and sound planning for the
grid system rollout are important for keeping rural electricity prices low. It is also important to
gain community support for rural electrification. Strategies to achieve this would include low
levels of system outages, timely and good billing practices that make certain bills are easy to
understand and pay. Complementary programs to encourage greater use of electricity would
include providing credit for new businesses and incentives for households to adopt efficient
electric appliances. In short, output-based aid (OBA) and other programs designed to lower
connection costs are an important component of an overall rural electrification strategy.

        Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have rural electrification rates that remain quite low.
The reasons for these low-connection rates vary by country. In many, the power companies have
not yet grappled with the need to have a dedicated team in place and a strategy that differs from
those used in more densely populated urban areas, which today account for their main electricity
customers. The emphasis on lowering connection costs is a good start for demonstrating that
people desire and will adopt electricity with the appropriate incentives. This, in turn, will have
large benefits for the country well above the investment cost of the electricity companies.

         The Ethiopia GPOBA program was an important first step in focusing the state electricity
company on providing service to some of the country’s poorest regions; but certainly it is not the
last step. Providing electricity to rural areas is a long-term investment. The future of rural
electrification in Ethiopia depends on the ability of the government and the power company to
make a serious commitment to adopting the principles of successful programs and working
together to provide electricity for all of Ethiopia’s people. Tackling the problems encountered will
not be an easy task. It is imperative that the solutions identified do not harm the electricity
company and that it be given appropriate incentives to serve rural areas. Once this is accomplished,
the electricity provided to rural areas will have a high level of benefits for Ethiopia.

    Annex 1. Programs to Lower
Connection Costs in Sub-Saharan Africa

There is little doubt that having reasonable charges for obtaining access to electricity, combined
with consumption tariffs that allow the utility to recover its costs, is a worthwhile endeavor.
Financing options to make household connections affordable, combined with low-cost
electrification technologies and effective procurement practices that help to reduce the cost of
connection service, are prerequisites for accelerating access expansion. Scaling up electricity
access also requires strong political support and specialized institutions.

       Sub-Saharan Africa has many available options for helping to make connection charges
affordable to consumers. Choosing the best one will depend on the specific conditions found in
individual countries. Over the past decade, some of the newer subsidy programs have been based
on output-based aid (OBA) and results-based financing (RBF), meaning that subsidy payments are
disbursed based on pre-agreed and independently verified outputs, such as functional household
connections, billing cycles, and distribution of energy-efficient lights, such as compact fluorescent
lamps (CFLs).

        In Senegal, for example, the Rural Electrification Priority Program aims to increase new
customer connections by providing OBA subsidies to private electricity concessionaires that agree
to finance the related investment. The subsidies target poor and remote communities within the
concession area (de Gouvello and Kumar 2007). In those communities, the average cost of
providing a connection, inclusive of upstream network development, is estimated at US$725, and
the average subsidy provided to competitively selected private operators is $286 per connection.
The difference, accounting for 60 percent of the project costs, is borne by the private operator.
Office National de l’Electricite, one of the selected concessionaires, is committed to increasing
both the overall number of connections and the proportion of connections using renewable energy.
The private operator recovers the capital costs of connection, internal wiring, and CFLs through a
monthly bill, which, by removing the barrier of high upfront charges, is expected to make
electricity adoption more affordable to poor households (Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013).


                                                 91
        The connection charge is recovered in the customer’s electricity bill over a period of 120
months, at 15 percent interest. The private operator is obligated to complete the internal
installations for the first three customer-service levels. For the fourth level of customer service,
this rule is optional. Customers must pay an affordable sum of money upfront before being
connected. This sum can be paid at once or in three installments. Because of the installment
option, customers’ monthly bills may have two components: energy consumption costs and
monthly repayment of the initial connection charge.

         In Liberia, Kenya, and Uganda, the World Bank is implementing Global Partnership on
Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) grants to reduce the burden of connection charges by encouraging
utilities to connect poor people who otherwise could not afford the full cost of a grid connection.
In Monrovia, the program subsidizes part of the overall cost of US$950 for providing a connection
(inclusive of upstream development). In the slums of Kenya, a subsidy is provided to lower the
$300 connection charge. Subsidy disbursement schemes vary by country, but all are linked to
verified household connections; that is, the subsidy is disbursed only after a certain number of
households have obtained connections. Though in the early stages of development, such initiatives
bode well for the future of electrification in Sub-Saharan Africa.

        Côte d’Ivoire has set up a revolving fund that allows customers to finance 90 percent of
their connection charges with interest-free loans over a maximum period of two years (World Bank
2009a). In Botswana, the government offers rural customers loans for 95 percent of the utility’s
standard connection charge (US$615).18 The loan is payable over 15 years at the prime interest
rate. Connection and installation services include smart meters with prepayment cards for
electricity consumption. The high connection charge in Botswana reflects high costs that could
probably be reduced by using lower-cost system designs. Meanwhile, offering loans to help new
customers pay for connection charges is a step in the right direction. Some subsidies to the interest
rate may be justified.

        In Kenya, several financing schemes offered by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company
(KPLC) are helping to expand access and ensure the utility’s financial viability (World Bank
2010b). Under one program, the KPLC has initiated a partnership with Equity Bank to offer
“Stima” loans for connection charges to all customers living within 600 m of a transformer.
Customers pay 30 percent of the charge upfront, with the balance payable over three years at an
annual interest rate of 15 percent. Under the Rural Electrification Deferred Payment Plan, financed
by the Ministry of Energy, customers pay 30 percent of the connection charge upfront and the
balance over 10 months. A third program, based on a revolving fund and administered by the
KPLC, is open to all customers and requires a 20 percent upfront payment, with the balance due



18
  This is the Botswana Power Corporation’s standard connection cost for customers within 500 m of transformer
coverage.
                                                     92
over one or two years. A 2 percent administration fee is charged on the 80 percent balance.
Finally, for customers living outside a 600 m radius of a distribution point, the KPLC offers a
group program called Umeme Pamoja. This program enables people otherwise ineligible for
individual connections (except at a great cost) to finance the transformer and low-voltage network.
The cost of extending power to such households is divided equally among the affected customers,
making it more affordable overall.19

       In South Africa, the government considers electrification a social service. Typically, the
South African government provides capital subsidies for electrification directly from the national
budget (Dinkelman 2011). Customers have also been asked to make modest financial
contributions. A program in Cape Town allows households that cannot afford to pay the US$24
connection charge as a lump sum to discharge it over time on prepaid meters, through which
customers pay for the electricity they use. For each dollar of electricity used, the customer pays
an additional $0.14 until the connection charge is paid in full (AEI 2009).

       In Zambia, the power utility benefits from a World Bank–funded program to reduce
connection charges (World Bank 2008b). Under the project, a government subsidy of about
US$120 covers 75 percent of the cost of a basic household connection. The utility receives the
subsidy in the form of materials and equipment used to connect a certain number of low-income
households. In the initiative’s pilot areas, the number of households requesting a connection
doubled from the previous volume of requests.

         Experience in Ghana shows that low connection charges encourage local populations to
participate in rural electrification (EUEI-PDF 2008). Only about 23 percent of Ghana’s rural
population has electricity. Even so, the country has one of the subcontinent’s highest rates of rural
electrification, and is set to make even further progress. In 1989, the government launched the
National Electrification Scheme (NES), whose goal has been to connect all communities of more
than 500 people to the national grid by 2020. External funding has been provided by a consortium
of institutional and bilateral donors under the auspices of the World Bank.

        Complementing the NES is the Self-Help Electrification Programme, a rolling (three-to-
five year) electrification program. Under this program, communities not scheduled for immediate
connection to the national grid, located within 20 km of an existing medium-tension electricity
line, help the electricity operator lower its cost by erecting low-voltage distribution poles and thus
ensuring that at least 30 percent of households in the community are wired and ready to be serviced
as soon as the electricity supply becomes available. The community accomplishes this work
through a village electrification committee, responsible for mobilizing funds, establishing rights-
of-way, and helping people to wire their homes. In 2000, a plan was devised to provide credit for


19
  These programs cover the connection charge, plus the cost of extending the system to supply the affected group of
consumers.
                                                        93
productive and income-generating uses of electricity. More recently, this credit facility has been
used to help pay for household wiring.

         Rwanda shows how a capital subsidy policy, combined with low-cost electrification
technologies and improved procurement practices, can be translated into significant access results
(World Bank 2009b, 2013c). The Rwanda Electricity Corporation (RECO) has been able to lower
its costs through bulk purchases of hardware for local installations, including bundled low-voltage
cables, distribution transformers, poles, prepayment meters, brackets, and other connection
materials. In addition, RECO has used less costly, but experienced, local labor for installation
services. Lower costs, combined with a capital subsidy, have allowed for a doubling of the number
of connected households in the targeted urban and periurban areas over the 2010–11 period. This
low-cost electrification project was the result of cooperation between RECO and the Tunisian
electricity company (Cecelski et al. 2005). Worldwide many successful programs have lowered
their electricity distribution costs by implementing low-cost strategies to service rural areas (World
Bank 2000a, 2000b, 2006; NRECA International 2000, 2011, 2012a, 2012b; Karhammar et al.
2006).

  Annex 2. Electricity Access and Study
              Methodology

Ethiopia’s low level of electrification meant that this study had to pay particular attention to the
methodology used to measure the impact of rural electrification. This was particularly important,
given the measurement challenges of assessing changes over the short two-year program period.
This annex describes the methodology used to assess the impact of the GPOBA intervention.

Overview
To measure the impact of electricity, this study relied on a mix of quantitative and qualitative
approaches (INTEGRATION Environment & Energy and MEGEN Power Ltd 2014). To monitor
progress on connecting households, an independent monitoring and verification (M&V) survey,
required for funds disbursement, was used to verify payments to households that adopted
electricity and installation of EEPCo connections. As part of this study component, baseline
surveys were conducted in November 2011, June 2012, and July–August 2013. The delay of the
baseline survey meant that examining changes over time would not be possible as part of the
analysis strategy. Therefore, in this report, more weight has been given to the impact evaluation
survey conducted after the project.

        Concurrent with the M&V survey, the study implemented a socioeconomic impact
evaluation to explore the impact of the GPOBA intervention on household connection rates,
particularly the affordability of connection costs. The evaluation study used several approaches.
For example, an impact evaluation survey, including a household questionnaire, was conducted at
project startup (2011) and after project completion (2013–14) (annex 3). This survey covered a
total of 760 households with and without electricity. While a larger sample (e.g., 2,000–3,000)
would have been more robust, the differences between households with and without electricity
were quite notable, even with the limited sample size. This formal statistical approach was
complemented by structured informant interviews with key village and EEPCo officials and focus
group discussions (FGDs) on project impact, with a focus on gender issues. Because of the
compressed timeline for completing the GPOBA program and the overlapping time frames

                                                95
between the baseline and impact evaluation surveys, the findings presented in this report are based
on the final cross-sectional impact evaluation survey.

Sample Stratification and Village Selection
The survey sample is highly stratified. Ethiopia’s overall rural electrification rate is only about 10
percent, compared to 60 percent for the sampled households. An explicit strategy of comparing
households with and without electricity was used to assess the differences between them. A
modified matched-pair sample design was used, meaning that households with and without
electricity were randomly selected within income groups so that there were similar numbers for
the overall survey and within distinct income classes (table A2.1). This approach eliminated much
of the bias that would have occurred using a random sample since higher income households adopt
electricity at a higher rate than lower income ones.20 The modified matched-pair sample design
made it possible to compare similar households with and without electricity. Also, the number of
households was rather low for conducting a formal impact evaluation survey.

        No doubt, significance tests for the variables would have indicated some type of positive
or negative association for those households with and without electricity. But given the sample
design, this approach might have been somewhat misleading due to stratification procedures that
became necessary during the sample selection. Therefore, the survey results are reported as
differences between groups of quite similar households with and without electricity. Since the
socioeconomic characteristics of the sampled households are comparable, the main difference


20
  If a random sample had been used, only 10 percent of households with electricity would have turned up in the
sample, making comparisons difficult due to the low number of sampled households.
                                                            96
between the two groups is that one has electricity and the other does not. Thus, the difference in
means, if any, is likely to result from rural electrification. Because of this random matched-pair
type of sample design, caution should be used in extending these results to rural Ethiopia.

Selection of Priority Districts and Villages

The selection of households started with the list of newly connected households, but was modified
according to on-the-ground realities. Based on the household lists received from EEPCo and
results of the M&V survey, the study team identified what it called EEPCo priority districts: those
districts with a high number of villages with electricity, defined as having at least 30 households
with electricity service.

        Within EEPCo priority districts, villages were selected after consulting with district offices,
confirming that the EEPCo lists in those districts were up-to-date. Villages were evaluated and
prioritized based on their proximity to the EEPCo office, road conditions, and minimum number
of new connections. Project M&V data was used to prepare the list of villages for selection for
the impact evaluation survey. Twenty-two villages were selected from this list, complemented by
the selection of two nearby villages without electricity, for a total of 24 villages.

Household Stratification and Selection

After villages were selected, households were chosen based on certain characteristics, grouped
into three electricity connection categories: (i) GPOBA households, (ii) EEPCo households, and
(iii) households without electricity. Households without electricity were selected from both
villages with electricity and nearby villages without electricity. One selection criterion was that
at least 10 households had to be chosen from each of the three electricity connection categories.
Within each category, the sample selection was based on such household criteria as presence of
adult household members, accessibility of the property, proximity of household location, and
economic diversity of households (rich, middle class, or poor). An attempt was made to ensure
that households within each strata were selected according to similar socioeconomic backgrounds;
however, this was not entirely possible in all villages.

Survey Instruments
The complementary survey activities yielded more consistent information for the impact
assessment. A village electricity market survey and gender impact assessment, along with the
household socioeconomic survey, were cross-validated. Village-level FGDs were held with
women, village elders, community leaders, kebele chairmen,21 teachers, and business people. Key
informant interviews were conducted with local politicians and officials in district-level electricity


21
     A kebele, similar to a ward, is the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia.
                                                              97
offices. The gender-centered FGDs each comprised 6–9 women of diverse ages, educational
backgrounds, occupations, and wealth status; these women represented both GPOBA and non-
GPOBA households with and without electricity.22

        The household survey activities received valuable assistance from EEPCo’s respective
regional offices in Addis Ababa and its district offices in the respective administrative regions and
zones. EEPCo district offices provided important local information about the location,
accessibility, and electrification status of villages within their respective jurisdictions. They also
provided local EEPCo technicians to accompany the field survey teams to the villages, which
greatly helped in identifying GPOBA households without influencing the selection of households
for interviews.

        As originally planned, the GPOBA program was to conduct a baseline survey to gather
information from the study group before project startup, with the first impact assessment to be
conducted 1–1.5 years later. However, because of the delay in program implementation, the first
baseline survey was carried out within months of project startup. The impact evaluation completed
at the end of the project allowed for a comparison of households that had gained 1–2 years of
experience using electricity. About 25,000 household connections out of a total of 40,000 were
completed between June 2011 and May 2012 under the GPOBA program. The impact evaluation
sample contained households that had electricity 1–3 years. Most of the earlier connections were
EEPCo-classified households, while a majority of the later ones were under the GPOBA program.

Sample Design
The sample frame for the assessment was based on lists from EEPCo, showing the total number
of newly connected households in the project area (a total of 21,792 households), covering both
GPOBA and non-GPOBA households. From these lists, the study sample of 760 households was
drawn, representing 24 villages and towns (including 2 control villages) from 14 administrative
zones in the 5 regions (table A2.2).23 Within each region, the sample group was stratified by
household type (whether electricity was provided under the GPOBA scheme or EEPCo’s normal
expansion program). The control groups included households without electricity in the selected
villages with electricity and households in nearby villages without electricity.




22
   GPOBA households receive loans for which the interest rate is paid through grants and the loan principal is repaid
by the participant households in monthly installments over time. GPOBA households also receive two free CFLs.
Non-GPOBA households are connected to the grid system through EEPCo’s normal practice. Both GPOBA and
EEPCo households are connected and serviced by EEPCo.

        During the M&V program phase, it was discovered that the lists provided by EEPCo were
not up-to-date. Some households, listed as newly connected, had no electricity connection; others
not listed were found to have an indirect connection (chapter 3). For the impact evaluation, this
meant that many households had to be reclassified, with some purposively selected based on their
household characteristics. For this reason, a random matched-pair sampling design (similar to
propensity-score matching), rather than a classic random sampling of households, was used.

        Because the M&V survey was conducted continuously over the compressed program
period, the impact evaluation survey team was able to prepare the sample frame based on that
information. The baseline and impact evaluation surveys were conducted too close together to
conduct a panel analysis; thus, the final impact evaluation survey comparing households with and
without electricity proved to be the best way to analyze the impact of rural electrification on
development. Within villages, an equal number of households from various socioeconomic strata
were randomly matched according to socioeconomic characteristics; thus, the comparison of
simple means was a valid measure of difference between the main household groups.24

Treatment of Indirect Connections
Through the M&V survey, it was discovered that many households had indirect electricity
connections (i.e., they used electricity passing through their neighbors’ officially sanctioned
meters) (chapter 3). However, there was no evidence of meter tampering. Households with
indirect connections paid neighboring households with metered connections a fixed monthly fee.
Thus, the electricity measured by the neighboring households’ meters accounted for both direct
and indirect household connections. The impact survey sample for the GPOBA and EEPCo
households included both direct and indirect connections. Because households with indirect

  Statistical inference has been avoided in this study in order to present the results in a way that is accessible to a
wider group of readers. Most of the comparisons between groups are simple differences in means.

connections comprised a significant number of households with electricity in the villages, the study
classified them as EEPCo or GPOBA connections (table A2.3).

Summing Up
The sampling procedure began by selecting districts with high concentrations of new electricity
connections under the GPOBA program. Next, villages were selected, based on their having a
sufficient number of households with electricity. Finally, households were selected from the
villages. The village samples were required to include 10 EEPCo connections, 10 GPOBA
connections, and 10 households without electricity. They were also stratified according to such
considerations as accessibility and social class. As mentioned, households with indirect
connections were considered either GPOBA or EEPCo connections, depending on the source of
the direct (metered) connection. In addition, two nearby villages without electricity controlled for
assessing the differences between households without electricity in villages that already had power
and those in villages without electricity service.
