THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Figure 1.5 How far has Myanmar come in the areas measured by Doing Business?

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

Myanmar is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Limited Liability Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and            Paid-in minimum capital requirement: MMK 0
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available          City: Yangon
information on business entry in that economy.
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,           Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

      The builder or representative must submit all the following in
      order to begin the application process for the construction
      permit:

      • Owner ID and family certificate
      • Application forms
      • Land title certificate from the YCDC Land Department
      • Cadastral map from the YCDC Land Department

      Once the application has gone through all the internal reviews at
      the YCDC, BuildCo is informed that the permit is ready and is
      provided with an invoice of how much is to be paid. The
      payment is either made at the YCDC Engineering (Building)
      Office directly or at the YCDC Bank for large amounts. About one
      week after the payment has been made, the construction permit

      * Receive an inspection from a YCDC technician

      A YCDC technician will visit the plot of land in order to check that
      it corresponds to the land certificate and designs provided and
      to check the conditions for water and electricity connections.
      While there, the technician also checks with neighbors to ensure
      there are no land disputes or other issues. The inspector will
      issue a report to the YCDC, and the builder will be informed
      when they can proceed with the permit application. Soil tests are       1 day        no charge

      only required by law for buildings 3 stories or higher or for large
      factories, though some builders prefer to perform the soil test,
      regardless of the building height. In such cases, the cost is MMK
      150,000 and it takes about 2 weeks. Similarly, seismic and
      environmental checks are not required for small warehouses.

        Request new connection at utility

        The application for a new electricity connection begins with the
        contractor paying a visit to the relevant township where the warehouse is
        located. At this stage, the desired load and type of equipment (air
        conditioning, machines) that will operate in the warehouse must be
        specified. The following documents must also be submitted:
        o Building completion certificate (BCC)
        o Business license or company registration certificate
        o NRC National Registration Card
        o Family certificate

        permit)
        o Electrical design
        o Capacity load expected

        After the inspection of the client's warehouse by the township, the
        application is internally distributed among the levels of government,
        from the township to the district, without the intervention of the
        applicant. There are 4 districts in Yangon, divided into 33 townships.
        Then the application is internally distributed from the district to the city
        level (Yangon Electricity Supply Board), without the interaction of the
        applicant.

      Once the application has received the approval of all levels – township
      and district – the contractor is informed and he/she can go back to the
      township office to pick up the invoice which will indicate the fees that
      need to be paid to the state in relation to the connection to the electrical
      grid. The payment of the administrative fees provided by the township is
      made at a designated state-owned bank.

      The township technician will inspect to see how far the warehouse is
      from the main transmission line, the posts, etc. A map of the necessary
2     connection works is made.                                                       1 calendar day        MMK 0

      Obtain meter installation by utility

      Upon completion of the connection works, the customer goes to YESB
      Township Office to fill up the application form for meter box installation,
      together with information on the size of transformer (160 kVA for our
      case study). The YESB Township Office will approve it and submit it to
      the YESB District Office, which in turn approves it and submit it to the
      YESB Head Office Testing and Supporting Unit. The Testing and
      Supporting Unit approves it, obtains a required meter box from YESB
      warehouse, and checks the functioning of the meter box. Then the YESB

      the customer often follows up to expedite i.e. the customer will take the
      form from YESB Township Office to District Office and again to Head
      Office Testing and Supporting Unit to get the necessary approvals; the
      customer will go to the YESB warehouse to get meter box and bring to
      the Testing and Supporting Unit for checks; the customer will then again
      bring the meter box back to the YESB District Office and Township Office
      for approval.

        Receive inspection of transformer by inspector from township

        Once the meter box is attached, the customer writes an application letter
        to the YESB Township Office to inform them that transformer is installed
        and attached to the meter box, together with a list of material used with
        details (e.g. size of 160 kVA, manufacturer of transformer) and photos
        (two-pole transformer). The inspector from YESB Township Office will
        make a site visit only at this stage (and this is a different team from the
        meter installation team in Procedure 4).
        The inspector will then produce a report to YESB Township Office and
   5    submit it to the YESB District Office for approval to discharge the         4 calendar days        MMK 0
        transformer (i.e. connectivity), which then submits to the YESB Head
        Office for approval. Upon the YESB Head Office’s approval, the District
        Office will issue a connection permit to the customer and commission to
        discharge the transformer. Five engineers must be present at the time of
        discharging: from the YESB District Office, YESB Head Office Testing and
        Supporting Unit, Test Lab, Distribution, and YESB Township Office.

        Ministry of Industry

        An engineer from the inspection office of the Ministry of Industry is also
        informed by the township and conducts an inspection of the connection
   6    works and internal wiring, mostly to check compliance with safety            7 calendar days       MMK 0

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes

consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
