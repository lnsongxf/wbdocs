2013 CPIA Results for Africa

Summary

u	The overall quality of policies and institutions in Sub-Saharan African countries held steady in 2013, with
     divergent performance across countries.
u	One-fifth of countries saw an improvement in their overall Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
     (CPIA) score, with several fragile countries strengthening their policy environment.
u	Not surprisingly, conflict and political instability weighed down on the policy and institutional
     environment in some countries. For the region as a whole, the overall CPIA score weakened in one-fifth of
     the countries, although there were far fewer countries with a decline in score in 2013 compared to 2012.
u	Fiscal policy slippage—resulting in depleted policy buffers and rising vulnerability to shocks—pulled CPIA
     scores down in several countries, and a weaker monetary policy stance in some countries lowered the
     regional CPIA score of this category. By contrast, improvements in trade policy in a few countries, mostly
     on trade restrictiveness, lifted the regional score of this component of CPIA.
u	The average overall CPIA score in Africa’s non-fragile countries is now similar to that of non-fragile
     countries elsewhere. But the gap between this region’s fragile countries and fragile countries in other
     regions persists.



Recent Trends and Analysis
The CPIA Africa report describes the progress African countries are making on strengthening the quality
of policies and institutions that underpin development. It presents Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) scores for the 39 African countries that are eligible for support from the International
Development Association (IDA), the concessional financing arm of The World Bank. The scores are an
indicator of the quality of these countries’ policy and institutional framework across 16 dimensions,
grouped into four clusters: economic management (Cluster A), structural policies (Cluster B), policies for
social inclusion and equity (Cluster C), and public sector management and institutions (Cluster D). The
scores, which are on a scale of 1–6, with 6 being the highest, are calculated by World Bank staff and are
based on quantitative and qualitative information. The assessment also relies on judgments of Bank staff.
CPIA scores are used in determining IDA’s allocation of resources to the poorest countries.

This year’s report expands coverage to include two countries in the Middle East and North Africa region:
Djibouti and Yemen.

The development literature identifies the components of CPIA as being broadly relevant for sustaining
growth and reducing poverty.1 The data show that countries with better policies tend to enjoy higher GDP
per capita growth.2 However, the association between CPIA and poverty reduction is low: the correlation
coefficient is -0.21 (figure 1). This result is consistent with recent analysis that shows a low conversion
rate of Africa’s growth into poverty reduction. The growth elasticity of poverty in the developing world
excluding China is estimated to be almost three times the growth elasticity of poverty in Sub-Saharan

                                                                                               countries to the weak and uneven
                   external global environment. Seven countries saw a 0.1-point reduction in their overall CPIA score: Eritrea,
                   Ghana, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia. The conflict in the Central African
                   Republic adversely affected a large number of policy areas, and the country’s CPIA score was sharply lower
                   (by 0.2 point), attesting to the fact that conflict and political instability can rapidly set back policy gains and
                   weaken institutions. Likewise, transition from conflict can support a rebound in the policy environment.

                   There continues to be much divergence in the quality of policies and institutions between the region’s
                   fragile and non-fragile country groups.4 Fragile countries are beset by deep policy and governance
                   challenges, and typically have weak public sector capacity. Not surprisingly, the overall CPIA score for this
                   group substantially lagged behind that of the non-fragile group: 2.8 versus 3.5. But there is considerable
                   variation in performance across fragile countries. Supported by improvements in political stability and
                   the security situation, post-conflict countries recorded solid gains in their policy environment. These
                   countries, along with other fragile countries, accounted for over half of the improvement in overall
                   CPIA scores in the region. Cote d’Ivoire’s score continued to strengthen for a third consecutive year,
                   thanks to wide-ranging policy reforms: the cumulative increase in the CPIA score from 2011-13 was 0.5.
                   Ongoing reforms (such as improving public financial management and making it easier to register and
                   transfer property) strengthened Chad’s CPIA score for a second year in a row, and progress in a number
                   of policy areas decisively lifted the score for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Yet, CPIA developments
                   in the Central African Republic and South Sudan are a reminder that conflict and political instability can
                   adversely impact countries’ policy environments.

                   CPIA developments were mixed among non-fragile countries. Amidst a weak and uneven global
                   economy, more countries saw deterioration in the policy environment rather than improvement.
                   Slippages in economic management and weaknesses in the fiscal framework continued to weigh down
                   on the CPIA performance of Ghana, and also pulled down the scores for Mozambique and Zambia.

By contrast, Nigeria showed steady improvement in scores, reflecting stronger economic management,
while steady progress on policy reforms translated into higher scores for Mauritania and Rwanda.

Movement in scores of the four CPIA clusters mirrored the flat trend in the overall CPIA. Within the
individual clusters, the economic management and public sector management clusters exhibited the
largest number of country-level movements—gains or losses—in 2013. As in 2012, the performance (in
terms of score) of the economic management cluster continued to lead that of all other clusters (figure
4). This reflects a mix of issues, especially the consensus in the region’s countries on the importance of
macroeconomic stability in facilitating growth and the relatively less contentious process (as compared
to say judicial system reform) for formulating macroeconomic policies. The next highest scores were for
structural policies and the policies for social inclusion and equity clusters. The downward drift in the
public sector management and institutions cluster was halted in 2013, but this cluster continued to
sharply lag all other clusters. Both fragile and non-fragile groups of countries exhibit a similar pattern of
cluster scores. The largest performance gap between the region’s fragile and non-fragile countries is in
debt policy, but the gap is substantial across all clusters and components, signaling a region-wide need
to improve fragile countries’ performance on all components of CPIA.

A comparison with IDA borrowers outside of the region shows that that Sub-Saharan Africa has not
narrowed the gap on the average overall CPIA score. However, the pattern by country groups is mixed.
For Africa’s non-fragile countries, the quality of policies and institutions is now similar to that of non-fragile
countries elsewhere. But the gap between this region’s fragile countries and fragile countries in other
regions persists. From the perspective of the 16 components of CPIA, the largest gaps between fragile
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and fragile countries elsewhere are in property rights and rule-based
government; transparency, accountability, and corruption; and debt policy and management. Gaps in
social protection and labor and quality of public administration are large as well. This differs from non-
fragile African countries that, when compared to their non-African counterparts, find the largest gap in
performance in gender equality, closely followed by the gap in equity of public resource use.

                  CLUSTER A: ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
                  The quality of three closely related policy areas is covered under this cluster: monetary and
                  exchange rate, fiscal, and debt.

                  The regional score for Cluster A held steady at 3.4 amid weaker performance in fiscal and monetary
                  policies in several countries (table 1). By contrast, more countries are seeing a positive trend in debt
                  policy and management than a decline. The region’s non-fragile countries recorded a Cluster A score of
                  3.7 and fragile countries a score of 2.9.

Fiscal policy. Fiscal policy has remained expansionary in the region even as growth has returned to pre-
crisis levels in many countries, resulting in depleted buffers and rising vulnerability to external headwinds.
Ambitious public investment programs, coupled with large increases in recurrent spending (especially
public wages) and higher spending in priority areas, have propelled fiscal spending upwards. Government
expenditures rose from a median rate of 23.3 percent of GDP in 2007 to nearly 27 percent of GDP in 2013.
Growth in government spending has outpaced revenue growth, which rose from a median value of 17.1
percent of GDP to 18.4 percent over the same period (figure 6). There has been a corresponding widening
of the fiscal deficit during this period.

2013. Ongoing overruns in the wage
bill and shortfalls in tax collection (especially lower payments of mineral royalties and corporate taxes
from mining companies due to lower realized gold prices) and grants kept the fiscal deficit in double
digits and above target. In Zambia, public sector wage increases (the wage bill increased by 27 percent
in 2013) put substantial pressure on fiscal accounts and, along with higher spending on the Farm Input
Supply Program, and a shortfall in revenue collection from mining companies, led to a sharp widening of
the fiscal deficit.

Elsewhere, deterioration in Tanzania’s fiscal stance pushed the fiscal deficit higher. The source of stress was
the continued operational losses on the state-owned power company (TANESCO) and financial weakness
of the pension system, especially the Public Sector Pension Fund. In fiscal year 2012/13, Rwanda faced
challenges in implementing the budget due to the decline in aid. The government reacted to the aid
decline by further prioritizing expenditures and relying on domestic financing. Extra-budgetary spending
and a rise in interest payments weighed down on fiscal performance in The Gambia. The fiscal deficit
nearly doubled to an estimated 7.9 percent of GDP from a deficit of 4.5 percent in 2012.

Some countries, such as Benin and Chad, were able to buck the trend and pursue an overall conservative
fiscal policy in 2013. For example, Benin contained the wage bill in line with government financial
and economic program objectives, mainly due to the adoption, in December 2012, by a decision of
the Council of Ministers, of a strategy for the reform of the civil service with the objective to limit the
expansion of the wage bill and maintain fiscal space for investments and priority social expenditures.

                     and in line with WAEMU objectives. In Chad, non-oil revenues were up, thanks to government efforts to
                     expand the tax base.

                     The region’s debt-to-GDP ratio remained moderate, though rising as several countries have turned
                     to international capital markets (and domestic markets) to finance infrastructure needs: the ratio has
                     risen from 29 percent in 2008 to 34 percent in 2013. However, there are significant differences across
                     countries: for example, Ghana’s public debt-to-GDP ratio, which has risen sharply over the past few
                     years, was 60 percent in 2013 and that of Mozambique and Senegal was around 45 percent (figure 7).

                     provide inputs into the conduct of macroeconomic policy with consistent debt strategy. Enhancing
                     debt management capacity will be especially important in countries where governments are
                     increasingly relying on market-based financing.

                     Nigeria is among the countries seeing a strengthening of debt management. In Nigeria, the
                     federal DMO has made significant strides in improving the management of public debt since
                     its establishment in 2000. The DMO has prepared a 2013-2017 Strategic Plan and Medium Term
                     Debt Strategy for 2012-2015 to guide its activities. The DMO publishes an annual report on debt
                     management activities, debt sustainability analysis, risk management and sub-national debt
                     management amongst others. In addition, the DMO coordinates with fiscal and monetary authorities
                     at several levels to provide input into the conduct of macroeconomic policy in Nigeria. In Tanzania,
                     the government prepared and published the third medium term debt strategy in December 2013.

that adequate debt recording systems are available so as to provide accurate and up-to-date data.
The Democratic Republic of Congo has also been strengthening all aspects of debt management,
including the management of arrears. Monitoring and reporting continue to improve: public debt
data are available on annual basis and are published. The improvement in data availability and in the
monitoring of arrears led to a substantial upgrade in the corresponding 2012 PEFA rating of the country.
All debts, including those contracted under natural resources-for-infrastructure agreements, are recorded
in the General Directorate of Public Debt. The Republic of Congo has also strengthened debt recording
and reporting.

Trade. The trade component assesses a country’s trade policy regime and trade facilitation. Four countries
saw an improvement in their overall rating for trade: Democratic Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Liberia,
and Rwanda. In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda there was a strengthening in both trade
policies and trade facilitation. These improvements lifted the regional average score to 3.7 in 2013, up
from 3.6 in 2012.

Recent trends show that when compared to other regions, Africa’s relative score has improved. Indeed,
the 2013 rise in the average trade score has narrowed the gap with the better performing regions,
including Europe and Central Asia, the best performing region overall (figure 8). Nevertheless, it is clear
that with regard to trade, two groups of regions can be discerned: South Asia (SA) and Sub-Saharan Africa,
which have similar but relatively low averages, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), East Asia and
the Pacific (EAP), and Europe and Central Asia (ECA), which have a higher average.

Africa the average score for trade
is 3.3. Hence, there are a range of
countries in Africa that are performing as well on the CPIA trade score as many countries in the best
performing regions. While there is still plenty of scope for all African countries to improve their trade


                                                                            11
policies and trade facilitation, the CPIA results suggest that the challenge for trade in Africa relates
primarily to the fragile states.

It is also interesting to compare outcomes across regions for the two categories that comprise the CPIA
trade ratings. Analysis shows that there is greater variation across regions in the performance on trade
policy than on trade facilitation. There are countries in Africa that match the top performers on trade
facilitation in other regions such as East Asia. However, on trade policy the best performing countries in
Africa continue to lag considerably behind the top performing countries in other regions. This suggests
the need for ongoing review of trade regimes to remove discretionary and discriminatory barriers—
especially the use of non-tariff barriers (for example, discriminatory standards, licenses, and permits)—
and a more open and inclusive process of consultation on trade policies and rules and regulations that
affect trade and greater transparency.

Again, the fragile states have a sizeable influence on the aggregate performance of the region and are
a particular drag on performance in the area of trade facilitation. The fragile states’ performance gap on
trade facilitation vis-à-vis non-fragile countries is substantially larger than on trade policy. Hence, the
more pressing challenge for the fragile states in Africa appears to be to improve performance on trade
facilitation by developing clear national trade facilitation strategies, improving performance standards
in agencies working at the border, reducing clearance times, increasing transparency by making
available information on trade procedures readily available to all traders, addressing corruption in border
management agencies, applying risk management more widely to reduce physical inspection rates, and
allowing electronic submission of customs declarations and other documentary requirements.

Financial sector. This component measures policies and regulations that affect financial stability,
efficiency and access. The average score for the region remained at 2.9 in 2013, well below that of other
regions. Country ratings were broadly stable, with some positive exceptions related to improved access to
finance; a couple of countries faced minor pullback within categories, including on stability.

Financial markets in Africa’s IDA borrowers remained broadly stable. A couple of countries faced
increased risks due to weaknesses in international markets, but most countries remained fairly isolated
from global trends as they are not fully interconnected. Some exceptions included countries that have
issued sovereign bonds in international markets in recent years while facing their own macro pressures.
Overall, systems have high headline capital adequacy ratios and liquidity buffers; non-performing loan
ratios remain high in many countries. Efforts to improve financial regulatory and supervisory regimes,
particularly through improved compliance with international standards, continue. Further efforts are
needed to ensure increased resilience as risks evolve, including an increased presence of cross-border
institutions within Africa. Also, incipient efforts in a few countries to strengthen bank resolution and crisis
management frameworks should be accelerated to ensure readiness to handle weaknesses that may
emerge in financial systems.

Access to finance remained low across African countries but improved steadily to reach about 25 percent
of the region’s adults in 2013. Some countries saw marked improvements (Uganda and Mozambique)
while others continued their upward trends from previous years (Kenya and Rwanda), which could lead
to further improvements in access in the next few years. These improvements emerged as a result of a
number of reforms in the region leveraging on branch-less banking (mobile money, agency banking),
in addition to increases in branch network, e-government, and enhancements in procurement systems


                                               12
by the government (as was the case in Mozambique), as well as improvements in credit infrastructure
and payments systems reforms. The recently approved East Africa payments systems infrastructure is an
important step forward, with other sub-regional reforms also underway.

Notwithstanding these improvements, eight countries account for about 85 percent of total loans in
Sub-Saharan Africa, while only a handful have noticeable financial markets beyond lending (insurance,
pensions, capital markets), following the bank-centric model prevailing in the region. However, there are a
number of reforms in progress or getting started that are expected to deepen markets in Africa, including
beyond lending. Importantly, efforts are increasing across countries to improve financial literacy and
consumer protection, which are also expected to improve financial markets.

Since most financial systems are shallow and a large share of them focused primarily on financing the
governments (via loans or investment in government bonds), small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
are typically left out. There are countries that have managed to improve access to financial services to
SMEs (notably Kenya, through provision of a wider set of products), including through incipient venture
capital efforts in a few countries. Yet, the potential for improving access to this segment is large and
encouraging reform efforts towards this agenda should be accelerated.

In general, banks reported strong profits, partly as a result of competitive power but largely driven by
the need to compensate for huge operating costs. While spreads remain relatively high at around 10
percentage points (International Finance Statistics) and have improved in recent years, they remain the
focus of attention for a number of governments that want to ensure broader access at more affordable
rates. Some governments have introduced interest rate ceilings in recent years to this end, while others
have managed to avoid pressures from different segments of the population to set these ceilings by
putting in place reform packages to address the root cause of high rates, namely operating costs, high
information costs, non-performing loans, and also competition issues.

Overall, financial systems in Africa need to continue to reform and improve going forward. Strong
attention is needed to ensure fiscal distortions do not delay these efforts, both on stability and access
grounds, and that emerging risks are effectively identified and managed.

Business regulatory environment. The business regulatory environment component of CPIA assesses
the extent to which the quality of the policy, legal, and regulatory framework for business is conducive to
attracting private investment and fostering private economic activity. There was little movement in the
rating for most Sub-Saharan African countries in 2013, with only five countries recording a change in the
business regulatory environment score, and the regional average score being 3.1. Among countries with
an improved business environment score was Rwanda—where a continuation of the strong reform trend
raised the country’s CPIA score from 4.0 to 4.5. A positive change was also recorded for the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Sudan. The CPIA score for Malawi slipped further as political tensions weighed
on the business climate there. The scores for Angola, Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe remained
low at 2.0. Most countries in the region put a lot of emphasis on business regulatory and investment
climate reforms in the period 2009-12. In 2013, similar to the period of 2009 and 2012, several countries
in the region made strides in reforming regulations affecting entry, exit, and competition; some of them
entered the second wave of reforms, where along with the legal and regulatory reforms, they embarked
on e-government reforms aimed at employing ICT tools and applications in order to bring the reforms
closer to businesses and the general population. Thus, for the vast majority of countries in Sub-Saharan


                                                            13
Africa, the unchanged scores in 2013 reflect that either these countries have embarked on new reforms
that were not finished in 2013, or that implementation of older reforms is still ongoing.

Several African countries were among the top reformers in the 2014 Doing Business (DB) report: Burundi
(which was also a top reformer in the 2013 Doing Business), Cote D’Ivoire, and Rwanda. Three African
economies made the biggest progress globally in an area measured by DB 2014: Burundi in the ease of
registering property, Benin in the ease of trading across borders, and Côte d’Ivoire in the ease of enforcing
contracts. In the region, Rwanda saw reforms in the most number of regulatory areas, eight of the 10 areas
tracked by Doing Business: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property,
paying taxes, getting credit, protecting investors, and resolving insolvency. Burundi and Cote d’Ivoire
reformed in four and six business regulatory areas, respectively. Worldwide, among the 20 economies
improving business regulation the most since 2009, nine are in Sub-Saharan Africa: Burundi, Sierra Leone,
Guinea-Bissau, Rwanda, Togo, Benin, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, and Guinea.

Reforms have helped to sharply lower the cost of doing business in the region. For example, in Rwanda,
the launch of the on-line construction permit system has reduced the cost and time it takes to get a
permit—from Rwf 625,000 to Rwf 60,000 for commercial permits and from Rwf 60,000 to Rwf 20,000 for
residential permits, and from over 100 days to a maximum of 30 days Also, the adoption of an improved
valuation methodology has reduced the time of importing and exporting goods (from 38 to 34 days for
importing and 31 to 29 days for exporting). Nevertheless, much remains to be done in African countries
to improve the investment climate in the region, including easing infrastructure constraints, reducing
corruption, strengthening regulatory quality, and improving security.

A positive trend in 2013 is the new emphasis on regional integration and the business regulatory environment
initiatives embarked on or initiated as a result of regional integration initiatives in Africa. The Accelerated
Program for Economic Integration (APEI 5), East African Community (EAC) and OHADA have shown a strong
commitment to business regulation reforms, most notably with OHADA enacting a new Commercial Uniform
Act that improved the legal framework for doing business in 17 countries across the continent.

The Rwanda reform experience and the new CPIA increase to 4.5 shows that the presence of strong
reform champions within the country is a needed ingredient for the successful implementation of
business environment reforms which are often cross-cutting and require the involvement of several
ministries, parliament, representatives from the private sector and, at times, professional associations,
academia and civil society. Undertaking successful business environment reforms therefore requires
not only strong champions but also focused coordination and selectivity in order to navigate through
interactive processes, handle stakeholder engagement and build consensus.

equal status and protection under the law. The scores for this component reflect not only the large gender
inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also the ‘sticky’ nature of many gender issues: the average score
has remained at 3.2 since 2005. There is a great deal of cross-country consistency regarding the variation
in achievement for the different dimensions of the gender component, with most countries lagging in
the area of gender equality in human capital development. National indicators suggest that there are also
significant geographical differences between the magnitude of gender inequalities in urban and rural
areas, though these cannot be revealed by the CPIA scores.

At the top of the score range is Cabo Verde, which has achieved the highest score (4.5) in Africa every
year since 2005. There are five countries with an average score of 4.0: Burundi, Ghana, Lesotho, Mauritania,
and Rwanda. Countries that achieve a score of 4.0 have laws and policies to promote gender equality, as
well as mechanisms to enforce these laws. Cabo Verde’s score of 4.5 additionally reflects its lower level of
gender disparities, especially amongst human capital related indicators.

At the low end of the score range are eight countries, each scoring 2.5: Central African Republic, Chad,
Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, South Sudan, and Sudan. Consistent
areas of poor performance across these countries include: extremely high rates of maternal mortality, a
low percentage of births attended by skilled health staff, low contraceptive prevalence, high adolescent
fertility, and large gender disparities in secondary school enrolment.

Human Capital Development. The majority of Sub-Saharan African countries are not currently on target to
achieve the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for maternal mortality. Modeled data for 2010 suggest
an average maternal mortality rate of 500 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is much higher than the
average for developing countries in EAP (83), LAC (81), and MNA (81). In addition to improving women’s
economic opportunities, knowledge of reproductive health issues, and access to quality maternal health
care, women’s maternal health can also be addressed by increasing their ability to control their fertility
and birth spacing through contraception. In this regard, there has been some progress. Between 2000
and 2010, Rwanda was able to almost quadruple the rate of contraceptive prevalence, from 13.2 to 51.6
percent. Over the same period, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau were able to increase contraceptive
prevalence 2.5 times and 2 times respectively.

While most countries in the region have made progress in increasing gender equality at the secondary
education level, the lowest CPIA scorers continue to exhibit significant gender gaps even at the primary
level. For example, the Central African Republic and Chad have female to male primary enrolment ratios
of just 74 and 76 percent, respectively. However, there are also examples of significant progress being
made. Between 2000 and 2010, Guinea-Bissau was able to increase the ratio of female to male primary
enrolment from 68 to 94 percent, partly thanks to the introduction of free primary education and a school
feeding program. Other countries, such as Benin (in 2008), have also achieved improvements with the
introduction of free education policies.

Access to Productive and Economic Resources. Women’s labor force participation is lower than men’s
in almost all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with just a few exceptions, including Burundi, Malawi,
Mozambique, and Rwanda. While in most countries in the region, the ratio of female to male participation
rates does not drop below 80 percent, there are significant disparities in employment status, with women
tending to be more concentrated in the informal sector, more likely to work as unpaid family workers,
and less represented in technical and senior management positions. For example, in Tanzania, while the


                                                            15
ratio of female to male labor force participation is close to parity, only 6 percent of women are engaged
in formal employment, versus 15 percent of men. The contributing issues include women’s lower skills
and education and restrictive social attitudes regarding women’s economic roles. Time poverty is also
a factor: women tend to bear a disproportionate burden for household chores, which significantly
reduces their ability to engage in income-generating activities, especially those outside the family home.
However, even when women have equal or higher educational outcomes than men, these outcomes are
often not translated into equal economic opportunities. For example, in Lesotho, there is relative gender
parity at the primary level and girls are more likely to be enrolled at the secondary level, yet the ratio of
female to male labor force participation is only 80 percent. Some countries have, nevertheless, made
significant progress: between 2000 and 2011, Mauritania increased the ratio of female to male labor force
participation from 29.6 percent to 36.2 percent.

Equality of Status and Protection under the Law. Agency is important because it is the process through
which women and men can convert their endowments into economic and other opportunities and,
ultimately, into the outcomes that they desire. Critically, there does not appear to be a strong association
between women’s agency and a country’s income level, suggesting that economic development alone
will not be enough to bring progress.

Over recent years, Sub-Saharan Africa has improved its performance with regard to the proportion of
parliamentary seats that are held by women, with the average across the region increasing from 11.6
percent in 2000 to 22.3 percent in 2013 (compared to a world average of 21.8 percent). Rwanda has
the highest proportion of seats held by women of any country in the world—almost 64 percent in
2013. This has partly been achieved with the inclusion of a 30 percent female Member of Parliament
(MP) quota in the national constitution. Other countries have also successfully used the introduction
of quotas to increase women’s representation. Since the introduction of quotas in Mauritania in 2006,
female representation has increased six-fold, from 3.8 percent to 22.1 percent. More recently, the
impact of quotas in Senegal could be observed for the first time in 2012, with women’s representation
increasing from 23 percent to 43 percent. Quotas may not always be sufficient—their use in Eritrea and
Gabon, for example, seems to have had little impact. Political will is likely to be at least as important as
official legislation.5

Some statutory legal discrimination, especially against women as wives, still exists in constitutions and
in statutes governing marital property, inheritance, land, and labor. However, over recent years, many
countries in the region have made notable progress. The 2014 IFC report on Women, Business and the
Law found that over the past two years two of the countries that have made the most reforms related to
women’s economic inclusion were from Sub-Saharan Africa: Cote D’Ivoire and Mali. For example, Cote
D’Ivoire recently changed laws which previously meant that husbands had the final say on the location
of the family residence and could legally stop their wives from working. Moreover, another change in the
law which allows women to be heads of households means that women can now claim tax deductions
for their husbands and children. Between 1960 and 2010, Sub-Saharan Africa went from being the region
with the greatest number of restrictions to being the region that had implemented the greatest number
of reforms. However, there is still much progress to be made and women’s ability to take advantage of
their statutory legal rights is often complicated by a number of factors, including: (1) the influence of

5	 After fielding a significant number of women in the 2011 elections, the ruling party in the Seychelles was able to increase the proportion of women MPs from 23.5
   percent to 43.8 percent, without the use of any quotas.




                                                                       16
customary law, which tends to discriminate against women and is sometimes recognized by statutory law,
even when it violates the gender equality provisions of the latter; (2) a lack of capacity or will on the part
of the police, the judiciary, and other agencies to enforce certain gender equality provisions, especially
those related to sensitive areas, such as gender-based violence; and (3) women’s relative lack of human
and financial capital, which prevents them from knowing their rights and effectively defending them.

One specific area where legal protection for women tends to be insufficient is gender-based violence
(GBV). This issue is especially serious in conflict and post-conflict areas, such as DRC, where violators
are often able to act with relative impunity. Despite some progress in addressing this issue, high rates
of GBV continue to persist across many countries in the region. Various GBV acts are often not covered
with specific laws and where laws do exist these are often not effectively enforced. In Sierra Leone, for
example, data suggest that despite recent legislative efforts, only 20 out of every 1000 GBV cases result
in prosecution.6

Equity of public resource use. This component of CPIA assesses the extent to which the pattern of public
expenditures and revenue collection affects the poor and is consistent with national poverty reduction
priorities. The average score for this category was unchanged at 3.3 in 2013, with only one country
recording a change. The slippage in score for the Central African Republic reflects the findings of a recent
public expenditure review, which showed that priority sector spending receives a disproportionately small
share of the budget. Also, a lack of resources adversely impacted the country’s budget implementation
in 2013. Overall, more than one-quarter of African countries have scores in a range of 4 to 4.5. In Rwanda,
public expenditures (including sub-national spending allocations) are well-aligned with poverty reduction
priorities. In Burkina Faso, the share of the budget devoted to poverty-reducing social expenditures has
been rising and was 7.6 percent in 2013. In Ethiopia, government spending is guided by the Growth and
Transformation Plan: In 2013, 70 percent of government spending was on pro-poor sectors, which is among
the highest in Africa. In Kenya, there is an increasing policy emphasis on social protection programs.

Building human resources. The human development component assesses the quality of national policies
and public and private sector delivery in health and education. The human development CPIA score for
Sub-Saharan Africa, which rose to 3.5 between 2009 and 2012, remained unchanged in 2013. In contrast,
the average score for the region’s fragile countries continued to improve in 2013, mirroring the uptick in
score in fragile countries elsewhere. The average score for both African and non-African fragile groups
remains comparable.

Reflecting the aggregate trend, the health sub-component saw little improvement between 2012 and
2013 in Sub-Saharan Africa. The performance for both fragile and non-fragile country groups followed the
regional trend, remaining unchanged in 2013. The top performers in the region compared well with top
performers elsewhere, and about 25 percent of countries performed strongly. This was the same situation
in 2012. Among the worst performers in 2013 were the Central African Republic and Chad. The conflict
in the Central African Republic has led to serious deterioration of the health system, with the majority of
health structures outside of the main cities no longer functioning due to a lack of minimum equipment,
medicine and qualified staff. The country’s health indicators are among the poorest in the world. Among
other countries seeing a slippage in health was Kenya, where the decentralization of health to local

authorities embodies an ambitious plan but is not supported with appropriate financing. In addition,
there are concerns about the implementation of the policy on the elimination of user fees in the primary
health care and maternity services. A clear strategy on devolution with a focus on health financing is
much required.

In general, while the majority of countries have policies and strategies in place, most have not been
able to cost these strategies out. Health financing strategies are almost non-existent in countries. Most
countries continue to face significant household out-of-pocket expenditures in health. Few countries
have been able to increase public spending in health. Further effort is required in encouraging countries
to develop health financing strategies, support universal health coverage through pre-payment
mechanisms, and improve financial protection.

The education sub-component assesses countries on the main dimensions of the primary and secondary
education system deemed critical to the creation of high-performance education systems over time.
These assessment indicators are sector strategy, education management and information systems,
learning assessments, teachers, education finance, and school-based management. Countries have made
efforts to strengthen learning outcomes, teacher training, data collection, and assessments.

Reflecting the aggregate trend, the education sub-component saw little change between 2012 and 2013
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Only three countries have seen progress on their education score from the earlier
year: Mozambique, Sudan and Zimbabwe.

Many governments have increased efforts to develop both pre-primary and post-primary education and
to reduce the level of illiteracy in order to create the necessary human capacity to sustain an economy in
continuous growth. For example, in Mozambique, the government recently developed a multi-sectoral
strategy on Early Childhood Development (ECD) to guide the scaling up of activities in this area. The
Government also has a policy for technical and vocational education—the “Programa Integrado da
Reforma da Educação Profissional” (PIREP) whose objective is to re-orient the system of technical training
to be more relevant and demand-driven. The strategic plan for higher education (2012-2016) seeks to
address quality, equity, governance, and financing issues in this sub-sector, and the recently approved
strategy for the financing reform of higher education is expected to contribute to increased accountability
and quality of provision of services. While the education sector is growing fast in terms of overall
numbers of students, it is also putting important challenges in the training, deployment, motivation, and
accountability of teachers at all levels. There has been recent progress in teachers’ qualifications, especially
in pre-service training.

Social protection and labor. Social protection and labor systems help people and families find
jobs, improve productivity, cope with shocks, invest in the health and education of their children,
and provide income support in old age. In Sub-Saharan Africa, given the low level of formal
employment, pension systems and labor market insurance tend to be fairly modest. They generally
cover a small share of the population—civil servants and those employed in the small formal sector.
The main aspects of social protection in Africa are represented by safety nets (or social assistance),
which aim to provide protection for the most poor and vulnerable and incentivize them to improve
their livelihoods and participate productively in society. Safety nets are a critical area of social
protection in Africa and are often closely linked to more traditional, established and longstanding
community-driven development programs. Increased policy engagement is also taking place in


                                               18
the area of social protection systems where there is strong engagement by governments and
development partners.

There were no notable changes in country performance between 2012 and 2013. Conflict-ridden countries,
as could be expected, showed a decline in scores from year to year (for example, Guinea-Bissau). The
remaining countries confirmed already existing tendencies towards improved strategic policies in the areas.

Despite the heterogeneity across the continent, social protection is becoming a core instrument in the
effort to reduce poverty. More and more African countries are preparing social protection strategies to
serve as the foundation on which to build effective and efficient social protection systems. Safety nets in
particular are placed high on the governments’ agendas. Experience from some African countries such
as Rwanda shows that clear action plans with careful costing and implementation plans are crucial for
putting strategies into operation.

With better analysis of safety nets, several countries are on the path towards developing more effective
safety net systems. Recent reviews of the fast-evolving landscape of social protection in Africa7 suggest
that 36 percent of the countries analyzed are making progress in building systems while 50 percent still
need to make more progress. A number of countries are actively increasing the effectiveness and scale of
their existing programs, including some that are relatively well-targeted (such as the programs run by the
Tanzania Social Action Fund). Also, more countries are moving towards building safety net systems and
programs that are predictable and flexible enough to respond to crises (for example, Niger, Cameroon,
Mali, Mozambique, Guinea, and Senegal). Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) has long been a
pioneer in this respect.

Overall, few African countries have well-planned safety net systems capable of taking a strategic approach
to reducing poverty and vulnerability. Instead, a multitude of interventions exist that are fragmented,
typically donor-driven, and together do not effectively target the poor. In low income countries, for
example in West Africa, safety nets are focused on emergency relief and food-related issues. Few provide
continuous support to the large number of chronically poor (such programs are more common in middle
income countries such as South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland due to the prevalence of social pension).
Looking across countries, the most common programs are school feeding programs, public work
programs, emergency and categorical transfer programs, and general subsidies ( 9). National poverty-
targeted cash transfers are not common, although smaller programs are being expanded—for example,
Kenya’s CT-OVC program, Rwanda’s VUP, and Tanzania’s Productive Safety Net. The most important
stumbling block has been effective targeting—that is, defining the rules and practice to allocate benefits
to the most needy members of society, as identified either by simple indicators of poverty or by other
indicators of deprivation such as food insecurity.

Coverage of the poor and vulnerable by existing safety nets is low. Taken together, each country’s safety
net programs cover only a very small share of the total number of its poor and vulnerable people. For
example, in Benin, the net coverage rate of all safety net programs is only 5 to 6 percent of the poor. In
Kenya, estimations show that cash transfers reached an estimated 9 percent of the poor population in
2010.8 Targeted programs are still not widely available in Africa (box 1).

           safety nets are able to identify and reach the poor and vulnerable, especially those in extreme poverty and
           vulnerability, given data and capacity constraints. Community-based targeting (CBT) is a prominent design

           other approaches to identify the poor (for example, poverty census surveys) when implementation capacity is
           low– including use of local knowledge, faster implementation and, not least, lower administrative cost. There
           is evidence that CBT can be effective (for example, Ethiopia), and is better accepted by communities than
           other targeting methods.

           Well-targeted safety nets are affordable in Africa, especially if inefficient universal and categorical spending
           can be redirected to the poorest groups and if fragmented programs can be harmonized.

Data collection and the monitoring systems that support safety net programs need to be improved
systematically across Africa. Especially, there is very little information about the effectiveness of food
distribution and emergency relief programs that are common in West Africa (for example, in Burkina
Faso, Benin, Mali, Mauritania, and Cameroon). Basic data on the number of beneficiaries reached and
information about program outcomes are imperative in order to improve the design and coordination
of programs, to keep decision-makers informed, and to attract financial resources. More and more
impact evaluations are being undertaken, contributing to a growing body of evidence on safety net
programs in Africa. While in the past most impact evaluations have been for small donor pilots for
research purposes, larger programs such as those in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya are now benefitting
from impact evaluations.

Policies and institutions for environmental sustainability. The environment and natural resources
component of the CPIA measures (a) the appropriateness and implementation of policies across a range of
environmental topics (air pollution, water pollution, solid and hazardous waste, freshwater resources, marine
and coastal resources, biodiversity, commercial renewable resources [mainly forests and fish], commercial
nonrenewable resources [mainly minerals], and climate change) and (b) the strength of cross-cutting
institutional systems, including the quality of the environmental impact assessment system, and a range of
environmental governance factors (access to information, participation, coordination, and accountability).

The regional average CPIA score for this component was unchanged at 3.1 in 2013. Individual country
scores ranged from 2.0 to 4.5, with two-thirds of all countries scoring either 3.0 or 3.5. Scores of 3.0/3.5 for
this component generally reflect situations in which environmental policies are relatively comprehensive
but gaps remain in implementation. The gap between policy development and implementation is evident
in almost every country.

The overall environment score changed in only four countries, falling in two of them. Mauritania saw
incremental improvements across a range of institutional and natural resources management measures
related to the increasing activity of the recently established Ministry of Environment, improving its overall
score as a result. South Sudan fell back slightly due to challenges in the management of water and
ecosystem resources. No country showed a very large change in performance in 2013, except Central
African Republic where the recent political crisis has led to a halt in many regular government functions
and caused a significant decrease in score.

Although few countries changed the final overall score, the aggregate trend masks the much larger
number of movement in the 14 measures of institutional and sub-sector performance that contribute
to the environment component of the CPIA. Analysis of the results for the individual performance
measures reveals the following pattern: the three institutional measures which are more influenced by
policies—public participation, environmental assessment and coordination—occupy three of the top four
positions, whereas the two institutional measures for which the assessment relies more heavily on actual
implementation—access to information and accountability—perform noticeably worse.

The average regional score for Sub-Saharan Africa is comparable to that of the rest of the world. The
relative performance between the different dimensions of the environment measure in Africa appears
to follow a similar pattern to the rest of the world, although those dimensions which show the worst
absolute performance in the region—accountability and the pollution-related measures—also have large
relative performance gaps in the rest of the world. Interestingly, the relative performance on access to
information and climate changes is also weak in Africa, although in absolute terms these are relatively

                  GDP, but they are strongly correlated with broad governance measures such as the Economic Intelligence
                  Unit’s Democracy Index. There does not appear to be any systematic difference between countries with
                  and without high dependency on mineral resources.


                  CLUSTER D: PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
                  Cluster D covers governance and public sector capacity issues: property rights and rule-
                  based governance, quality of budgetary and financial management, efficiency of revenue
                  management, quality of public administration, and transparency, accountability and
                  corruption in the public sector.

                  Demand for good governance is increasing in Africa. Citizens, businesses, and institutions alike are calling
                  on governments to institute reforms that can improve public service delivery; enhance transparency,
                  voice and accountability; strengthen protection of their rights; and offer peace and security. CPIA
                  promotes support for evidence-based decision making, in line with the World Bank’s twin goals of
                  reducing extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, by providing data and trends of governance
                  reforms in the region and beyond.

                  The importance of governance and public sector capacity as the basis for sustainable growth and
                  effective service delivery is abundantly clear. For example, low levels of security, justice, and normative
                  structures weaken protection of property and contract rights in fragile and conflict-affected areas such
                  as the Horn of Africa and the Central African Republic. Weak public administration at the central, regional,
                  and local levels affects policy development, implementation, and service provision in parts of the Great
                  Lakes region and the Sahel. Deficiencies in revenue collection and budgetary and financial management


                                                                 22
reduce the predictability of public investment and their expected outcomes. Lack of transparency and
corruption reduces the integrity of public resource use and its effectiveness, affecting citizens’ trust in their
government, as in Malawi and South Sudan for example.

In the 2013 CPIA cycle, the governance cluster (Cluster D) showed an increased share of activity when
compared across indicators. Seven countries improved their cluster D scores. Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, and
Democratic Republic of Congo experienced an increase of 0.2 points in their average cluster D score;
Guinea, Liberia, Tanzania, and Cabo Verde saw an improvement of 0.1 (figure 12). In Côte d’Ivoire the
increase reflects the positive impacts of political normalcy and peace on property rights and judiciary; in
Chad, property registration and its transference has been made easier by lowering the property transfer
tax and instituting other measures, such as efforts to promote citizen security, which have had a positive
impact. DRC’s improved score is due to the country’s robust progress in strengthening its budgetary and
financial management systems. But a larger number of countries (nine) saw their scores decline. Guinea-
Bissau, Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Togo saw a drop of 0.1 points; Central African
Republic, Malawi, and Lesotho saw a decline of 0.2 points.

in increased incidences of fraud;
in Comoros, the lower score is
attributed to the Government’s increasingly slow implementation of an effective payroll management
system and its financial weaknesses in cash planning. In Lesotho, substantial budget policy challenges
affected the country’s performance.

Burundi, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, and Tanzania, on the other hand, experienced
significant improvements in the budget and financial management CPIA rating. For example, Burundi
improved its fiscal reporting by preparing budget reports on a quarterly basis and making them
available to citizens, thereby experiencing a positive impact on its score. In Tanzania, the linking of
government ministries and agencies to the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)

                  financial management system technologies were promoted, while in Chad, good progress made in the
                  implementation of an integrated financial management system along with the passage of new budget
                  legislation helped improve the country’s score.

                  With regard to property rights and rule-based governance, the scores of three countries—Chad, Ghana,
                  and Cote’d Ivoire—increased while Mozambique’s and Burkina Faso’s scores decreased. For example,
                  post-election political stability had a positive impact on Ghana’s property rights and judicial regime, while
                  incidents of insecurity in the Sahel and the resulting influx of refugees negatively affected the security
                  environment in Burkina Faso.

                  Fragility and conflict affects public sector performance and service delivery both within and outside
                  Africa. Africa’s non-fragile countries compare favorably with similar countries in other regions, with the
                  average scores being 3.2 and 3.4, respectively. However, fragile states, when compared across regions,
                  show much greater variation, as African fragile states perform poorly when compared to non-African
                  fragile countries. For example, African fragile states scored 2.3 compared to their counterparts’ score of
                  2.8 for both property rights and rule-based governance (which includes judicial system capacity) and
                  transparency, accountability and corruption indicators. African fragile states’ performance across all
                  categories of CPIA’s indicators shows a consistent pattern, underscoring the existing weaknesses in their
                  policies and institutions (figure 13).

                  Large gaps exist between the scores of fragile and non-fragile African countries (an overall and consistent
                  average difference of 0.7 points for all areas, except efficiency of resource mobilization where the
                  difference is 0.6). Among fragile countries, transparency and corruption as well as property rights and
                  rule-based governance appear to be the weakest performance indicators within the cluster, both with a
                  score of 2.3. Meanwhile, at 3.6, efficiency of revenue mobilization is the better performing component.
                  Weak Sub-Saharan Africa’s policy and institutional performance, indicates the need to scale up capacity

2013 CPIA Results for Djibouti and Yemen
This section discusses the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores1 for Djibouti and
Yemen, the two countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region that are eligible for support
from the International Development Association (IDA). The focus of this section is on the 2013 scores,
supplemented with a discussion on trends over the last eight years.



Summary

u	The latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores for the MENA countries that are
     eligible to borrow from IDA—Djibouti and Yemen—were virtually unchanged relative to 2012. There were
     no changes in scores for Yemen and only slight rating changes for a couple of policy clusters in Djibouti.
u	Since 2005, neither country has improved its overall rating; indeed, Yemen’s overall policy and institutional
     score actually declined.
u	The quality of policies and institutions in MENA IDA countries lags behind the average for middle income
     countries (MICs) in all CPIA categories, the notable exceptions being policies for trade and for social
     inclusion and equity, which were areas of strength for MENA.
u	Yemen’s CPIA ratings exceeded the average for fragile IDA countries. Yemen’s ratings marginally
     dominated those of fragile countries outside of Africa, with strengths evident in some categories of CPIA
     and weaknesses in others. Yemen’s ratings dominated the average Africa fragile country rating overall and
     on all four policy clusters.




Recent Trends and Analysis
The average CPIA score for IDA-eligible countries in MENA was 3.0 in 2013, unchanged from 2012. Both
Djibouti and Yemen had unchanged scores, indicating that despite unsettled conditions in the region and
lingering challenges in global economic conditions, these countries generally opted to maintain their
existing policy framework. Djibouti’s CPIA score (3.1) was slightly higher than the average while Yemen’s
was on par with the average (Figure 15).

Compared with other country groups, both MENA IDA-eligible countries had lower scores than the
average IDA-eligible country score (3.3), lower also relative to the Sub-Saharan African IDA country
average score (3.2). The MENA countries, both lower middle-income countries, had lower overall ratings
than the average score for IDA-eligible middle-income countries2 (3.4) and Sub-Saharan IDA MICs (3.3).
Given that the IDA country CPIA scores ranged from 2.0 to 4.4 in 2013 and the median score was 3.4 (that
is, with half the countries falling below 3.4, and the other half rated above), the MENA IDA country scores
were positioned in the lower half of the distribution.

1	 The scores are an indicator of the quality of these countries’ policy and institutional framework across 16 dimensions, grouped into four clusters: economic
   management (Cluster A), structural policies (Cluster B), policies for social inclusion and equity (Cluster C), and public sector management and institutions (Cluster D).
   The 16 policy and institutional areas are defined in Appendix A. The scores, which are on a scale of 1–6, with 6 being the highest, are calculated by World Bank staff and
   are based on quantitative and qualitative information. The assessment also relies on judgments of Bank staff. CPIA scores are used in determining IDA’s allocation of
   resources to the poorest countries.
2	 Most of which are lower middle-income. Appendix B highlights (with asterisks) the 47 middle income countries (MICs) that are IDA eligible. Ten of these are upper MICs,
   of which 4 are fragile and all but 2 are small island countries in the Caribbean and Pacific oceans.

fragile countries outside of Sub-Saharan
Africa. However, at cluster level, Yemen had higher scores than the non-SSA fragile countries on economic
management (Cluster A) and on policies for social inclusion and equity (Cluster C), while scoring lower on
the cluster reflecting the quality of public sector management (Cluster D).

Djibouti is not a fragile country despite similar scores as Yemen. Compared with other non-fragile
countries (both SSA and non-SSA country groups), Djibouti’s scores were lower both overall and on all
four policy clusters. The one exception was Djibouti’s score for the structural policies (Cluster B), which was
on par with the average score for non-fragile SSA countries.

Despite having similar overall scores, Djibouti and Yemen exhibited differences in scores at cluster level
depending on the policy or institutional area. The two countries had the same scores on economic
management (3.2) and on policies for social inclusion and equity (3.0) (Figure 16) (see Appendix A for
definitions of the CPIA categories). However, Djibouti’s score on structural policies was higher than
Yemen’s (3.5 versus 3.0 respectively) while Yemen had a slight edge over Djibouti on public sector
management and institutions (2.8 versus 2.7 respectively).

                   the current ratings reflect a slow but steady deterioration in the quality of Yemen’s policy and institutional
                   environment across the board since 2005, a trend that was aggravated sharply in the immediate wake of
                   the Arab Spring.

country’s policies and institutions were largely unaffected by the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Nonetheless,

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

NOTES: The CPIA consists of 16 criteria grouped in four equally weighted clusters: Economic Management, Structural Policies, Policies for Social Inclusion and Equity, and Public Sector Management and Institutions. For each of the 16 criteria,
countries are rated on a scale of 1 (low) to 6 (high). The scores depend on the level of performance in a given year assessed against the criteria, rather than on changes in performance compared to the previous year. The ratings depend on
actual policies and performance, rather than on promises or intentions. The ratings reflect a variety of indicators, observations, and judgments originated in the World Bank or elsewhere. For details see: www.worldbank.org/africa/CPIA

Appendix A: CPIA Components

A. Economic Management:

   1. Monetary & Exchange Rate Policy: The quality of monetary/exchange rate policies in a coherent macroeconomic policy
      framework.
   2. Fiscal Policy: The quality of fiscal policy as regards stabilization (achieving macroeconomic policy objectives in conjunction
      with coherent monetary and exchange rate policies, smoothing business cycle fluctuations, accommodating shocks) and
      resource allocation (appropriate provisioning of public goods).
   3. Debt Policy: Degree of appropriateness of the country’s debt management strategy for ensuring medium-term debt
      sustainability and minimizing budgetary risks.


B. Structural Policies:

   4. Trade: Extent to which the policy framework fosters regional and global integration in goods and services, focusing on the

Appendix C: Guide to CPIA
The CPIA is a diagnostic tool that is intended to capture the quality of a country’s policies and institutional
arrangements—i.e., its focus is on the key elements that are within a country’s control, rather than on
outcomes (such as growth rates) that are influenced by elements outside the country’s control. More
specifically, the CPIA measures the extent to which a country’s policy and institutional framework supports
sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and consequently the effective use of development assistance.
The outcome of the exercise yields both an overall score and scores for all of the sixteen criteria that
compose the CPIA. The CPIA tool was developed and first employed in the mid-1970s and over the years the
World Bank has periodically updated and improved it to reflect the lessons of experience and the evolution
of thinking about development.

In June 2006, the World Bank publicly disclosed for the first time the numerical scores of its 2005 Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). The CPIA exercise covers country performance during a given
calendar year with the results for the IDA eligible countries disclosed in June of the following year.

The CPIA has undergone periodic reviews to update and refine the content of the criteria. The most recent
revision of the criteria took place last year and was applied to the 2011 CPIA exercise. The revisions were
guided by the conclusions of an IEG evaluation and by the relevant literature findings and the lessons
learned in carrying out the annual CPIA exercise in the past few years. In undertaking the revisions, special
attention was given to ensuring that the content of the revisions was commensurate with the availability of
information and the ability to assess country performance; and that some degree of continuity was preserved
in the criteria. The revisions have not resulted in significant changes in country scores. Among the revisions
are the following:

  •	 In Q4 (Trade), trade policy and trade facilitation are now equally weighted; more emphasis is placed
    on the trade regime, not just imports; services are explicitly introduced; and the trade facilitation sub-
    component elaborated.
  •	 The coverage of social assistance programs, including coordination, reach and targeting issues in Q10
    (Social Protection and Labor), was strengthened.
  •	 Q15 (Quality of Public Administration) was revised to include a stronger focus on the core public
    administration and, when relevant, a more explicit treatment of sub-national governments.
  •	 In Q16, (Transparency, Accountability and Corruption in the Public Sector) was revised to include a new
    dimension to cover aspects of financial corruption that had not been treated consistently. Coverage
    of fiscal information is now more explicit, and capture and conflicts of interest as distinct forms of
    corruption are treated more consistently.
CPIA scores help to determine IDA allocations—concessional lending and grants—to low-income countries.
