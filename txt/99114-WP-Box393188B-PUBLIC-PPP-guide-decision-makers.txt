    deliver an infrastructure service over the long term. It combines the
    strength of the public sector’s mandate to deliver services and its role
    as regulator and coordinator of public functions with the private sec-
    tor’s focus on proﬁtability and therefore commercial efﬁciency.

    “PPP” is used here in its most inclusive form, to mean any contrac-
    tual or legal relationship between public and private entities aimed
    at improving and/or expanding infrastructure services. Clearly, the
    more extensive the private involvement, the more supportive the
    investment climate needs to be. The term “Government” will be used
    to mean the level of Government responsible for the reform processes,
    whether it be the federal, state or municipal Government. The two
    counterparties to the main project contract will be referred to as the
    “contracting agency” on the public side and the “project company” on
    the private side. PPP can be implemented as a series of ad hoc projects
    or as a program of projects coordinated and enabled centrally. This
    text discusses the latter—“PPP programs”.

    One of the challenges for Governments wanting to implement a
    conducive PPP framework is the variety of models and approaches
    put forward by different countries, advisers and commentators. A
    common approach is to try to adopt the fully functioning framework
    used by a country that has been very successful in developing a PPP
    program, in one fell swoop. This involves taking, for example, the
    PPP program in England and Wales and replicating it wholesale

    Key Messages for Policy Makers

    • Learning by doing—an important part of identifying gaps in the investment climate is learned while “doing”, while implementing PPP projects.
    • Use small steps without being timid—start with easier projects that are clearly financially viable and have political support. But these projects
      need to provide a signalling effect; they need to be sufficiently substantial and strategic to ensure Government buy-in, the interests of private
      investors and a statement to the market that the framework for PPP in the country is conducive.
    • Learn from the experiences of others, without being dogmatic—there is a tendency to try to replicate the successes of other countries. While it is
      important to learn from the successes and failures of others, it is generally unwise to try to replicate an entire framework, wholesale.
    • Keep it simple—complex is not necessarily comprehensive or better, the PPP framework needs to be understood by a wide group of stakeholders.

    The Government will wish to create a clear and stable legal environ-
    ment for PPP projects, in order to reduce the perception of risk, attract
    more competition for projects, attract more lending and therefore
    reduce project costs. The legal (and regulatory) framework creates the
    foundation for the institutional, regulatory, commercial and ﬁnancial
    environment for PPP with clarity, consistency, transparency and cer-
    tainty. It is particularly critical for the institutional framework, describ-

    framework. For this reason, this text describes the legal framework
    ﬁrst. However, the reader will need to read this section in close con-

    The policy should include:

    The creation of a PPP program requires a well-designed institutional
    framework, with clear and strong political support. A robust institu-
    tional framework organizes, coordinates and focuses the resources of
    the Government in the manner best suited to encourage and enable
    PPP. This section will review the institutional framework needed to
    promote PPP by describing the responsibilities to be allocated to differ-
    ent Government entities, the project development process, the different
    approvals required at key decision points during the project, and how
    the Government supports PPP transaction preparation, procurement
    and implementation.




      Key Messages for Policy Makers

      • Make sure the different roles are allocated and that the system works, ideological purity is
        less important.
      • Institutions are only as good as the people in them, and the funding/mandate they are
        given. Real capacity building (not just the occasional training or trip abroad) is key to a
        sustainable programme.
      • Strong, consistent leadership is key—coordination amongst different institutions and
        ensuring consistency of practices and focus of efforts generally requires clear direction
        from the highest levels of Government.
      • A robust value for money assessment and transparent, competitive procurement can protect
        the Government and the project from ex-post criticism, and can make the project less
        vulnerable to change, external shocks and the temptation of future Governments to
        reverse decisions.

    within or attached to a key ministry that provides resources for project development or other incentives to use PPP. Typically PPP units have a
    number of functions, including:
    •   improving the policy/legal/regulatory context for PPP
    •   ensuring that the PPP programme is integrated with overall planning, fiscal risk management and regulatory systems
    •   ensuring that projects protect government environmental and social interests and comply with relevant requirements
    •   promoting PPP opportunities at national and regional levels, amongst potential investors and the financial markets and developing those
        projects that maximize value for money, competition and sustainability.
    The PPP unit can provide a single point of contact for investors and government agencies alike, coordinating PPP activities across sectors so that the
    PPP program is as uniform and consistent for investors as possible. A PPP unit usually works best when connected with a key ministry or depart-
    ment (such as the ministry of finance or planning). PPP units with executive powers tend to work better than those who provide solely advisory
    services as they have more influence over contracting agencies.

   Box 3.4: Lessons from London Underground—The Importance of the Regulator

   “We consider that the gathering and publication of information by the PPP Arbiter will generally tend to benefit all interested parties: London
   Underground as client, the Infracos as suppliers and the public as users. The Government should also find such information useful for assessing the
   benefits and costs of similar proposals in the future. There is some evidence to indicate that an earlier review could have mitigated the impact of
   Metronet’s collapse, if not averted it entirely. However, it is important that any reporting process is seen as neutral and is designed to provide the
   information that both the Infracos and London Underground require to address performance issues and to prepare for Periodic Review. It would
   have been wiser to make the annual review an automatic process rather than one which had to be initiated by a party to the contract.”

   Box 3.5: Cost of Public Versus Private Capital

   It is often assumed that public capital is cheaper than private capital, but the two are difficult to compare—the cost of public debt is often (though
   not always) cheaper than private debt, but the actual cost of public capital should include the hidden risk premium of the implicit guarantee of tax-
   payers for public debt (the taxpayer risk making the debt cheaper). The equivalent risk premium is already built-in to the cost of private debt. The
   actual cost of public capital should also include the opportunity cost for the country of using its capital for different purposes. Chile, for example,
   applies a “social discount rate” when it uses its capital for infrastructure as compared to other sectors that would be less likely to attract private
   financing

  Partnership UK (PUK) was formed by the UK Government in June 2000 following the recommendation in the second Sir Malcolm Bates review of
  1999, and absorbed back into HM Treasury in 2012. It was a PPP, majority owned (51%) by private sector shareholders and the remainder retained
  by Government (HM Treasury 44,6% and Scottish Executive 4,4%). PUK supported:
  • individual projects before, during and after procurement—by using its commercial experience and expertise.
  • Government in developing policy and monitoring compliance—by using its market knowledge to ensure that outputs are effective and practical.
  PUK financed itself by charging fees to the public sector for its services, benchmarked against private advisory companies.

    Box 3.11: Public Sector Comparator (PSC)

    A comparison between the cost of public delivery of the project and that through PPP can provide a useful mechanism is assessing value for money.
    But a PSC is difficult to assemble with any accuracy. In order to assess PSC properly, full information is needed on how the project would be imple-
    mented by the public sector, including actual cost of construction, cost of operation, cost of financing and risk borne by the public sector (which is
    difficult to calculate with any accuracy).

    Box 3.12: Delusion and Deception in Risk Assessment

    As human beings, our risk assessment tends to be influenced by personal beliefs or biases, for example:
    •   underestimating the time and cost required to complete a task,
    •   believing we understand risk better than we really do,
    •   underestimating risks associated with familiar tasks, for example traffic accidents while driving to work and slipping in the bathtub,
    •   validating prior decisions.
    There may be collaboration in these influences. This collaboration may have pure motives, for example exaggerating the benefits and underesti-
    mating costs and time to help decision-makers justify a project they believe is important. And yet, this deception ends up costing the taxpayer,
    since risks that are ignored are not managed.

    In amongst the roles played by PPP institutions, this section will
    review methods for the Government to support project preparation
    and implementation, following pre-feasibility and feasibility studies,
    project preparation, the procurement process for PPP projects, and the
    implementation and monitoring of PPP projects.

    Competitive procurement of PPP involves careful preparation,
    reviewing risks and their allocation, identifying market requirements
    and creating a competitive process for selection of the right private
    partner. In its most basic form, the tender (or bid) process involves a
    party offering a project to the market and asking for bids from par-
    ties interested in performing the project, or some part of the project.
    Tendering (or bid) procedures are meant to achieve efﬁciency, manage
    costs, maintain quality, encourage expediency and maximise valuefor-
    money. PPP transactions take time to prepare, and need the attention
    of experts to ensure that risks and ﬁnancing are managed properly
    and efﬁciently and taken to market in a form and manner designed
    to attract as many high quality bidders as possible and thereby keep
    costs down and improve delivery.

    them against the different phases of project development, as per the

   • Do not cut corners in procurement. It may seem easier to enter
     into direct negotiations instead of using competitive procure-
     ment, but it isn’t. It takes longer and costs more money. Maxi-
     mize competition (where possible) through good, transparent,
     competitive procurement.
   • Invest in preparation. PPP preparation takes time and money, if
     done well.
   • Be clear to bidders about what you want. Indicate clearly what
     results, milestones and indicators you want the investor to
     achieve, in particular in the bid evaluation criteria and their
     weighting. Help bidders to give you what you want, don’t make
     them guess.
   • Be cautious when selecting the winning bid. If a bid seems too
     good to be true (financially, technically or otherwise), then it
     probably is.

be developed at this stage, to test the viability of
the project and the potential appetite of investors.
This is an essential stage of project development, to
avoid wasting preparation costs on projects that do
not satisfy this basic test of viability. As part of the
pre-feasibility study, the contracting agency makes a
preliminary assessment of value for money,20 which
tests the value provided by PPP.

  Box 4.1: Optimism Bias or Bad Incentives—How Planning Goes Wrong

  Planning and forecasting need to reflect benefit to the Government, through cost-benefit or value for money assessments. But such assessments
  tend to involve incentives for those performing them to emphasize benefits and de-emphasize costs, whether consciously or not.a There is a similar
  bias towards new build, rather than refurbishing what exists and maintaining it properly. Maintaining a road properly is more than three times less
  expensive than maintaining it poorly and rebuilding later. But the socio-political incentive is to build something big and new that can carry the
  name or be identified with a politician or political party. Khan and Levinson (2011) highlight the failure in the US national highway system to main-
  tain roads properly due in part to the tendency for federal monies to be allocated to new build projects rather than maintenance or refurbishment.b
  The Private Infrastructure Investment Management Center in South Korea routinely rejects 46% of proposed projects (compared with 3% before its
  creation) at a savings of 35% to the Government on poorly planned or selected projects. Similarly, Chile’s national Public Investment System rejects
  25–35% of projects proposed.c

  Key Messages for Policy Makers

  • Select good projects. Garbage-in-garbage-out; say “no” to bad projects
          • Select robust, viable projects for PPP, these are more likely to be financed on a competitive basis and are therefore more likely to provide
             value for money. Projects suffering from bad design, dubious demand or weak fundamentals (even if politically popular) are more likely
             to fail, and may weaken the entire PPP program in the process.
          • If a project needs Government support, get approvals early to avoid wasting time and money on projects that do not meet viability and
             value for money criteria, and the awkward position of Government rejecting support for a project only after preparation.
          • A good, transparent selection process (for commercial rather than political reasons) can reassure investors and increase competition.
             Projects selected for political reasons or priorities will create a perception of increased political risk amongst investors.

Creating a Framework for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Programs: A Practical Guide for Decision-makers




    Key Messages for Policy Makers

    • Prepare the Government to play its part from project development to expiry. Even where a comprehensive PPP is envisaged, the Government will
      play an essential role in monitoring and regulating the project and the sector.
    • Be ready for challenges. In any long-term relationship, change happens. PPP is, above all, a partnership, and it needs to be designed with chal-
      lenges, changes and resolution in mind. Problems need to be elevated to appropriate levels of management before they become disputes or
      worse.
    • Consider all stakeholders. PPP will have a direct influence on some stakeholders (in particular employees and management) and may raise politi-
      cal or philosophical concerns amongst many more. While absolute consensus will never be reached, the Government needs to consult widely,
      understand fundamental concerns and address them.

    Box 4.4: Prequalification Criteria for an Airport Concession

    Each sector and project has its own specificities. For example prequalification criteria for an airport PPP may include:
    •   level of owned total assets in excess of a set amount
    •   recent experience managing the construction and operation of an airport of similar size and complexity in a similar market
    •   recent experience raising similar amounts of debt and equity
    •   exclusion of air carriers, or of companies owned by air carriers, or of operators of airports located close to the site (e.g. within 800 km) (which
        would create a natural conflict of interest)
    Clearly these criteria will need to be adjusted based on market context.

   Key Lessons for Policy Makers

   • Be proactive. Establish mechanisms intended to catch disputes as early as possible. Early in the process, options are varied, relative cost is low,
     and the likelihood of immediate value-added resolution is higher.
   • Facilitation can help. Softer processes are designed to use and develop relationships as the basis for finding mutually satisfactory solutions and
     can work better than more formal processes.
   • Renegotiation can be an opportunity, and can improve the PPP arrangements and protect the poor, if it is contemplated in advance, transparent
     and well managed when needed.
   • Get good advice. Do not try to manage disputes or renegotiations with internal staff alone, no matter how good they are. Get the best, external
     advice. It will cost money, but will save money in the long run.

5                  Using Public Support
                                for PPP



    You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
                                                          —Wayne Gretzky

    Governments can and should use public resources to support and
    enable PPP programs where this provides value for money as an
    integral part of the PPP framework. Figure 5.1 maps out key oppor-
    tunities to use public money to mobilize PPP, including through the
    project development cycle, supporting project preparation, through
    the bidding process, investment mechanisms that can support project
    ﬁnancing and ﬁnally contingent support to reinforce and target the
    incentives fundamental to the project revenue stream and possibly
    reﬁnancing.

    Moving chronologically through the project process, the following
    are some of the key areas the Government can support to help imple-
    ment PPP:

    •   Project preparation—funding and technical support for feasibility
        studies, hiring and managing transaction advisors.
    •   Capital grants and in-kind support—for example offsetting con-
        struction costs, acquiring land, rights of way, etc.
    •   Debt or equity into the project—to supplement available private
        capital.
    •   Contingent support—to address key project risks, for example
        guarantees of demand risk, foreign exchange risk or payment risk.
    •   Revenue support during implementation,—e.g. as key milestones
        are achieved, possibly as a feed-in/shadow tariff or availability
        payment.

    5.1 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PUBLIC SUPPORT

    The Government will need to consider carefully which projects to
    support, how much support to provide, the terms of such support (in
    particular, incentives to create and how to maximize leverage of private
    investment) and how to ensure that support is properly managed.

   Box 5.1: The UK’s Erstwhile PFI Credits

   Until relatively recently, the UK Treasury allocated PFI Credits for both local Government and central level Government departments—a specified
   amount of funding for a specific project over a period of time beyond that of the immediate budget allocation framework. It allowed the local
   authority (or department in the case of central Government) certainty as to a revenue stream from the central budget for meeting its obligations
   under a PPP agreement and provided a strong incentive for departments and local authorities to implement projects as PPPs. The use of PFI credits
   was heavily criticized for creating significant long-term liabilities for the Government. The program has been abandoned officially.

  Availability payment mechanisms place downside risk clearly on the Government, but also ensure the Government benefits from the upside ben-
  efits (if the road is not used, Government still pays, but if it is very successful, the benefits accrue primarily to the Government). Under a toll based
  concession, Government reforms can reduce concessionaire revenues, giving the concessionaire the right to claim lost revenues from the Govern-
  ment. The availability payment allows the Government to make changes without concerns of liabilities to concessionaires.

    Box 5.8: Lessons from London Underground—The Importance of Private Liability

    The London Underground project involved three parallel concessions to run different metro lines. Two of these “infracos” could claim additional
    funds if total cost increases exceeded 50 million pounds sterling ($80 million), the third if it exceeded 200 million pounds sterling ($320 million),
    giving it a powerful incentive to make savings in order to offset any cost increases, rather than seeking additional payments from London Under-
    ground. This has encouraged a considerable level of innovation by the third “infraco”.

    I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we
    must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.

    Financing for PPP ideally involves long tenor debt, at ﬁxed rates.
    This allows the high upfront cost of infrastructure to be spread out
    over its long lifecycle (as much as 30–50 years), and therefore makes
    the infrastructure more affordable; the ﬁxed rates help avoid sud-
    den changes in ﬁnancing costs and therefore user tariffs. Long-term
    ﬁnancing (12–18 years tenor), either with ﬁxed interest rates or with
    variable interest rates that are supported by interest rate swaps to
    become ﬁxed, are generally available in the global currencies, e.g. US
    Dollar, Euro, Yen and Pound Sterling (with notable exceptions during
    the credit crunches in 2008/9 and 2011/12), but is more difﬁcult to
    access in developing ﬁnancial markets.

    Long-term infrastructure investments can provide opportunities to
    debt capital markets, help to increase the depth and breadth of the
    markets, establish robust yield curves, and provide long-term place-
    ment opportunities in local markets that are often starved of such
    opportunities. Long-term capital for infrastructure can provide a
    platform for reforms and market dynamism.

    Accessing long term ﬁnancing for infrastructure in local currency is
    not so simple. Commercial banks in many countries do not have access
    to long-term liquidity. They fund themselves primarily through short
    term deposits. The debt capital markets may offer only short to medium
    term positions (e.g. 3–5 years), depriving banks of the opportunity
    to lay off long-term loans against long term bond issuances. These
    banks will face a “liability mismatch” to the extent they lend long-term
    (long-term loans funded with (the volatility of) short term deposits).

    Governments can do much to mobilize long-term local currency debt.
    Governments regulate ﬁnancial markets, setting rules for banking
    and capital markets, to protect different market actors and encourage

    Box 6.3: Arguments for Government Equity Holdings in Infrastructure

    Some argue that Government should be an equity holder in infrastructure transactions. The argument usually runs that Government needs:
    • A share in the upside of very profitable projects, to ensure that Government gets a piece of the action. Counter-argument: But equity distribu-
      tions in infrastructure are hard to control and harder to forecast. If Government wants to share in the upside, it should require a share of revenues
      or a fixed lease payment instead.
    • Control of the sector—to maintain Government influence over the project and the sector. Counter-argument: But private partners are likely to
      limit real Government control over the project as equity holders to mitigate conflict of interest and ensure that decisions are made on a com-
      mercial rather than political basis. Government would do better maintaining control through regulations and regulatory powers.
    • Access to information—Government may see equity as a mechanism for accessing company information. Counter-argument: However, private
      partners will inevitably establish a governance structure that isolates sensitive information. The Government may find that regulatory powers
      and data gathering of its own will provide a more practical solution to information access.

Aggregate Key Messages for Decision Makers:

•   Learning by doing—an important part of identifying gaps in the
    investment climate is learned while “doing”, while implement-
    ing PPP projects.
•   Use small steps without being timid—start with easier projects that
    are clearly ﬁnancially viable and have political support. But these
    projects need to provide a signalling effect; they need to be suf-
    ﬁciently substantial and strategic to ensure Government buy-in,
    the interests of private investors and a statement to the market
    that the framework for PPP in the country is conducive.
•   Learn from the experiences of others, without being dogmatic—there
    is a tendency to try to replicate the successes of other countries.
    While it is important to learn from the successes and failures of
    others, it is generally unwise to try to replicate an entire frame-
    work, wholesale.
•   Keep it simple—complex is not necessarily comprehensive or bet-
    ter, the PPP framework needs to be understood by a wide group
    of stakeholders.
•   PPP policies should be clear, comprehensive, yet ﬂexible—periodic
    updates are a useful way to adopt lessons learned into the PPP
    program.
•   Keep the legal framework simple and clear. Do not confuse complex-
    ity with comprehensiveness. Simple is better, and will give more
    conﬁdence to investors. Detail is best left to secondary legislation
    that is more easily amended to respond to change.
•   Do not use the legal framework to second guess the PPP contract by
    creating rights and obligations at law that should be addressed in the
    contract on agreed terms. If the Government is keen to establish
    such terms, standard form documents can achieve this, where
    the terms can be spelled out in detail.
•   Make sure the different roles are allocated and that the system works,
    ideological purity is less important.
•   Institutions are only as good as the people in them, and the fund-
    ing/mandate they are given. Real capacity building (not just
    the occasional training or trip abroad) is key to a sustainable
    programme.
