2   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY
                              This Primer is primarily intended for entities looking specifically to
                              design projects on sustainable land management (SLM) for submission
                              to the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This Primer addresses
                              all aspects of developing of such a project, including priorities of
                              the GEF as financial mechanism of the UN Convention to Combat
                              Desertification (UNCCD).

                              Land degradation is recognized as a global phenomenon that
                              influences ecosystem services and productivity of agro-ecosystems,
Dr. Naoko Ishii               as well as human livelihoods. It is a major threat to biodiversity and
CEO and Chairperson           ecosystem stability and function. Land degradation is also a serious
Global Environment Facility   threat to food security, income, and livelihoods of rural populations,
                              especially in developing countries, and thus has major ecological,
                              social, economic, and cultural significance.

                              Addressing land degradation requires concerted effort at local,
                              national, regional, and global scales, with innovative approaches
                              and solutions in agricultural, rangeland, and forest landscapes.
                              Understanding the GEF mandate and approach to financing, as well as
                              the opportunity for cross-focal area programming to demonstrate and
                              harness synergy with other GEF focal areas, is therefore essential to
                              designing good projects on sustainable land management.

                              This Primer provides step-by-step directions on how to access GEF
                              funds under the Land Degradation Focal Area, including projects
                              utilizing funds from the Biodiversity, Climate Change, and International
                              Waters Focal Areas. The Primer also provides helpful insights into how
                              to design a good project proposal, covering all stages of the GEF
                              project cycle.

                              Although all projects must involve one of the Agencies, it is essential
                              that all potential executing partners understand how GEF resources
                              can be best harnessed to generate global environment benefits
                              in the context of sustainable development. Hence, this Primer is
                              relevant for government agencies, development partners, civil society
                              organizations, private sector entities, scientific institutions, and any
                              entity interested in GEF projects on sustainable land management.

22	 Refer to the core GEF Gender Indicators identified under the gender section of the Strategic Positioning Paper forGEF-6 replenishment. The five
    Gender Indicators are:
    1. Percentage of projects that have conducted gender analysis during project preparation.
    2. Percentage of projects that have incorporated gender sensitive project results framework, including gender sensitive actions, indicators, targets,
    and/or budget.
    3. Share of women and men as direct beneficiaries of project.
    4. Number of national/regional/global policies, legislations, plan, and strategies that incorporates gender dimensions (e.g. NBSAP, NAPA, NAP, TDA/SAP, etc).
    5. Percentage of Project Implementation Reports (PIR), Mid-term Evaluation (MTE) and Terminal Evaluation Reports (TER) that incorporate gender
    equality and women’s empowerment and assess results/progress. Projects will use gender-sensitive indicators and sex-disaggregated data, and it will
    be systematically recorded, reported and integrated into adaptive management responses at the project level. GEF will undertake periodic reviews of
    the portfolio and highlight best practices in mainstreaming gender in projects, including through Annual Monitoring Review and Learning Missions.
