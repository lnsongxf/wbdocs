I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Guinea perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Guinea
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Guinea
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April to May 2016, 492 stakeholders of the WBG in Guinea were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 384 stakeholders participated in
the survey (78% response rate).
Respondents completed the questionnaire with a representative from the fielding agency.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Guinea; their overall attitudes toward the
WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working
with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in Guinea; and the WBG’s communication and
information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 75%, N=383). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 99).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister were
       combined with respondents from the office of a minister; respondents from PMUs and
       consultants working on WBG-supported projects were combined with employees of
       ministries; respondents from financial sector/private banks were combined with those
       from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based
       organizations, youth groups, faith-based groups, private foundations, and trade unions
       were combined in the “CSO” category; and the few respondents from academia/research
       institutes/think tanks, bilateral/multilateral agencies, and the judiciary branch were
       included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly more
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey (mean
        familiarity rating in FY’16 = 6.1; mean familiarity rating in FY’13 = 5.7).1
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Guinea, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Guinea, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

Headed in the Right Direction2
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents were significantly less likely to believe that
           Guinea is headed in the right direction compared to respondents in the FY’13 Country
           Survey.
          Stakeholder groups: In this year’s Country Survey, respondents from the Office of the
           President/Prime Minister/Minister and local governments were significantly more likely
           to indicate that Guinea is headed in the right direction, whereas respondents from the
           office of a parliamentarian were least positive about the prospect of Guinea.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Guinea, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty three specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Guinea. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at health; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Guinea, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Guinea? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

 FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 370  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 383

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

 and equity. It will seek to foster income growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s
 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the less
 well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the following
 TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Guinea? (Choose no more than TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to micro-finance for the poor
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
  10   Better employment opportunities for young people
  11   Better employment opportunities for women
