Over the past ten to fifteen years, migration to Belize
has increased sharply, fueled heavily by political
instability and unemployment in neighboring Central
American countries and Mexico. While migrants have
been absorbed fairly quickly into the Belizean labor
market, native unemployment has remained high,
creating questions about the role of migration in
poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Belize. While
attributing native unemployment in Belize to high
migrant employment may be tempting, the data
available does not suggest a strong causal relationship
between the two phenomena. At the district level,
native unemployment does not appear correlated to
migrant labor market participation. In places where
migrants appear to access employment opportunities
by accepting wages that natives would not, the result
may be the survival of agricultural and service industries
with low and variable profit margins. It is possible that
firms in these industries would close if they could not
rely on migrants and instead had to pay higher wages
to natives; field research would be necessary to
substantiate this claim. Thus, migration’s effect on
native employment is unclear.

goods within the country and internationally to
neighboring states. In addition, port capacity is also        
very limited with only one port operating in the country
and at non-competitive prices, thus increasing costs to
exporters. According to the Doing Business report, the
estimated cost for exporting a container from Belize is
higher than both the Latin America and Caribbean and
OECD averages (respectively, $1,355; $1,299; and
$1,080). In addition, firm-level data (ES 2011) reveal
that 36.4 percent of enterprises identify electricity as a
major constraint. Electricity rates for commercial and
industrial enterprises range from USD 0.33 – 0.44,
depending on consumption levels. These are
considerably high, similar to the rates observed in the
Caribbean, but higher than rates in Central American
countries, which rely mostly on hydro sources.
Agriculture sector representatives highlight that
infrastructure deficiencies constrain investments in
output growth and hamper the competitiveness of
exports due to higher freight costs. Consultations with
tour operators and other industry representatives
indicate that the road infrastructure also impacts the
growth of the industry.

Reducing crime and violence can help in many ways,
including reducing costs, improving productivity,
increasing investments and ultimately growth. The
relationship between insecurity and development is
complex, but in Belize’s recent history, the deterioration
in crime rates have coincided with somewhat lackluster
economic and social indicators. After a period of
relatively rapid economic growth between 1998 and
2003, Belize’s GDP grew (only 3.1 percent in real terms
from 2004 to 2012) barely above the 2.65 percent
annual growth in the country’s population, with the
result that GDP per capita has remained broadly
unchanged in real terms since 2004. Unemployment,
on the other hand, has increased from 8 to 14 percent in
recent years (and even more among youth, 23 percent

exports. This is exemplified by the importance of
services—in particular trade and transport services
and other private services—as labor inputs for sectors
such as agriculture, forestry and fishers, processed
foods, and machinery and equipment. This is particularly
relevant for global-value-chain-oriented sectors that
may import foreign inputs and rely heavily on labor and
services as domestic inputs. The government should
look to reduce regulatory policies that act as barriers to
services provision, both domestically and by
international services suppliers.

Finally, the government should seek policies to
enhance the backward linkages between tourism and
other sectors including agriculture and processed
foods. The low backward linkages of trade and
transport services relative to peer countries suggests
room to grow the linkages with domestic suppliers,
which may be prevented currently by a weak supporting
industry. This includes policies to strengthen the
linkages with sectors including agricultural or processed
food inputs, growth of which would simultaneously
support shared prosperity. Caution is warranted,
however, not to put in place policies that act as anti-
import biases, which would raise agricultural prices in
Belize and harm poorer populations outside the
agricultural sector.

Source: The central scenarios are developed using a real interest rate of 4.5 percent for external debt, and 3 percent for domestic debt. For simplicity, we
assume that interest accrued for 4 years after the nationalizations before compensation payments are made at the (nominal) external debt interest rate of
6 percent. Interest amounts to US$48 million, for a total of US$230 million or 14 percent of 2014 GDP in compensation payments. The scenarios are the
following: Scenario 1: Foreign-financed instalments. The government of Belize pays compensations with a net present value of US$230 million in equal
yearly instalments of US$54 million over a period of five years starting in 2016. The outstanding debt continues to accrue interest at 6 percent per year. The
government raises external commercial debt to fund compensations. External commercial debt carries an interest rate of 6 percent per year. Scenario 2:
Domestically financed instalments. Same as above, but the government issues domestic debt to fund compensations. Conversion of compensations into
foreign currency for transfer abroad reduces central bank reserves. Scenario 3: Foreign-financed one-off payment. The government of Belize pays
compensations in one payment in 2016 with external commercial financing; one-time transfers to the former owners are made by the companies. Scenario
4: Domestically financed one-off payment. Same as above but payments are made with domestic financing and reserve draw-down.

     Box 5: The World Bank’s Adjustment Net Savings Indicator


     First appearing in the 1999 edition of the World Development Indicators, the World Bank’s adjusted net savings
     (ANS) indicator was created to give national-level decision makers a clear, relatively simple measure of how
     sustainable their countries’ growth policies are. While standard national accounts (SNA) only consider the
     value of a limited set of manufactured capital and assets, ANS offers a more inclusive picture of changes in a
     comprehensive set of capital assets that constitute a nation’s wealth base, including a knowledgeable and
     skilled workforce and natural resources such as forests, fossil energy, metals, and minerals. The indicator
     also captures changes in these assets due to pollution and climate change. Positive saving indicates an
     investment in the future—that a nation is accumulating the assets needed to build up its wealth and ensure
     its economic growth over the longer term. Years of negative saving, on the other hand, suggests that a
     country is running down its capital stock and is on an unsustainable growth path.
     Adjusted net saving is derived from the standard national accounting measure of gross national saving (GNS),
     by making four types of adjustments:

     1.	 Deduction for the depreciation of produced capital, measured by the consumption of fixed capital, which
         equals net national saving;
     2.	 Addition of investments in human capital, measured by current public expenditures on education;
     3.	 Deduction for the depletion of natural capital, including minerals, energy, and forest resources; and
     4.	 Deduction for the damages from pollution, including carbon emissions and exposure to particulate
         matter.

     It is important to note that these estimates are indicative and provide a big picture overview, as they are
     based on publically available global databases. The benefit of the ANS dataset is the ability to assess cross-
     country comparisons and time trends in a consistent framework. But a more robust picture of Belize’s
     adjusted net savings can be achieved through a thorough assessment using country-specific data, modifying
     any methodological assumptions to its country context, and adding relevant missing natural capital
     components (e.g., land degradation).

     Box 6: Indigenous Peoples in Belize Have Used the Court System to Assert their Land Rights


     SATIIM, the Toledo Alcaldes Association, the Toledo Maya Cultural Council, and the Maya Leaders Alliance
     have managed to use the court system to protect and assert collective indigenous ownership over ancestral
     Mayan lands. Key court cases and rulings include the following:
     n	 In 1996, the Mayan communities launched their first legal challenge against the Belizean government
         over land rights. This was followed in 1998 by two indigenous peoples rights groups, the U.S.-based Indian
         Law Resource Center and the Toledo Maya Cultural Council, which filed a petition to the Inter-American
         Commission on Human Rights (ICHR) arguing that by granting logging and oil concessions in indigenous
         territories without local consultation, the Belizean government was violating certain rights guaranteed
         under the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In October 2004, the ICHR ruled in favor
         of the petitioners, concluding that the failure of the government to consult with the Mayan people, and
         the negative environmental effects arising from the concessions, constituted violations under
         international human rights law.
     n	   In 2007, the Supreme Court determined that the Mayan communities of Conejo and Santa Cruz hold
          customary title to their lands and ordered the government to respect and demarcate their territory. The
          Supreme Court confirmed that the nature of the interest of the title was communal and constitutes
          property under the Constitution of Belize. Moreover, it found that the granting of concessions to third
          parties to utilize the property and resources located on lands belonging to the communities of Conejo and
          Santa Cruz amounts to a violation of the Constitution.
     n	   In 2008, the Supreme Court extended the findings with respect to the communities of Conejo and Santa
          Cruz to all Maya villages in Toledo and five additional Maya villages in Stann Creek to the extent that the
          Court confirmed the existence of customary land tenure. In addition, the Supreme Court found that
          there is an obligation on behalf of the Government of Belize to adopt affirmative measures and, in
          consultation with the Mayan communities, develop the legislative, administrative or other measures
          necessary to create an effective mechanism to identify and protect Maya customary property rights.
     n	   In 2010, the Court of Appeal affirmed that all Mayan communities in the Toledo District hold customary
          collective rights over the land and resources. The Court of Appeal did not uphold that the Government
          would have to take affirmative legislative, administrative or other measures as per the earlier Supreme
          Court decisions.
     n	   The above referenced court decisions notwithstanding, the Government of Belize approved US Capital
          Energy activities within the region in and around the Sarstoon Temash National Park without consulting
          with the local Mayan communities.
     n	   In 2013, SATIIM filed another lawsuit against the government and US Capital Belize Energy Ltd, and in
          April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that the permits granted to the oil company for oil drilling and road
          construction violated the applicable principle of free, prior and informed consent and were unreasonable
          and unlawful, but did not render them void.
     n	   Both the MLA and TAA, as well as the Government of Belize cross appealed the 2010 decision by the
          Court of Appeal to the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), the highest appellate court of Belize. On April
          25, 2015, the CCJ issued a consent order as negotiated by the MLA et al on the one hand and the
          Government of Belize on the other clarifying the level of protection of indigenous land rights. The CCJ
          confirmed the existence of customary land tenure in Maya villages in the Toledo district and the need for
          the Government of Belize to identify and protect the rights of the Maya communities. The CCJ also
          expects the parties to report back on compliance with the consent order by April 30, 2016.

4, public debt levels can increase substantially
depending on the outcome of court decisions on the
compensation payments for the nationalized utilities.
While the government has made sensible provisions to
face the costs of the arbitration, the final outcome
could require additional funding which is hard to predict
with precision at this point. In that context, Belize would
do well in safeguarding fiscal sustainability by continuing
to seek ways to strengthen its fiscal position and
reduce its debt level as a share of GDP. As a small and
largely open economy, Belize is exposed to large terms-
of-trade shocks that can introduce output fluctuation
and affect growth negatively. A sure way to mitigate
against external shocks is by building fiscal buffers that
could help the authorities to keep a counter-cyclical
fiscal stance. While the short-to-medium term outlook
for Belize remain broadly favorable, projects financed
with PetroCaribe resources may become future fiscal
liabilities. Continued efforts to promote fiscal
consolidation would help create fiscal space to finance
priority expenditures (on education and resilience, for
example) and boost the income of the bottom 40% of
the population.

    Box 1: Mennonite community in Belize


    In 1959, some 3,000 Mennonites moved to Belize, hoping to start a farming community. They signed a special
    agreement with the government that exempt them from military service and certain forms of taxation while
    giving them complete freedom to farm within their communities.

    Since then the Mennonite community has grown in size and presence, expanding to areas of Corozal, Orange
    Walk and Cayo, in addition to original settlement by the River Hondo. Currently, the overall Mennonite
    community has around 10,000 members or 3% of the country’s population. They keep expanding by buying
    more land to accommodate the aspirations of the young Mennonites and have started taking loans from
    commercial banks to ensure planned growth.

    The Mennonites grow a significant amount Belize’s food output and are critical for the country’s food security.
    They have started attracting buyers from Trinidad & Tobago and Jamaica. Their principles include:
    o	 Common vision
    o	 Integrated and mixed farming system with collective approach to solving common challenges
    o	 Soil management and conservation in energy use and the environment
    o	 Wide skill base

    In addition to strong agricultural skills, members of the progressive Mennonite community have an established
    network of production, transport and distribution of agricultural goods and beef cattle, mainly focusing on
    chicken, eggs, dairy, beans and fruit. They are vertically integrated in feed, storage and finished products.
    These goods are distributed locally, as well as for export.
