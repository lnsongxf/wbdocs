THE FRUIT OF HER LABOR
PROMOTING GENDER-EQUITABLE
AGRIBUSINESS IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA

I. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT:
GENDER IN PNG AGRICULTURE
The World Bank Group recently completed a study of gender issues in three
agribusiness supply chains in Papua New Guinea (PNG) − coffee, cocoa, and
fresh produce. It found women to be key to ensuring quality in PNG agriculture.
Therefore, if PNG wants to export better quality coffee and cocoa, and to bring
better quality fresh produce to market, it needs to focus on the contribution of
women; to improve their skills and capacities, and to give women a bigger share of
the benefits.

Agriculture accounts for approximately one-third of GDP in PNG, and the sector
is dominated by smallholder farming systems. Coffee and cocoa are – along with oil
palm – the main cash crops, with respectively over 30 percent and 20 percent of the
total labor force involved in their production, processing and sale.


   The coffee industry is a major contributor to national income and
   employment, as almost 3 million people depend directly or indirectly on coffee.
   Productivity is low, with yields on average 30-50 percent of their potential, and
   quality has also been deteriorating.

   Cocoa is one of PNG’s major agricultural exports, with an estimated 151,000
   households, or about 1 million people, involved in the industry. The cocoa
   sector has been devastated by the emergence of cocoa pod borer (CPB). In
   East New Britain, production is estimated to have declined by 80 percent as a
   result of CPB.

   The fresh produce industry has great potential in PNG. Market demand
   for fresh produce is likely to remain high in years to come, due largely to
   resource-led development, increased urbanization, and a general rise in
   standards of living.
