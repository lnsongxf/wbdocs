 Definitions
 Under-five mortality rate: Probability of dying between birth and exactly five years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.
 Infant mortality rate: Probability of dying between birth and exactly one year of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.
 Neonatal mortality rate: Probability of dying in the first month of life, expressed per 1,000 live births.
 Note: Upper and lower bounds refer to the 90 percent uncertainty intervals for the estimates. Estimates are generated by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation to ensure comparability;
 they are not necessarily the official statistics of UN Member States, which may use alternative rigorous methods.
 a	 The sum of the number of deaths by region may differ from the world total because of rounding.

The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation

The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) was
formed in 2004 to share data on child mortality, harmonize estimates
within the UN system, improve methods for child mortality estimation,
report on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and
enhance country capacity to produce timely and properly assessed
estimates of child mortality. The UN IGME includes the United Nations
Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the
United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and
Social Affairs as full members.

The UN IGME’s independent Technical Advisory Group, comprising
eminent scholars and independent experts in demography, provides
technical guidance on estimation methods, technical issues and strategies
for data analysis and data quality assessment.

The UN IGME updates its child mortality estimates annually after
reviewing newly available data and assessing data quality. This report
contains the latest UN IGME estimates of child mortality at the country,
regional and global levels. Country-specific estimates and the data used to
derive them are available at www.childmortality.org.
