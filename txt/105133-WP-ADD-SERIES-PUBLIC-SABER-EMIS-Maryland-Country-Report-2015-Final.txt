      1. Enabling Environment
         EMIS in the State of Maryland is supported by strong policies, people, and
         processes at state and local levels. The Code of Maryland Regulations
         (COMAR) effectively positions the state-level EMIS managed by the Maryland
         State Department of Education (MSDE) as the point of reference system that
         collects, processes, and disseminates education data on a regular basis. With
         a decentralized state education system, in which counties are autonomous
         and independent in many areas of decision making, COMAR effectively
         regulates and empowers counties to build systems and innovate in relation to
         reporting, managing, and using data. In this way, COMAR guides the
         systematic flow of data from schools to counties and finally to MSDE. Each
         county has an EMIS, selected and managed independently by the county and
         integrated with the overarching state-level EMIS. The strong legal framework
         lays the foundation for key ingredients that contribute to Maryland’s advanced
         enabling environment, including talented human resources, a dedicated
         budget augmented by federal and state partial funding, and a statewide data-
         driven culture. Powered by clear vision from high-level decision makers and
         solid buy-in from leaders across the education system, EMIS has evolved from
         a focus on compliance to a more innovative, learning-focused approach to
         data management and utilization. New institutionalization strategies and
         incentive structures put Maryland at the forefront of this national trend in the
         United States.
      2. System Soundness
         Each county has an established EMIS, although they vary widely in terms of
         design and degree of advancement. Each county has a data warehouse.
         Some systems have been built in-house and others purchased off the shelf.
         The state-level EMIS was built in-house and comprises three primary systems:
         (1) the Educational Data Warehouse (EDW), (2) the Longitudinal Data System
         (LDS), and (3) the Web Data Collection System (WDCS). The EDW is the hub
         for statewide K12 education data. Data coverage in the EDW includes
         administrative and learning outcomes data. Established in 2010, the LDS
         integrates K12 with higher education and workforce data and receives
         additional flat file transfers for early childhood, career and technology
         education, and special education data. The LDS infrastructure is established,
         although all data have not yet been fully loaded. MSDE tries to establish clear
         data-sharing processes, but some counties report that at times MSDE makes
         changes to data requirements, requests data outside of designated times with
         short notice, and requests already collected data, indicating gaps in
         coordination and communication. The lack of fully integrated financial and
         human resources data at county and state levels creates data siloes, limiting
         comprehensive EMIS functionality.
3. Quality Data
   Quality data are effectively mandated by federal and state policies and
   implemented through a variety of systematic processes. First, “The Maryland
   Student Records System Manual” documents procedures for maintenance of
   student data across a decentralized education system by sharing
   requirements and maintenance directions on topics such as data definitions,
   sample forms, relevant policies, and data coding requirements. An array of
   other manuals are regularly updated at the state level and circulated to
   counties describing processes and requirements for reporting, such as the
   “Attendance Procedures and Web Data Collection System User Manual” and
   the “High School Assessment Status and Completers Reporting and
   Procedures Manual.” Second, with regard to flow of data, schools report data
   to counties through a variety of different digital systems that are unique to
   each county. Counties then input student data into the EDW by uploading flat
   text files through the WDCS. The WDCS is a common, data-inputting interface
   across different county systems. At the state level, data flow is supported by a
   Data Governance Plan that guides the response to data requests and informs
   the collection, reporting, and use of data. Third, multiple points of validation
   exist to ensure accurate reporting. Data are validated first when they are
   transferred from schools to counties, and again through the WDCS when data
   move from counties to the state-level EDW. Finally, access to data is restricted
   to relevant staff and data privacy measures are strictly enforced at all levels.

4. Utilization for Decision Making
    Data utilization in Maryland is embedded in the policy framework and
    enhanced through a common culture that recognizes the value of data. With
    this foundation, data are utilized in decision making by different stakeholders
    at all levels of the education system (e.g., policy makers, principals, teachers,
    administrators, parents, students). Parents and students have real-time
    access to student learning data. Teachers use data to track progress toward
    Student Learning Objectives. Principals and school administrators actively
    use data to evaluate teachers, monitor school progress, and manage school
    plans. Policy makers use data to monitor education quality and equity,
    improve accountability, and gauge effectiveness of policies and programs. In
    addition, data are accessible to the general public, media, and researchers for
    academic pursuits. Utilization of data in the classroom for instructional gains
    varies between counties, with some counties stronger in this area than others.
    Further, digital learning programs used in the classroom are often not
    recorded in the county EMIS, missing an opportunity to collect another aspect
    of student learning data. Utilization would be stronger if more collaboration
    occurred between counties. Minimal collaboration between counties limits
    opportunities to learn from peers, share resources, and strengthen systems.
    These opportunities for sharing of resources would be especially
    advantageous to counties operating on lower budgets. If constructed
    effectively under an overarching EMIS strategy, counties could benefit from
    collective bargaining power and more efficient use of resources, while MSDE
    could leverage statewide experience in EMIS implementation to ultimately
    achieve better education results.

In 2001, these early efforts were further supported at the
federal level with the reauthorization of ESEA as No Child
Left Behind, which mandated annual testing, reporting of
individual student results, and disaggregation of results
by race and special services groups. Soon after, between
2003 and 2015, a series of curriculum and assessment
reforms were adopted in Maryland, which used
assessment data not just for compliance with federal
policies, but also to guide instructional improvement. In
2003 the Maryland School Assessment (MSA) Program

       The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)
       initiative collects data on the policies and institutions of education
       systems around the world and benchmarks them against practices
       associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
       with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators,
       teachers, and parents to policy makers and business people—an
       accessible, detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of
       their country's education system are oriented toward ensuring that
       all children and youth learn.

       This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of Education
       Management Information Systems.
