Rural Road Pavement and Surfacing Design
Options

 Key Messages
       1.      Rural roads that are designed to be compatible with their task and their local
               environment are more effective in terms of whole life costs than those that are not.
       2.      Poorly or inappropriately maintained rural roads are very likely to fall short of design
               life performance targets.
       3.      Current Vietnam rural road design and construction procedures are, in many
               instances, out of step with current National and Regional research and International
               practice.


 Key Actions
       1.      Final assessments of the conditions of the trial pavement, particularly with respect to
               climate impacts.
       2.      Upgrade of Vietnamese rural road standards, specifications and design guidelines to
               take into account recent research and potential climate threats.
       3.      Increased focus on meeting the challenge of funding effective rural road maintenance.

 Some Practical Outcomes of the RRSR
 Programme
 Under SEACAP and subsequently under World Bank the outcomes from the RRSR work have been
 disseminated through technical papers and workshops. Practical outcomes from the RRSR may be
 summarised as follows:

 1.      Strategic change in pavement option selection between RT2 and RT3 in Vietnam; under RT2 the
         roads were approximately 80% unsealed whilst in RT3 the roads are approximately 85% sealed.
 2.      ADB have adopted a policy of promoting sealed or non-reinforced concrete pavements (rather than
         as previously adopting unsealed gravel) for irrigation project roads in their rural road programmes in
         Vietnam and in Lao
 3.      Outcomes from the RRSR work were incorporated into aspects of the World Bank funded Ethiopian
         Low Volume Road Design Manual and are included in the DFID-funded South Sudan Low Volume
         Road Design Manual.
 4.      RRSR outcomes formed part of the recommendations on Appropriate Standards and Specifications to
         the relevant Cambodian and Lao PDR ministries between 2007 and 2009.
 5.      The RRSR principles with respect to the Road Environment and Low Volume Road design have been
         included in a current ADB climate resilient infrastructure projects in Bangladesh and Laos.
 6.      RRSR recommendations on the road environment and pavement design have been included in the
         current Lao Poverty Reduction Fund programme (PRF-II, funded by World Bank).
 7.      The incorporation of RRSR content within teaching and research modules at the University of
         Transport and Communications (Vietnam).
