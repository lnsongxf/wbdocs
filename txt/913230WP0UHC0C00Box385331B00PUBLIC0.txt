Abstract: While Universal Health Coverage (UHC) offers a powerful goal for a nation, all countries-
irrespective of income- are struggling with achieving or sustaining UHC. France is a high-income country
where health coverage is in effect universal. Health-related costs are covered by a mix of mandatory
Social Health Insurance (SHI) and private complementary schemes, while benefit packages are
comprehensive, uniform and of good quality. France provides some of the highest financial protection
among countries in the OECD. Still, under pressure to sustain UHC without compromising equity of
access, the system has been fine-tuned continually since inception. Much can be learned from France’s
experience in its reforms toward better fiscal sustainability, equity and efficiency. The main purpose of the
study is to assess major challenges that France has faced for sustaining UHC, and to share its
experiences and lessons in addressing system bottlenecks to benefit less developed countries as they
embark on the path to UHC.

  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: LESSONS FROM FRANCE’S EXPERIENCE
France has an employment-based social health insurance (SHI) system that attained universal health
coverage (UHC) in 2000 by introducing a state-funded insurance scheme for the poorest segment of the
population. Mandatory health insurance provides a broad benefit basket but demands high cost sharing
for all essential services. Reliance on private complementary (top-up) insurance for covering these costs
has raised concerns over solidarity, redistribution, and efficiency in the system. Under pressure to sustain
UHC without compromising equity of access, the system has been fine-tuned continually since inception.
Much can be learned from France’s experience in its reforms toward better fiscal sustainability, equity,
and efficiency.
Resources diversification and expenditure control
To assure financial sustainability, sources of funding have been broadened in the past 10 years beyond
just payroll contributions to include a broader range of income including that from financial assets and
investments. The government has come to play a greater role in managing health expenditure through
the introduction of spending targets and rigorous monitoring mechanisms for health insurance funds,
deviating from its origins in independent management of social security.
Necessity of complementary schemes to address equity concerns
The original design, based on cost sharing for all services, required the launching of complementary
schemes to address inequalities. The state-funded insurance program for the poorest (Universal Medical
Coverage) has improved access to care for these groups, but the cost-effectiveness of other targeted
measures, in the forms of vouchers and financial incentives improving access to private complementary
insurance, is questionable. France’s experience suggests that a more comprehensive SHI design for
essential services may be more cost-effective for tackling inequalities than incremental adjustments
through a multiplicity of complementary schemes.
More attention to primary care
Improving the quality and efficiency of primary care has been recognized as a key strategy for ensuring
equity of access and efficiency of the health system in France, as elsewhere. A soft gatekeeping
instrument has been introduced to better manage care pathways, but has had limited effects on overall
spending. France’s experience with pay-for-performance for general practitioners shows that this
approach can improve quality and accountability of providers, but fee-for-service limits the ability to
change clinicians’ behavior for ensuring care coordination and efficiency in the long run.
Improving efficiency and governance of the hospital sector
Payment associated with diagnosis-related groups has helped improve hospital productivity, but France’s
experience shows that to deal with the adverse effects of such payment, a strong information system—
monitoring both costs and quality of services—is essential. Empowering hospital leadership has proven
necessary to drive public hospitals toward a more performance-oriented approach and to improve
accountability. To reduce fragmentation in health care provision and improve allocative efficiency, France
has also taken steps to move away from centralized governance, shifting responsibility to regional health
agencies that oversee all health services for their populations.

                                          INTRODUCTION
To reach the highest attainable standard of health is an objective that has driven health policy nationally
and globally for the last 50 years. In 2012, a resolution of the United Nations reaffirmed this goal by
highlighting the importance of promoting universal health coverage (UHC) by improving financial
protection and access to health services worldwide. In December 2013, the president of the World Bank,
Jim Yong Kim, strongly committed the institution to helping countries advance UHC and proposed, with
the World Health Organization, a set of core indicators to track progress toward UHC worldwide.
While UHC offers a powerful goal for a nation, all countries—irrespective of income—are struggling with
achieving or sustaining UHC. Nearly 30 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have made notable
progress toward expanding health coverage and financial protection. Almost all high-income countries
have achieved UHC but are also facing challenges in financing it efficiently and sustainably. There is
growing interest among LMICs to incorporate UHC as one of the goals of their national development
plans.
Health coverage has several dimensions, including (i) breadth of coverage to ensure access to health
services across different population groups (Who is covered?); (ii) depth and scope of coverage in the
range of benefits and services offered (What is covered?); and (iii) financial protection against out-of-
pocket and catastrophic health spending (World Health Organization, WHO). A UHC-related goal is to
establish an inclusive and sustainable health system—one that ensures equitable and affordable access
to health care for all members of society, that provides adequate financial protection, and that contributes
ultimately to the well-being of individual citizens and of society as a whole.
LMICs face multiple constraints in expanding health coverage, including limited financial resources from
both public and private sources and low quality of care and productivity of services. Because of the
complexity of interactions that influence health coverage, identifying the key constraints and designing
feasible solutions to overcome these barriers is daunting. Still, lessons from high-income countries that
have expanded coverage and financial protection in past decades could be useful in LMIC settings.
France is a high-income country where health coverage is in effect universal. Health-related costs are
covered by a mix of statutory insurance and private complementary schemes, while benefit packages are
comprehensive, uniform, and of good quality. France provides some of the highest financial protection of
health expenses among countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (OECD 2013). The state of health care in France is generally good but has some apparent
contradictions. On the one hand, indicators such as life expectancy (81 years) and healthy life expectancy
(72 years) show that the health of the population is good and above the OECD standard (OECD 2013). In
particular, women live longer, and the elderly remain in better health than in many other European
countries. France also compares well on cardiovascular diseases, while its relative position on mortality
due to alcoholism, cirrhosis, and cancer of the cervix is improving. On the other hand, it suffers from a
high rate of premature male deaths from accidents and unhealthy habits (smoking and alcoholism), and
social and geographic inequalities in health remain substantial for such a high-income setting (Chevreul
et al. 2010). France has one of the widest socioeconomic inequalities in health outcomes and in access to
health services in Western Europe.

Purpose and Structure
The main purpose of this case study is to assess major challenges that France has faced—and still
faces—for sustaining UHC and to share its experiences and lessons in addressing system bottlenecks to
benefit less developed countries as they embark on the path to UHC.
After reviewing the main features and the sequencing of France’s UHC strategy (section 1), the study
assesses the fiscal challenges associated with UHC financing (section 2). The section characterizes
health deficits and analyzes strategies used to diversify sources of revenue in recent years. It also profiles
the policies used to curb spending. Section 3 looks at the equity gap. After characterizing the scope of
health inequalities, it reviews existing measures and recent reforms to tackle inequalities in access to
care. It closes by examining recent cost-control strategies and their potentially adverse effects on
financial protection, especially among the worse off.

                                                      2
Section 4 looks at efficiency and payment in service delivery—analyzing the main sources of inefficiency
in the service delivery system—and presents the contents and the early effects of recently introduced
measures to improve system efficiency and quality in primary and acute care, where it pays particular
attention to the effects of new payment systems. Section 5 rounds off the document with a review of
health governance issues, in a period when—to move away from traditional fragmented and centralized
management—France initiated structural reform for shifting decision-making power in the health sector to
regional health agencies (agences régionales de santé).

      SECTION 1: UHC IN FRANCE: A LONG-STANDING OBJECTIVE
       Summary: France provides health coverage to its entire population through social health
       insurance (SHI). Health coverage is provided through multiple schemes for the various
       employment-based groups. The benefit package, which became equal across schemes only
       recently, is quite broad. Financial protection, though it relies on cost sharing, is among the
       highest in OECD countries. Most of the population has complementary private insurance to
       cover copayments. Service delivery is dominated by a fee-for-service (FFS) payment system
       for a mix of public and private providers.

                            1.1      UHC: THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A CENTURY
France’s current health insurance system was shaped over more than a century. Post–World War II
reforms established a wage-based system for the formal sector; civil servants and remaining population
groups were gradually covered in the following four decades. The objective of providing coverage for the
whole population was finally achieved in 2000 when the state passed the Universal Medical Coverage
          1
(CMU) Act for all legal residents, irrespective of work status.
The system derives from the tradition of mutuelle-based organizations, in place since the French
Revolution (1791). At that time, provident societies (sociétés de secours mutuel) provided their
contributing members with financial support in the event of death or disease. The 19th century was
marked by the launch of targeted schemes run by the state to cover, among other contingencies, health
risks. However, population coverage and the provision of benefits remained low, as the schemes were
based on voluntary contributions.
After World War I, the first compulsory scheme was set up for industry workers in the Alsace-Lorraine
region bordering Germany. This served as a catalyst for the development of a broader insurance system
in the 1930s to cover the whole country (the Social Health Insurance Act). The system was based on
contributions from employees and employers in industry and business and provided coverage for illness,
motherhood, disability, old age, and death. This period in France (characterized as the “welfare state”)
was marked by deeper state involvement in social protection.
A major stride in establishing a nationwide compulsory health insurance system took place just after
World War II. In 1945, a general insurance scheme (the Régime Général) was adopted under the Social
Health Insurance Act to provide a compulsory system guaranteeing uniform rights, initially for salaried
workers (travailleurs salariés) in five areas: illness, maternity, disability, old age, and death. Nevertheless,
the objective of one uniform scheme was not achieved, as very quickly differences arose based on
competing interests. Certain socio-professional groups (such as civil servants, miners, and railway
workers) already benefiting from insurance with more favorable terms succeeded in maintaining their
particular schemes, which still exist.
Coverage for various population groups expanded incrementally over the next four decades. General
statutory insurance was extended to farmers in 1961 and to the self-employed in 1966, but access to
health insurance remained problematic for very low-income groups and people with variable incomes until
2000 when the CMU Act came into effect. This law opened the right to health insurance for all legal
residents not previously covered. It also mandated means-tested subsidies for those who cannot pay for
their insurance. Thus the goal of providing coverage for the whole population was finally achieved in 2000
(figure 1.1).




1. Couverture Médicale Universelle (CMU) is the name given to the state-funded scheme for the poor providing basic
(CMU) and complementary Couverture Maladie Universelle–Complémentaire (Public Complementary Insurance
Scheme, or CMUC) package of health services with no copayment and is, for the vast majority of enrollees, a
noncontributory program. CMU is different from UHC, which relates to the goal of providing access to health services
and improved financial protection to everyone in a country.

Today, the three major statutory insurance schemes cover more than 95 percent of the population. The
largest one, the Régime Général, insures wage and salary earners and their dependents and covers
                                              2
about 85 percent of the compulsorily insured. It is managed by the Caisse Nationale d’Assurance
Maladie des Travailleurs Salariés (National Health Insurance Fund for Salaried Workers, or CNAMTS).
The two other schemes, covering the self-employed (Régime Social des Indépendants) and farmers and
agricultural employees (Mutualité Sociale Agricole), cover about 13 percent of the population. In addition,
16 small schemes cover certain professional categories, including miners, the clergy, employees of SNCF
(the national rail company), and the central bank (1 percent) (figure 1.2).
Enrollment in insurance schemes is compulsory and automatic for workers (covering their spouses and
dependent children). Consumers cannot choose their scheme or insurer, and cannot opt out. With the
exception of CMU, enrollment follows employment status, which means that an agricultural employee
automatically falls under the agricultural scheme and is not allowed to switch to the general insurance
scheme. There are thus no competing health insurance markets for core social health coverage.

       1.2         COMPREHENSIVE BENEFIT PACKAGE WITH GOOD FINANCIAL PROTECTION
The French health system is known for providing extensive service coverage, with solid financial
protection. While population groups are covered through separate schemes and funds, the schemes are
tightly harmonized, which was previously a major issue and finally achieved only quite recently. The same
benefit package now applies for all schemes and for the whole country, including CMU beneficiary groups.
Each SHI member is legally entitled to the same package regardless of his or her scheme.
The standard package under the statutory health insurance system includes a wide range of goods and
services (box 1.1).

Box 1.1 Service Coverage under SHI in France, 2013
•   Hospital care and treatment in public or private institutions providing health care, rehabilitation, or
    physiotherapy.
•   Outpatient care provided by general practitioners (GPs), specialists, dentists, and midwives.
•   Diagnostic services and care prescribed by doctors and carried out by laboratories and paramedical

The benefit package is comprehensive, with cost sharing for almost all its services but still high financial
protection relative to other OECD countries. In the breakdown for total health expenditure for common
goods and services for 2011, SHI covered 75.5 percent; complementary voluntary insurance
13.7 percent; and direct household spending 9.6 percent. SHI spending fell from 76.7 percent of total
health expenditure in 2000 to 75.5 percent in 2011. Over the same period, the share covered by voluntary
health insurance (VHI) increased from 12.4 percent to 13.7 percent (figure 1.3).

In general, the insured are expected to advance full costs for ambulatory care and to claim
reimbursement from insurance funds based on predefined rates (negotiated tariffs). Copayments are
fixed rates defined by insurance funds and the Ministry of Health. The same rates apply regardless of the
                                  3
scheme or the patient’s income. The share of costs left to patients varies by type of service and by type
of medication: cost sharing for patients amounts to 30 percent of the cost of ambulatory visits, about 20
percent of the cost of hospital care, and 35–85 percent of the cost of (approved) treatment drugs. The
rate of reimbursement by statutory insurance is determined according to the effectiveness of the
prescription drug and the seriousness of the disease treated: 100 percent for rare, highly effective and
expensive drugs; 65, 35, or 15 percent for those of diminishing therapeutic value; and no reimbursement
for ineffective drugs. As the system relies heavily on cost sharing, the insured are encouraged to enroll in
private complementary (top-up) insurance to cover costs not supported by statutory insurance: 94 percent
of the population is now enrolled in VHI schemes through private firms, provident firms, and mutuelles, all
of which generally cover full copay, though significant disparities persist across complementary contract
provisions.
A growing number of patient groups are eligible for a third-party payment system (tiers payant), which
exempts them from paying the entire cost of services at the point of delivery. Additionally, some
population groups are exempt from bearing the direct costs. Patients with long-term chronic diseases
(under the Exonération pour Affection Longue Durée [ALD], or Long-Term Illness Scheme), pregnant
women, and newborns are exempt from cost sharing for services related to their condition, while CMU
beneficiaries do not carry any user charges as these are systematically covered by the CMUC scheme
(see section 3.2).

   1.3       FROM A PURE EMPLOYMENT-BASED SYSTEM TO A DIVERSIFIED FUNDING MODEL
On expenditure relative to its economy, France is the third highest for health care among OECD countries
(figures 1.4 and 1.5). In 2011, France spent 11.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on health care,
against the OECD average of 9.3 percent and behind the United States (17.7 percent) and the

US$4,118 (in 2011 parity purchasing power dollars), compared with the OECD average of US$3,339
(figure 1.5), although French health spending per capita was less than half that of the United States
(US$8,508).

Until the end of the 1990s, SHI financing depended almost exclusively on payroll contributions from
                                                     4
employers (63 percent) and employees (32 percent). Since 1998, most employee payroll contributions
have come through earmarked taxes, known as the General Social Contribution (Contribution Sociale
Generalisée, or CSG). The CSG, earmarked for health, is levied at 5.25 percent of income and income
from capital and 3.95 percent of unemployment and disability benefits, and is now one of the main
sources of statutory health insurance funding (36 percent). In addition, specific taxes (on tobacco and

                     1.4        A PRIVATE AND PUBLIC MIXED DELIVERY APPROACH
Health care delivery is shared between the private and public sectors. Primary care is quasi-exclusively
delivered through self-employed physicians on an FFS basis. GPs working in the ambulatory sector
contract with health insurance funds and are paid according to a negotiated FFS schedule. GPs who
agree to charge on the basis of the nationally negotiated fee (called “sector 1” contractors) get, in return,
their social contributions, including pension, paid by CNAMTS. Others are authorized to charge higher
fees (“sector 2” contractors) but must purchase their own pension. About 65 percent of specialists and 85
                                         5
percent of generalists work in sector 1.




5. The creation of sector 2 in 1980 did not reduce total expenditure of the statutory health insurance fund, as was the
intention. Consequently, access to that sector has been limited to 1,000 new doctors a year.

Hospital care is split among the public sector (with two-thirds of hospital beds) and private for-profit and
not-for-profit facilities. The hospital payment system has evolved over the last two decades from global
budgets in public hospitals and an inflationary itemized billing system in private clinics to a more
performance-oriented and public–private alignment model through the introduction of an activity-based
payment system in all hospitals.
Traditionally, the French health care system has been characterized by strong central governance.
Regulation and management are predominantly divided between the state and the statutory health
insurance funds. The institutions at regional and département level (metropolitan France is divided into 22
regions and 96 departments) also play an executive role, but despite several reforms to reinforce the role
of the regions, decision making remains quite centralized. The state sets out sector-level expenditure
targets, determines the level of health care provision and training, regulates care quality, and defines
priority areas for national programs. The salaries and working conditions of public hospital staff as well as
prices of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are regulated by the government. The health insurance funds
play the main role in defining the benefit baskets; regulating the prices of procedures, drugs, and devices,
which will be reimbursed to patients; and defining the levels of copayment. The sickness funds are also in
charge of setting tariffs for health professionals in private practice via collective negotiations with the
professionals’ unions. Doctors working in private hospitals contract with health insurance funds and are
paid according to the negotiated FFS schedule, while those in public hospitals are salaried.

                                          Summary: Revenues matter for the financing of health, particularly in the context of SHI.
                                          France’s experience is of particular interest to other countries as it has shifted from a purely
                                          wage-based model at the time the system was introduced to a more diversified financing
                                          model in recent years, aiming to generate resources through different taxes. On the
                                          expenditure side, France has also taken some steps to curb the size of health care deficits
                                          over the past few decades. The combination of these measures has improved financial
                                          sustainability, though deficits remain a feature of the system.

Health is the second-largest area of public spending in France, after social protection (OECD 2013). In
2011, health accounted for 14.7 percent of total government spending (close to the OECD average).
France also has the second-highest level of government spending among OECD countries, together
giving the country one of the largest shares of public spending on health relative to GDP among OECD
countries (figure 2.1).

Health deficits have been substantial in recent years and are a major part of social security deficits, about
half of which stem from health insurance costs. Health care and other social security deficits (net of health
care) became persistent and onerous over the 2000s (above € 10 billion) (figure 2.2).

         2.2         INTRODUCING TAXES TO DIVERSIFY AND INCREASE REVENUES FOR HEALTH
Although initially the system was almost entirely funded from wage-based contributions, today these
account for less than half of France’s health care revenues. The government has sought to diversify
sources of financing for health over the last two decades, expanding the base of health financing to
lessen reliance on only one key form of revenue—wage-based contributions.
The most profound change was the introduction of the CSG during the 1990s. The CSG brought in a
basket of taxes applied to a broader range of incomes than just wages. The CSG includes wage income
but also extends to incomes from financial assets and investments, pensions, and unemployment and
disability benefits.
As well as broadening the sources of revenue, one of the motivations of this policy was to reduce labor
costs. At the time of its creation, the CSG rate was low, at 1.1 percent of each of these sources of
revenue, and was allocated to the family branch of the social security system. The appropriation of the
CSG to fund SHI effectively began in 1997, as part of Plan Juppé (box 2.1). Alongside measures to
control expenditure (discussed later), this plan sought to reduce wage-based contributions for health care
and replace the forgone revenues with an increase in the CSG—that is, a reduction of 1.3 percentage
points on employee wage-based contributions was replaced by an increase of 1.0 percentage point on
CSG rates across the various sources of income. The CSG was also widened to include gambling
revenues at this time.
Following this, a major push toward diversifying revenues for health care came in 1998. The employee
wage-based contribution was reduced by 4.75 percentage points, and the CSG on wage income and
capital income was increased by 4.1 percentage points. At the same time the CSG on pensions and
unemployment benefits was raised by 2.0 percentage points, and contributions from these social benefits
for health were almost entirely removed. Since then, the remainder of the wage-based contribution toward
health care revenue has been almost entirely financed by contributions levied on employers. The CSG
now accounts for 38 percent of health care revenues.

Box 2.1 Plan Juppé
First announced in 1995, Plan Juppé sought to reform the social security entitlements of public sector
workers (particularly the pensions of transport and energy workers), with a view to bringing them closer to
those in the private sector. At the same time, it also aimed to establish spending targets in health care
while reforming the governance of social security institutions and of the hospital sector. Led by unions but
with a coalition of other bodies, opposition to these reforms (particularly among public sector workers)
was significant, and prompted major strikes across France in 1995.
While the controversial measures relating to social security and retirement of public sector workers did not
succeed, the plan did result in the introduction of policies aimed at bringing social security deficits under
control, including the diversification of revenue sources. Though initially introduced under the
administration of a prime minister from the major center-right party (Rassemblement pour la République
[RPR]), these measures have been maintained through multiple changes of government.

Earmarked taxes have come to contribute a greater share of health financing needs. They have been the
fastest growing source of financing, now accounting for some 13 percent of revenues for health care,
against just 4 percent a decade ago. These more than 20 types of taxes are known as impôts et taxes
affectés. In 2011, 55 percent of these earmarked taxes financed health insurance funds for a total of
some €27.8 billion (10 percent of SHI revenues). These taxes are taxes on enterprises, such as five
different taxes on pharmaceutical companies, taxes on company cars, or a share of a global tax above a
certain level of net sales for all companies. There are also taxes on consumption or behavior, such as a
share of value-added tax, a tax on private complementary health insurance, and taxes on tobacco and
alcohol (figure 2.3 and table 2.1).

The introduction of the CSG has also marked a worthwhile shift toward better equity in financing health
care. The share of labor income (principally wages) in household incomes fell from 80 to 71 percent
between 1970 and 2011 (figure 2.4). At the same time, income from capital and social benefits came to
form a larger share of household incomes—29 percent in 2011. The shift from taxing only wage-based
incomes to a broader definition of incomes has thus improved the equity of revenue raising for health, as
wealthier individuals generally have higher incomes from capital and other financial assets and are more
likely to have accumulated substantial social benefits during their working lives.
Nonetheless, calls remain for more ambitious changes to financing social security. The CSG collects the
equivalent of around 5 percent of GDP, against the 2.9 percent (in 2011) of income tax. While exemptions
have been set for the unemployed and retirees, the tax is applied to a fixed proportion of incomes and
does not increase for those on higher incomes (that is, it is not progressive). A reform to consolidate and
harmonize the tax regime is under Government discussion in 2014.

     2.3      SETTING NATIONAL SPENDING TARGETS AS A WAY TO MANAGE EXPENDITURE
Setting an overall expenditure target for health care, known as the National Objective for Health Care
Spending (Objectif National de Dépenses de l’Assurance Maladie, or ONDAM), has been a key aspect of
the strategy to control health spending. This involves setting an a priori global budget for health each year.
For most of its history, the government has not played a proactive role in influencing overall health care
spending, with independently operated insurance funds responsible for managing spending in line with
their social entitlements to citizens. ONDAM marked a significant break from this tradition, and represents
the reassertion of the government’s control of health care spending.
ONDAM is now at the heart of the Social Security Financing Law (Loi de Financement de la Sécurité
Sociale), specified in monetary terms as the total amount of health spending for the forthcoming calendar
year. Once published, it gives all stakeholders a precise spending objective. In 2012, ONDAM was €171
billion (or 38 percent of the total €454 billion in social security spending). The monetary ONDAM target is
used to signal the proportion of health spending growth that the government is willing to accept in any
given year. For example, the 2013 objective was €174.5 billion, or 2.7 percent growth from 2012.
ONDAM’s overall target is split into three subtargets for the main health service providers: ambulatory
care, hospitals, and medico-social facilities. Ambulatory care and hospitals absorb the vast majority of
ONDAM, with 2013 targets of 45.9 percent and 43.6 percent of total ONDAM, respectively. When setting
ONDAM, the government draws up a precise list of savings necessary to meet budget targets (figure 2.5).

Although the creation of ONDAM was seen as a step toward better monitoring of health spending, it has
taken over a decade for the policy to begin demonstrating consistent results. In its first five years,
ONDAM targets were regularly overrun. As its nonbinding nature meant no stakeholder was obligated to
uphold it, the policy did not suffice to constrain SHI spending within budgetary targets (figure 2.6).
Therefore, additional measures were put in place (section 2.4)

                        2.4          REGAINING CONTROL OVER HEALTH EXPENDITURES
For much of their history, statutory health insurance funds have been the key operational entities that pay
health care providers for services delivered to patients. While the most important fund (CNAMTS for the
formal sector) continues to have considerable influence in the administration of the health care system,
reforms over the last few years have seen the state expand its role in determining health care spending.
Somewhat unusually for a social insurance–based system, the French Parliament ultimately sets the
fiscal parameters within which CNAMTS (and other health insurance funds) are required to maintain
spending. A separate Social Security Financing Law has been in place since the late 1990s.; it subjects
the expenditure and financing sources of all aspects of French social security (including health, pensions,
and family benefits) to annual ratification. This process is now enshrined in the Constitution, making
Parliament a major player in health sector developments and reasserting the government’s influence on
social security spending.
The annual process behind the Social Security Financing Act requires several ministries to work together
to control health expenditure. Every year, the Ministry for the Economy produces a draft act, with the
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Labor, and other social security entities. The draft is prepared between
June and October by the Social Security Direction (Direction de la Sécurité Sociale), an administrative
body under the joint supervision of the Ministry of Budget and the Ministry of Health. Following its
publication (as the Projet de loi de financement de la sécurité sociale), the document is debated in
Parliament in accordance with the legislative calendar (figure 2.7).

The inability to reach ONDAM targets in early years led the administration to conclude that there should
be closer monitoring of health expenditures and of ONDAM’s prospects for success during the year, and
indeed ONDAM targets have evolved progressively from vague objectives to binding targets. An Alert
Committee was set up in 2004 to closely monitor growth of health expenditure. Its mission is to flag to
governing bodies, including Parliament, when spending is growing faster than the ONDAM target. Since
2010, the Alert Committee has gained additional powers and can undertake an ex ante evaluation of
ONDAM before the draft (projet de loi) of the Social Security Financing Act is submitted to Parliament. If
hospital-ONDAM targets are expected to be overrun, DRG tariffs can be adjusted (decreased).
In recent years, the budgetary processes ushered in by ONDAM have begun to show signs of improved
monitoring of health expenditures as well as better working relations between stakeholders, though it is

                                                                     17
too early to say that it has permanently enhanced control over health spending. While growth of health
expenditures has been decreasing for a decade, the ONDAM target has been met only since 2010. Such
growth has decreased to 3 percent since 2010, from a high of 7 percent in 2002 (see figure 2.6). However,
it is expected that France will need to achieve a 2.5 percent ONDAM growth rate in forthcoming years to
end health deficits. This would, according to the Ministry of Health, represent an average extra annual
saving of €2.8 billion over 2013–17—a not inconsiderable challenge.


                              SECTION 3: THE EQUITY GAP
      Summary: France has worked hard to harmonize different insurance schemes and cover
      the whole population over the past couple of decades. Despite universal entitlement since
      2000, significant inequalities in health and use of health services have persisted. The social
      insurance system—heavily based on cost sharing—relies increasingly on private
      complementary insurance for covering costs, raising concerns over solidarity and
      redistribution. While extension of insurance coverage through state-funded mechanisms
      (CMU and CMUC) was instrumental in expanding effective access for the worst off, the cost-
      effectiveness of other targeted measures, such as Complementary Health Insurance
      Vouchers (Aide à l’Acquisition d’une Complémentaire Santé, or ACS), is questionable.
      Another important lesson is that cost-control strategies must be continually monitored for
      their impact on equity and financial protection.

             3.1      PERSISTENT HEALTH INEQUALITIES IN A HIGH-INCOME SETTING
France has relatively good health outcomes and enjoys one of the highest life expectancies in the world.
Nevertheless, the significant improvements in health status over the last decades have not been equally
distributed across socioeconomic groups. Compared with other European countries, France had wide
socioeconomic inequalities in premature mortality, especially for men with cancer and cardiovascular
diseases (Kunst, Groenhof, and Mackenbach 1998), and although reducing health inequalities has been
a public health priority since the late 1990s, France’s low ranking among Western European countries
remained unchanged a few years ago (Mackenbach et al. 2008).
Disparities in health across socioeconomic groups could partly be linked to socioeconomic inequalities in
utilization of health care services (Or et al. 2009). France shows relatively equitable use of generalists,
while it ranks last among 13 OECD countries for visits to specialists and to dentists (figure 3.1). Recent
studies suggest that utilization of preventive services, such as breast cancer and cervical cancer
screening, are also largely conditioned by income, and more than in many other European countries
(Devaux and de Looper 2012).

Note: The probability of a doctor, GP, or specialist visit is inequitable if the horizontal inequity index is
significantly different from zero. It favors low-income groups when it is below zero, and high-income
groups above zero. The index is adjusted for need.



In 2008, 16.5 percent of the population age 18 to 64 years reported they had forgone health care in the
last 12 months for financial reasons (Allonier et al. 2008). Dental health care is of greatest concern (10.7
percent of the population age 18 to 64 years had forgone dental health care in the last 12 months),
followed by optical care (4 percent) (Allonier et al. 2008). Forgoing health care is inversely related to
income: people in the poorest quintile (under €820 a month) forgo three times more care than people in
the richest quintile (more than €2,000 a month) (Allonier et al. 2008). Moreover, the more degraded the
health status is, the likelier that care will be forgone.
Despite the high emphasis on equity in the system, a number of structural weaknesses may explain why
inequity in access to care remains a problem. First, copayments can be quite significant both for
ambulatory and hospital care (where specialists often extra-bill), for those who do not have
complementary insurance (about 7 percent of the population), and for those with low-cost complementary
insurance. The fact that fees charged by almost half of physicians (sector 2) are not regulated means that
access to quality care depends partly on ability to pay.
Second, there may also be nonfinancial barriers in accessing care. The system is very fragmented and
complicated from the point of view of users. Education (beyond income) is an important determinant of
care use. Higher education is significantly associated with an increased probability of consulting
specialists in France, as elsewhere (Or et al. 2009). Furthermore, there are geographic inequities. The
principle of allowing doctors and nurses in the ambulatory sector to practice where they like results in
wide variations in supply between and within regions. Yet policies to improve supply in rural and low-
income areas have been rather weak because of strong resistance from medical unions.

      3.2       POLICY INSTRUMENTS USED TO REMEDY INEQUALITIES IN ACCESS TO CARE
As seen, Social Health Insurance does not cover all health care expenses: there are considerable
copayments for almost all health services and the chances of overbilling by some practitioners. Given the
importance of cost sharing, from its inception the French system introduced protective mechanisms to

reduce the financial burden of care for patients suffering from chronic illnesses (ALD). In the past decade,
new policy instruments have been added to tackle inequalities in access to basic public and private
complementary insurance: CMU, CMUC, and ACS. In parallel, one scheme, AME (Aide Medicale d’Etat,
or State Medical Assistance) targeting immigrants in illegal situations was introduced (table 3.1).

ALD
Introduced in 1945, ALD aims to reduce the financial burden of medical care for beneficiaries suffering
from chronic diseases. Irrespective of their income status, patients are exempted from copayments for
treatments associated with a chronic disease. Initially introduced to cover four groups of diseases (cancer,
tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, and mental illness), the scheme was extended over time and now covers 32
groups of diseases.
In 2012, over 9 million people were covered by ALD, or 15 percent of SHI beneficiaries. ALD accounts for
nearly 60 percent of health expenditures reimbursed by the health insurance fund. Expenditures linked to
ALD recorded an average annual growth of 4.9 percent over 2005–10, against 1.8 percent for other
health expenditures (Dourgnon et al. 2013).

CMU and CMUC
While the majority of residents in France are entitled to social security via their professional activity, some
categories remained uncovered until 2000. Introduced that year, CMU established the right to statutory
health insurance coverage on the basis of residence in France. It allowed those groups who were not
covered by any insurance scheme to benefit from insurance coverage with means-tested subsidies. Only
3 percent of CMU beneficiaries pay social contributions; the rest is funded by the state using earmarked
taxes (Rapport d’évaluation de la loi CMU 2011).
CMUC was introduced to reduce the financial burden of cost sharing for the poorest part of the population
generally not covered by VHI. The income threshold varies by household composition (about €8,500 a
year for a single person, €13,000 a year for a couple). CMUC covers 100 percent of costs of all drugs and
services included in the benefit package (no cost sharing). It also covers dental care and optics, which
were poorly reimbursed by SHI. Moreover, patients are exempted from upfront payments, and
professionals are not allowed to overbill CMUC patients. CMUC covered some 4.3 million people in 2012
(Rapport d’évaluation de la loi CMU 2012).

AME
AME was enacted in 1999 and implemented in 2000. It is fully state funded and provides access to a
standard benefit package for illegal immigrants. It is means tested, and applicants must be resident for
more than three months. Income eligibility is the same as for CMUC. As of 2010, 227,705 people
benefited from the scheme.

ACS
ACS was introduced in 2004 to subsidize private complementary health insurance among low-income
people ineligible for CMUC. The target population included those with incomes up to 15 percent above
the CMUC eligibility line. The limit was pushed to 25 percent in 2011, then to 35 percent in 2013 (annual
income below €11,600 for a single individual, €17,400 for a couple). ACS provides cash support in the
form of vouchers that can be used to buy complementary insurance. Financial support accounts for €200
for an adult and between €350 and €500 for seniors, covering up to 60 to 70 percent of insurance
premiums annually.
The target population was about 2 million, but by end-2008 the number of enrollees had reached only half
that (Rapport d’évaluation de la loi CMU 2011). The lack of information on the availability of the scheme,
conditions of access, and complexity of identifying potential beneficiaries were observed to be the main
barriers to use (Guthmuller et al. 2012).

Effectiveness of Different Strategies
The measures to improve financial access have contributed to reducing inequalities in access to care to a
certain extent. But the juxtaposition of measures over time has also led to a very complex regulatory
framework for patients and funders without entirely resolving problems of access.
The ALD scheme has been effective in reducing inequalities in pharmaceutical, GP, and specialist
expenditures among beneficiaries (Dourgnon et al. 2013). However, its contribution to reducing
inequalities in optical and dental care expenditures remains marginal (Dourgnon et al. 2013). Despite the


                                                      22
exemption from copayments for their main health problem, ALD beneficiaries often suffer from an
accumulation of additional “unlisted” disorders and are faced with higher out-of-pocket payments, on
average double of those non-ALD beneficiaries (Dourgnon et al. 2013).
CMU and CMUC have significantly improved access to GP care for the poorest (Grignon and Perronnin
2003; Guthmuller et Wittwer 2012; Dourgnon et al. 2012; Rapport d’évaluation de la loi CMU 2011), while
use of GPs has become more equitable over time (figure 3.2). Inequalities in the use of specialist care
also decreased slightly in the decade to 2008 (figure 3.3), due partly to the introduction of CMUC.
Nevertheless, these two schemes are not panaceas. Denials and delays in obtaining medical
appointments have been observed for their enrollees. Desprès et al. (2009) showed that 30 to 40 percent
of sector 2 doctors, in particular dentists, ophthalmologists, and gynecologists, did not accept CMUC
patients. There is also evidence of access problems for those with incomes just above the eligibility
threshold (not covered by the CMUC but without private complementary insurance). Controlling for health
needs, these near-poor groups appear to experience significantly lower levels of health care utilization
than individuals with complementary coverage, whether private (VHI) or public (CMUC) (Dourgnon et al.
2013).
While ACS may have played a role in closing the gap in complementary health insurance coverage, the
cost-efficiency of this type of instrument is uncertain. Ultimately, ACS subsidizes private insurance
contracts, but their contents are not regulated and may encourage overutilization of services that are cost
inefficient.

                        3.3      EQUITY CONCERNS OF RECENT STRATEGIES
The French health system relies heavily on VHI to cover part of health care costs. VHI coverage rose
from 69 percent of the population in 1980 to 95 percent in 2012. However, enrollment remains voluntary,
and access to VHI is still associated with income and employment status. About 12 percent of the poorest
do not have VHI compared with only 3 percent among the better-off. Recent attempts to subsidize VHI
increase further the reliance on VHI and may have some adverse effects on equity since the contents of
VHI contracts or their quality are not regulated. Moreover, the launch of flat deductibles that restrict
demand for care can potentially affect access to care for the worst-off.
Service coverage and financial protection differ widely across VHI contracts, and affect income groups in
different ways. In terms of service coverage, only a minority of the insured (9 to 12 percent) benefited
from broad protection for dental care and optics in their current VHI contract (Couffinhal and Perronnin
2004). Service coverage is unequal across contracts. Large discrepancies exist between the three types
of providers (mutuelles, provident firms, and private firms) and between collective and individual contracts.
Collective contracts purchased by firms for their employees tend to be more generous on service
coverage (Arnould and Vidal 2008). In 2008, about half (42 percent) of those with VHI benefited from a
collective contract (Garnero and Rattier 2011). It is estimated that two-thirds of collective contracts
provide broad protection, versus only one-third of individual contracts. Financial protection, too, varies
widely across income groups. Good financial protection is generally associated with higher incomes: of
the richest, 53 percent benefit from broad protection, compared with only 13 percent of the lower-income
groups.
As for coverage of extra- billing, VHI contracts can cover some (or all) costs linked to it (by doctors
working in sector 2, whose prices are not regulated). Only 27 percent of individual contracts are reported
to offer coverage for extra billing, while 64 percent of collective contracts do (Kambia-Chopin and
Perronnin 2010). The net share left to patients depends on contract provisions. For those contracts
offering coverage for extra billings, the overall rate of coverage is 120 percent of the SHI reimbursement
(Garnero and Rattier 2011).
In 2013, in an attempt to improve access to collective contracts, the government introduced new
measures. From 2016, all employers (irrespective of the size of their business) must offer private VHI to
their employees. While this may reduce inequalities between employees, the new policy can potentially
perpetuate inequalities between salaried employees and other groups (students, retirees, unemployed,
and self-employed).
Increasing reliance on VHI for funding basic health services raises concerns for solidarity—a key principle
of social protection—and redistribution in the system (Askenazy et al. 2013; Or 2010a). As a result of
efforts to contain costs, the share of VHI in total health expenditure increased from 12.4 percent in 2000
to 13.7 percent in 2011 (figure 3.4). While services with higher risk of catastrophic spending (for example,
hospital care) are better covered by national SHI (near 90 percent of total hospital expenditure), patients’
contributions, especially in areas where overbilling is common (surgery), can be quite high. Moreover,
dental care and optical treatment, which can be quite costly for low-income budgets, are not well covered
by SHI. Pursuing a strategy to provide VHI for the entire population without regulating items covered in
the benefit basket may be problematic in ensuring equity of access to care and for cost efficiency.

Flat-rate deductibles are often used in health care to deter unnecessary utilization of services and lead
patients to consider costs and benefits of treatments. To contain demand for targeted services, non-
reimbursable flat-rate deductibles were introduced in recent years in France (table 3.2). Those
deductibles are not supposed to be covered by VHI; in practice policies vary between different insurers. A
complex capping system has been introduced in parallel with flat deductibles: per service, per day, and
per year caps are used to limit financial consequences for consumers. Nevertheless, by their nature
(insensitive to income), deductibles risk causing inequities in access to care. Moreover, they have limited
effects on the behavior of higher-income groups.

A study by Kambia-Chopin and Perronnin (2010) estimated that flat-rate deductibles particularly
disadvantage low-income groups, especially those without complementary coverage. The lowest-income
quintiles reduced drug consumption far more than the better-off after the introduction of drug deductibles.

They report buying only a part of their prescription or delaying purchase. Relatively high deductibles for
hospital care are also problematic for the most disadvantaged groups.
Since the economic downturn that began in the late 2000s, there has also been a tendency to curb public
spending by reducing SHI coverage for certain high-cost services. Measures include the reduction of
reimbursement rates from 35 to 30 percent for drugs for common “non-vital” diseases, omitting high blood
pressure from the list of diseases (ALD) for which costs are fully covered, and reducing coverage for
transport expenditure for chronically ill patients. Although the measures were contained, they reflect a
move to shift costs to the sick—rather than using general contributions—thereby endangering the
principle of solidarity.


    SECTION 4: EFFICIENCY AND PAYMENT IN SERVICE DELIVERY
      Summary: The health sector is largely dominated by Fee-For-Service (FFS). To curb
      escalating expenditures in a UHC setting and improve performance, new payment
      mechanisms have been introduced, showing some promising results. Giving a more
      prominent role to primary care was another strategy to improve efficiency and better manage
      care pathways, but the FFS setting appears to be a barrier to changing clinician behavior. To
      improve overall efficiency and management within the hospital sector, the government
      launched an ambitious reform plan in 2003: measures modified the funding model for public
      and private hospitals, the rules of hospital sector planning, and the governance of public
      hospitals.

                                   4.1      A DOMINANT FFS MODEL
Historically, health care in France has been organized around four principles delineated by law:
confidentiality of medical information; freedom of prescription and of practice for physicians; patients’ free
choice of provider; and office-based FFS practice in the ambulatory sector. Thus doctors are free to
choose their place of practice as well as the procedures and drugs to prescribe, and patients have free
access to any physician or any facility—public or private—with no limit on the number of doctors seen or
the frequency of visits. And until recently, there was no control of access to secondary or specialist care.
As seen, doctors in the ambulatory sector and in private hospitals contract with health insurance funds
and are paid according to a negotiated FFS schedule. A formal national negotiation process between the
government, the insurance funds, and the medical profession sets official tariffs for reimbursement.
Physicians and other health care providers, all paid by FFS, have neither the interest nor incentive to
control the volume and the cost of their prescriptions or to invest in prevention, health promotion, and
coordinated care. Fewer than 10 percent of consultations end without a prescription, and France ranks
quite low among OECD countries for health promotion and prevention (OECD 2013). In addition,
variations in medical practice among providers raise questions about efficiency and quality of care
provision.
In the past two decades, rising cost of health care has been a major concern. While France had visible
success in controlling prices of health care services and pharmaceuticals through formal negotiations with
health care providers and value-based pricing of drugs, low prices seem to have only a limited impact on
health expenditure growth. Health care providers tend to compensate for these reduced revenues by
increasing the volume of services. In the mid-2000s most parties and stakeholders recognized the need
for further structural reforms to improve overall efficiency (Larcher 2007). The lack of articulation between
ambulatory, hospital, and social care as well as between different levels of administration (central,
regional, and departmental) has been recognized as a major drawback both in terms of cost control and
quality of care. Moreover, uncoordinated care coupled with the high degree of independence and choice
for both providers and patients have been identified as key drivers of health care cost. Increasingly,
health care providers are asked to account for the cost and quality of services they provide.

                                    4.2      INVESTING IN PRIMARY CARE
Introducing Gatekeeping
A noncompulsory gatekeeping system was introduced in 2004 as a means to better coordinate patient
care and ultimately improve health sector efficiency. The system intended to prevent the unnecessary
specialist consultations encouraged by freedom of choice and low rates of cost sharing (for the majority of
the population who benefit from complementary health insurance). It also aimed at reinforcing the role of
GPs as primary care providers to improve care coordination, quality, and efficiency.
Under the new system, patients must declare a primary care provider or “preferred doctor” (médecin
traitant), with whom they sign a contract, but whom they can change at any time and as often as they
wish. Preferred doctors are expected to provide appropriate primary care and act as gatekeepers to guide
their patients in the health system, coordinating treatment with other health care professionals. Patients
are incentivized (with lower reimbursement rates) to get a referral for specialist care, but they remain free
to choose any specialist without constraint. Direct access to gynecologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists,
neuro-psychiatrists, and neurologists is permitted without penalty in certain circumstances (for instance,
for contraception advice, screening, and prescription of eye glasses).
Participation in the gatekeeping scheme is voluntary for patients and providers, but there are financial
incentives to participate directed mainly at patients. If an individual does not register with a preferred
doctor, the rate of reimbursement he or she is entitled to from the statutory health insurance fund is
reduced from 70 percent to 30 percent. The same applies if he or she consults a specialist without referral.
The payment mechanism (FFS) for physicians has remained the same. Preferred doctors did not receive
                                                                     6
any extra payment for following up registered patients until 2013; however, for those suffering from a
listed “chronic disease” such as cancer, diabetes, severe high-blood pressure, or long-term psychiatric
disease, the physician receives an annual payment of €40 for drafting a care protocol.
About 90 percent of the population has declared a preferred doctor. Nevertheless, despite generalists’
commitment to improve care coordination, promote prevention, and improve prescription habits by
respecting guidelines, there has been little visible change in practice patterns. The impact thus far of this
reform on overall functioning and efficiency has been marginal: an early evaluation showed that the new
system did not achieve the expected financial impact, and that the rise in physicians’ fees largely offset
the very modest reduction in visits to specialists. Eight years after the reform was launched, the National
Auditing Office (Cour des Comptes) concluded that for the insured—the vast majority of whom had
declared a preferred doctor—this reform remained essentially financial and somewhat incomprehensible
(Cour des Comptes 2013). It criticized the little attention given to medical care coordination in the reform.
Lack of coordination between GPs, specialists, and other professionals working in health care networks
and hospitals thus remains a major issue for efficiency.

Performance-Based Approach
In 2009, as a new attempt to improve quality and efficiency of primary care, the SHI introduced a pay-for-
performance scheme—Contracts for Improved Individual Practice, or CAPI (Contrats d'amélioration des
pratiques individuelles). Offered to GPs and initially signed by them individually on a voluntary basis, the
contracts sought to improve clinical quality of care by encouraging prevention and generic prescribing
(box 4.1). The first contracts provided up to €7,000 annually if 100 percent of targets were achieved




6. Since July 2013, they have received €5 per registered patient.

                                                         27
Box 4.1 Initial Targets for CAPI
Improving prevention. Target: to achieve a 75 percent flu vaccination rate for those over 65, and a breast
cancer screening rate of at least 80 percent for women 50 to 74 years old. There was the further objective
of lowering adverse reactions to drugs by reducing prescription of vasodilators (which are overprescribed
despite being proven ineffective) and benzodiazepine (potentially dangerous and addictive) for elderly
patients 65 and over.
Increasing quality of care for patients with chronic diseases. Target: in particular, to improve the
management of diabetes according to clinical guidelines (eye exams, HbA1c prescription) and
management of high blood pressure (the target is to normalize blood pressure for 50 percent of patients
over a three-year period.
Rationalizing prescriptions. Target: specifically, to increase generic prescribing for seven groups of
medications including antibiotics and antidepressants.
Source: Or 2010b.


The introduction of CAPI was highly controversial in the medical profession. Physician unions were
concerned about the individual nature of the contracts and possibly a weak negotiating position in
collective bargaining. The first contracts were signed in July 2009 by about 5,500 GPs; this number
increased to 14,800 generalists (one-third of eligible GPs) by September 2010. Two-thirds of the GPs
who signed the contract in July 2009 received remuneration in 2010.
The analysis of results of initial participants by fund after one year of CAPI suggests that there was some
progress in almost all targeted domains apart from prevention. The results for prevention and diabetes
improved for all generalists, but the difference between CAPI signatories and others was not significant.
Still, CAPI induced a change in French medical culture, demanding accountability from primary care
providers for their results. The scheme was generalized to all GPs in 2011, with the stipulation that the
payment of primary care providers could be related to their performance. Further, the objectives of CAPI
were extended to include improved computer use in prescribing and in electronic data management. In
2012, with the “payment for public health objectives” scheme (Rémunération sur Objectifs de Santé
Publique), all physicians were covered by the pay-for-performance contracts. Some objectives, such as
organization of office practice and electronic records, are common to all physicians; others concern only
GPs. In April 2013, CNAMTS reported that about 75,000 physicians (of whom two-thirds were generalists)
had received some performance payment of about €3,700 on average (about €5,000 on average for GPs).

Encouraging Multidisciplinary Group Practice
Compared with traditional (solo) general practice, group practice is preferred in ensuring high-quality and
efficient care provision. Finding an effective way of funding group practice that will emphasize prevention
and care coordination in primary care has long been a policy objective. Despite several initiatives for
encouraging group practice, take-up has been very slow; however, fewer than 50 percent of generalists
work in group practice, and the size of practices and their distribution vary widely across regions.
Different primary care structures have been created over recent years through various legal frameworks
and payment schemes. Traditionally, health centers were group practices, mainly oriented to primary care,
but they can include specialist services. More recently, multidisciplinary health houses have come to refer
to group practice structures bringing together self-employed medical and paramedical professionals in a
single practice. In health centers, professionals are salaried, but the main funding comes from FFS for
their medical activities. In multidisciplinary group practices, doctors (and other health professionals) are
paid by FFS. Thus collaborative work in groups—for example, for better disease management—is not
particularly rewarded, and FFS is seen as a barrier for developing coordination among health
professionals.
To find new solutions, the 2007 Social Security Financing Act scheduled a period of five years starting in
January 2008 to experiment with supplementary or alternative remuneration schemes in primary care
structures (health centers and multidisciplinary health houses). The pilots, Expérimentation de Nouveaux
Modes de Rémunération (Experimentation on New Modes of Payment, or ENMR), began in January

                                                    28
2010 in six regions. In all, 150 group practices were contracted by 19 regional health agencies (agences
régionales de santé, or RHAs). The total cost of the pilot was about €7 million a year. Primary care
structures are expected to improve management of chronic diseases and effectiveness of care provision
by shifting the focus from curative care for acute conditions toward preventive services and care
coordination. They are also intended to improve accessibility of care (with longer opening hours),
cooperation between professionals (in particular between GPs and nurses), and the range of services for
patients.
Preliminary results of group practice suggest that the quality of care (prevention, coordination) in most
domains is better, with slightly lower health care or pharmaceutical consumption in group practices than
among solo-practice GPs. It also seems that in locations where pilots were installed, the density of GPs
                                                   7
has grown more rapidly than in the control areas. Group practice appears to be more attractive for
generalists than solo practice in rural or underserved areas (Chevillard et al. 2013).

                4.3       REFORMING THE HOSPITAL SECTOR TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY
Activity-Based Payment
Until 2005 two different funding arrangements were used to pay public and private hospitals. Public and
most private not-for-profit hospitals had global budgets, mainly based on historical costs, while private for-
profit hospitals had an itemized billing system with different components: daily tariffs covered the cost of
accommodation, nursing, and routine care; and separate payments were made for each diagnostic and
therapeutic procedure, with separate bills for costly drugs and physicians’ fees.
This difference between public and private hospitals had always been controversial. Public hospitals
considered global budgets an instrument of rationing, which strangled the most dynamic hospitals and
were inflexible to changing demand. Private hospitals argued that global budgets rewarded inefficiency
and prevented fair benchmarking—that is, they believed that although they were more efficient, they were
not remunerated accordingly.
DRGs—a form of activity-based payment (ABP)—were launched in 2004–05 to pay for acute care
services (including home hospitalization) with the objective of improving efficiency, creating a level
playing field for payments to public and private hospitals, and improving the transparency of hospital
activity and management (box 4.2).
Improvements in hospital sector efficiency have been observed since the introduction of DRGs. The
number of public hospitals in deficit decreased, and the size of the overall deficit fell from €485 million in
2007 to €220 million in 2010 (Cour des Comptes 2009). There also appeared to be a positive trend in
productivity of public hospitals after 2004, with a strong rise in case mix–weighted production; whereas in
the private sector, a modification of activity (case mix) was observed rather than a significant increase in
productivity (Or et al. 2013; Studer 2012). Overall, DRG-based payment addressed some chronic
problems inherent in the hospital market and improved transparency and accountability of health care
facilities and enhanced efficiency. DRGs allowed for gains in overall transparency of information on
hospital activity. Moreover, by linking payments to actual activity, DRG-payment creates direct incentives
for hospitals to increase productivity.

Box 4.2 DRGs à la Française
Implementation. In the public sector (public and private not-for-profit hospitals), the share of activities paid
for by ABP increased gradually, starting with 10 percent in 2004 and 25 percent in 2005 to reach 100
percent in 2008. Private for-profit hospitals, however, have been paid entirely by ABP since March 2005.
A transition period (until 2012) was allowed where "national prices" were adjusted, with each provider
taking into account its own historical costs and prices.
Patient classification. Under ABP, the income of each hospital is linked directly to the number and case
mix of patients treated, defined in terms of homogeneous patient groups (groupes homogènes des
malades). The classification was inspired initially by the US Health Care Financing Group classification
(HCFA-DRG) but adapted to the French system and modified regularly. The current version (v11) of the
classification, introduced in 2009, accounts for 2,291 groups, distinguishing four levels of case severity for
most DRGs, compared with 784 in the previous version.
Price setting. The DRG prices (tariffs) for each service are set annually at the national level based on
average costs. However, there are two different sets of tariffs: one for public (including private, not-for-
profit) hospitals and one for private, for-profit hospitals. The tariffs for public hospitals cover all costs
linked to a stay, while those for the private sector do not cover medical fees paid to doctors (which are
paid FFS) or the costs of biological and imaging tests (for example, scanning), which are billed separately.
Average costs per DRG (reference costs) are calculated from a voluntary set of hospitals. Reference
costs are transformed into actual DRG prices by the Ministry of Health in a complex and opaque
calculation, taking into account total hospital expenditure growth and public health priorities.
Extra payments. Public hospitals (and private hospitals participating in so-called “public missions”) receive
additional payments—Missions d'Intérêt Général et à l'Aide à la Contractualisation (General Interest
Missions and Assistance Contracts)—to compensate for specific missions, including education, research,
and innovation-related activities; activities of general public interest such as those meeting national or
regional priorities (for example, developing preventive care); and investments in quality, contracted with
the RHAs. The costs of maintaining emergency care and related activities are paid by fixed yearly grants,
plus an FFS element accounting for the annual activity of providers. Finally, a restricted list of expensive
drugs and medical devices is paid retrospectively, according to the actual level of prescriptions.
Expenditure control. To contain hospital expenditure, national expenditure targets for acute care (with
separate targets for the public and private sectors) are set by Parliament. If the actual growth in volume
exceeds the target, prices subsequently decrease. However, this macro-level regulatory mechanism
creates confusion and an extremely opaque environment for hospitals in which it is impossible to predict
market trends and prices. Prices for homogeneous patient groups are set as a function of overall changes
in hospital activity, increasingly independent of costs and their evolution at individual hospital level.

However, the quality of hospital care may be at risk: 30-day readmission rates for the main cardiovascular
diseases and for cancer are reported higher since the introduction of DRG payment. Moreover, the sharp
increase in standardized rates of certain interventions and procedures is suggestive of supplier-induced
demand that is little justified. Increasingly, the quality and relevance of care provided under the DRG
system are questioned, as ABP provides incentives to develop hospital activity, sometimes beyond what
is medically necessary. Assuring pertinence of care is now a policy priority, with several institutions
tackling the issue. Finally, it is largely recognized that ABP does not favor cooperation between hospitals
or within a hospital between different departments to assure care coordination and quality.
Future objectives include adjusting hospital payments based on a range of quality indicators, extending
payments beyond acute hospital reimbursement (especially for chronically ill and multi-morbidity patients),
and bundling payments for rehabilitative services. But these may be more difficult to achieve than initially
thought due to lack of robust cost data across providers.

New Corporate Governance for Hospitals
Influenced by lessons from other sectors, many health care policy makers concluded that the
performance problems of public hospitals were grounded in the rigidity of hierarchical bureaucracy, the
lack of control by managers, and absence of performance-based incentives. Having applied new public
management techniques in other sectors, it was a natural step to consider applying similar reforms to the
health sector (Preker and Harding 2003). Initially, the reform choice was to give hospitals some degree of
autonomy. Limited success with this type of reform encouraged European policy makers to transform
state-owned facilities into private firms or networks (such as Hospital Trusts in the United Kingdom).
Along these lines, a middle course between the status quo and privatization, which consisted of retaining
public ownership of the hospital but initiating organizational reforms in the form of “corporatization,” was
introduced in France, as in neighboring countries, in the 2000s.
Introducing new payment mechanisms alone would not be sufficient for hospitals to rationalize how they
were organized: combining internal governance and funding reform was necessary to give public
hospitals the requisite flexibility to respond to the incentives they were offered. Reforms in internal
governance, included, first, reinforcing the role of the hospital chief executive officer (CEO), closely
associating medical staff in strategic decision making; and second, giving medical management more
autonomy within their remit.
The powers of the hospital CEO have been greatly extended, and he or she alone is accountable to the
regulatory entities with the power to make spending and recruiting decisions. This expansion was
associated with a dual management model, engaging the medical community in strategic decision making.
In practice, the Medical Board (Commission médicale d’établissement) now has full powers for care
safety, quality, and patient outcomes; its main role is to draw up the medical project (projet médical) of the
hospital, for which it has full decision-making and implementation power. Additionally, the CEO must
consult with the Medical Board in any decision that affects the hospital’s organization from the standpoint
of medical care. Moreover, the chairperson of the Medical Board is also vice chair of the board of
directors (the directoire) that assists the CEO and must be consulted on all key aspects of hospital
management (financial accounts, investment choices, recruitment and staffing policy, and contracting with
regulatory entities).
Another structurally significant aspect of reforms for internal governance was the introduction of new units
called medical “departments” (pôles). Their aim is to give senior medical personnel more managerial
autonomy while making them more accountable for resources. Indeed, the everyday actions and strategic
choices they make must comply with the activity and managerial performance specifications contained in
the contract they sign (the department contract—contrat de pôle) with the hospital management. This
internal contract reflects the objectives and indicators set out in the external contracting mechanisms (see
below on external governance). The creation of such a department headed by medical staff with
increased managerial autonomy has been a crucial step toward promoting a performance-oriented culture
in hospitals. Another underlying objective is to encourage cooperation between medical wards and
resource sharing (administrative and paramedical personnel, equipment, and R&D), thus helping to
rationalize organization at hospital level.
Changes required by law in hospitals’ internal organization were implemented quite rapidly. A few years
after 2005, medical departments were in place and joint CEO/Medical Board governance structures had
been set up. The principle of empowering the medical community is now widely accepted and is
promoted in hospitals by a medico-economic approach to health care.
A cornerstone of internal governance reforms has been the creation of medical departments that
encompass several medical units or specialties and are financially accountable to the CEO. In principle,
the rationale for defining boundaries should be based on medical logic or common projects such as R&D
or patient pathways. In reality, however, decisions are sometimes based on preexisting logistical or
organizational constraints such as common accountancy software or use of the same building. The most
successful experiences occurred where departments’ boundaries matched hospitals’ strategic objectives
and where the medical units they encompassed were tied to common goals. In less successful cases,
heads of departments have had to give medical meaning ex post to artificially designed organizations
(IGAS 2010).

        SECTION 5: REFORMING HEALTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE
      Summary: Traditionally, France’s health care system has had strong central governance
      and a hospital-centered model; the regions had limited power. New sector governance was
      introduced at the end of the 2000s, shifting power to recently created Regional Health
      Agencies (RHAs), as “one-stop shops.” In addition, a set of instruments was introduced to
      move from a supply-oriented approach and to better serve populations according to their
      actual needs and demand.

                                    5.1      THE CREATION OF RHAS
Metropolitan France’s 22 regions and 96 departments have limited degrees of administrative autonomy.
Several initiatives for decentralizing executive powers have led to fragmentation of responsibility for
health services among administrative levels (Larcher 2007). In 2009, a major reform package—the Law
“Hôpital, patients, santé et territoires” (Hospital, Patients, Health and Territories)—transformed health
governance, simplifying regional health management while strengthening coherence of health care
policies at regional level.
Until 2010, most hospital activities were controlled by regional hospital agencies (agences régionales
d'hospitalisation), but several state agencies were responsible for the provision and financing of different
types of long-term and social care services. The core measure in the reform was the creation of RHAs,
which, along the lines of one-stop shops, brought together seven different public agencies. The agencies
have the mission to define health care needs at regional level and guarantee fair access to care, and to
improve coordination between hospital, ambulatory, and social care providers. They oversee public and
private hospitals, as well as nursing homes.
The RHAs were set up in 2010. Their directors are nominated by the government’s Council of Ministers
(cabinet). They are to invest in health promotion and prevention as well as to regulate care supply to meet
the needs of the local population while assuring quality and efficiency. They are increasingly important
actors in shaping health care organization.
Another significant structural change is the creation of new legal entities called local hospital communities
(communautés hospitalières de territoire), in view of quality problems in low-volume, small hospitals for
complex surgery (Or 2007). They are formed by grouping large and small hospitals based on the
complementarity of their medical competencies. The idea is to concentrate complex surgical interventions
in high-volume hospitals and transfer less complex medical and medico-social care to small, local
hospitals. In principle, hospitals in such a community will be able to share their patients as well as their
health care resources.

                 5.2      GREATER LOCAL REGULATION OF HEALTH CARE SUPPLY
In the last few decades in all high-income countries, technological and organizational progress has
changed the role that modern hospitals play within health care economies and territories (often, regions),
in particular with the advent of lighter ambulatory care techniques. Unlike other countries in Europe such
as Sweden or the United Kingdom, which have a strong primary care infrastructure, France has
traditionally been a hospital-centered system with weak ties to other health care providers.
On the eve of reforms, there was agreement that the last several decades of supply-side planning
pursued centrally by the Ministry of Health had led to an expensive, over-hospitalized health care system
to the detriment of other health care providers. Reforms therefore aimed at readjusting hospitals’
functions within a territory in relation to other providers, and at rationalizing overall health care supply to
address local needs, while avoiding duplication and waste. Ultimately, the policy objective was (and is) to
promote the emergence of hybrid forms of health care organization that cut across hospital boundaries
and enable better links between hospitals as well as with ambulatory, primary, and social care.
Previous forms of strict quantitative planning with quotas were abandoned in 2003 and replaced by more
flexible approaches based on fulfilling local health needs rather than defining strict targets for supply (that
is, a demand-oriented rather than a supply-side approach). A regional organization plan (schéma régional

                                                      32
d'organisation sanitaire), drawn up by each RHA, defines each region’s health care supply needs
simultaneously for hospital, ambulatory, and social care on the basis of regional demographic and
epidemiological characteristics.
The shift toward more decentralized and flexible forms of governance is also apparent in the increased
use of contracting mechanisms between individual hospitals and the RHAs. Indeed, RHAs must sign a
five-year contract with each hospital (contrat pluriannuel d’objectifs et de moyens), defining service,
quality objectives, and resources required, so that hospitals have to justify their resource use.
Despite this shift, RHAs’ capacity to manage financial resources remains weak. They have hardly enough
funding on which to base rational supply-side restructuring. The Ministry of Health remains the last-resort
decision maker on most sensitive issues, such as hospital restructuring. In 2013, RHAs had €3 billion to
finance some hospital and social services—a very small proportion of public health care expenditure in
the hospital sector (less than 4 percent).
Moreover, RHAs do not have the data on which to make rational decisions. Indeed, most strategic data
on patients’ characteristics and health care consumption are contained in the claims data that are
managed by health insurance funds. In theory, this information should be shared with RHAs and analyzed
by local teams to identify care-consumption patterns and shortcomings in care supply. But in reality,
access to health data is a major problem (box 5.1), and the lack of an appropriate (open) structure
presenting health data in a meaningful way as well as the scarcity of expertise in health information
statistics among RHA staff reduce the agencies’ capacity for regional guidance.
Another issue for improving regional efficiency was that various types of suppliers were regulated
nationally by different bodies, although locally they were recently under the umbrella of RHAs. Indeed at
national level, all ambulatory care providers were mainly piloted by the Social Security administration with
collective contracting mechanisms, while hospitals were within the ministry’s remit; and home and social
care are in the hands of locally elected authorities.
On the ground, this institutional setting has not yet been conducive to cooperation across boundaries of
care, nor to the emergence of new forms of hybrid care supply with multidisciplinary teams responsible for
health care pathways of patients.

Box 5.1 The Importance of Health Information Systems for Regulation
Almost all residents in France have an electronic data card (the Carte Vitale) that contains their
identification and confirms their right to statutory health insurance benefits. This card is used by almost all
health care providers (hospitals, home-based GPs and specialists, pharmacists, diagnostic laboratories,
etc.) to electronically bill the health insurance funds. Thanks to this electronic third party payment system,
patients do not have to directly pay health care professionals, as was previously the case. However, the
Carte Vitale does not have any medical information and does not allow one to follow patients’ medical
history—it is only used for billing.
Reimbursement data on ambulatory care and pharmaceutical products—payment of which is based on
an itemized FFS system—are registered in a data repository managed by health insurance funds called
the SHI inter-scheme system (Système National d’Information Inter-régime de l’Assurance Maladie). It
contains about 1.2 billion yearly reimbursement records providing valuable information on prescriptions,
physicians, and patients, and can be linked to data from other sources such as hospitals and private
insurers. The data are collected primarily for reimbursement, follow-up, and management by SHI. Use of
these data is strictly regulated with few public agencies and institutions allowed to exploit certain data.
Private for-profit organizations are forbidden access, and use of insurance data for commercial purposes
is prohibited. However, processing these data for general use is not part of the funds’ mission, and hence
little information is available to the public for comparing the quality and cost of health care services.
Currently, there is intense demand both from the industry and the research community for further sharing
the reimbursement data (the “open data initiative”).

On hospital care, where activity is measured by DRGs, the major information system is an activity
database (the Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d’Information) managed by a specialized
technical agency of the Ministry of Health (the Agence Technique de l’Information Hospitalière). This
agency is also responsible for setting the DRG tariffs, based on the cost structure of a sample of hospitals.

                                            CONCLUSION
France’s experience presents several potentially useful lessons for other countries aiming for UHC. The
mix of mandatory and voluntary insurance to cover copayments of basic health services seems to have
been effective in covering the entire population for a comprehensive set of goods and services and
against costs of illness. However, the introduction of a state-funded insurance scheme for the poorest
was necessary to ensure that individuals with variable incomes actually benefit from the same health
coverage. Moreover, a series of complementary schemes and measures were necessary to deal with
negative effects of cost sharing for basic health services for low socioeconomic groups and improve
equitable access to care over time. Still, inequalities in health and access to specialist services persist.
Thus France’s experience with private complementary insurance suggests that reliance on voluntary
insurance for financing basic health services is problematic for equity and redistribution. A wider
mandatory system covering all necessary services would probably be a more equitable approach.
The initial employment-based funding system proved somehow unsustainable in a constrained economic
environment with high unemployment and an aging population. Funding sources have been broadened in
the past 10 years, generating additional resources through different taxes applied to a broader range of
incomes, including that from financial assets. On the expenditure side, a series of measures, including
national targets, to curb escalating trends have helped monitor health expenditure more closely and
demonstrated some promising results in curbing health spending in very recent years.
Like many other countries, efficiency and quality of care have been a continuous concern for France’s
health system. Investing in primary care by strengthening the role of GPs in delivery and coordination of
care has been a key strategy in recent years. The experience with pay-for-performance contracts for GPs
(CAPI) has shown advantages over traditional FFS for improving the efficiency and accountability of
providers. However, the French experience with gatekeeping has also suggested that payment reforms
built on FFS are, on their own, unable to radically change provider behavior.
France has also been exploring alternative payment models incentivizing collaborative work in
multidisciplinary group practices that emphasize prevention and care coordination. At hospital level, a
tailored DRG system introduced in the mid-2000s has reached half its goals by boosting productivity, but
challenges remain for ensuring quality and pertinence of care and improving performance overall.
France’s experience also shows that to deal with adverse effects of a DRG payment system, a strong
information system monitoring costs and quality of hospital services is essential, as is flexible and
transparent governance supporting continual fine-tuning of the incentive structure.
To improve equity of access to care, as well as quality and efficiency, the authorities also had to modify
the traditional centralized and fragmented governance model. Health governance has been thoroughly
reformed over the past decade, through the creation of regional entities overseeing all health care
providers (hospital, ambulatory, and social care) to meet the needs of the local population, and by
remodeling hospital corporate governance, leading to a new deal between hospital administration and the
medical community.
The conflicting pressures to curb rising health expenditures while ensuring equity of access and quality of
care characterize France’s experience with UHC—highlighting the crucial role of complex, perpetual
reforms to sustain UHC.

While Universal Health Coverage (UHC) offers a powerful goal for a nation, all countries—irrespective of
income—are struggling with achieving or sustaining UHC. France is a high-income country where health
coverage is in effect universal. Health-related costs are covered by a mix of mandatory Social Health Insurance
(SHI) and private complementary schemes, while benefit packages are comprehensive, uniform and of good
quality. France provides some of the highest financial protection among countries in the OECD. Still, under
pressure to sustain UHC without compromising equity of access, the system has been fine-tuned continually
since inception. Much can be learned from France’s experience in its reforms toward better fiscal sustainability,
equity and efficiency. This study assesses the major challenges that France has faced for sustaining UHC, and
highlights its experiences and lessons in addressing system bottlenecks to benefit less developed countries as
they embark on the path to UHC.
