Fiscal Year in Pakistan (July 1—June 30)
Pakistan Development Update                                                            October 2014


                                       Executive Summary

   •   In just a few weeks, since mid-August, economic conditions that had improved so much during
       FY2013/14 weakened a bit due to a succession of political events. Progress last year was indeed
       significant supported by a solid economic reform program of the Government of Pakistan. An IMF
       Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and two World Bank Development Policy Credits with a focus to
       restructure the energy sector, foster private and financial sector developments and improve social
       protection and revenue mobilization have reinforced the reform program. The risk of a balance of
       payment crisis was minimized with a significant strengthening of the international reserves position.
       This mainly resulted from strong remittances and significant foreign capital inflows, which also
       brought stability in the foreign exchange market. A strong fiscal consolidation achieved; the fiscal
       deficit was contained at around 5.5 percent of GDP—due to improved tax collection, high non-tax
       revenues, and restricted (current and development) expenditures. Price stabilization followed with
       average inflation remaining in single digits. This environment favored growth recovery, with GDP
       growth rate above 4 percent for the first time in seven years—driven by dynamic manufacturing and
       service sectors supported by better energy availability and improved investors’ expectations. As a
       result, performance under the IMF program remained satisfactory, with the Third Review concluded
       on June 27. However, since mid-August, the ongoing political uncertainty has negatively affected the
       macroeconomic stance and may modify the pace and depth of reforms. Some salient features of
       FY2013/14 economic performance were:
           • Growth re-emerged. GDP growth rate was 4.1 percent in FY2013/14, primarily driven by the
           manufacturing and services sectors. Industrial sector growth was based on a sharp turnaround in
           construction, electricity generation and gas distribution and better performance of large scale
           manufacturing (LSM) growth (of about 4 percent). In addition, services contributed to about 60
           percent of growth through relatively better performance in wholesale and retail trade; and
           transport, storage and communication (which together accounts for half of services value added).
           Agricultural growth, however, was slower compared to the previous year.
           • Increased remittances, capital and financial inflows supported a buildup of reserves.
           Remittances touched US$ 15.8 billion. The capital and financial account registered a sizeable
           surplus of US$ 7.07 billion in FY2013/14 compared to only US$ 0.8 billion in FY2012/13.
           Official reserves coverage increased to about two month of next year’s projected imports of
           goods and services on June 30, 2014. Foreign inflows led to a mild appreciation of the real
           effective exchange rate.
           • A significant correction of a previously loose fiscal stance took place. The government
           reduced the fiscal deficit from 8.3 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to 5.5 percent of GDP in
           FY2013/14. Tax revenues increased by almost 1 percent of GDP and expenditures compressed by
           1.3 percent of GDP.
           • Fiscal consolidation and improvement in business confidence produced a strong recovery
           in credit to the private sector, after five years of muted growth. The lower demand for
           commercial bank credit by the government due to a lower fiscal deficit provided necessary space
           to the private sector to borrow from the banking system.
           • Price stability – with CPI inflation in single digit – was preserved. Better food supply
           conditions, reduced external vulnerability and fiscal consolidation contributed to the softening of
           underlying inflationary pressures.
   •   Progress on the structural reform agenda was promising. The government reduced power subsidies,
       by adjusting power tariff towards cost recovery level. In order to overcome inter-corporate circular
       debt issue, the stock and flow of payables at all levels of the energy sector will now be identified by a
       technical and financial audit and a roadmap to limit the accumulation of new arrears and reduce their

Pakistan Development Update                                                           October 2014

       stock has been designed. Government also completed capital market transactions by selling shares of
       United Bank Limited (UBL) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) in June 2014; and successfully
       auctioned 3G telecoms licenses. Under a three-year program to phase out concessionary tax
       exemptions, the FY2014/15 budget approved a package of revenue measures to expand the tax base,
       including the elimination of tax exemptions and adjustments to the sales and excise tax rates for
       special categories so as to raise additional revenues equivalent to above 1 percent of GDP. In
       addition, the government reduced statutory Custom tariff slabs from eight to six, which will
       subsequently be brought to four in the next two years. It expanded the coverage of beneficiaries and
       significantly increased the benefits of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) cash transfer
       program while introducing conditional cash transfers supporting school enrolment. To build reserves
       and in a sign reflecting investors’ confidence toward these reforms, after a gap of seven years, the
       government raised US$2 billion by placing sovereign bonds in international debt markets.
   •   The political events following the mid-August Long-March and Sit-in may have affected the
       economy. The Bank is in no capacity to make judgments of the possible outcomes of these events and
       their medium term impact on the economy. However, besides appraising its short-term effects, two
       questions left are how much the business-prone investor-friendly image that Pakistan was carefully
       rebuilding has been compromised, and how quickly reform momentum can be recovered. Signs of
       partial deterioration of the economy are multiple and mixed. On the one hand, growth may have
       slowed down in the first quarter of FY2014/15 as the virtual paralysis of the government machinery
       may have affected trade, construction and services. The international reserve position has suffered
       small losses. Accelerated rupee depreciation of 3.0 percent in August 2014 forced the State Bank of
       Pakistan (SBP) to intervene by about US$375 million. Investment decisions and visits by China and
       Sri Lanka presidents were postponed. On the other hand, on the public expenditure side, the cost of
       additional security, as mentioned by the government, has rather been small (Rs 357.6 million
       equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP), and tax receipts kept robust, growing at 25 percent last August
       despite a call for civil disobedience made by the demonstrators.
   •   It also remains to be determined how much the pro-reform momentum, so carefully gathered
       during the past fiscal year and entering a decisive second year, will be affected by the civill unrest;
       but new investors’ confidence-building measures will have to be nurtured to reinvigorate the
       reform agenda. Due to the political situation, the government might find difficult to implement
       certain structural reforms needed for growth acceleration and poverty reduction or might consider
       delaying them. In an early sign of the ongoing difficulties, and unlike the past three favorable and
       timely reviews of the IMF program, the fourth review initially scheduled for Board presentation by
       the end of September is at a standstill. At least three areas of reform may get delayed or modified:
       approval of adjustment in power tariffs; the privatization agenda; and reforms requiring legislative
       approval. Alternatively, the government may consider strengthening some areas of the program such
       as power, with more decisive and less incremental actions, inclusion and governance. Strengthening
       media communication efforts on the benefits of reforms may also contribute to regaining the
       momentum.

The risk of a balance of payment crisis has been minimized.

Further decomposition of export performance reveals        Source: State Bank of Pakistan
that the year-on-year exports growth during the second quarter decelerated sharply to -0.17 percent compared
to 3.1 percent during the first half of FY2013/14 (H1-FY2013/14). Overall, export growth was mainly driven
by textile products (raw cotton, knitwear, bed wear and other textile made-ups), the petroleum group (solid
fuel, naphtha), and rice exports as a result of both increased quantity and unit value. Pakistani exports
continued to be highly concentrated in textile exports (see Figure 1) and likely to benefit from GSP plus status
from the European Union, 2 the largest export market with a share of 25 percent in total exports. On the other
hand, non-textile exports, particularly other manufacturing group (machinery and transport equipment, gems
and jewelry, handicrafts, cement and cement products etc.) witnessed a sharp decline 3 due to the power
shortages and the fall in international prices.

  Pakistan export to EU mainly comprises textile and clothing, accounted for 75 percent of total exports to EU. Nevertheless, a
competitive and less volatile exchange rate is imperative.

3.       Import growth was mainly driven by improved domestic production rather than consumption.
Imports of machinery, 4 particularly power generation, textile, construction and electrical machinery, grew by
about 26 percent. The increased import of textile machinery reflects the revival of the textile industry in
response to getting GSP plus status while imports of construction and power generation machinery are
attributable to ongoing work on various power and construction activities in the country. In addition, due to
higher economic activity, higher demand for some of industrial raw materials such as plastic materials,
fertilizers, iron and steel scrap and synthetic fiber contributed to the import growth (see Table 2).

4.      Current transfers (mainly remittances) continued to be a source of comfort. Current transfers at
US$ 20.1 billion more than compensated for US$ 19.2 billion deficit in trade of goods and services. Workers’
remittances registered a sharp growth of 13.7 percent 5 against 5.6 percent last year. Country wise data shows
that remittances from all major countries increased except the United Kingdom, 6 which contributes about 14
percent in total remittances. The share of Saudi Arabia in overall remittances was the largest (30 percent);
with the United Arab Emirates (20 percent) and the United States(16 percent) having the second and third
largest shares, together contributing 65 percent in total remittances 7 ; while member countries the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) contributed about 12 percent. Remittances from the European Union countries
grew significantly, by 20 percent against a contraction of 2 percent last year. However, the European Union
contributed just 3 percent to the remittance flow, thereby contributing only marginal influence on volume and
growth in remittance.

  Import of machinery contributed about 15 percent in total import bill.
5
  The significant growth can be largely explained by the initiative of channelizing international remittances through banks and other
money transfer service under Pakistan Remittances Initiatives (PRI).

   Growth rate decreased from 28 percent in FY2012/13 to 12 percent in FY2013/14.

  Remittances from Saudi Arabia, UAE and USA grew by 15 percent, 13 percent, and 12.7 percent respectively in FY2013/14.

6.       Overall, official reserves increased to US$ 9.71 billion by June 30, 2014 compared to US$6.0
billion at end of FY2012/13. This translates into 2.1 months of import coverage (reserves sufficient to import
next year’s projected import of goods and services). Moreover, based on positive external outlook, improved
financial indicators and with a steady economic performance, Moody’s changed Pakistan’s external ratings
from negative to stable.

rupee appreciated by 9.9 percent during last seven

reestablish fiscal stability. Supported by the IMF’s EFF program, the government aimed at lowering the
consolidated fiscal deficit from 8.3 percent of GDP in FY2012/13 to 5.8 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 by
raising tax revenue by almost 1 percent of GDP and constraining expenditures by another 1.3 percent of GDP.
In addition, the federal government agreed with the provinces to maintain a sizeable fiscal surpluses (of 0.2 to
0.5 percent of GDP) to achieve this substantial reduction in consolidated fiscal deficit. The provisional data
for FY2013/14 indicates that the government was able to exceed this target by lowering the fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) to 5.5 percent of GDP (see Table 3). The actual budget financing was 4.7 percent of GDP
because of higher-than-anticipated availability of grants (at Rs. 206 billion compared to programmed amount
of Rs. 67 billion).

9.       The reduction in the fiscal deficit was achieved with a mix of increases in federal tax collection,
albeit lower-than-expected, and receipts of more than projected non-tax revenue. Despite strong efforts
from the government, tax collection improved but below                  Table 3: Summary of Fiscal Operations

provinces in shared revenue, fiscal consolidation has
become both complicated and difficult. With its drastically reduced revenue share and expenditure rigidities,
the federal government, on its own, cannot reduce the fiscal deficit to the desired level. In FY2013/14, the
federal government requested the provinces to show a combined fiscal surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP, and
provided incentives in the form of                    Table 4: Provincial Fiscal Surpluses, 2012/13 – 2013/14

  A peculiar accounting protocol was adopted by the government for the Saudi grant of Rs. 157 billion (0.6 percent of GDP). The
amount was deposited in the Pakistan Development Fund and accounted as recurrent expenditure (as federal grant). To balance this
expenditure, the same (but negative) amount was added to the statistical discrepancy. This implies that had it not been for this
accounting protocol, the recurrent expenditure of the government would have fallen short of the target by 0.4 percent of GDP. At the
same time, the statistical discrepancy would have reduced to only -0.3 percent of GDP.

12.     Beside a lower fiscal deficit, improvement was also made in the mode of financing. Since
FY2007/08, Pakistan had been running high fiscal deficits with decreasing external financing. This caused the
government to resort to heavy borrowing from the banking system, including the central bank, to finance
them. Excessive reliance on domestic borrowing had exacerbated inflationary pressures and crowded-out
bank credit for private investment. In contrast, the FY2013/14 fiscal consolidation program was able to restart
donors’ budget support operations, including US$1 billion provided by the World Bank and about US$500
million provided by the ADB and Japan. Hence, against the program target of 3.7 percent of GDP, the
government borrowed only one-third of that amount (1.3 percent of GDP) domestically from the banking
system.

15.     Net external debt inflows contributed to an increase in their stock after two years. Pakistan entered
into a three year US$ 6.64 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF in September 2013. This
arrangement enabled a healthy inflow of multilateral and bilateral monies. Of the 18 new loans signed during
FY2013/14, two World Bank International Development Association (IDA) Development Policy Credits
(DPCs) and an ADB budget support operation added US$ 1.4 billion to the external debt stock. Moreover, the
Government was able to place US$ 2.0 billion Eurobonds issuance in April 2014 16. It is worth mentioning
here that the new loans are mostly designed in a ‘front-loaded’ modality with a disbursement to loan ratio of
about 61 percent.

   Pakistan entered international financial markets after a gap of almost seven years, raising US$ 1.0 billion each in 5 and 10 years
tenors – five year bonds at a fixed rate of 7.25 percent (5-year UST + 558bps) and 10 year bonds at a fixed rate of 8.25 percent (10-yr

   Fiscal consolidation coupled with higher external inflows and increased reliance on non-bank sources of financing during H2-
FY2013/14 substituted part of government borrowings from the banking system.

   The quantitative limits set under the IMF program on NDA such as ceiling set on government borrowings from SBP and indirect
impact of restrictions on the fiscal deficit contributed to this slowdown in NDA.

Rs258 billion in FY2012/13.
18.      The lower demand for commercial bank credit by the government provided necessary space to the
private sector to borrow from the banking system. Private sector credit has increased by 11.4 percent year-
on-year to Rs. 384 billion during FY2013/14 compared to a small contraction of half a percent in FY2012/13–
highest in last six years. Similarly, loans to private sector businesses (PSBs) have increased by Rs.298 billion.
This upward trend in credit uptake along with growth in LSM of 3.9 percent (year-on-year) during
FY2013/14 indicates the revival of economic activity and improved business climate after current government
took office. Analysis of loans by type shows that while a bulk of credit was available for working capital (Rs
228 billion); a sizeable amount was also utilized for capital formation (Rs. 70 billion or 0.3 percent of GDP).
This welcome rise in credit is attributable to uptakes by textiles, energy, agriculture, telecom, food and
beverages, metals, and retail trade and petroleum products. The telecom sector is investing in expanding its
infrastructure after obtaining 3G/4G spectrum. Energy and textiles are possibly modernizing and expanding
their production due to expected higher demand. In addition, the sugar sector is investing in bagasse based
Co-Generation Power Projects. The government aims to continue enhancing investors’ confidence by
focusing on doing business indicators (see Box 2). 19

   Within food group (37 percent weight in CPI), much of the volatility was a result of higher inflation in perishable segment (5 percent
weight in CPI). For instance, during November 2013, perishable segment’s weighted contribution in y-o-y inflation was about 22
percent (see Figure 8)

Non-Energy (NFNE) and 20 percent trimmed mean, exhibited gradual easing during FY2013/14. This
indicates moderation of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy largely due to improvements in
supply conditions and marginal softening of aggregate demand relative to the available productive capacity. 21
In general, the supply conditions improved in FY2013/14. This is reflected in higher growth of industrial
goods and non-perishable food items, such as sugar, rice, and wheat contributed to this trend. This
improvement in supply conditions along with moderate aggregate demand partly due to government’s fiscal
consolidation helped in containing inflationary pressure buildup in FY2013/14. In addition, general
deceleration in international commodity prices, including oil prices, and appreciation of the rupee has also
dampened imported inflation component.

And growth recovery finally took place, driven by industrial and services sectors
21.     Pakistan’s real GDP growth is picking up. It grew by 4.1 percent in FY2013/14—higher than last
year’s growth of 3.7 percent (see Table 6). 22 It exceeded the 4.0 percent mark for the first time since
FY2008/09, sustaining the growth trajectory in an increasing trend. The government has set a growth target of
5.1 percent for FY2014/15.

strong growth of the major crops. Agriculture sector

This declining trend however is surprising given significant technological upgrades in this sector in recent
years. 24
23.     The industrial sector (with 21 percent share of GDP) contributed significantly to growth based on a
sharp turnaround in construction, electricity generation and gas distribution and better performance of
large scale manufacturing (LSM). LSM (with a share of 52 percent in the overall industry) grew by 3.9

21
   Aggregate demand, which was 108 percent of GDP in FY2011/12 declined marginally to 106 percent in FY2013/14. The marginal
increase in GDP growth to 4.1 percent in FY2013/14 is mostly a reflection of better utilization of spare capacity.

   These are official provisional estimates based on 10 months data.

   Drag especially came from potato crop.

   This sector has undergone significant technological upgrade in recent years, with vertical integration in supply chain of meat and
dairy products, and the focus on new processing techniques that are based on international hygiene and health standards. However, the
hard data on livestock may not reflect such trends, as the share of the formal segment is still very low compared to the informal
market. Currently, gross value addition in the livestock sector is computed on the basis of past surveys or by applying fixed
parameters (Source: SBP third quarterly report FY2013/14).

also registered strong growth of 9.5 percent, reflecting
bullish consumer sentiments. The drag on the manufacturing sector growth came from sub-sectors such as
automobiles, engineering and wood products. The LSM sector could have surpassed its FY2012/13 growth of
4.0 percent but the hike in the power tariff for industrial users, in September 2013, and imposition of Gas
Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC, including gas dependent industries such as textiles, fertilizers,
cement and paper) 28 in January 2014, increased the cost of production for many industries, taking some steam
out of LSM growth.
25.     Services sector performance in FY2013/14 remained relatively weak. This sector has been on a
mixed growth trajectory – 4.9 percent in FY2012/13 and 4.3 percent in FY2013/14. Relatively modest
performance during FY2013/14 was largely driven by the finance and insurance and general government
services sub-sectors (almost 17 percent share in services value added) whereas wholesale and retail trade and
transport, storage and communication (which together accounts for half of services value added) continued to
provide impetus to overall growth in services.

   As per July-June data released by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. This number is lower than the 5.1 percent growth rate used in
Economic Survey FY2014/15, which is based on nine months available data only.

   These include textiles, agro-based industries, paper and board, iron and steel products, coke and petroleum products, chemicals,
fertilizers, electronics, leather, rubber products, and non-metallic minerals.

   Chinese government announced a lower target price in the new cotton policy (March 2014) compared to the support price in the
older policy. Under the new policy, Chinese government instead of buying cotton at higher than market prices would pay a differential
to farmers if market price falls below the target price.

   GIDC was first introduced in 2011 through “Gas Infrastructure Development Cess Act 2011,” primarily to finance the infrastructure
development for the import of natural gas. In July 2013, Peshawar High Court suspended the collection of GIDC by the government.
This suspension was challenged by the government in the Supreme Court, which set aside the High Court decision, resulting in the
resumption of GIDC. The government increased the GIDC on fertilizer feedstock from Rs 197 / mmbtu to Rs 300 / mmbtu and on
power and industrial sector, from Rs 50 /mmbtu to Rs 100 / mmbtu in January 2014.

26.     Consumption in FY2013/14 (private and public) registered at 89.8 percent of GDP, compared to
about 88.6 percent in FY2012/13, a growth of about 7 percent, based on FY2005/06 base year prices. Private
sector consumption remained high at 78 percent of GDP and contributed significantly to current period
economic growth on the back of sustained growth in remittances, increase in rural income due to higher
production of crops and better growth in small-scale manufacturing. Public consumption expenditures showed
a marginal increase in share and reached 12 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 compared to about 11 percent of
GDP in FY2012/13. This increasing consumption trend, particularly private consumption leaving fewer
resources for investment as investment to GDP ratio, has been declining during the last three fiscal years—
from 15.1 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 to 13.8 percent of GDP in FY2013/14.

there were initial signs of improving credit quality
(see Table 8). Non-performing loans (NPLs) declined to 12.8 percent of the overall loan portfolio. Given
adequate provisioning, net NPLs ratio was at 2.9 percent in June 2013. NPLs in Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) remain high representing 33.9 percent of loans, followed by agriculture sector (14.8
percent) and consumer sector (12.4 percent). However, there has been a decrease in NPLs across the
corporate, SME, agriculture, and consumer sectors between July 2013 and June 2014, indicating
improvements in credit quality.

Structural reforms took off on solid ground and played their part at stimulating
growth
31.      Progress on the structural reform agenda is promising. In a move that implicitly acknowledged
favorable investors’ confidence toward these reforms, and after a gap of seven years, the government
successfully raised US$2 billion by placing sovereign bonds in international debt markets in a bid that was
three times oversubscribed. The government:
      •    Reduced power subsidies, supported by power tariff adjustments aimed at gradually phasing them
           out while bringing tariffs to cost recovery level.
      •    Identified the stock and flow of payables at all levels of the energy sector using a technical and
           financial audit.
      •    Designed a roadmap to limit the accumulation of new arrears and reduce their stock.
      •    Successfully completed capital market transactions by selling shares of United Bank Limited and
           Pakistan Petroleum Limited in June 2014.
      •    Listed for divestiture or sale the first transactions among 31 identified state-owned companies.
      •    Auctioned 3G telecoms licenses.
      •    Approved under a three-year program to phase out concessionary tax exemptions, a package of
           revenue measures to expand the tax base, including the elimination of tax exemptions and higher
           income, sales and excise tax rates for special categories, and raise additional revenues equivalent to
           above 1 percent of GDP.
      •    Initially reduced statutory tariff slabs from eight to six in a three-year program that will further
           reduce to four.
      •    Expanded the scope and significantly increased the benefits of the BISP cash transfer program while
           introducing conditional cash transfers supporting school enrolment.

32.     The agenda of key structural reforms was well defined and included the following five
priorities:
   1)   Reforming the power sector is the first and top sector priority as lack of adequate power inhibits
        business, and subsidies contribute to the massive deficit. Measures adopted were part of a new
        energy policy approved last July 2013. The government committed to go further including (i)
        adoption of a new tariff pricing formula, (ii) an improved operating efficiency and reduced losses
        within power distribution companies, and (iii) incentives for investments, including stronger efforts
        to develop gas production.
   2)   Raising revenue from below 10 percent of GDP to 14 percent over five years is a second priority.
        Last year measures adopted raised the tax ratio by about 0.6 percent of GDP. The goal is to increase
        revenue by broadening the tax base, while strengthening compliance with a solid set of tax
        administration reforms and a reinvigorated and performance-based tax administration. Recent
        measures adopted are part of a new tax reform strategy approved last February. As part of the
        strategy they approved (i) completing the three-year program of elimination of tax exemptions and
        concession supported by Statutory regulatory orders (SROs), (ii) transferring FBR legal
        empowerment to approve concessionary tax exemptions, based on SROs to Parliament,(iii)
        successfully implementing new income and sales tax registration schemes, and (iv) significantly
        enhancing enforcement and auditing capacity supported by an integrated and performing IT system
        at the Federal Board of Revenue.
   3)   A third critical reform is consolidating the re-launching of the privatization process, especially
        dealing with loss-making SOEs. This remains essential to improve service delivery, and reduce
        fiscal losses. A list of 31 loss-making enterprises has been approved by the Cabinet Committee on
        Privatization. The government completed the capital market transactions scheduled for the first
        calendar year.
   4)   A fourth critical reform is enhancing the business environment, as part of a comprehensive ongoing
        effort at improving Pakistan’s ranking in doing business indicators. This is needed to foster private
        investment and attract investors, and requires federal and provincial measures. They launched the
        preparation of the One Stop Shop for business registration and submitted the credit bureau law to
        Parliament. Government is also preparing a National Financial Inclusion Strategy and a
        comprehensive plan designed to improve Doing Business Indicators, initially centered on getting
        electricity, paying taxes, enforcing contracts, starting businesses, trading across borders, and getting
        credit.
   5)   Finally, a fifth critical reform is the strengthening of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) as
        part of the support of the poor and vulnerable and, through its conditional cash transfer program,
        increase enrolment in primary school. As part of the Growth DPC, the government approved an
        increase in BISP allocation for Rs. 97.15 billion, which allowed an increase in individual family
        allocations to Rs1500 per month, a 25 percent increase, well above inflation. However, BISP has yet
        to start activities to expand CCTs in the additional 27 districts, and needs to formalize provincial
        Governments’ commitment to cost-sharing arrangements on CCTs with the federal Government.
        BISP also needs to strengthen its internal governance, as perceived weaknesses are affecting its
        performance. The BISP Board — half of its members from private sector—is incomplete and not
        meeting, and there is frequent overlap on management affairs between the Chairperson, the
        Secretary and the rest of the administration in decision-making, which results in delayed or
        ineffective key decisions. A definite solution requires systemic not just managerial measures with
        strong government-wide backing. An option is to address the existing ambiguity in the BISP Act
        2010 with respect to the respective powers and functions of the Board, the Chairperson and the
        Secretary by issuing subsidiary rules and regulations.

The preliminary outlook for FY2014/15 remains cautiously sanguine
33.      The macroeconomic framework for FY2014/15 projects sustained growth recovery-cum-low
inflation, supported by fiscal consolidation and rebuilding of the external position. This projected outcome
assumes improvements in power load-shedding, cumbersome business environment, low access to finance
and stable commodity prices (see Table 10).
34.      Growth and inflation: GDP growth is expected to be between 4.3 percent and 4.6 percent in the
current fiscal year. Relatively stable or declining international commodity prices and stable exchange rate in
real terms are expected to help contain imported inflationary pressures. On the supply side, growth is
expected to continue to be driven by the services and large-scale manufacturing sectors, which would benefit
from decreased power load-shedding, improved business climate, and better availability of credit ensuing
from fiscal consolidation. On the demand side, growth will be supported by substantial remittances inflow,
with strengthened private investment, and renewed export dynamism, and to an increase in public investment.
Inflation, which is already below double digits since the last two fiscal years, is expected to reach between 7.5
percent and 8.0percentdueto continued fiscal prudence and monetary tightening.
35.      Public Finance: Fiscal consolidation is expected to continue on the basis of the effort to raise tax
revenue, curtail federal government grants and subsidies, and increase in development spending for key
public infrastructure and human resource development. Revenues and grants are projected to increase from
15.1 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 to 15.0 percent in FY2014/15 as a result of a sound tax reform strategy
adopted by the government. On the expenditure side, the government’s privatization program and actions to
improve governance and efficiency of the SOEs will result in significant reduction in demand for government
grants for SOEs, whereas adjustments in electricity tariffs and reduction in power sector losses through
administrative and technological measures will lead to substantial reduction in power subsidies. This will lead
to containment of consolidated recurrent expenditure to 16.0 percent in FY2014/15. The overall fiscal deficit
will therefore decline from 5.5 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 to 5.1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15.

36.     External Sector: The current account deficit, which was at 1.2 percent of GDP in FY2013/14, is
expected to increase initially to 1.4 percent in FY2014/15, 30 on the basis of an economic recovery requiring
higher imports (including oil) of raw materials, and gradually declining thereafter. Export recovery and strong
dynamism of remittances is expected to support current account in medium term. Nevertheless, higher
investment inflows attracted by lower country risk, privatizations, setting up of special economic zones
especially attractive to China and Japanese investors; and multilateral flows will support the financial account.

     We are expecting the investment rate to rise faster than the national savings rate.

Gross official foreign exchange reserves are expected to build from 2.1 months of imports by the end of
FY2013/14 to about three months of imports by the end of FY2014/15.

But the overall impact of August political events on the economy is yet uncertain
37.     The August political turmoil has negatively affected the macroeconomic stance and might affect
the pace and depth of structural reforms. Despite the satisfactory outcomes achieved during the first year of
Government, there are early short-term signs of deterioration in key macro indicators that might lead to
medium term external or domestic imbalances. 31
38.     Whether the domestic shock is just a temporary or a permanent shock and the sustainability of its
final outcome will determine the magnitude of its long lasting impact on the economy. In the meantime,
there are perceived signs of deterioration in August that might have long lasting effects over the entire fiscal
year.
      • Growth may have slowed in the first quarter. The virtual paralysis of the government machinery may
       have led to a first quarter slowdown of the economy (particularly affecting trade, construction and
       services). Exports decreased by 7.6 percent (year-on-year) in August. Public investment, especially
       infrastructure projects, have been put on hold, precisely when they were gathering some pace in the last
       quarter of last fiscal year. High-level official visits—China and Sri Lanka presidents were postponed. In
       response to an Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) Survey, firms from 35
       countries reported that: half postponed business trips and 40 percent expected declines in their sales and
       profits in Pakistan linked to the crisis.
      • The international reserve position has suffered small losses. Accelerated rupee depreciation
       triggered by political impasse forced SBP’s intervention by about US$375 million since August 15,
       2014.
      • The fiscal balance has not been affected significantly. The government’s estimate of the cost of
       additional security was Rs.357.6 million until the end of August (small amount equivalent to 0.1
       percent of GDP). But, paradoxically, and contrary to expectations, tax collection growth was a robust
       25 percent (year-on-year) and remittances were also a dynamic 7 percent (year-on-year), last August.
39.      A remaining question is how much the pro-business investor-friendly image that Pakistan was
rebuilding has been shattered by the demonstrators’ sit-ins and how much this will affect prospects for
attracting foreign and private investors. Many investment decisions have been postponed. Investors want to
play safe until a quick and sustained settlement to the crisis. This could delay investment decisions, including
those affecting its privatization process. The international credit ratings that were just recently upgraded might
also get re-evaluated.
40.      Similarly, it remains to be determined how much the reform momentum gathered during past fiscal
years will be affected by political unrest. A politically weaker government may water-down certain structural
reforms that are badly needed for growth acceleration and poverty reduction. In an early sign of the ongoing
difficulties, and unlike the past three favorable and timely reviews of the IMF program, the fourth review
initially scheduled for Board presentation by the end of September is currently at a standstill and its
completion is likely to be affected by the recent political unrest. At least three areas of reform may actually
get delayed or modified: (i) approval of power tariffs, (ii) the privatization agenda, and (iii) reforms requiring
legislative approval. Alternatively, the recent events may also influence the government to consider
strengthening some areas of the program with less than incremental but rather more decisive actions, such as
power, inclusion, and governance. Strengthening media communication efforts on the benefits of reforms may
also contribute to regain momentum.

 By early September, the government of Pakistan’s estimated overall losses on the economy at Rs547 billion (about 2.1 percent of
GDP).

                            Box 1: Government’s Tax Reform Strategy
The government is fully cognizant that creating additional fiscal space through revenue mobilization is critical to
accelerate the pace of economic and social development. For this, it has designed a tax reform strategy to increase tax
revenue by rationalizing tax exemptions, increasing the number of registered taxpayers, expanding the base to taxes; and
ensuring adequate tax compliance through a system of effective audits and strengthened tax enforcement. Overall,
expected minimum annual revenue yields from tax reform from FY14/15 onwards are 0.75, 0.32 and 0.45 percent of
GDP.
Rationalizing tax exemptions: Pakistan’s tax bases are badly perforated due to ad-hoc, discretionary, and generally
distortionary tax exemptions and concessions. By one estimate, these tax exemptions and concessions resulted in a
revenue loss of over Rs 400 billion (or 2 percent of GDP) in FY2010/11. A large number of these exemptions are granted
through Regulatory Statutory Orders (SROs) issued by the Federal Board of revenue (FBR) rather than through tax laws.
The government has categorizes these exemptions into: Category A comprising exemptions that would be retained by
transferring them to the tax laws; Category B, consisting of those exemptions which would be eliminated but with
reduced (than normal) rates; and Category C, containing those exemptions which would be eliminated by imposing the
normal rates. The government has also prepared a plan to eliminate the exemptions in categories B and C over a period
of three years (FY2014/15 – FY2016/17).
Taxpayer registration drive: Among the estimated 52 million income earners, less than 1.5 million are registered income
taxpayers. To increase the number of registered income taxpayers, the government is committed to sending tax notices to
100,000 every year between FY2013/14 andFY2015/16 to salaried individuals with non-salaried income. These potential
taxpayers are identified on the basis of third-party data on acquisition of property, purchase of vehicles, foreign travel
and children’s tuition fee. After 60 days of the issuance of the tax notice, non-compliant individuals are being served
with a second tax notice and after 60 days of second notice, the non-compliant individuals are being served with
provisional assessment orders. In FY2013/14, FBR issued 120,000 tax notices; almost 38,500 second notices and about
28,700 assessment orders. About 17,000 of these individuals have registered themselves as taxpayers and are creating a
tax demand of Rs. 17 billion.
Expanding the base of federal sales tax: In Pakistan, bases of all taxes, especially of sales tax, are very narrow. The
retail sector in particular has managed to stay outside the sales tax net. Through negotiations with the trading community,
the government has designed a new scheme to impose a General Sales Tax (GST) on the retail sector. Retail traders are
divided into two categories. Those traders whose electricity bill is over Rs 600,000 per year would be asked to register
for sales tax and would pay GST at 5 percent of their turnover. While smaller traders, whose electricity bills are less
than Rs 600,000 per year, GST will be charged at 5 percent and collected with the electricity. This measure is expected
to yield Rs 35 billion in FY2014/15.
Effective tax audits: Pakistan has a system of self-assessment for most of the federal taxes. However, until FY2012/13,
tax audits were not undertaken for variety of reasons. In FY2013/14, the government selected 5 percent of filed tax
returns through computerized random balloting, for tax audits. A total of 37,576 tax audits were started and by the end of
June 2014, 78 percent of these were completed, creating a tax demand of Rs 14.5 billion. For FY2014/15, the
government intends to increase the number of tax audits to 10 percent (or higher) of filed tax returns, with expected
minimum tax demand of Rs 40 billion.

                                            Box 2: Doing Business Indicators

The private sector in Pakistan continues to face a tough investment climate, manifested by consistent deterioration in the
country’s Doing Business ranking. In 2014, Pakistan’s ranking was 110 out of 189 economies, down from 76 out of 181
countries in 2008. Pakistan performs well in certain indicators, but lags other South Asian countries considerably in areas
such as getting electricity connections, paying taxes, and enforcing contracts (see Figure A). Additionally, the
performance on doing business indicators varies across cities throughout the country. Challenging business environment
is particularly impeding SME start-ups, operations and exit. SMEs account for 99 percent of business establishments in
Pakistan, employing between one and 20 workers and 70 percent of the non-agricultural labor force, contributing around
30 percent to GDP and 25 percent to exports.

The government of Pakistan is aiming to improve the quality of the business environment to unlock the potential for
private sector growth, employment, and competitiveness. The Board of Investment has been tasked to mobilize relevant
federal and provincial authorities for developing a shared reform action plan and successful implementation. But this
needs to be institutionalized since presently there is no single agency at the national or provincial levels with a mandate
to identify, implement, and enforce investment climate reforms on an on-going basis.
Efforts needed to improve the quality of business environment will have to take into account three critical dimensions for
delivering sustainable improvements in the national and sub-national investment climate including: (i) the respective
roles of federal and provincial authorities, (ii)the extent to which a suitable and structured public-private dialogue for
understanding the significance of reforms exists, and (iii) and the mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of indicator
based targeted reform actions. Ultimately, high quality conditions for doing business depend on the role of government
not just as an effective “regulator” but also as a “facilitator” of the privates sector.
