corridors for shared prosperity
The Inclusive Business Transfer Framework presented in Corridors for Shared Prosperity was designed
to guide small and medium inclusive businesses for systematic transfer to Africa. The framework was built
based on a hypothesis of the drivers of successful transfer, and was then validated, improved and refined
based on experiences of eleven Indian inclusive businesses that have replicated in Africa. The framework
is currently focused on agriculture, healthcare and renewable energy as focus sectors, with country focus
being limited to Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana.

Metrics used in the framework
The Framework is able to provide insights to inclusive businesses as a result of quantitative and
qualitative data fed into it, which are derived from a set of shortlisted metrics. The broad categories of the
metrics are as follows:

         Metrics to understand intent
         Metrics to measure transfer-readiness
         Metrics to compare the relative attractiveness of 5 African countries as transfer destinations

Metrics to understanding intent

 Orientation       Although most commercial enterprises have some form of profit orientation to motivate
                   employees to maximize revenues, the most successful producers also incorporate a customer

                   satisfaction with its products

Metrics to measure internal readiness to transfer

Metrics were identified across 3 areas of management capacity, financial capacity and operational
capacity to measure transfer-readiness (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4). Each metric was awarded a binary
score of 1 or 0 based on an inclusive business’s specific capacity in that area. For instance, while

                                                                                                                           2
measuring management bandwidth, availability of 20 percent or less bandwidth was given a 0 score,
while availability of more than 20 percent bandwidth was given a score of 1. The binary score gates were
adapted to suit the context of small and medium inclusive businesses.

To establish readiness on a specific area (management, financial, operational); binary scores for each
metric were weighted and summed. If the sum is greater than 60 percent of the total score, then an
inclusive business is transfer-ready from that perspective. With the exception of knowledge sharing as a
format, for all other transfer formats an inclusive business must score above 60 percent on management,
financial and operational capacity in order to be deemed transfer-ready. The weightages awarded to
different metrics were arrived at based on the experiences of the sample set and feedback from industry
experts.

Analysis of destination markets

The relative attractiveness of 5 African markets, i.e. Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria and Ghana was
analyzed using quantitative metrics as well as qualitative metrics using the following approach.

Step 1 – Identifying Metrics: Quantitative metrics were considered only for the Sub Saharan African
region, with a focus on 35 frontier markets only. Hence, South Africa was not considered as part of the
data set. Metrics were then converted into standardized z-scores and checked for normal distribution.
Metrics that were not normally distributed was replaced with metrics that were. Finally, the degree
correlation between metrics was analyzed, and in cases where metric pairs showed a correlation of more
than 0.6, only one metric deemed most relevant to the project was considered. As a result of this
exercise, 37 quantitative metrics across 13 categories were identified to compare markets based on the
overall macro-economic environment, ease of doing business, investment climate, and specific
organization-level business dependencies.

Step 2 – Creating a sector-agnostic ranking of countries: In order to consider the impact of all metrics
together on a country’s suitability for transfer; each category was given a composite z-score. All
categories were assigned weightages based on the relative importance that the 20 inclusive businesses
analyzed for this project accorded to each for selecting target countries (Table 5). In cases where the z-
scores were negative, the country was deemed “below the average” of the general Sub Saharan African
trend and awarded a binary score of 0. In cases where the z-scores were positive, the country was
deemed “above the average” of the general Sub Saharan African trend and awarded a binary score of 1.
Binary scores across 13 categories were then summed to arrive at a relative ranking of countries.

Step 3 – Bringing in sector-specific metrics: In the final step, quantitative and qualitative metrics to
measure sector-specific business environments were added to the analysis to create sector-specific
rankings of countries. Quantitative metrics were treated in the same manner as in steps 1 and 2.
Qualitative metrics were identified on the basis of primary research done with inclusive businesses and
industry experts. Each qualitative metric was also given a binary score based on whether the country was
above the Sub Saharan African Average or below. Sector-specific metrics contributed 30 percent of the
weightage for overall country ranking and prioritization.
