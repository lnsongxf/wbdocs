                              The importance of financial inclusion to development is nowadays widely recognized in the
                              international development community and by policy-makers in developed and developing economies.
                              Still, an estimated 2 billion adults globally do not have access to a transaction account that can be
                              used to receive payments and make deposits. Yet, research shows that low-income and financially
                              excluded populations have active financial lives and need a range of financial services to take
                              advantage of economic opportunities and manage and mitigate risks. Similarly, an estimated 200
                              million enterprises in developing economies are still constrained in terms of financing, even though
                              small and medium enterprises generate the greatest number of new jobs, employ the largest number
                              of people in aggregate and, hence, are important for job creation and economic growth. Moreover,

Global Practice               Recognizing the transformational potential of financial inclusion for economic development, the World
World Bank                    Bank Group President, Jim Yong Kim, and partners put forward an ambitious goal of universal financial
Group                         access by 2020. The goal envisions that all working-age adults have access to a transaction account
                              held with banks or other authorized and/or regulated service providers (including non-banks), which
                              can be used to make and receive payments and safely deposit funds.

                              While many foundations and drivers exist for achieving financial access and inclusion, the potential
                              impact of extending digital financial services through a more widespread acceptance of electronic
                              payments among small retailers (merchants) is substantial. Traditional retailers in developing
                              economies, the majority of which are micro, small and medium enterprises, generally do not use
                              electronic payments and are excluded from the regulated financial sector. The regularity and
                              frequency of consumer purchases can help everyday retailers expand consumers’ use of electronic
                              payments. These retailers not only can play an important role in increasing consumer acceptance of

The global market sizing analysis further estimates that besides $7.1 trillion in electronic payments, about $6.3 trillion in
paper transactions are conducted from retailers to suppliers (see Figure 4 for the geographic breakdown). In addition, of the
estimated $2 trillion in salaries paid by MSMRs, $1 trillion is in cash and checks. Hence, a total of over $19 trillion is handled
in cash and checks at the retail point of sale.

 Box 1: Payment behaviour of merchants in India17
 A study was recently commissioned to understand the current behaviours towards and perceptions of digital payments
 among consumers and merchants in low-income communities in India. Key insights indicate that the adoption and use of
 electronic payments has yet to make strides.

 Cash transactions are a matter of habit: 97% of retail transactions in India are conducted in cash or by check
 Few consumers use electronic payments: Only 11% used debit cards for payments in the past 12 months
 Few merchants accept electronic payments: Only 6% of Indian merchants accept electronic payments

 The need to make cash payments to suppliers was the top-ranked reason for merchant disinterest in adopting debit
 cards. Lack of awareness was the second reason, and low consumer demand ranked third.

Box 2: Payment behaviour of Indonesia’s traditional retail market18
The Indonesian market has an estimated 2.5 million retailers, of which the majority is in the traditional and informal space.
Most of these retailers pay their immediate suppliers in cash. Estimates of sales through traditional retail range from about
$46 billion to about $80 billion, depending on the scope of goods covered and the classification of traditional retail versus
modern retail. Selected highlights on profiles of traditional retailers in Indonesia demonstrate the following:

   box at the end of the day, it signals a profit.
–– Most traditional retailers are not registered business entities and do not pay tax. The impetus for a traditional
   retailer to register its business is to receive a loan; this is a prerequisite for a bank.
–– Most traditional retailers do not use a bank account for their business. They mix their personal and business
   finances. Generally, traditional retailers only use a bank account for savings or a bank loan. They often stop using the
   account once the loan has been repaid.

             Payment Process: The owner pays suppliers in cash. After a bad experience using a debit card, she was
             charged twice, and refuses to use or offer electronic payments in her store. The owner does not have a
             bank account, and manages all her business in cash, including her savings. She does not offer credit to
             customers, does not have a bank loan or use supplier credit. While she wants to expand, she does not want
             a loan.

In focus groups with the previously mentioned mobile
operator’s merchants, however, most respondents showed
only partial interest in the merchant payment products.
However, they responded positively to prototypes of
adjacent services that could support their business, such
as financial management tools, inventory control and
unsecured small-business loans. Retailers responded
positively to other ideas, including revenue-generating
activities such as bill payment or mobile top-up reselling
capabilities. The payment itself is only one aspect – and
sometimes not the most important feature – for attracting
merchants, as described in the case boxes of two merchant
payment initiatives in Kenya (Safaricom’s Lipa Na M-PESA
[insight 2], and Kopo Kopo [insight 3]).

Comprehensive and combined business solutions
can be the “hook” for small businesses to accept
electronic payments. In turn, they can lead to access to
other products, as well as to elevated level of “business
savviness” for the merchant. A transaction account, in
addition to being a financial service in itself, can also serve
as a gateway to other financial services.21 It can particularly
facilitate credit underwriting (which is supported by
electronic transaction data and the linkage to settlement
flows for payments22) and non-financial services, such as
supply chain automation, inventory management, customer
loyalty programmes, data analytics and other business
support services.23 But retailers who currently do not accept
electronic payments may not see the benefits of doing so
and/or perceive too many obstacles; thus, offering non-
payment services that respond to their core business needs,
coupled with a payment functionality, can be one strategy
to boost financial inclusion. This would not only increase
adoption and use of transaction accounts, but also enable
access to other financial services.



 Innovations that go beyond facilitating electronic
 payments to provide value-added services for the
 small retailer promise high success, particularly for
 lower-income merchants.

To solve this pain point, Square innovated with a
technological product and business model. For the product,
Square devised a card reader, a small piece of hardware            Case box 1: Square

tablet to transform it into a card-accepting terminal. It later

More flexibility in decreasing price points associated
with acceptance of electronic payments. Retailer margins
are usually thin, compared to other businesses such as
those in the service sector. Thus, traditional card-based
merchant service charges (MSCs) are often prohibitively
high, despite recognition of the value in accepting electronic
payments. In many cases, non-card innovators have greater
flexibility in determining MSCs than traditional acquiring
banks (who often use interchange rates for calculating
the retailers’ MSCs) because they manage their own
“schemes”, and often in a three-party model. This flexibility
allows innovators to set MSCs that are more amenable
to merchants, encouraging the ongoing acceptance of
electronic payments.

 Big, Small and Alternative Data: New Opportunities,
 New Challenges

 Much has been made of “big data”, particularly in fintech
 and with the rise of alternative lending and underwriting.
 While combining multiple, sophisticated data sets can
 yield powerful results, some basic analysis on even a
 handful of variables can improve segmentation, boost
 customer loyalty and reduce loan losses. Harnessing
 digital data for innovations in merchants’ adoption of
 electronic payments has great potential and is taking
 many forms, as well as for other types of financial
 services. This trend also requires special attention
 to assessing and developing adequate practices for
 protecting consumer data, ensuring data security and
 privacy, and, at the same time, providing an enabling
 environment for innovation.

 (2015), CGAP (2015d) and World Bank (2016).

28   Innovation in Electronic Payment Adoption
Consumers rarely pay retailers electronically, and retailers
seldom deposit cash payments from consumers in a bank
account on a frequent basis. Thus, merchants simply
prefer to pay suppliers in cash. Suppliers can help limit the
frequency of making such bank deposits by offering credit in
the form of deferred payments.

Another obstacle is that very few suppliers have enough
leverage to persuade individual retailers to pay electronically.
Even the largest supplier may represent only 30% of the
cost of goods sold by a typical small retailer, and most
suppliers represent a small fraction of that. However, a
stronger case for a business owner to adopt electronic
payments would be if several suppliers both used such a
payment solution and represented the majority of a retailer’s
costs. (Tienda Pago has signed up multiple large suppliers,
as described the subsequent case).

Paying suppliers with money received electronically
from consumers can help build positive network effects.
Retailers prefer to receive payments from customers and
pay suppliers and employees from the same account
because it is convenient. For example, if consumers are
content to pay retailers electronically, but retailers in turn
cannot pay suppliers in a similar way (or if the suppliers
demand cash instead), the retailers are more likely to insist
that consumers pay them in cash. But the opposite is also
true: suppliers who accept electronic payments are more
likely to have retailers who welcome such payments from
consumers, creating a virtuous cycle that increases the
use of payments and the underlying transaction account
(deposit transaction account or e-money).


 Suppliers can take an active role in promoting
 electronic payments for retailers, to the mutual
 benefit of both parties.

number of its weekly visits from three to two; and, thanks
to the credit line provided to the retailer, the supplier’s sales
volume has increased. The retailer benefits as well – from
increased sales to its consumers and a safer, more efficient
mechanism to pay its supplier.

Retailers in rural areas will particularly benefit from
partnership models. Transaction costs for financial
services, including payments, tend to be higher in rural
areas because of poor infrastructure for roads, electricity
and telecommunications connectivity relative to urban areas.
Rural populations also tend to have smaller transaction sizes
(e.g. loans, saving balances and average payments), and are
less literate and financially savvy. As a result, few authorized
financial institutions target rural areas, and many financial
services that do exist for them are informal or semi-formal
(e.g. loans from agricultural suppliers). Partnering with actors
that have an existing, ongoing relationship with rural retailers
can help financial institutions create a viable business model
to offer payment and other financial services. This can assist
non-banks as well, who have begun offering mobile money
accounts to the broader public.

 Because of their existing interactions with small
 retailers, non-traditional payment actors are well
 positioned to help acquire and retain retailers for
 electronic payments in developing countries.

In light of the core insights, the considerations for action centre on reducing or eliminating the six main obstacles to
expanding adoption of electronic payments to retailers, as described in Part 1. Specifically, and as depicted in Figure 10,
the private sector may consider action to address obstacles 1-4 (highlighted in blue), and policy-makers would primarily
target obstacles 5 and 6 (highlighted in green).

 Innovations that promote electronic payments for
 small and medium merchants are still emerging. They
 represent, however, an enormous potential to accelerate
 commerce among underserved populations and deepen
 financial inclusion for merchants and consumers alike.
 While more pilots and implementation are required, and
 more research and data points need to be gathered,
 the five identified insights, featured cases, global sizing
 and related analysis are intended to serve as inspiration
 for exploring and conceiving similar product concepts.
 Moreover, this report reflects the optimism that the
 concrete considerations discussed herein can help
 policy-makers to set an enabling regulatory environment,
 and industry to accelerate the creation of winning
 solutions.

 key terms                    and “small businesses” are often used interchangeably, as well as formal “micro, small and medium

                              Electronic payments: The term “electronic payments” denotes all payment transactions comprising
                              direct debit (direct debit and wire transfer), card (debit, credit, prepaid, gift) and mobile (conducted by
                              a mobile device, such as a phone or tablet). For the purposes of this report, “electronic payments”
                              is the most frequently used term. If the term “digital payments” is referenced, it denotes electronic

Annex 2: Guiding principles of payment aspects of financial
inclusion57

 Guiding Principle                               Description
 1. Commitment                                   Commitment from public- and private-sector organizations to broaden financial
                                                 inclusion is explicit, strong and sustained over time.

 2. Legal and regulatory framework               The legal and regulatory framework underpins financial inclusion by effectively
                                                 addressing all relevant risks and by protecting consumers, while at the same
                                                 time fostering innovation and competition.

 3. Financial and ICT infrastructures            Robust, safe, efficient and widely reachable financial and ICT infrastructures are
                                                 effective for the provision of transaction accounts services, and also support for
                                                 the provision of broader financial services.

 4. Transaction account and payment              The transaction account and payment product offerings effectively meet a
 product design                                  broad range of transaction needs of the target population, at little or no cost.

 5. Readily available access points              The usefulness of transaction accounts is augmented with a broad network of
                                                 access points that also achieves wide geographical coverage, and by offering a
                                                 variety of interoperable access channels.

 6. Financial literacy                           Individuals gain knowledge, through awareness and financial literacy efforts,
                                                 of the benefits of adopting transaction accounts, how to use those accounts
                                                 effectively for payment and store-of-value purposes, and how to access other
                                                 financial services.

 7. Large-volume, recurrent payment              Large-volume and recurrent payment streams, including remittances, are
 streams                                         leveraged to advance financial inclusion objectives, namely by increasing the
                                                 number of transaction accounts and stimulating the frequent usage of these
                                                 accounts.

        suppliers, and other supplier payments along the supply chain were excluded. A reliable estimate of all B2B payments
        along the supply chain was not feasible on a global scale.

13.	    Costs incurred by the user include “resource costs”, such as those due to time, logistics, infrastructure and
        production, and “transfer costs”, which are fees paid to the service provider, such as transaction fees. Users bear
        higher transfer costs for electronic payments compared to cash, but significantly lower resource costs. Other costs
        are borne by the service provider. For a full methodology, see World Bank (2015a).

42.	   Some companies previously considered as “challengers”, particularly mobile network operators, could arguably have
       been seen as more established PSPs in some markets (e.g. Safaricom in Kenya). The considerations herein are
       oriented towards incumbents and challengers versus associating them to any particular sector.

45.	   The considerations that follow are specifically oriented to policy-makers, although the broader government does
       have a role to play. Most significantly, recurring, often small-value G2P payments, such as pension or unemployment
       benefits, child care support and government employee salaries, can and should be provided electronically rather than
       through checks or cash. Stipulating that G2P payments should be disbursed electronically may not necessarily be an
       explicit policy per se (and, thus, fall outside policy-makers’ remit); it is, nonetheless, an action that their counterparts
       in government agencies can take.

47.	   In parallel, governments can design national identification schemes for identifying all individuals. While not exclusively
       for facilitating payments, the two purposes have substantial benefits between them. In India, for example, the
       government has registered nearly 900 million individuals through Aadhaar, a 12-digit unique identification number, and
       has recently rolled out a product for making welfare payments to a corresponding bank account enabled by Aadhaar.

48.	   CPMI and World Bank Group (2016). The report particularly urges PSPs to “provide a basic transaction account at
       little or no cost to all individuals and businesses that do not hold such an account and that wish to open such an
       account”.
