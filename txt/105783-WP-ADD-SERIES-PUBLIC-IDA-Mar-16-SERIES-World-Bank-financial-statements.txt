       2       IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
Introduction
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Association’s (IDA) financial
statements and management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015
(FY15). IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IDA’s selected
financial data as of and for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 (FY16 YTD) and March 31, 2015 (FY15 YTD)
as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

I.     Organizational Overview and Business Model
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its 173 member countries. It is the largest
multilateral channel for providing concessional financing and knowledge services to the world’s poorest countries,
and is one of the five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG); the others are the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Each of
these organizations is legally and financially independent, with separate assets and liabilities. IDA is not liable for
their respective obligations. The WBG’s two goals, to be achieved by 2030, are to end extreme poverty by reducing
the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3% globally, and to promote shared
prosperity in a sustainable manner by fostering income growth for the bottom 40% of the population in every
developing country. In October 2015, the WBG raised its extreme poverty line figure from $1.25 to $1.90 a day, to
reflect the increase in prices worldwide based on updated purchasing-power-parity data.
IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid architecture and pursues the WBG goals by providing concessional
development credits, grants and guarantees to the world’s poorest countries for programs and operations that help
meet their development needs. IDA provides technical assistance by providing reimbursable advisory services,
policy advice and global knowledge services through economic sector work and country studies. It also supports
member countries with disaster risk financing and insurance to help increase their financial resilience against natural
disasters, as part of their broader disaster risk management agenda. In addition, IDA provides or facilitates financing
through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors.
The resources available to IDA for funding its activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA finances its
development credit, grant and guarantee commitments primarily from partner contributions and loans, funds from its
internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRD’s net income, and grants designated out of IFC’s retained
earnings. The three-year replenishment process allows IDA to be responsive to changes in the needs of its borrowers
and the development environment. Given that the disbursements of IDA’s credits and grants take place over several
years, commitments do not have to be fully funded at the time of approval and this allows partner contributions to be
encashed over several years, and internal resources to be committed in advance of their expected receipt.
Since its inception, IDA’s resources have been replenished seventeen times, complemented by an additional
replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Details of the
Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA17), which is effective from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017, are
provided in Chart 1.

II.    Funding and Resource Allocation
The funding of IDA’s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities is presented and discussed below.
Sources of Funds
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions and Borrowings from Partners): IDA finances its
commitments for development credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner
resources that are in the form of subscriptions and contributions are assigned voting rights. Prior to IDA17, IDA had
not entered into long-term borrowings, even though it was allowed to do so under its Articles. Whilst grant
contributions from members remain at the core of IDA’s financing framework, borrowings from partners were
introduced in IDA17 to increase the lending envelope available by incorporating a limited amount of debt funding
into the financing framework in a sustainable manner.
Internal Resources: These primarily comprise contractual principal repayments (including any contractually
accelerated repayments and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend term credits, income from the
investment portfolio and any carryover of residual resources from previous replenishments.


                                            IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016                  3
Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations: These are transfers from IBRD’s net income and grants from
IFC’s retained earnings.
Applications of Funds
Disbursement of development credits and grants: Through its development operations IDA’s development
credits, grants and guarantees benefit the poorest and least creditworthy countries, which are eligible to borrow from
IDA.
Administrative Expenses: IDA’s administrative expenses represent its share of administrative expenses, net of
other revenue, jointly incurred with IBRD. IDA’s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a
level that will cover its administrative expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the
extent to which service and certain interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and
forgone charges on development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) and the
MDRI, cover administrative expenses. FY16 commitment charges are set at nil.
Commitment Authority
The IDA17 Commitment Authority Framework amounts to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 37.7 billion
(approximately U.S. dollar equivalent $57 billion using the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate). This amount
includes a $5 billion increase that was approved by the Board on March 8, 2016, and a $1 billion increase due to two
partner countries submitting their IOCs under IDA16 contributions.
The $5 billion will be allocated as follows:

         $3.9 billion will be used to fund the IDA17 Scale-Up Facility, (SUF), for lending to IDA countries on terms
          similar to those of IBRD. The SUF will finance IDA operations to be approved between now and the end of
          FY17.

         $900 million to replenish the Crisis Response Window (CRW) , which will help IDA provide rapid
          financing to help countries deal with severe natural disasters, economic shocks or health emergencies and
          pandemics over the remainder of the IDA17 period.

         $200 million will be allocated, on an exceptional one-off basis to Jordan and Lebanon, as part of the World
          Bank Group's crisis response initiative in the Middle East and North Africa region to assist with the Syrian
          refugee crisis.

Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under IDA17 and the
extent to which these sources have been used for commitments of development credits, grants and guarantees
through March 31, 2016.

 a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for
    presentational purposes only, based on the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate of U.S. dollar/SDR 1.50718. Actual
    commitments are recorded based on historical U.S. dollar rates.
 b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.
 c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 4.5 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.
 d. Includes U.S.$ 5 billion of incremental commitment authority resulting from a change in the liquidity management framework
    and U.S. dollar equivalent 1 billion of incremental commitment authority due to two partner countries submitting their IOCs
    under IDA16.


4   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
III. Basis of Reporting
IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. The financial statements
provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDA’s sources and uses of resources. Under the reported basis,
IDA’s Statement of Income alone does not fully reflect the economic results of IDA due to a number of
asymmetries, which are explained in the MD&A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

IV. Statement of Activities Analysis
The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of funds
in executing its operating activities. Specifically, it presents the flows associated with IDA’s operating activities and
the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDA’s investment portfolio.

Results from Operating Activities
IDA’s operating activities resulted in a net inflow of $2,181 million for FY16 YTD. This primarily reflects the
$5,894 million of cash receipts relating to members’ subscriptions and contributions and $3,139 million of cash
receipts relating to principal repayments and prepayments, partially offset by $8,941 million of outflows for
disbursements of development credits and grants.


The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDA’s results from operating activities:

Members’ Subscriptions and Contributions
The subscriptions and contributions of $5,894 million represent the cash contributions received from members and
the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $180 million of member contributions received to finance foregone
charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is reflected under administrative activities as partner
contributions for forgone charges. The decrease of $754 million primarily reflects the timing of members’ cash
payment schedules as compared to the previous year ($2,585 million in FY16 YTD as against $3,384 million in
FY15 YTD).
Borrowings from Partners
As part of IDA17, IDA has signed loan agreements with partners for $4.4 billion. The $1,183 million decrease in
YTD receipts from borrowings from partners reflects the timing of the loan schedules. The $24 million increase in
FY16 YTD borrowing expenses as compared to FY15 YTD, is consistent with the increase in borrowings balances
over the period – see Note D in the Financial Statements for more details.
Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations
On October 9, 2015, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer of $650 million, for a total of $1,285 million
in transfers under IDA17. The transfer was received on October 15, 2015.
On January 15, 2016, IDA signed a $330 million grant agreement with IFC, for a total of $670 million in grants
under IDA17. The grant was received on January 22, 2016.
Development Operations
Gross disbursements of development credits and grants in FY16 YTD were $8,941 million, an increase of $494
million as compared to the $8,447 million in FY15 YTD. Africa and South Asia regions together accounted for 84%
of the total FY16 YTD gross disbursements (78% in FY15 YTD).




(a.Includes adjustments for certain PPA Amounts )

Given the lengthy disbursement period for IDA credits, five to ten years for investment project financing and one to
three years for development policy financing, FY16 YTD and FY15 YTD disbursements also include amounts
relating to commitments made under earlier replenishments. The following charts display the composition of the
FY16 YTD and FY15 YTD development credit and grant disbursements by replenishments.




As part of the package to increase Commitment Authority by $5 billion, the Board also approved an increase in the
Single-Currency Lending program from $4.5 billion to $10 billion in order to accommodate potential demand for
single currency financing under the SUF. This program allows IDA recipients to denominate new IDA credits in one
of the four constituent currencies of the SDR basket: USD, Euro, JPY and GBP.


6   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
Net Admininstrative Expenses
Table 2 represents IDA’s share of administrative expenses, net of other revenue, jointly incurred by IBRD and IDA.
The allocation of expenses between IBRD and IDA is based upon an agreed cost sharing methodology which is
driven by the relative level of lending activity between these two institutions. The decline in FY16 YTD net
administrative expenses as compared to FY15 YTD, is in line with changes in the lending activity of IDA relative to
IBRD over the same period.

Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief and
for Losses on Development Credits
Development credits outstanding increased by $4,122 million, primarily due to positive net disbursements of $4,401
million and translation adjustment of $283 million resulting from the appreciation of the SDR against the U.S.
dollar, offset by the $524 million MDRI write-off of credits pertaining to Chad reaching its completion point under
the HIPC Debt Initiative. Additionally, a buy down was effected for one development credit with an outstanding
carrying value of $85 million under the polio eradication buy-down mechanism and one IDA graduate country
prepaid development credits with an outstanding carrying value of $54 million.
The decrease of $363 million in the accumulated provision for debt relief and for losses on development credits
primarily reflects the Chad MDRI write-off.
Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities
The net investment portfolio increased from $28,418 million in June 30, 2015 to $31,358 million in March 31,
2016. The key drivers for this increase of $2,940 million were (i) net inflow from IDA’s operating activities as
reflected in the Statement of Activities (Table 1), see Section IV for variance analysis of operating activities, and
(ii) the $152 million positive impact of exchange rate movements, reflecting the appreciation of two of the non U.S
dollar component currencies of the SDR, the Euro and JPY, against the U.S dollar.
Subscriptions and Contributions
The $6,790 million increase in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the receipt from
members of $4,404 million of demand notes and $2,585 million of cash contributions which was partially offset by
negative translation adjustments of $199 million.




8    IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
VI. Financial Risk
IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk.
Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding
position ratio, see Section II, Funding And Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
Positions.
Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of IDA’s daily cash flow monitoring and management, timing of
partner contributions, and prudent investment policies under an established financial framework.
A key indicator of liquidity management is the core liquidity position which reflects the number of months of gross
disbursements (based on the average for a particular year) that can be met out of the core liquidity (comprised of
investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3) available at any point in time, see Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
Positions.
Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.
Country credit risk is managed through regular country debt sustainability assessments. These reviews provide an
input into the composition of development credits versus grants for new operations. Reviews are also performed to
determine the adequacy of provisions for losses on credits and other exposures.
Table 5 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as of March 31,
2016. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.

Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to the
changing market enviroment. IDA's commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in debt
instruments issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table 6. The
credit quality of IDA’s investment portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 78%
of the portfolio rated AA or above as of March 31, 2016 (81% - June 30, 2015), reflecting IDA’s continued
preference for highly rated securities and counterparties across all categories of financial instruments. Total
commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral held, was $32,917 million as of March 31, 2016.

Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk with respect to its future partner contributions, which it manages
using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its investment portfolio, and interest rate
risk on its investment portfolio, which it manages by aligning the duration of the investment portfolio with that of
the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is reflected on IDA’s Statement of Income,
however, the economic offset is not reported as it relates to future net cash outflows. Further details can be seen in
IDA’s June 30, 2015 MD&A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these activities on IDA’s Statement of
Income and the corresponding economic offset.
Foreign Exchange Risk
IDA conducts its operations in SDR and its component currencies of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound
sterling. These constitute the functional currencies of IDA, and all other currencies are considered non-functional
currencies.
Any translation adjustments due to exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar for non-functional currencies
and functional currencies, are reflected in the Statement of Income, and in Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet, respectively.
IDA faces foreign exchange rate risk exposure as a result of the currency mismatch between its commitments for
development credits and grants, which are denominated in SDRs; partner contributions, which are typically
denominated in national currencies; and the portion of IDA’s internal resources and expenditures that is
denominated in U.S. dollars and euro.
IDA uses currency forward contracts to convert the majority of partners’ encashments provided in national
currencies into the four currencies of the SDR basket, thereby aligning the currency composition of partner
contributions with the net cash outflows relating to development credits and grants. These transactions are
intermediated by IBRD for efficiency purposes. The payable leg of the currency forward contracts economically
hedging partner pledges are denominated in non-functional currencies. Accordingly, appreciation (depreciation) of
these currencies against the U.S. dollar results in exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of
Income.
The translation adjustment on future inflows from partners is the economic offset to the translation adjustment on
non-functional currencies of currency forward contracts. The translation adjustment gain on non-functional
currencies of $123 million in FY16 YTD was due to the depreciation of the non-functional currencies against the
U.S. dollar. This provides an economic offset to the effect of foreign exchange movements on the future inflows
from partners, which was a loss of $87 million in FY16 YTD.


10    IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: MARCH 31, 2016
In FY15 YTD, the translation adjustment gain on non-functional currencies of the forward contracts of $1,055
million was due to the more pronounced depreciation of the majority of the non-functional currencies against the
U.S. dollar. This provides an economic offset to the effect of foreign exchange movements on the the future inflows
from partners, which was a loss of $1,350 million in FY15 YTD.
The difference between the reported translation adjustments and the effect of foreign exchange movements on the
partner contributions primarily represent certain non-functional currencies that are not economically hedged through
forward contracts due to their relatively small contribution amount or the unpredictability of the expected payment
date. These residual partner contributions are hedged using a currency correlation methodology under the overall
currency management framework.
In addition, IDA also mitigates the currency exchange rate risk by aligning the currency composition of its liquid
asset portfolio and the hedges of its non-SDR cash flows with the SDR composition.
On November 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed its latest review
of the SDR basket of currencies and decided to include the Chinese renminbi (RMB) as the fifth currency of the
SDR basket effective October 1, 2016, with a weighting of 10.92%. IDA is currently undertaking all the necessary
preparations to ensure the effective implementation of this decision.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective in the management of IDA’s investment portfolio is to provide a ready source of liquidity
when needed by IDA to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDA’s assets are invested so that their
duration closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDA’s lengthy disbursement
profile, the duration of IDA’s investment portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long duration, combined with
volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in unrealized mark-to-market
gains/losses on the portfolio
IDA’s investment portfolio had a duration of approximately three years as of March 31, 2016, and has two
components: core liquidity and partner asset and liability management. During FY16 YTD, the core liquidity -
investment portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market gains of $321 million due to the decline in the yield
curves of the major currencies, as compared to unrealized mark-to-market gains of $378 million in FY15 YTD when
the decline in yield curves was more pronounced. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses
on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash outflows.
The partner asset and liability - non-trading portfolio, incurred unrealized mark-to-market gains of $18 million
during FY16 YTD, comprising of unrealized mark-to-market gains of $21 million on investments with IFC and
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $3 million on the currency forward contracts. This is compared to unrealized
mark-to-market losses of $162 million in FY15 YTD, comprising of unrealized mark-to-market losses of $164
million on the currency forward contracts, resulting from the downward movement of yield curves of the majority of
the payable currencies during FY15 YTD, and unrealized mark-to-market gains of $2 million on investments with
IFC.

VII. Funding and Liquidity Positions
Management monitors IDA’s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDA’s ability to conduct its operations. Since
IDA has not borrowed from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of Agreement,
it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual obligations to disburse
approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.
On March 8, 2016, the Board approved an adjustment to IDA’s liquidity management framework. Specifically,
Tranche 1 assets may now serve as additional temporary, emergency liquidity. As a result of this change, $5 billion
of assets which were previously set aside and uncommitted in Tranches 2 and 3 for minimum liquidity requirements
will now be used to fund an increase in the IDA17 commitment authority, see Section II.
IDA’s funding position is determined as the total of its investment portfolio and unrestricted demand notes as a
percentage of undisbursed commitments of development credits and development grants payable. Any remaining
funding gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners, and
repayments on outstanding credits by recipient countries. At all times, IDA enters into new commitments based on
the commitment authority available. See Section II for further details on IDA’s Commitment Authority.
IDA’s liquidity position is determined as the number of months of average gross disbursements covered by IDA’s
core liquidity, comprised of investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3.

Funding Position                                            Liquidity Position




As of March 31, 2016, the investment portfolio and          As of March 31, 2016, IDA’s liquidity position was
unrestricted demand notes covered 80% of all                sufficient to cover approximately 11 months of average
undisbursed commitments of development credits and          monthly gross disbursements, within the 5 year
grants as compared to 70% at June 30, 2015. The 80%         historical range of 9 to 14 months of average monthly
funding position is within the 5 year historical range of   gross disbursements and above the minimum
70% to 81%.                                                 requirement of 4 months.

NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2015
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2015 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDA’s financial
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first
nine months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
These financial statements were approved for issuance on May [10], 2016 which was also the date through which
IDA’s management evaluated subsequent events.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of March 31, 2016, IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its business.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of
the Effective Date. The ASU defers for one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). While, this ASU clarifies the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, it does not change the core principle of the
guidance in Topic 606. For IDA, this ASU and ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning from the year ending June
30, 2020, with earlier application permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the impact of these ASUs on its financial
statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The ASU makes targeted amendments to existing
guidance on recognition and measurement of financial instruments that primarily affect the accounting for equity
investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. For IDA, the ASU will be effective from the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, with early
adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on its financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires that a lessee recognizes on
the balance sheet the assets and liabilities that arise from all leases with a lease term of more than twelve
months. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows by the lessee will primarily
depend on the classification of the lease as finance or operating. The accounting applied by a lessor remains largely
unchanged from the current guidance, with some targeted improvements. For IDA, the ASU will be effective from
the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with early adoption permitted. IDA is currently evaluating the impact of this
ASU on its financial statements.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS
The investment securities held by IDA are designated as either trading or non-trading. These securities are carried
and reported at fair value, or at face value which approximates fair value.
During the year ended June 30, 2015, IDA purchased a security which is held in a non-trading portfolio. While IDA
does not plan to sell the security, IDA elected to measure it at fair value, so that all its investment securities would
be measured on the same basis. The changes in fair value for this security are reflected in the Condensed Statement
of Income. For details regarding this transaction, see Note G – Affiliated Organizations.
As of March 31, 2016, IDA’s investments primarily comprised government and agency obligations (84%), with all
the instruments being classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
A summary of IDA’s Investments at March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2015 is as follows:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
most government and agency securities and futures contracts.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment spreads.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity
are used.
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value, which approximates fair value, as they
are short term in nature.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for counterparties by type of
instrument and maturity category.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring procedures
and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash or other
approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.
IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note E-Derivative Instruments.

Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations and ABS.
These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA to
reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. As of March 31, 2016, amounts which could
potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $127 million ($457 million -
June 30, 2015).
Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as IDA still retains control over these
securities and therefore the accounting criteria for the treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are
permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase date.
Securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements expose IDA to several risks, including counterparty risk,
reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged). IDA has
procedures in place to ensure that trading activity and balances under these agreements are below predefined
counterparty and maturity limits, and to actively monitor net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily
mark-to-market. Whenever the collateral pledged by IDA related to its borrowings under securities lending
agreements and repurchase agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by returning
cash or pledging additional collateral.
The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements, and the related liabilities, as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015:

In the case of resale agreements, IDA receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to repledge
these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the securities
received are not recorded on IDA’s balance sheet as IDA has not obtained control over these securities and therefore
the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of March 31, 2016, securities purchased under
resale agreements included no securities which had not settled on that date ($181 million—June 30, 2015). For the
remaining purchases, IDA received securities with a fair value of $131 million ($418 million —June 30, 2015).
None of these securities had been transferred under repurchase or securities lending agreements as of that date ($81
million—June 30, 2015).

NOTE D—BORROWINGS
IDA’s borrowings comprise concessional partner loans. These borrowings are unsecured and unsubordinated fixed
rate debt in SDR component currencies. IDA may prepay some or the entire outstanding amounts without penalty.
These borrowings are carried and reported at amortized cost.
As of March 31, 2016, IDA’s borrowings outstanding were $2,848 million. These borrowings have original
maturities of 25 and 40 years, with the final maturity being 2054. This does not include the effect of the amounts
relating to proceeds received under the grant component of the concessional partner loan agreements, for which
voting rights have been provided and are reflected in equity.

observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and proxy funding spreads.


NOTE E—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
IDA uses derivative instruments in its investment portfolio to manage currency and interest rate risks, for asset-
liability management purposes, and to assist clients in managing risks.

Under its derivative agreement with International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), IDA is not
required to post collateral as long as it maintains liquidity holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for a
AAA credit rating. As of March 31, 2016, IDA had not posted any collateral with IBRD in accordance with the
agreement.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.

The following table summarizes information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IDA’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015. Total
derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the cash and
securities collateral received.

the derivatives portfolio.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBA securities, swaptions, exchange traded options and
future contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow
methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding
spreads.
NOTE F—DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other exposures
include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of
March 31, 2016, 90% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.
Based on IDA’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the
Medium and High risk classes.
As of March 31, 2016, development credits outstanding totaling $2,555 million (representing about 2% of the
portfolio) from five borrowers, were in nonaccrual status. 




34 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits
Based on an evaluation of IDA’s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio
segment — Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.
IDA’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDA’s exposures,
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status.
IDA’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, service,
interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit agreements.
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of March 31, 2016, and June
30, 2015:

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)
and Other Exposures
Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable losses
inherent in IDA’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and nonpayment of
principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the accumulated
provision and the reasonableness of the inputs used, on a periodic basis, at least annually, and adjustments are
recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.

Provision for Debt Relief
HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,
including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part of
the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as qualifying
debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the amount of the
eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes eligible for
MDRI debt relief.
Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt
relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, and the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2015 are summarized below:

40 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: MARCH 31, 2016 (UNAUDITED)
NOTE I—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

IBRD, along with IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, sponsor a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan and Trust, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and Trust and a PEBP that cover substantially all of their
staff members.
While IDA is not a participating entity to these benefit plans, IDA shares in the costs and reimburses IBRD for its
proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD, as part of IBRD’s allocation of staff and
associated administrative expenses to IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.
During the three and nine months ended March 31, 2016, IDA’s share of IBRD’s benefit costs relating to all the
three plans totaled $54 million and $164 million, respectively (three and nine months ended March 31, 2015—$69
million and $205 million, respectively).
The cost of any potential future liability arising from these plans would be shared by IBRD and IDA using the
applicable share ratio. 

NOTE J—ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income consists of net income (loss) and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S.
GAAP, are excluded from net income (loss). For IDA, comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income
(loss) and currency translation adjustments on functional currencies. These items are presented in the Condensed
Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The following table presents the changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income balances for the nine
months ended March 31, 2016, and March 31, 2015.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
As of March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2015, IDA had no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis.
For valuation methods and assumptions as well as additional fair value disclosures regarding Investments, Loans,
Borrowings and Derivative assets and liabilities, refer to Note C—Investments, Note D— Borrowings, Note E—
Derivative Instruments and Note F— Development credits and other exposures, respectively.
Due from Banks: The carrying amount of unrestricted and restricted cash is considered a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of these positions.
