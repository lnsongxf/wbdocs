In 2011, Japan celebrated the 50th anniversary of achieving universal health coverage (UHC). To
mark the occasion, the government of Japan and the World Bank conceived the idea of
undertaking a multicountry study to respond to this growing demand by sharing rich and varied
country experiences from countries at different stages of adopting and implementing strategies
for UHC, including Japan itself. This led to the formation of a joint Japan–World Bank research
team under The Japan–World Bank Partnership Program for Universal Health Coverage. The
Program was set up as a two-year multicountry study to help fill the gap in knowledge about the
policy decisions and implementation processes that countries undertake when they adopt the
UHC goals. The Program was funded through the generous support of the government of Japan.
This Country Summary Report on Peru is one of the 11 country studies on UHC that was
commissioned under the Japan–World Bank Partnership Program. The other participating
countries are Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Ghana, Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Turkey, and
Vietnam. A synthesis of these country reports is in the publication “Universal Health Coverage
for Inclusive and Sustainable Development: A Synthesis of 11 Country Case Studies,” available at:
http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/brief/uhc-japan.
These reports are intended to provide an overview of the country experiences and some key
lessons that may be shared with other countries aspiring to adopt, achieve, and sustain UHC.
The goals of UHC are to ensure that all people can access quality health services, to safeguard all
people from public health risks, and to protect all people from impoverishment due to illness,
whether from out-of-pocket payments or loss of income when a household member falls sick.
Although the path to UHC is specific to each country, it is hoped that countries can benefit from
the experiences of others in learning about different approaches and avoiding potential risks.

                                          Overview
Peru is an upper middle-income country that has experienced fast economic growth (average of
6.9% per year from 2004 to 2013, according World Developing Indicators, WDI) combined with a
reduction in poverty and inequality over the past decade. Economic growth was led by exports
and domestic demand, generating an increase in private investment, attracting foreign capital,
and strengthening public finances. The population living in poverty and extreme poverty fell from
58.7 percent and 16.4 percent in 2004 to 25.8 percent and 6 percent in 2012, respectively (INEI
2014a). Inequality has also decreased, with the Gini index declining from 0.503 in 2004 to 0.48.1
in 2010 (WDI).

In the past two decades, Peru has made excellent progress on its health indicators. For example,
with chronic malnutrition, the proportion of stunted children under five fell from 36.5 percent
in 1992 to 13.1 percent in 2013. The achievements in the reduction of this indicator at national,
urban, and rural levels have already surpassed the Millennium Development Goal set for 2015.
Peru has also achieved the 2015 goal to reduce the infant mortality rate by two-thirds between


                                                1
1990 and 2015: in 2013, the national rate was 17 deaths per 1,000 live births, down from 55 in
1992. Finally, Peru has made important progress in reducing the maternal mortality ratio in the
last 20 years, cutting it from 265 per 100,000 live births in 1990–96 to 93 in 2004–10. But
there is still a gap of 27 to reach the 66 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births committed to
by 2015 (INEI 2014a; INEI 2014b).
At the same time, Peru is also experiencing a substantial shift in the burden of disease: between
1990 and 2010, the share communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders in the
burden of disease (DALYs) dropped from 54 percent to 28 percent, while the weight of
noncommunicable diseases increased from 37 percent to 62 percent. (IHME 2014)
Yet Peru has one of the lowest total health expenditure (THE) as a share of GDP in Latin America:
in 2012, it was 5.1 percent, versus the regional average of 7.7 percent. (WHI 2014) (Figure 1)
Increases in health spending are barely keeping up with economic growth rates, widening the
gaps in supply dimensions such as infrastructure, equipment, and human resources—Peru is one
of the few countries in Latin America with a critical health workforce shortage.

Despite some efforts to integrate the health sector supply side in Peru, it continues to be
fragmented and segmented between various subsectors of the public sector and the private
sector. On the supply side, the public health sector includes the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de
Salud—MINSA) and its three health directorates in Metropolitan Lima (Direcciones de Salud—
DISAs) and specialized institutes; the regional governments and their regional health
directorates (Direcciones Regionales de Salud—DIRESAs); EsSalud, the social security health
insurance institution under the Ministry of Labor (Ministerio de Trabajo—MINTRA); and the
police, army, air force, and navy health funds (Fuerzas Armadas—FFAA and Fuerzas Policiales—
FFPP). The private health sector includes private providers and insurance companies, nonprofit

as suppliers of traditional or indigenous medicine. On the demand side, the public health sector
includes the Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (Seguro Integral de Salud—SIS), EsSalud,
the FFAA and FFPP coverage programs, and various private insurance programs. Figure 2

                     Part I. Universal coverage—status and sequencing

A. Oerview of current status

1. Legal and Statutory Basis of Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
Since the late 1990s, five important milestones have defined the expansion of health coverage in
Peru: the creation of EsSalud in 1999; the creation of SIS in 2002; the regionalization of public
health services provision, initiated in 2003; the introduction of the semi-contributory regime in
2007; and the legislation instituting universal health insurance in 2009 (Figure 3).
In 1999, EsSalud, the social security health insurance institution, was created in an effort to
consolidate and expand contributory health insurance. In practice, it provides health insurance
for formal employees and their families and is financed by payroll contributions. EsSalud
provides most of its health services through its own network of facilities, including primary,

  Estimates using administrative records from MINSA and EsSalud show higher levels of coverage than the ENAHO
(see, for example, CNS 2013).


                                                      3
secondary, and tertiary care. Formal employees have the right to complement EsSalud services,
by channeling a fraction of their contributions to accredited private health service providers
(empresas proveedores de servicios—EPS). In practice, EPS facilities focus on primary care while
EsSalud facilities provide mainly secondary and tertiary level care. EsSalud also covers specific
categories of workers such as rural workers, domestic employees, fishermen, etc.), most of them
related with small business, on a semi-contributory basis: while formal sector workers
contribute 9% of payroll to EsSalud, workers in the semi-contributory category only contribute
3% of payroll.
In 2002, SIS was created to ensure access to health services for workers in the informal sector
and the poor. It was initially created by merging the Mother and Child Insurance program and the
Free School Insurance program (Law 27675). As the public health insurance institution, SIS is
indirectly subordinated to MINSA, but it is self-managed and financed by public treasury funds.
Health services to SIS affiliates are provided by public health service providers. Also in 2002,
Peru embarked upon a process of decentralization that included administrative, economic,
productive, financial, tax-related, and fiscal functions.3
In 2003, the Regional Government Law4 defined a wide range of health-related functions to be
transferred to the regional governments, including the organization of the levels of care, the
management of public health centers, and the supervision and control of production,
commercialization, and distribution of pharmaceuticals. The actual transfer of functions was
completed in 2009.5
In 2007, SIS introduced a semi-contributory program to incentivize the affiliation of informal
workers. Despite the limited results of previous efforts, MINSA believed the enhanced benefit
package would attract this segment of the population. The Universal Health Insurance Law of
20096 created a regulatory framework to achieve UHC under coordinated institutional efforts
between EsSalud, SIS, MINSA, and the regional governments. It grants to the entire population
UHC through three basic mechanisms: contributory insurance (via payroll-based contributions
and/or private payments); subsidized insurance for the poor (paid with public fiscal funds); and
semi-contributory7 insurance for informal and small-business workers (paid with a combination
of private payments and public subsidies). The latter two programs are managed by SIS.

2. Current Status of UHC
UHC involves progress along and trade-offs between three dimensions of coverage: the
proportion of the population to be covered; the range of services to be made available; and the
proportion of the total costs to be met (WHO 2010). Figure 4 depicts a hypothetical situation
where about half the population is covered for half the possible services, but where less than half
of the cost of these services is met from pooled funds. In this section of the report, we examine
the current situation of health coverage along the three dimensions of UHC.

       a. Who is covered?
Affiliation to health insurance programs has increased sharply in the last decade. According to
the ENAHO surveys, 65 percent of the population was affiliated to some health insurance
program in 2013, up from 53 percent in 2008. Health insurance affiliation is higher among the
extremely poor and poor than among the nonpoor. A drop in 2012 in insurance appears to be
because SIS started requiring identification documents to formally affiliate people. In addition, a
number of changes in the targeting information of the Household Targeting System (Sistema de
Focalización de Hogares—SISFOH) led to exclusion of previously eligible populations from SIS,
though this was subsequently reversed (SIS 2013b).
In 2013, 25.3 percent of population was affiliated to EsSalud, and 35.3 percent to SIS; the
private sector programs cover a small share of the population (less than 4 percent) (Figure 2).
Affiliation rates to EsSalud increased gradually as the economy grew and more population was
incorporated into the formal sector; however, it is the introduction of SIS that accounts for the
largest share in the increase in coverage in the last decade. The International Labour
Organization (ILO) estimates that if economic growth continues steadily, EsSalud coverage will
naturally increase to 40 percent of the population (ILO 2012).
Given the past SIS emphasis on covering maternal and child health needs, health insurance
enrollment rates vary by age. The population age 18–49 has a lower coverage rate (about
59 percent) than children and teenagers (about 72 percent) (Figure 5). With the epidemiological
and demographic transition, this poses a risk to future adult and elderly coverage, given that
their proportions will increase, creating pressures to cover risks associated with
noncommunicable diseases, which demands more investment and financing for early health
promotion, disease prevention, and treatment.

Peru also has significant regional disparities among the insured and noninsured population, in
that poorer regions tend to have a higher share of the population enrolled in health insurance


                                                  6
(Figure 6). This reflects the success of SIS in increasing the share of poor who have health
insurance, since the five poorest regions also have the highest share of population enrolled.8

After a very large increase in population coverage between 2004 and 2010, coverage has
progressed more slowly. This can be partly explained by the difficulty in extending coverage to
workers in the informal sector who are ineligible for coverage by EsSalud or the subsidized SIS

  Recently, the targeting approach has shifted somewhat toward being insurance for the vulnerable populations rather
than insurance for the poor. However, this concept needs to be further clarified.

program, and in theory should affiliate to the semi-contributory program offered by SIS. In
addition, younger, lower risk population in the Lima metropolitan area seem to be reluctant at
affiliating to a health insurance program. In practice, the semi-contributory program has
attracted very few people since its creation in 2007—in December 2011 only 0.025 percent of
SIS beneficiaries belonged to the semi-contributory program (MINSA 2013).



        b. Which services are covered?
Health services are delivered according to benefit packages that varies by health insurance
agency. The packages differ on health conditions covered, financial protection, and delivery
mechanisms. EsSalud’s benefits package is comprehensive, with few exclusions. It includes
preventive and promotional services, and wide-scope acute care and rehabilitative services, and
a package of social and economic benefits including maternal and breastfeeding subsidies, and
compensation for temporary disabilities.
The SIS benefits package has evolved a lot since 2002. Initially, it focused on health prevention,
treatment, and rehabilitation for children under 18 years and maternity (including prenatal care,
delivery, and postnatal care). Since then, coverage of services has increased substantially and is
defined in the Essential Plan of Health Insurance (PEAS). This public basic package is based on
1,100 diagnoses coded in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), whose health
benefits of care and rehabilitation meet 140 health insurable conditions. It also includes 44
explicit guarantees of timeliness and quality. The PEAS was designed to meet 65 percent of the
causes of morbidity, as opposed to the 20 percent that covered the initial package of benefits
(List of Prioritized Health Interventions). The PEAS also has a negative list of excluded
procedures, which has also seen changes in the last few years. In April 2012, the government
created the Intangible Health Solidarity Fund (Fondo Intangible Solidario de Salud-FISSAL) and
tasked it with managing an approved plan that includes seven high-cost cancer-related
pathologies and corresponding procedures9, kidney diseases treatment (such as kidney
transplants and hemodialysis) and rare and orphan diseases (such as Von Willebrand disease,
Kocher syndrome, Pendred syndrome and others).
Despite the relatively comprehensive coverage of services defined under the various benefits
packages, access to health services is still a challenge. And although the EsSalud package
includes nearly unlimited coverage in terms of curative care, supply is unable to respond to the
increasing demand for complex health care services, including care for catastrophic illnesses,
and waiting times are long. On the SIS side, while the benefits package now includes a wide
range of services, actual availability of services, especially in poor rural areas, is a continuing
obstacle. In the last few decades, the public and social security health systems have not invested
enough in hospital infrastructure or ambulatory facilities, especially in poor areas. In 2012,
MINSA prioritized a set of 748 health centers that will receive investments in infrastructure
through a joint effort between MINSA (through the Support to the Health Reform Project)10 and
the regional governments.

Notwithstanding these challenges, access to maternal and child health services has generally
improved in the last decade. Immunization rates for DPT and measles are above 85 percent;
96 percent of pregnant women receive prenatal care; and 87 percent of births are attended by
skilled health staff (Figure 7).

Peru’s burden of disease has shifted toward noncommunicable diseases and therefore it is also
important to look at access to services related to those conditions. The 2012 Demographic and
Health Survey includes some information on coverage of services related to chronic conditions
and injuries. In particular, it measured the incidence of high blood pressure among adults 40 and
over. Figure 8 shows that among each 100 adults who needed blood pressure treatment,11 38
received treatment and 17 had normal blood pressure levels as a result of treatment. Among the
poorest 40 percent, 22 of each 100 population needing treatment receive it and 10 have normal
blood pressure levels. The numbers for SIS affiliates are in between. On treatment of injuries, the
survey indicates that 36 out of each 100 adults who suffered an injury in the past three months
received treatment for the injury (Figure 9).

       c. Financial protection
Despite the growth of affiliation to health insurance programs, out-of-pocket health payments
(OOP)—and specifically direct payments to providers—remain the main source of financing in
the health sector (Figure 10). OOP consists mainly of expenses incurred for medical care and
medication not only by those who are still uninsured but also for those who are insured but have
no access due to geographic barriers or supply limitations. In addition, the insured may choose to
pay out of pocket if they feel that providers who are covered do not offer the quality or
convenience of services that they require.

Following the WHO and World Bank discussion paper (2013), we measure the extent to which
OOP reflects a lack of financial protection for the population by examining whether they lead to
impoverishment or catastrophic expenditures. We define OOP as impoverishing if a person’s (or
household’s) total expenditure is above the poverty line, but expenditures net of OOP are below
the poverty line (Seinfeld 2013; Sherri et al. 2012) Figure 11 shows that 2.6 percent of the
population became poor due to OOP in 2013, and the number is stable over 2008–13. However,
there is some evidence that impoverishment actually increased for SIS affiliates between 2008
and 2013 (from 2.2 percent to 2.9 percent)

The incidence or lack of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) is another measure of (lack of)
financial protection in health, and can be defined in several ways. In this document, we use the
following definition: people are said to incur a CHE if their health expenditure is higher than
40 percent of their capacity to pay, which is itself defined as the difference between the total
expenditure per household member and the poverty line. We use the poverty line defined by INEI.
In this definition, all people living below the poverty line are counted as incurring CHE if they bear
any OOP. In Peru, CHE seem to have diminished for the overall population between 2008 and
2013 (Figure 12). However, for the lowest expenditure quintile12 as well as for SIS beneficiaries,
there is no clear downward trend.

     We compute expenditure quintiles using per capita total household expenditures.

proportion of the poverty line (Figure 13). SIS affiliates have experienced larger increases in OOP
than the general population: in 2008, SIS affiliates spent on average 39 percent of the poverty
line on OOP payments; by 2013, this had increased to 57 percent.

3. Governance Structure: Institutional Arrangements, Decision Making, and Accountability

        a. Goal setting
The health sector reform process is a complex process that requires ownership from various
stakeholders. MINSA is responsible for taking a leadership role in stewardship of the reform
process. In 2012, the president of Peru requested the National Health Council (Consejo Nacional
de Salud—CNS) to develop health reform guidelines, with the ultimate goal of ensuring access
and quality of health services, and the gradual increase of their scope. The CNS drafted a
preliminary document that contains an outline and content for the proposed health sector
reform and endorses MINSA’s role in leading the reform process (CNS 2013). The Health Reform
Guidelines document includes an ambitious program that has the potential to transform the
health sector. The planned reform aims to increase the health system’s focus on results via
health outcomes and health system outputs, complementing the traditional focus on processes
and inputs. It also aims to move the system toward results-based management and financing,
which of course requires a monitoring and evaluation system. The Health Reform Guidelines
document still needs to be complemented with quantifiable goals, and results chains and
indicators for each area of the reform.



                                                  14
On December 10, 2013, the Government passed 23 Legislative Decrees and one Supreme Decree
in several areas related to the implementation of the Health Reform, including supervision of the
health sector, service exchange between insurers and providers, MINSA’s organization, SIS’s
relationship with health care providers, and the management of health service provision in Lima

        b. Governance structure
MINSA is in charge of key regulatory, planning, monitoring, and evaluation functions, and
finances special health programs such as promotional health campaigns and investments.
Regulation, supervision, and sanctions of insurers and providers, public and private, are the
responsibility of the National Superintendence of Health (Superintendencia Nacional de Salud—

   In December 2013, SUNASA changed its name from National Superintendence of Health Insurance
(Superintendencia Nacional de Asseguramiento en Salud) to National Superintendence of Health (Superintendencia
Nacional de Salud). In June 2014 the acronym was changed from SUNASA to SUSALUD See webpage

        c. Service delivery structure
The provision of services is almost completely separated between the public system (the
EsSalud network) and the private sector providers.
Public providers attend SIS affiliates as well as the non-insured who pay out of pocket. They
include MINSA establishments in the Lima Metropolitan Area as well as regional providers
outside Lima. The provision of health care services in the regions is managed by the DIRESAs of
the regional governments, which are politically and administratively autonomous. DIRESAs are
responsible for providing primary, secondary, and most tertiary health care services. In the Lima
Metropolitan Area, most of the hospitals belong to MINSA,14 while the public hospitals and health
facilities in the regions have been mostly transferred from MINSA to the regional governments or
recently built to improve health supply and to meet increasing demand from the SIS-affiliated
population.
For formal workers, EsSalud provides health services by managing its own health units or
purchasing services from private hospitals, ambulatory care facilities, and other health facilities.
The EsSalud network of services includes 379 health facilities, 64 of which are in Lima and
Callao, the rest in the regions, mainly in the capitals (SUNASA 2013). EsSalud’s insured
population face a restricted supply of services characterized by long waiting lines, delayed
appointments, poor quality of treatment, and incomplete drug delivery (Petrera and Seinfeld
2007; Seinfeld 2013).
While SIS still mostly finances services for its affiliates through regional and MINSA networks of
providers, the market for health care services has evolved in its coverage, quality, and pricing.
The increase in disposable income and expansion of private health services in primary care,
pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics increasingly means that even poor SIS affiliates may have the
option of using private providers, especially in urban areas. This is then associated with an
increase in OOP in health. The experiences with private investments in the northern and
southern districts in Lima, the expanding networks of pharmacies with on-site health services,
and the experience of SISOL in Lima are just a few examples of market response to the low
capacity of the public sector to deliver services in urban areas (World Bank 2013b).




14
  In December 2013, Legislative decree 1167 created the Institute for Management of Health Services, which will
assume the functions of managing, operating, and coordinating health services previously managed directly by
MINSA. The Institute is an autonomous entity attached to MINSA.


                                                        16
Service exchange agreements were established among SIS, regional governments, and
EsSalud. In 2012, SIS, the regional governments, and EsSalud started entering into service
exchange agreements. Under them, patients affiliated to SIS in the regions became eligible for
medium- and high-complexity services (such as MRI, mammographies, ultrasound, endoscopies,
and surgery) in EsSalud facilities, while EsSalud patients became eligible for primary care from
regional government facilities where EsSalud has no supply of services. The exchange
agreements make functional sense given that the supply of services by regional governments is
concentrated in the first and second level of care, while EsSalud services are focused on
medium- and high-level complexity, with limited attention to primary care services. The service
exchange agreements offer an opportunity to integrate the networks of health facilities in the
first level of care, and to work toward resolving the lack of standardization of processes and care
evident across facilities belonging to different networks.

In the initial phase of implementation, challenges arose on the insurance/administrative side and
on the patient care side from structural differences between the two institutions and from the
design and content of the agreements (Barrenechea 2014). On the administrative side, the rules
governing the insurance programs vary greatly between SIS and EsSalud. For example, SIS has a
universal approach in the sense that its affiliates can be attended in any regional government
facility while EsSalud beneficiaries can only receive services from regional government facilities
if they are registered as residents of the area. EsSalud also excludes treatment of some pre-
existing conditions and requires waiting periods for certain types of care including maternity,
unlike SIS. SIS in contrast tries to influence the behavior of health care providers through
agreements with the regions and through performance indicators, which bear no relation to the
EsSalud requirements.
On the structural side, challenges included differences in clinical guidelines between EsSalud and
regional government facilities, lack of personnel to attend to patients, differences in the salary
scales and professional careers, outdated medical equipment, lack of maintenance of
infrastructure, lack of standardization of patient care and management, and difference in the
focus of care (curative care focus in EsSalud versus preventive care focus in regional government
establishments).
Generally, human resources in SIS, EsSalud, and regional governments seem poorly prepared to
handle the new way of working associated with the service exchanges—in particular, capacities
to handle insurance, management of risks, medical auditing, clinical management, planning, and
financial management are limited.
Information systems used by both institutions are unable to communicate because they do not
have a common protocol or data dictionary. Thus none of the regional governments has managed
to bill EsSalud for the care provided to EsSalud beneficiaries, and so payments have been only
one-sided from SIS to EsSalud. Finally, the actual number of services that have been exchanged
is very low, evidence that operational issues are impeding patients from making much use of the
agreements.

B. Current status of health financing
In absolute terms, Total Health Expenditures in Peru increased more than fourfold between
2000 and 2012, although as a share of GDP it remained stagnant (Table 2).

Peru now has one of the lowest THE as a share of GDP in Latin America: in 2012, it was
5.1 percent, versus the regional average of 7.7 percent (WDI 2014 and WHO 2014). General
government expenditure on health stayed relatively low (below 60 percent of THE) and include
expenditures by SIS, EsSalud, regional health authorities, and vertical health programs. Despite
the increases in affiliation to EsSalud and SIS, OOP still make up a significant portion of THE and
were nearly as high in 2012 as in 1995.

         a. Fiscal space and sustainability15
Fiscal space in health16 refers to the capacity of the government to increase spending for the
health sector, without jeopardizing the government´s long-term solvency or crowding out
expenditure in other sectors (Tandon and Cashin 2010). The literature identifies five pillars to
generate fiscal space for health: (i) conducive macroeconomic conditions, mainly GDP growth
and tax revenue; (ii) reprioritization of health within the government budget; (iii) earmarked
taxes for health; (iv) external grants for health; and (v) efficiency improvements in the health
sector (Powell, Hanson, and McIntyre 2012). USAID (2011b) analyzes Peru’s fiscal space for
health, concluding that there are possibilities to generate revenues to close the financial gap in
the health sector, mainly through pillars (i), (ii), and (v). Peruvian tax law prohibits earmarked
taxes for any sector.17 External grants for health have been limited. In fact, less than 2 percent
of the country’s THE is financed by external grants.
The government is executing measures to broaden the tax base permanently, including
promoting formalization, which is vital for health fiscal space, because not only does it increase
the tax revenue but also increases affiliates to EsSalud; combating high tax evasion (35 percent
for the value-added tax and more than 50 percent for income tax); increasing efforts to recover
15
   This section draws heavily on Seinfeld (2013).
16
   Health-sector specific fiscal space assessments are needed due to the lack of adequate and sustained levels of
resources to achieve health outcomes (Tandon and Cashin 2010).
17
   Even when it is not exactly an earmarked tax for health sector, the establishment of free affiliation to the semi-
contributory regime for those affiliated to the NRUS is a way to generate fiscal space for the health sector through
increases in tax revenues.

tax debts; and rationalizing tax exemptions and benefits. These measures, combined with the
political will to prioritize health, are important for increasing the health fiscal space.
Computations of how much would need to be invested to offer a universal package of health
services are complicated by the fact that the per capita cost of the benefits package (PEAS,
complementary plan, or catastrophic plan) has not been determined on the basis of actuarial
cost studies. Seinfeld (2013) projects that government expenditure on health would fluctuate
between PEN 22,582 and PEN 27,557 million in 2020, or equivalent to about 2.7 percent of
GDP. On average, estimated government health expenditure growth will fluctuate between
10.4 percent and 13.6 percent a year over 2014–20, depending on the scenario, while between
PEN 1,600 million and PEN 2,300 million would be added to government health expenditures
each year until 2020. Yet Peru still has 2.7 million poor people without health insurance—using
an estimate of PEN 342 per capita cost for the benefits package, this implies that covering the
PEAS for the currently uninsured poor and children under 5 would represent 44–64 percent of
the projected annual increase in government health expenditures.
In the case of the semi-contributory modality of SIS, the enrolled population finances part of the
premium and in theory this could contribute to the sustainability of the insurance system.
However, as of 2012 the contribution to the premium was at most PEN 15 per person per month.
In addition, as mentioned above, enrollment into the semi-contributory program is negligible
compared with the subsidized program.
EsSalud, as well as the FFAA and FFPP public insurance programs, are financed by employers’
and employees’ contributions. Contributions for the general health plan amount to 9 percent of
salaries. According to projections by the ILO (2012), EsSalud expenditures will be PEN 11,121 in
2016 (Table 3)—an increase of 51 percent from 2012. On the growth of GDP projected by the
Ministry of Economy and Finances (MEF) (2013), EsSalud expenditure as a share of GDP is set to
be 0.2 percentage points higher than in 2012. Given the market orientation of the economy in
Peru, it would not be politically feasible to propose an increment in the contribution as a way to
increase EsSalud funding in the medium term.

                   b. Expenditure management18
Financing and fund management mechanisms for the public health system are fragmented. The
funding function is split between several agencies including MEF, the DIRESAs, and the health
facilities and providers who collect OOP. The public health provider networks are mainly

18
     This section draws heavily on Seinfeld (2013).


                                                                      19
financed by two sources of revenues: MEF transfers directly to the executing units the payment
for human resources and to finance the results-based programs (Presupuesto por Resultados—
PpR); and SIS transfers to the regional governments resources to cover the variable costs of
services to SIS affiliates (inputs and medical materials, medicines, and infrastructure
maintenance). The fragmented approach to health expenditure management presents a major
challenge to improving efficiency and accountability in health care financing.
The direct transfers from MEF to the regions that finance human resources have limited
accountability mechanisms. For example, the regions do not systematically have to update or
make available lists of the human resources they employ, and so it is not possible to compile up-
to-date statistics on employment of doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel there, nor can
one analyze their distribution.
Pharmaceuticals are another potential area of saving for the health sector. In 2012, spending on
medicines represented about 55 percent of OOP in health (ENAHO 2012). In a 2010 study,
Cameron and Richard found that for 11 medicines studied, 78.7 percent of current private
sector spending could be saved by using generics instead of brand-name medication;19 the net
saving for this limited basket of medicines alone would exceed $2.5 million (in 2008 dollars).
Therefore, investments in promoting quality-assured generic medicines appear warranted.
Expenditure management for EsSalud. EsSalud faces challenges in ensuring its sustainability.
The first is to use its revenues more efficiently, by improving clinical management programs and
focusing on health promotion and prevention to avoid costly hospitalizations. The lack of
articulation between levels of care also leads to significant wastage of time and resources as
patients are forced to repeat diagnostic tests and procedures because the different levels of
care do not have a way to share patient information between them. The current model of care is
centered on disease, acute care, and hospital-based treatment, rather than on primary and
secondary attention, where evidence shows most health problems (70–75 percent) should be
solved.
Second, EsSalud needs to increase its revenues, recovering the debts from subsidized insurance
programs, the government, and the private sector. For example, the Agrarian Health Insurance
debt of nearly $500 million has been outstanding for many years. In addition, the state and the
private sector owe a vast amount to EsSalud ($1,300 million).20 On various occasions, EsSalud
has faced political pressure to include segments of the population with a lower percentage of
salary contribution, but for those populations the contribution does not cover the cost of
offering the package of services. In addition, EsSalud faces filtration of uninsured people who
face a negative health shock and obtain a formal sector job with the sole purpose of obtaining
EsSalud health coverage. Yet EsSalud affiliates can opt to use private health service suppliers to
cover ambulatory services, and the most complex health care services are still covered by
EsSalud. With this, the employer selects the EPS and transfers one-fourth of the premium to the
EPS, which is another way to lose revenues.
Expenditure management for SIS. SIS program offers services along the PEAS package of
“essential” services. According to Acosta (2008), the annual cost of PEAS, including fixed and

19
   The study mentioned a list of 18 medicines included in the analysis of different countries. However, it does not
specify which of these medicines were used in the Peruvian case.
20
   Approximately 63 percent of this corresponds to private sector debt.


                                                          20
variable costs, is about PEN 342 per capita. In addition, SIS offers a complementary plan and
covers treatment for the most common cancers, ESRD, and rare or orphan diseases through the
Intangible Health Solidarity Fund (Fondo Intangible Solidario de Salud—FISSAL). Although the SIS
package of covered services was expanded, this expansion was not based on systematic reviews
to ensure their cost-effectiveness, or a study of the cost of the services.21 In addition, SIS lacks
updated information on the epidemiological profile of its affiliates and the projections, even for
PEAS (Seinfeld 2013).
The payment mechanism used by SIS to finance health care for its beneficiaries has undergone
key changes in recent years.22 Up to 2011, SIS based its payments to the regions on fee-for-
service reimbursements. Starting in 2011, SIS began signing management contracts with
regional governments, in which they agreed rights and responsibilities on health service coverage
and financing. The first agreement was signed with the Huancavelica region in 2011, and a
further four regions in 2012. All other regions signed agreements in 2013.
A key component of the agreements was a change in the payment system for services to SIS
affiliates. While the agreements incurred some changes in the pilot phase, starting in 2013 the
payment mechanism was capitation for the first and second level of care, with an adjustment for
risk based on the Human Development Index. In addition, the agreements include a list of
performance indicators that carry a value of 20 percent of the amount set aside for the
transfer. In other words, 80 percent of the payments are based on capitation, 20 percent on
performance indicators.
A number of issues arose in the initial phase of implementation (Beteta 2014). First, while the
agreements establish the amounts to be transferred to the executive units of the regional
government, as well as the calendar of payments that depend on the performance indicators,
they do not include any rules for how the regional governments or executive units should
transfer funds to the health facilities, despite the fact that they establish rights and obligations
for those health facilities. The agreements only ensure that the transfer arrives at the executive
units and not the health facilities. While SIS resources are intended to be used to finance health
benefits for SIS beneficiaries, in practice control mechanisms are such that regional
governments could use them for other programs not necessarily associated with SIS.
Second, the major bottlenecks in the flow of funding and incentives are now at regional level.
Weaknesses in the organization of the health sector within the regions, and in the financial
administration of the executive units’ resources, result in delays in management of the budget,
procurement, and logistics, and in delayed arrival of resources at health centers.
Third, at central and regional levels, the capitation payment methodology is widely considered an
incentive for health centers to affiliate more beneficiaries to SIS. However, there seems to be a
breakdown of incentives between the regions and health centers: because there is no clarity in
the management agreements on how the resources should be distributed within the region, it
appears that health centers continue receiving resources that are either based on fee-for-service
or on historical assignation of resources.


21 Legislative decree 1163 states that SIS financing should be supported by an actuarial study establishing the

premium value for funding the package, including the claims costs, the acquisition costs, the administrative costs, and
the technical utility. In practice, however, this has not happened.
22
   This section draws heavily on Beteta (2014).


                                                          21
Finally, health centers in rural areas lack the capacity to deliver the services in the package, as
they struggle with lack of qualified personnel or high turnover of personnel (or both). The
capitation payment does not provide incentives to attract additional personnel to centers where
there could be more demand for services, as it only pays for the variable costs of service
(medicines and supplies) and not for personnel. While the capitation payment may provide some
incentives to increase affiliation to SIS, in practice it only represents a fraction of the funding
that is required to provide effective infrastructure and support system to ensure quality
services for the SIS beneficiaries; meanwhile, health personnel are funded by MEF and regional
governments and are not directly responsive to SIS needs. Thus, the fragmentation of funding
mechanisms and governance structure leads to a lack of consistency and coordination of
payment system, and complicates the crucial task of effective expenditure management.

         c. Assuring equity in health financing
Annual per capita expenditures vary substantially between EsSalud and SIS. EsSalud’s top plans
are organized by program where the employee can choose a private health promotion company
(EPS) to manage the plan. Competition is common to attract enrollees by offering different
conditions of service coverage and pricing. The per capita expenditure of an EPS-type plan costs
as much as a voluntary health plan (about $600 a year). On the SIS side, annual expenditure is
very low. In 2011, SIS spent an average of PEN 40 (about $15) per beneficiary (MINSA 2013).
This is lower than the estimated cost of the PEAS ($124 per year), though SIS transfers only
cover the variable costs of services.
Affiliation to SIS is based on the SISFOH and requires the National Identification Document.
According to ENAHO household surveys, about 69 percent of SIS affiliates belonged to the
lowest two quintiles, and this percentage has been stable since 2008, making it a progressive
program (Figure 15). Coverage among the extreme poor and moderately poor is higher than
among the nonpoor (Figure 16). Still, about 14 percent of SIS affiliates belong to the two richest
quintiles, which implies significant filtration into the program (Figure 15). At the same time,
health insurance coverage in the lowest two quintiles is still below 76 percent (Figure 17). These
errors of inclusion and exclusion partly reflect the discrepancy between the SISFOH system for
identifying beneficiaries (which is based on a number of criteria including a list of assets) and
more complete measures of poverty that can be captured in ENAHO household surveys.

C. Human Resources for Health (HRH)23

1. Current status of HRH
Peru is one of the few countries in Latin America facing a critical health workforce shortage, with
health worker density below the crucial threshold of 2.3 per 1,000 population.24 Beside the
overall shortage, geographic distribution is skewed. The number of doctors per 1,000 habitants
in Lima is 7.7 while in most Andean and Amazon jungle regions—the majority of rural areas in the
country—it is below 4.0 and even close to 2.0 in some regions (Miranda et al. 2012). A similar
situation is seen for other health cadres such as nurses and midwives (Huicho et al. 2012).

  This section is based on CRONICAS (2014).
24MINSA estimated for 2010 a huge deficit of human resources in different medical professions: medical doctors,
37 percent; nurses, 35 percent; midwives, 38 percent; dentists, 91 percent.




                                                         24
Little information is readily available about human resources for health, especially outside the
public sector. A recent study of the health labor market (CRONICAS 2014) was limited to the
public sector, as no information was publicly available for the other segments including EsSalud
or the private sector. For example, there is no comprehensive list of the medical doctors who
practice in the private sector—each professional association keeps tabs of licensing
requirements. Even within the public sector, MINSA does not have a comprehensive, up-to-date
list of health personnel, so analysis is based on a collection of different sources of information,
many of which are outdated. The lack of information for the public sector is partly due to a lack
of accountability in the funding mechanisms: MEF funds human resources in the regions without
requiring that regions be accountable or report to MINSA on the health personnel they employ.
As a results, reports on the number of doctors, nurses, and other health professionals tend to
vary substantially, depending on the source of data.



2. Training and education of human resources for health
The number of training programs for health professionals and the number of graduates have
increased significantly in recent years. In 2013, there were 21 medical schools (up from three in
1960 [MINSA 2011]) and 35 nurse training programs (eight in 1960 [MINSA 2011]) registered
with CONEAU,25 the tertiary education evaluation and accreditation body. In addition, many
schools offer training on multiple campuses. There were 234 registered training programs in
health-related professions.26 Training is provided by both public and private universities and
institutes, with the private ones offering a wider variety of programs. Among the universities
that account for 4 percent or more of medical students, seven were private and two public. In
nursing and midwifery, all of the larger programs were private.
Despite the increase in training programs, there is significant excess demand for health
professional training—for example, only 5 percent of applicants to public medical schools end up
registering, while in private universities the ratio is 26 percent. The expansion of training
programs has led to steep increases in the number of health professional graduates in recent
years. For example, the number of medical graduates increased from 1,244 in 2007 to 2,011 in
2011 (Table 5).

In 2006 the government created a national system to evaluate, accredit, and certify educational
quality (Sistema Nacional de Evaluación, Acreditación y Certificación de la Calidad Educativa—
SINEACE). The system aims to improve quality by ensuring that institutions meet standards and
can be accredited to train health professionals, and by engaging and authorizing professional
colleges in the certification of graduates. As of November 2013, 186 out of the 234 training
programs had initiated the accreditation process, though only two programs (one in nursing and
one in dentistry) had been accredited, pointing toward difficulties in accreditation. By contrast,
progress on the certification side was faster: by 2013, all professional colleges had been
authorized to certify graduates.
In an effort to reaffirm the role of primary care, in 2009 MINSA created competency profiles for
so-called “basic health teams”. These include medical doctors, nurses, midwives, and dentists,
and the intention is for them to form the basis of primary care delivery, which should address
70–80 percent of demand for services. Nonetheless, an analysis of the training plans of the
major training institutes reveals that those do not necessarily put much emphasis on primary
care and show major discrepancies with MINSA’s competency profiles, including lack of training
in prevention, promotion, and management of conditions in all training programs. At the same
time, the competency profiles are skewed toward care by medical doctors: for example, in the
area of adult care, nurses are only competent in management of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS,
while the care and management of all other infectious and non-infections conditions falls
directly to medical doctors. This approach is at odds with international discussions about the
need to include a wider spectrum of health professionals in managing noncommunicable diseases
(WHO 2011).
Medical specialists are trained through a medical residency program implemented by the medical
faculties. Entrance requirements include an entrance exam, previous graduation from an
undergraduate medical program, certification by the Medical College of Peru (Colegio Médico del
Perú), and completion of SERUM (see just below). For most specialties except family and
community medicine, there are excess applicants to the specialization programs. The specialist
profiles are established by the CONAREME (Consejo Nacional de Residentado Médico). Analysis
of the training programs shows that the only specialties that include emphasis on community-
based competencies are OB/GYN and family medicine. Pediatrics, general surgery, and other
specialties do not include this type of training.

3. Rural internship program (SERUM)
One of the strategies the government is using to increase the coverage of health professionals at
primary care level across regions is the Rural Internship Program (Servicio Rural Urbano Marginal
en Salud—SERUM). SERUM is an internship that health professionals must go through to qualify
to work in the public sector. They spend one year usually in a remote and rural setting providing


                                               26
health care for the local population. Starting in 2009, SERUM was refocused toward the poorest
communities and the number of available placements was increased significantly, reaching
6,384 in 2013. SERUM has been effective at increasing the presence of health professionals in
the most remote and underprivileged locations. In 2008, of the 800 poorest districts in the
country only 53 percent had a doctor carrying out their SERUM; by 2011, 89 percent had.
Furthermore, in the three poorest regions (Ayacucho, Apurimac, and Huancavelica), 95 percent
of districts now have a medical doctor.
Yet there are concerns. First, SERUM tends to place an inexperienced professional, trained to
provide care mainly at the secondary and tertiary levels, into a primary care setting without
much support or mentorship, which may undermine the quality of care. Second, the links
between training, SERUM, and insertion into the public sector are not straightforward. For
health professions other than medical doctor—nurses, midwives, pharmacists—the number of
graduates far exceeds the number of available SERUM positions. For medical doctors, the
number of positions is similar or slightly higher than the number of graduates. More
dramatically, 75 percent of health professionals who conclude a SERUM do not continue
working in the public sector. This reflects on the capacity of the public sector to attract and
contract new health professionals. In addition, over 2007–11, among professionals who
completed a SERUM and did start working in the public sector, over 75 percent did so under a
temporary administrative contract.

4. Contracting modalities and the health labor market
The public sector uses more than 10 types of labor contracts in the health sector, which have
wide disparities in conditions, salaries, and benefits, especially among medical doctors. Within
the public sector, those on permanent “276” contracts can earn up to twice as much as those on
temporary, newer contracts (e.g. Régimen Especial de Contrato Administrativo de Servicios—
RECAS). The difference with health professionals working outside the public sector (e.g. EsSalud)
is even starker, particularly for nonphysicians, with public sector workers making up to PEN
19,000 (around $6,800) less annually. Although income is not the only factor that health
professionals consider when taking up employment, these differences are still an obstacle to
attracting high-quality, motivated professionals to the public sector.
The national level has significant shortages of doctors in the public sector to be able to provide
the basic PEAS package of services. This shortage is not a result of a lack of graduates with
medical training, but a result of the lack of absorption of graduates into the public sector.
CRONICAS (2014) estimates that if the current insertion rates continue, the deficit of medical
will be resolved—by 2027. However, if the public sector managed to double the insertion rate,
the deficit would disappear by as early as 2020. Little information is available about the number
of health professionals in the private sector, but a study by MINSA in 2005 suggests that in Lima
and other urban areas, a large group of health professionals were working in conditions of
underemployment, new graduates had difficulty getting job placements, and there was an
expansion of dual practice or multiple employment, job instability, and ongoing search for new
opportunities, including migration. The 2010 university census shows that 78 percent of medical
students, 67 percent of nursing students, and 60 percent of midwifery students intend to
migrate (ANR 2010).

In 2012, the public sector had 7,048 specialists, of whom about 58 percent were in Lima (MINSA
2012). Even among those specialties considered to be priority (anesthesiology, general surgery,
OB/GYN, family and community medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics), 53 percent of public
sector doctors were in Lima. Zevallos (2011) estimates that need for specialists based on the
epidemiological profile is 11,738—implying a 40 percent deficit overall. The four specialties with
the largest shortages are OB/GYN, pediatrics, internal medicine, and general surgery. However,
just increasing training is unlikely to resolve the overall deficit of specialists, as the absorption
problem into the public sector is even starker than for medical doctors and other health
professions: in 2009–10, only an estimated 10 percent of specialists who completed their
residency went on to work in the public sector.




                           Part II: Lessons for Other Countries
Although the following conclusions are specific to Peru’s experience with UHC, the associated
recommendations may also have relevance for other middle-income countries.	
In the past two decades, Peru has made impressive progress on health indicators, partly by
increasing public spending on health and partly by instituting important reforms such the
creation of SIS and the passage of the Universal Health Insurance Law in 2009. There is a
political will to implement a health reform that will progress toward UHC. The SIS now covers
over 10 million Peruvians, and health coverage has increased to 65 percent in 2013 (ENAHO).
Health insurance affiliation is higher among the extremely poor and poor than among the
nonpoor.

A. Health Financing
Despite this progress, the country still faces deficiencies in its financial protection for the
households. For example, while public spending on health increase in absolute terms, it has not
kept up with general economic growth. OOP on health remain the main source of total health
spending, the quantity and quality of health services is inadequate, and economic barriers are
still significant determinants of access to health services.




                                                 28
The SIS now covers over 35 percent of Peruvians with a package of services; however, there is a
long way to be able to ensure its beneficiaries with access to high-quality health coverage. In
recent years, for instance, the tendency has been to expand the SIS benefit plans to show an
expansion in coverage, but these expansions were not based on actuarial projections of the cost
of care nor did they take into account the demographic and epidemiological profile of the
population or the availability of services. As a result, the benefits package is a theoretical plan
that does not correspond well to available services, especially for poor, rural populations. It	
would	 be	 key	 for	 the	 country	 to	 improve benefits-package management, basing it on the
population’s demographic and epidemiological profile, definition of services covered under the
plans, and actuarial projections of the cost of covering the plans (based on available health care
service providers).
The Peruvian health system is also fragmented in its insurance risk pooling, financing, and
service-provision functions, leading to duplication and wastage of resources. Funding to public
providers is fragmented between MEF and SIS, with SIS only covering a marginal amount of the
cost of providing services. The two sources of funding will need to be better aligned to generate
incentives for providers to generate more and better services. SIS needs to transform itself from
a source of funding to a real purchaser of services, with the managerial tools and organizational
structure that will allow it pool funding, purchase services from providers, and monitor use and
quality of services.
EsSalud faces challenges of its own, both on the efficiency side and on the revenue side, which it
hopes to address using a newly developed Master Plan for 2013-2021. Given the epidemiologic
transition and its acute, hospital-based model of care, EsSalud will need to adjust the model to
focus more on preventive and primary care. Fiscal sustainability of the model is also at stake in
the long run—it will need to recover debt owed to the institution and find long-term solutions to
ensure that its affiliates’ contributions match its expenditures.



B. Health Services Organization
Decentralization presents both opportunities and challenges. The relationship between national
and regional governments and SIS has changed substantially with the introduction of
management agreements that include capitation payments from SIS to the regions for the first
and second level of care, as well as performance indicators. However, initial experiences suggest
that changes are needed in those contracts and in how SIS operates more generally to align
incentives between the actors. Changes are also necessary in the funding arrangements with the
regions—there is little accountability for how regions spend the funding from MEF. There needs
to be a concerted effort by MINSA, MEF, and SIS to improve coordination of sources of funding
to increase accountability in the regions.
Recent pilots of service exchange between the regions, SIS, and EsSalud offer opportunities for
integration; they also point to the operational challenges of integrating networks with different
beneficiaries, rules and modus operandi. Still, integrated health service delivery networks could
improve the accessibility of the system, improve overall system efficiency, prevent duplication
of infrastructure and services, reduce production costs, and respond more effectively to people´s
needs and expectations.


                                               29
In order to use current supply more efficiently, the health network should not only be formed by
public establishments, but also mechanisms should exist to integrate private establishments
with the health network. With the implementation of integrated networks, the current model of
care—centered on disease, acute care, and hospital-based treatment—would change. The focus,
without neglecting acute care and hospital-based treatment, should be on primary and
secondary attention, where evidence shows that most health problems (70–75 percent) should
be solved.
Peru needs substantial investment and modernization of its health information systems to build
effective service networks. On the one hand, Peru is one of few countries that have annual
household and demographic and health surveys—in that sense general information on health
status, household expenditures, and socioeconomic well-being is updated and easily available. On
the other hand, health information systems tend to be fragmented between the different
networks of providers and even within networks. Data collection and management systems are
outdated, duplicative, and unreliable. For the system to move to an articulated system of
insurers and providers, a major effort and investment is needed to align protocols and ensure the
inter-operability of IT systems.
Peru will also need to modernize its health service delivery processes, such as the supply chain
for medicines, perhaps involving the private sector, to resolve issues with availability. OOP on
medicines could be cut heavily by improving systems to ensure the quality of generic medicines
and by encouraging their use. Most public hospitals in Peru do not have a hospital management
information system, and so patients spend time in multiple queues at every stage in the service
delivery process. EsSalud also needs to improve clinical management and focus on primary and
preventive attention for its beneficiaries.

C. Human Resources for Health
Peru trains enough medical professionals, yet there are continued challenges in terms of
ensuring the relevant of training programs, recruitment, and efficient management of human
resources. The supply and demand of training for the medical professions in Peru is high, and
there is a pending agenda to adjust the content of training the priorities of the country in terms
of health, in particular to a renewed focus on primary care. One option would be to develop
alternative, shorter training modalities with high likelihood of employment on graduation. MINSA
and regional governments, as majority employers, will need to work with professional boards and
universities to ensure an appropriate focus on primary care.
In addition, the accreditation process of health training programs needs to move faster to
perform its function of signaling the quality of training. The SERUM strategy has been successful
in increasing the number of health professionals in rural and isolated areas, but needs to be
complemented with a clear strategy as to retention of recent SERUM graduates by the public
sector.
Recruitment of trained health professionals into the health sector is also a challenge: while the
country trains sufficient health professionals to be able to close the deficit of health professional
in few years, in reality a large portion of this investment is wasted. While Peru trains significant
numbers of specialists, only 10 percent of those get integrated into the public sector, and little
information is available about the whereabouts of those who do not get integrated. A


                                                 30
comprehensive strategy that includes appropriate incentive structures, working conditions, and
better information on the labor market would help bring services to where they are needed
within a realistic financial scenario.
Too little information is readily available about health human resources, especially outside the
public sector. Even within it, MINSA does not have a comprehensive, up-to-date list of health
personnel. There is need for a concerted effort and strategic alliances between the various
networks of providers—EsSalud, professional colleges, the private sector, the Ministry of
Finance, and even migration authorities—to improve the availability of basic and strategic
information.
