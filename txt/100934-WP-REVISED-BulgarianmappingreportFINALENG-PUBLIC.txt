This report identifies and maps procedural steps according to the law on the books
and actual practice for two types of procedures in Bulgarian courts: the fast track
claims procedure under Chapter 25 of Bulgarian Civil Procedure Code (hereinafter
referred to as the CPC) with particular reference to labor claims; and the procedure
for issuance of an enforcement order under Art. 410 of the CPC and under Art. 417 of
the CPC. Work on the report was conducted in 2015.

The report was produced by Ms. Svetozara Petkova (World Bank Consultant) as part
of a set of Just-in-Time outputs supervised by David Bernstein (Lead Public Sector
Specialist) and Gregory Kisunko (Senior Public Sector Specialist). This work was
funded by the World Bank’s Bulgaria Country Office with the support of Mr. Antony
Thompson, Bulgaria Country Manager.

The World Bank would like to thank Bulgarian Ministry of Justice (MOJ) officials,
judges, attorneys and court staff consulted for this report for their guidance,
cooperation, and availability. The World Bank would particularly like to acknowledge
the support for this work from Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov, Deputy Justice Minister
Petko Petkov and MOJ Head of Cabinet Nadejda Yordanova.

1. Preface

The aim of this report is to illustrate the steps court users take in order to protect their
interests through procedures carried out by courts. The focus is on the difference
between the procedure in the law and actual practice. In outlining these differences,
the report shall identify procedural inefficiencies, bottlenecks and potential areas for
improvement of the procedure. It shall also estimate the approximate costs of these
procedures to the parties.

As per the methodology of the report, the first step was to prepare a de jure map of
each procedure. The maps show all procedural steps, specifying the party responsible
for carrying out the particular step, as well as the applicable timeline, if specified in
the law. In this manner the maps provide the analytical basis for the report. They
cover only the most straightforward development of the respective procedure and are
therefore complemented by graphs, which illustrate in more detail (without being
exhaustive) the possible paths of each procedure.

The second step was to conduct in-depth interviews with those who regularly
participate in the respective types of proceedings, i.e., attorneys with considerable
experience in such cases, judges and court staff responsible for service of documents.
The primary purpose of the interviews was to assess how the procedures actually
unfold, that is, to compare what happens in practice (the de facto procedure) with the
procedures envisaged by law (the de jure procedure), and to identify problems that
may occur and potentially undermine their efficiency and/or effectiveness.

It should be noted that, as regards the duration and costs of procedures, interviewees
were not requested to provide exact statistical data on procedures they were involved
in. Instead, they were asked to estimate the time each procedural step takes, the costs
parties incur and to give their opinion as to the most important challenges arising in
the course of the procedures.

Interviewees included legal professionals from Sofia, whose first-instance court has
the largest caseload in the country, as well as from Plovdiv, Blagoevgrad and Ihtiman
in order to reflect varying caseloads and regional diversity of court practice.
Additionally, many of the interviewed attorneys had experience countrywide. Hence,
one of the aims of the research was to assess regional differences in the functioning of
the judicial system. If this kind of analysis is done in the future, for other types of
procedures, the researcher recommends that interviews be conducted also with judges
in Eastern and Northern Bulgaria in order to have wider national coverage.

2. Executive summary

1. Labor Cases. The examination of fast-track labor cases under Chapter 25 CPC
indicates that generally there are no major differences between the procedural steps
under the law and in practice. Perhaps the most serious deviation between the two
occurs in cases where judges omit to prepare a preliminary report in labor cases or
issue a formalistic one and rely on the first open court hearing to make a
pronouncement on the evidence. This may lead to an increase in the number of
hearings necessary to complete the case.

2. The other issues identified in respect of labor cases could not be captured by the
comparison between the de jure and the de facto maps but were nevertheless
important. Employers’ representatives were concerned that in cases where a dismissal
is found illegal, the two-week time period for returning to the job after receiving a
notice of restoration to work might be abused. Specifically, employees can avoid
service of the notice thus postponing their return to work while benefiting from social
security payments. This issue is particularly serious at Sofia Regional Court
(hereinafter SRC), which does not serve notices for restoration to work ex officio but
leaves it to employees to collect them. Other problems include appeals of first-
instance decisions in labor cases solely for the sake of updating the period of
compensation for unemployment, which burdens the court system; delays due to
expert evaluations; and the cumbersome process of proof ensuing from the Labor
Code’s provisions on selection in cases of dismissal. The report makes
recommendations on ways to address these issues, which are summarized in Table 1
below.

3. Enforcement Orders. The examination of the procedures for issuing enforcement
orders under Art. 410 and Art. 417 CPC indicate that even thought there are no
deviations from the legally established procedural steps, there are notable differences
in the practices of individual judges and courts. Thus, some judges check in advance
whether they have territorial jurisdiction to examine requests for issuance of
enforcement orders while others do not; some judges instruct claimants to remove
errors and omissions to requests only in cases specified in the law and in the Supreme
Court of Cassation’s interpretative decision while others provide such instructions in a
wider number of cases. Practices differ also with regard to the treatment of original
documents in requests under Art. 417 and to the calculation of amounts due under
reverse writs of execution.

4. Again, not all issues regarding enforcement orders could be captured in a
comparison between the de jure and the de facto map. Amongst these issues are the
problems in serving enforcement orders under Art. 410 CPC, the numerous and
sometimes frivolous objections by debtors which may lead to an exponential increase
in the cost of the procedure, as well as the questionable determination of the fees for
the procedures in the respective tariffs, which appear not to be cost-based.
Recommendations on ways to address these issues are summarized in Table 1 below.

5. Sofia Regional Court. The comparisons between the de facto and the de jure map
of the two procedures demonstrate that the most serious deviations between law and


                                                                                      6
practice relate to timelines. The most significant delays appear to occur in SRC where
legally established timelines are frequently not complied with. Given the significance
of this court, which handles approximately 30% of all cases in the country, the report
devotes a separate section to it. Amongst the reasons for delays in this court are the
excessive caseload, the slow internal processes, problems with the space available in
the court building, the information systems and access to information.
Recommendations on ways to address these issues also are summarized in Table 1
below.

1    Not all judges prepare a preliminary report.      Ensuring that a preliminary report is prepared
                                                       on every occasion and that the report is not
                                                       formalistic but comprehensive.
2    No timeline for scheduling subsequent             Specifying the timeline for a subsequent court
     hearings in labor cases.                          hearing for fast track proceedings, possibly
                                                       through court practice or via future legislative
                                                       amendments.
3    Employees may avoid service of notice of          Ensuring that notices of restoration to work are
     restoration to work (especially in Sofia) thus    served ex officio to the employee, specifically
     benefiting from continuation of social security in Sofia. Consider introduction of a deadline

                                                       without resorting to a second-instance court.

5    Expert evaluations may contribute to delays.      Work on fundamental reform of expert

3. Fast-track procedure for labor claims under Chapter 25 of CPC

6. The fast-track procedure under Chapter 25 of CPC provides for stricter timelines
and other rules aimed at accelerating several types of claims, including certain labor
claims, claims for vacating rented premises, some intellectual property and consumer
protection claims, etc. Fast-track procedures have been given a special status by law
because it is deemed that they need to be handled in a speedier manner than other
civil cases, usually due to their social importance. This report shall examine the
procedure under Chapter 25 with particular reference to labor claims.

7. In 2014, the fast-track procedure under Chapter 25 of CPC represented 2.3% of
civil cases at regional courts in district towns and 3% of civil cases in other regional
courts. Of all fast-track procedures under Chapter 25 of CPC countrywide, about 30%
take place at Sofia Regional Court. Bulgarian court statistics do not gather
disaggregated information so it is not possible to determine the percentage of fast-
track cases that were labor disputes.

3.1. Short overview of the procedure

8. The fast-track procedure is applicable to labor claims for remuneration, illegal
dismissal, restoration to the prior workplace, compensation for temporary
unemployment and corrections to certain labor documents. Claimants in fast-track
labor cases can only be persons who have/had the capacity of employees or workers
(hereinafter referred to as employees).

9. The various possible procedural steps under Chapter 25 are illustrated in Graph 1.
For the purposes of this short overview, only the most common route of the procedure
is described. Details on specific issues that may arise and on deviations from the
legally set timelines and procedural steps are discussed in subsequent sections.

10. Upon filing of a labor claim under Chapter 25 CPC, the court shall review it on
the same day. If there are any omissions, it instructs the claimant to fix them within a
week. If the claim is complete and clear, the court orders its service to the respondent
who has 30 days to respond. On the day of filing the response or upon expiration of
the timeline thereof, the court, in a closed session, prepares a detailed report on the
case, admits evidence and schedules an open hearing within three weeks. The case is
completed in one or more court hearings depending on the need to use experts, hear
witnesses, request documents, etc. On the day of the last court hearing, the court
indicates the precise date when the court decision shall be published. The timeline for
appeal starts from this day unless the court is delayed in pronouncing the court
decision.

3.3. Comparison between the de jure and the de facto map of the procedure

3.3.1. Procedural steps

11. In terms of types and numbers of procedural steps, there are several main
deviations of the de facto map of the procedure from the de jure map.

12. First, not all judges prepare a detailed preliminary report (as per procedural step 8
per Table 1 above) on the case in advance, as required under Article 312 (2) of CPC.
It was difficult to determine based on the interviews how frequent that practice is but
at least in Sofia, attorneys indicated that some judges use the first open hearing to
make this report. This postpones collection of evidence and as a result, the case may
have to be heard in a larger number of open court hearings. Interviews indicate that in
courts outside of Sofia the preliminary report is prepared as per the law in closed
hearing upon receipt of the response from the respondent.

13. Secondly, judges and court users report that the provision under Article 312 (3) of
CPC requiring the court to make a pronouncement on parties’ additional requests on
the day of receiving them is rarely complied with. It is practically unrealistic, if there
are by law a total of three weeks between the issuance of the first court order and the
first court hearing, to have the time to serve the order to the parties, have them
prepare a request, file it with the court and obtain a pronouncement on the request
before the first hearing. Therefore, the court usually makes pronouncements on
parties’ additional requests during the first hearing.

14. The third, minor deviation from the procedure in the CPC is observed in terms of
the last court hearing when, upon the request of the parties, the court usually grants
them a short period of time (e.g. three to ten days) for the preparation of written notes.
The timeline for issuance of the court decision is not extended by the time granted to
parties for providing written notes but forms part thereof.1


1
  Even though Bulgarian legal theory (Jivko Stalev, Anelia Mingova, Ognyan Stamboliev, Valentina
Popova, Ruzha Ivanova, Bulgarian Civil Procedure Law, Ciela Norma AD, Sofia 2012, pp. 762 – 763)
does not consider that fast-track procedures are compatible with extra time for the preparation of
written notes, in practice this may often be necessary as the parties would get acquainted with some of
the evidence only at the last court hearing and may need time to comment on it.


                                                                                                    13
3.3.2. Timelines

15. The more serious deviation of the de facto from the de jure map of the
proceedings is in respect of timelines, particularly as regards Sofia Regional Court.
Indeed, the timelines applicable to judges are indicative but still interviewees indicate
that in Sofia deviations might be quite significant.

16. It appears from the interviews that in most courts in the country the court usually
reviews the claim on the day of filing (as required by law) or within the next two
days. In Sofia, this timeline is not observed. Moreover, it appears that in Sofia the
administrative processing of the case, from the day of filing until the day it reaches
the desk of the respective judge, is rather lengthy. Attorneys practicing in the capital
city share that finding out what number the case has been assigned and which judge
would hear it usually takes a week from filing the claim. The issues and possible
causes of these apparent difficulties in the administrative processing of cases in Sofia
Regional Court are discussed in a separate section of this report.

17. Judges in smaller regional courts are generally able to comply with the legal
requirement of scheduling the first open court hearing within three weeks of the report
on the case (procedural step No. 8, Table 1). For judges in larger regional courts, this
period may be extended to a month. In Sofia this timeline may be up to two-three
months.

18. It is difficult to assess the actual timelines for every single procedural step in the
fast-track procedure. However, court users noted that the first court hearing in most
towns is usually scheduled within two months of filing, whereas in Sofia, it is
normally scheduled approximately five months from filing the claim. This time period
factors in the time needed for service of the claim to the respondent, the one-month
timeline for the preparation of the response to the claim and the time period between
the judge’s report on the case and the scheduling of the first hearing.

19. It appears that first-instance labor cases outside of Sofia are generally completed
through one or two open court hearings. Court users report that in Sofia a case usually
takes two or three hearings to complete. The most important factor influencing the
number of hearings for solving a labor case appears to be the presence or absence of
the preliminary report on the case as required by Art. 312 (1) point 2 CPC. Thus,
judges from Sofia Regional Court who prepare such a report before the initial open
hearing are also generally able to complete a case within one to two hearings.
However, in those Sofia cases where the preliminary report is absent or is purely
formal, an additional hearing may be necessary.

20. Usually, an additional hearing is scheduled due to the need to appoint various
types of expert evaluations (e.g. an accounting evaluation), summon witnesses and
collect written evidence. Unlike the first hearing, there is no legal timeline for
scheduling a second hearing. Nevertheless, according to interviewed judges, if an
additional hearing proves necessary, it is usually scheduled sooner than a hearing in a
non-fast track civil case. The time period between two court hearings in a labor case
in courts countrywide appears to be approximately one month, whereas, in Sofia
Regional Court this period is usually longer, approximately 1.5 to 2 months.



                                                                                       14
Interviewees report that the total length of a first-instance labor case in Sofia is
approximately six months to one year. In other Bulgarian towns, a labor case may be
completed within two to four months.

21. The length of this particular procedure might have serious economic effects. First,
it keeps the dismissed employee in a state of insecurity that may affect his/her
decision on whether and when to start looking for a new job. Second, if the dismissal
proves to be illegal, the employer owes the employee compensation in the amount of
his/her monthly salary for each month after the dismissal within the first six months
following the dismissal. So the longer the case takes, the greater the cost to the
employer if it loses. Third, in case of an illegal dismissal, the employer owes the
employee social security payments from the date of dismissal until the date of
restoration to the previously held job, which in certain cases heard in Sofia might be a
very long time-period.

3.4. Service

22. Unlike other types of procedures, labor claims usually do not pose serious
difficulties in terms of service, not least because the respondents (employers) are
usually businesses and also the employee is well aware of their current address. The
service of the notice of restoration to work might pose certain difficulties in cases
when the employee wishes to avoid or delay it. This scenario will be discussed in
more detail below.

23. In Sofia Regional Court, fast-track procedures fall under the types of procedures
for which judges may order quick service by the Urgent Services Department, if they
establish that 10 days before a scheduled hearing the notice has not been served
properly and there is a risk for a postponement of the case for this reason. Thus, the
establishment of Urgent Services Department at Sofia Regional Court in 2011 may
have led to a reduction in the number of labor cases postponed due to failed service in
this court, assuming judges take sufficient advantage of this opportunity (this analysis
was not able to ascertain how frequently judges use this option for service in labor
cases).

3.5. Other issues (not related to discrepancies between the de jure and the de
facto map of the procedure)

24. Many of the difficulties judges and parties encounter in labor cases are not related
to deviations from the legally established procedure and therefore cannot be captured
in the comparison between the de jure and de facto maps. Some of the more serious
issues of this type are examined below.

3.5.1. Notice of restoration to work

25. One of the issues raised by interviewees in respect of labor claims relates to the
provision of Art. 345 of the Labor Code. Specifically, if a labor claim results in a
decision restoring the employee to his/her previous workplace, the court issues, in
addition to the court decision, a “notice of restoration to work”. The employee is
entitled to return to his/her previous job within two weeks of receiving that notice.



                                                                                     15
26. Interviewees share that this particular provision is sometimes abused. Specifically,
employees restored to their previous position can avoid service of the notice thus
postponing their return to work while at the same time benefiting from social security
payments. This situation is more serious in the jurisdiction of Sofia Regional Court.
Interviews indicate that unlike other courts in the country, Sofia Regional Court does
not serve the notice for restoration to work to the employee but rather leaves it to
him/her to go to the court and obtain it. This means that there might be a serious time
gap between the moment the court decision on a labor case becomes final and the
moment the employee returns to work. Currently, the employee has the opportunity to
substantially prolong this time period to the detriment of the employer, especially in
Sofia.

3.5.2. Provisions on selection under the Labor Code and court practice thereof

27. Other issues raised by interviewees relate to the provision of the Labor Code in
respect of selection. According to judges and court users, the provision under Article
329 of the Labor Code perhaps contributes the most to a cumbersome and lengthy
process of proof in a labor case. On its face, this provision gives employers the right,
in case of scaling down the enterprise, to select to dismiss employees whose positions
would not be abolished in order to keep employees who are better qualified or work
better. Even though the provision is framed in the interest of the employer, according
to an interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation2, the evaluation of the
employer as to who works better and is better qualified shall be subject to judicial
control.

28. As a result, a labor dismissal case involves a complex evaluation of whether
selection among employees should have been performed; the positions amongst
which the employer should have performed selection; as well as whether selection
had been properly carried out. This type of assessment includes an examination of the
various types of positions at an enterprise, including positions that may have different
job descriptions but share some common functions. This assessment needs to answer
the rather vague question whether the dismissed employee works better and is better
qualified than the employees whom the employer chose to keep. The evaluation
involves numerous proofs and is one of the main causes for prolongation of labor
cases. Many professionals interviewed for this report felt that judicial review of the
employer’s assessment of which employees to keep and which ones to dismiss
represents unwarranted interference in the private sector.3

3.5.3. Determination of the time-period of compensation for illegal dismissal

29. According to Art. 225 (1) of the Labor Code, in case of illegal dismissal, the
employee is entitled to compensation in the amount of his/her gross monthly
remuneration for the time-period of unemployment but no more than six months. In
Sofia, where a labor case usually lasts more than six months, an illegally dismissed
employee is owed the full six-month payment from the employer. In other regions of
2
 Interpretative Decision No. 3/2012 of the Supreme Court of Cassation.
3
 The Labor Code, initially adopted in 1986 and amended on numerous occasions, frequently came
under criticism. Many interviewees were of the opinion that the entire Code is outdated, not suited to a
market economy and failing to adequately regulate more recent types of labor arrangements such as
domestic assistants, small and middle-sized enterprises, house help, etc.


                                                                                                      16
Bulgaria however, such court cases would indeed be fast-track and would typically
last less than six months. As a result, the first-instance court decision in an illegal
dismissal case obligates the employer to pay compensation to the employee (assuming
the employee has not found new employment yet) from the date of dismissal until the
date of finalizing the discovery process in the case (i.e. the last court hearing).

30. However, it is quite probable that by the time the decision is issued, the employee
would not have found a new job. As a result, he/she has an incentive to appeal the
decision and request an increase of the compensation due to new circumstances (i.e.
the continued unemployment since the date of the last court hearing). Thus the labor
case would go to a second-instance court, which would increase the compensation
based on the actual time period of unemployment ensuing from the dismissal. This
appeal for the sake of updating the period of unemployment burdens the court system,
as well as the employer (who would have to bear also the expenses of the second-
instance case, if the employee is successful).4

3.5.4. Court experts

31. Another reason for delays and other difficulties in labor cases, as well as in most
civil litigation, is the role played by expert witnesses. Interviewed court users and
judges note that the lists of expert witnesses in Bulgarian courts are extremely
outdated. By law, they should be updated annually; however, updating is purely
formal. As a result, some experts included in the lists may be deceased, retired or not
sufficiently qualified. Therefore, if judges appoint a random expert from the list, they
run the risk of this person being unavailable or unqualified, causing serious
difficulties and delays in the process. To avoid this, judges tend to work repeatedly
with those experts they already know. This practice, in turn, has two undesirable side
effects: (1) it creates the perception of impropriety; and (2) the experts who are
preferred by judges are very busy, attend numerous hearings and this may lead to
difficulties in scheduling a case becoming another reason for postponement of a
hearing.

32. There has long been understanding that the system for court experts needs
fundamental reform. In 2012, MOJ attempted to replace Regulation No. 1/2008 on the
Registration, Qualification and Remuneration of Court Experts with a new one. The
replacement however, was repealed in 2014 by the Supreme Administrative Court due
to violations in the procedure for its adoption. As a result, the old Regulation is still
effective. Currently, MOJ is attempting to update the Regulation again. It has
published on its website a draft that raises experts’ remunerations and introduces
stricter deadlines for their payment. An interesting feature of the draft Regulation is
that it repeals the requirement for random selection of experts. Thus, MOJ legitimizes
the current practice of judges repeatedly choosing the same set of experts. At the same
time, MOJ has presented the draft Regulation as a temporary compromise with the
need to re-think conceptually the system. Therefore, it invites stakeholders to join a
working group, which would develop a new concept for a comprehensive reform of
expert evaluations in courts and, in the future, a new draft regulation.
4
  Additionally, judges in courts outside of Sofia feel that this particular issue has the effect of
punishing them for complying with the fast-track procedure because if the first-instance decision is
revised, this affects negatively their performance evaluation regardless of the fact that the decision had
been revised due to purely technical reasons.


                                                                                                        17
3.6. Costs

33. No court fees are due for labor cases in Bulgaria. Attorney fees are set by
negotiation whereas their minimum level is determined in a Tariff as illustrated in the
table below. Employees would often be charged the minimum fee whereas employers
may be charged any fee that they negotiate with their attorney. If however the
employee loses the labor case, he/she would have to pay the expenses made by the
other party, including the attorney fees. If the court considers this fee to be excessive,
it may reduce it.

3.7. Recommendations

34. To improve the processing of fast-track labor cases in Bulgaria, the following
measures could be taken:

    1) Preliminary report: Ensuring that a preliminary report is prepared on every
       occasion and that the report is not formalistic but comprehensive. This would
       help reduce the number of hearings necessary to complete a labor case. This
       recommendation is applicable to Sofia Regional Court in particular, as the
       other courts reviewed for this study generally appear to comply with this
       procedural step.
    2) Scheduling hearings: Currently, the law provides for a timeline only for the
       scheduling of the first hearing on a labor case. It is advisable to specify a
       timeline for scheduling subsequent court hearings for fast track proceedings,
       possibly through court practice or via future legislative amendments.
    3) Notice of restoration to work: Ensuring that notices of restoration to work are
       served ex officio to the employee if the dismissal is declared illegal,
       specifically in Sofia Regional Court. Consider the introduction of a timeline,
       from the moment the court decision enters into force, beyond which the time
       period for returning to work would commence and the accrual of social
       security benefits would cease regardless of whether notice of restoration has
       been served. The employee has initiated the case, so he/she should have legal
       interest in following its development, including the entry of the decision into
       force.
    4) Time period of compensation for illegal dismissal: With regard to appeals of
       first-instance court decisions for the sole reason of updating the time-period of
       compensation, explore further, at the appellate level, how often this is the
       reason for appeal. If it is frequent, legislative amendments should be initiated



                                                                                         18
         that address the issue of how to update the period of unemployment without
         having to resort to a second-instance court.
      5) Expert evaluations: The regulation on expert evaluations needs profound
         reform.
      6) Labor Code provisions: With regard to the provisions of the Labor Code on
         selection in case of dismissal, further research may be needed into how they
         are applied and whether the interpretative decision answers all questions. The
         development of a new Labor Code that is appropriate to the economic reality
         of Bulgaria should be considered


4. Procedure for Issuance of Enforcement Order

35. The procedure for issuance of enforcement order aims at creating a possibility to
quickly obtain a writ of execution whenever a debtor does not contest a claim. This
procedure represents a significant share of the total number of civil cases in regional
courts in Bulgaria. In 2014, such cases amounted to 52% of all civil cases at regional
courts in district towns and 49 % of all civil cases in the other regional courts. Of all
procedures for issuance of enforcement orders countrywide, about 30% take place at
SRC (as well as 30% of all civil cases).5

36. The procedure is subdivided into two distinct types: (1) procedure for the issuance
of enforcement order under Art 410 of CPC; and (2) procedure for issuance of
enforcement order based on a document under Art. 417 of CPC. These two types of
procedures shall be described separately below.

4.1. Short overview of the procedure under Art. 410 CPC

37. The procedure for issuance of enforcement order under Art. 410 of CPC allows
for a facilitated path for obtaining a writ of execution whenever a debtor does not
contest a claim. This procedure is applicable to claims for monetary takings or
fungible goods that would be under the jurisdiction of regional courts (i.e. that have a
value below BGN 25 000), as well as claims for transfer of movables that the debtor
has obtained under an obligation to return or that have been pledged as collateral. This
procedure is used on a mass scale by utility providers, quick credit firms, as well as
many other classes of creditors. It is frequently used for relatively small claims.

38. The implementation of this procedure can take many different routes. The
principal ones are illustrated in Graph 2. For the purposes of this short overview, only
the most common implementation path of the procedure is described. Details on
issues that may arise and on deviations from the legally established procedural steps
and timelines shall be discussed in subsequent subsections.

39. The procedure commences with a request by the creditor filed with the regional
court. The content of the request is standardized as per a form approved by MOJ and
used nationwide. Even though the form is simple and could be filled out by laymen,
most claimants prefer to use the services of an attorney. This raises the cost of the

                                                                                      19
procedure (initially for the creditor, and later on, upon successful enforcement, for the
debtor).

40. Once a request for issuance of enforcement order is filed, the court should
examine it within 3 days of filing in order to verify that it meets the formal
requirements. If these are met, the court issues the order and it is served to the debtor.
Upon service, the debtor has 2 weeks to file an objection. There is no need to provide
any reasons or attach any proofs to the objection. If an objection is not filed, the
enforcement order enters into force and a writ of execution is issued. If an objection is
filed, the court gives the creditor one month to launch a full-blown court claim for
ascertaining his claim. Not filing the claim within the deadline would lead to
nullification of the order. On the other hand, if a claim is filed, the issued enforcement
order would have to wait for the outcome of the case before entering into force.

4.3. Short overview of procedure under Art. 417 of the CPC

41. The procedure under Art. 417 of CPC allows the creditor, who can prove his
claim with a certain type of document (notary deeds, bank documents, promissory
notes, etc.) to file a request with the court, attaching the specific evidentiary


                                                                                                      22
document, and ask that the court issue an enforcement order and writ of execution
allowing immediate execution in respect of debtor’s property. In this case there is no
limit on the monetary amount of the enforcement order. Hence, very large sums (e.g.
receivables under bank credits) can be collected in this manner.

42. Unlike the procedure for issuance of enforcement order under Art. 410, in the
procedure under Art. 417 the debtor is informed about the order only when execution
commences. If the debtor objects to the claim, this will not stop the execution unless
the claim is based on a promissory note or the debtor provides monetary guarantee or
convincing proof that the amount in question is not due. Regardless of the fact that
objection in this case generally does not stop execution, if it is made by the debtor, the
court would instruct the creditor to file a regular civil claim. If in the framework of
that regular civil claim the debtor succeeds in proving that the amounts are not due,
the court will issue a reverse writ of execution enabling the debtor to collect back
from the creditor the amounts that have been taken from him/her in the course of the
execution.

43. There is a heated debate in Bulgaria’s legal system about this enforcement order
procedure. It is often viewed as contradicting the European Convention of Human
Rights. On the other hand, institutional creditors hail its efficacy. The conceptual
debate on this provision falls outside the purpose and scope of this report, which shall
examine solely the process for implementing the legal procedure.

4.5. Comparison between the de jure and the de facto map of the procedures
under Art. 410 and Art. 417 CPC

4.5.1. Procedural steps

44. There are no major differences between the de jure and the de facto maps of the
above procedures in terms of number and type of procedural steps. Nevertheless,
there are certain distinct and diverse practices in the application of the procedures,
which shall be described below.

4.5.1.1. Attaching documents to the request for issuance of enforcement order
under Art. 410

45. Despite the standardized form for requesting enforcement order under Art. 410,
there are discrepancies in claimants’ practices. Some file only the completed form.
Others attach all the supporting evidence to the request form. The latter practice,
albeit very common, might represent an unnecessary effort on the part of claimants.
Interviews with judges indicate that in deciding on the request, judges generally do
not examine evidence, even if attached. This is in line with Interpretative Decision of
the Supreme Court of Cassation No. 4/2014, point 2b, according to which the court
may not derive information from the attached documents and all material
circumstances should be indicated in the request itself. On the other hand, interviews
indicate that judges in smaller courts with lesser caseload may examine evidence, if
attached. Additionally, some lawyers note that they would be more inclined to advise
their clients who are debtors to file an objection against an order, if upon reviewing
the case they notice that no evidence has been attached.

4.5.1.2. Jurisdictional checks

46. According to the law, the permanent address or the seat of the debtor determines
territorial jurisdiction in this procedure. Hence, when a request for issuance of
enforcement order under Art. 410 or Art. 417 is filed, some judges have instructed
their clerks to verify the permanent address of the debtor. Others judges do not make
this preliminary check and issue an enforcement order based on the address specified
in the request. Some courts have uniform practices in this respect (i.e. all judges in the


                                                                                       26
respective court either make or do not make a check) and in other courts the practice
is up to the discretion of individual judges (i.e. some judges in the court make the
check, others don’t and yet others request the check only occasionally).

47. Additionally, the jurisdictional check is more cumbersome in courts with larger
caseload (it is carried out by particular officials who have access to the civil
registration database) and easier in courts with smaller caseload. In the courts where
the check is cumbersome, performing it means that the judge may fail to make a
pronouncement on the request within the 3-day timeline required by law.

48. According to Interpretative Decision No. 4/2014 of SCC, point 3a, in cases where
the court does not check jurisdiction in advance and proceeds to issue enforcement
order solely on the basis on the information stated in the request, the issued order
would be valid and may not be nullified even if it turns out that the debtor has its seat
or residence elsewhere. This provision of the Interpretative Decision, coupled with the
fact that some courts/judges do not check the address of the debtor in advance, creates
opportunities for forum shopping on the part of claimants.

49. Currently, there is an incentive for forum shopping predominantly for claimants
whose cases fall within the territorial jurisdiction of Sofia Regional Court, which
routinely takes several months longer than other courts to make its pronouncements
on requests for issuance of enforcement orders. Interviews suggest that forum
shopping is still limited; however, given that it was enabled by the Interpretative
Decision in mid-2014, it could intensify, if significant differences in timelines for
reviewing requests for enforcement orders remain between Sofia and the rest of
Bulgaria. On one hand, forum shopping in this case has the somewhat positive effect
of distributing caseload more evenly among regional courts. On the other hand, it is
an undesirable practice as it represents a form of circumvention of the law.

4.5.1.3. Providing instructions to the claimant for corrections to the request
under Art. 410

50. According to Interpretative Decision No. 4/2014 of SCC, the court should provide
instructions to the claimant for correcting the request only if the claimant has not used
the standardized form or in case a larger court fee is required. In all other cases of
mistakes and omissions in the request, judges should refuse to issue an enforcement
order. However, some judges feel that it is not acceptable to reject the request if the
omission is minor and easily fixable and the claimant has paid a large court fee.
Therefore, in some instances, judges may provide correction instructions despite the
opinion of the Supreme Court of Cassation as stated in the Interpretative Decision.

4.5.1.4. Original documents under Art. 417 CPC

51. There are some divergent practices in cases where the claimant under Art. 417
CPC has not attached to the request the originals of the document that is the basis for
which immediate enforcement is sought. It appears that in these cases most judges
would issue the enforcement order stating therein that a writ of execution may only be
obtained upon presentation of the original; however, other judges may refuse to issue
the order or may instruct the creditor to provide the original document before
proceeding to issuing the order.


                                                                                      27
4.5.1.5. Reverse writ of execution

52. In cases where the court has issued an order for immediate enforcement under Art.
417 CPC which is then rejected by a decision in a civil case under Art. 422, the court
shall issue a reverse writ of execution enabling the debtor to restore the amounts
already collected. There are some divergent practices in respect to the amount under
that reverse writ of execution. It appears that most judges follow strictly the provision
of Art. 245 (3) of CPC and issue the reverse writ only for the actual amounts collected
from the debtor. On the other hand, other judges add to those amounts the interest
from the time of collection of the funds until the time of returning them.

4.5.2. Timelines

53. The main deviations of the de facto from the de jure map arise in respect to the
timelines within which judges perform individual procedural steps. Judges noted that
they review requests for the issuance of enforcement orders under Art. 417 and Art.
410 in the same document track and generally pronouncements can be expected
within the same time limits. At the same time, the review of requests under Art. 417 is
generally more time-consuming for judges since they need to review the documentary
basis for the claim in addition to the request. The result may be that pronouncements
under Art. 417 CPC are issued a little later than pronouncements under Art. 410 but
the differences between the timelines of the two procedures are not substantial.

54. The comparison between the de jure and de facto timelines of the procedures
indicates that the deviations from the legally specified timeline in courts other than
Sofia Regional Court are negligible. In Sofia Regional Court, however, these
deviations are severe. For example, interviewees indicate that the pronouncement on
the request for issuance of an enforcement order, which by law should happen within
three days from filing the request, in Sofia takes on the average between one and three
months. In some extreme examples, the delay may be up to 5 months. Also, in Sofia
Regional Court there appear to be significant differences in the time period for the
issuance of the order among individual judges. In other regional courts the same
pronouncement takes approximately one week, or two-weeks if the court has a large
caseload.

55. The main reason for the delay in processing enforcement orders in Sofia Regional
Court is its extreme caseload. Currently 72 judges in this court work on enforcement
orders. These judges do not deal solely with this type of cases but also with many
other civil cases. In 2014, each of these judges had a monthly caseload of
approximately 56 cases for issuance of enforcement orders. In terms of total caseload,
in 2014, each judge at Sofia Regional Court had a monthly caseload of 124 cases
whereas nationwide the average monthly caseload per judge for regional courts in
district towns was 59 cases and the average caseload per judge in other regional
courts was 33 cases.6

4.6. Service

56. There is no legal timeline for serving the enforcement order to the debtor.
Therefore, technically, no discrepancies between de jure and de facto timelines in this
respect can be identified. Also, service is usually not an issue under Art. 417 since it
is done by enforcement agents and not by court staff and, additionally, in the case of
Art. 417 entry into force of the enforcement order is immediate and not dependent on
service.

57. However, service of the enforcement order is by far the most serious delaying
factor in the procedure under Art. 410 CPC. Service of the order under Art. 410 CPC
is of crucial importance for the further development of this procedure because service
sets into motion the two-week period for contesting the claim, upon the expiration of
which the enforcement order would enter into force.

58. When attempting service, clerks should visit the address specified in the request
for issuance of the order at least three times within a month. If service is unsuccessful,
the documents are returned to the judge who should instruct the clerk how to proceed.
In the procedure for issuance of enforcement order, it is usually at this point that
judges ascertain the debtor’s permanent address. If it differs from the address in the
request, the judge instructs the service clerk to serve at the permanent address. If the
two addresses coincide, or service to the permanent address has also proven
unsuccessful, the judge instructs the service clerk to stick a notice on the debtor’s
door. In this case the order would enter into force one month after sticking the notice
(comprising the two-week period during which the debtor could visit the court to
obtain the document and the subsequent two-week period for filing an objection).

59. There are slight discrepancies in the manner in which judges organize service of
documents, in the case where the address specified in the request differs from the
permanent address of the debtor. As noted above, in cases where there has been no
preliminary jurisdictional check, service is attempted to the address pointed out in the
request and if it fails, the permanent address is obtained. However, in cases where the
preliminary check is done from the very beginning, there are still discrepancies. If the
check establishes a difference between the address in the request and the permanent
address, some judges instruct service clerks to first attempt serving to the address in
the request and later on, if that fails, to the permanent address. In contrast, other
judges require service clerks to try serving to both addresses from the outset.

60. Both the practice of visiting the address three times to verify that the order cannot
be served, and the practice of sticking a notice on the door of the debtor give rise to
some controversy. With regard to the three visits to the debtor’s address, some
attorneys believe that there are no effective ways of ascertaining that these three visits
have indeed been made by the service clerk. When reporting to the judge, the clerk
usually specifies the dates of the visits, and, more rarely, the time and the particular
circumstances of the visit. Sticking a notice on the door also gives rise to controversy
as doors are not always accessible and, in addition, third persons could easily remove
the notice before the debtor has had a chance to see it. On the other hand, especially in
cases where the debtor tries to avoid service, these methods may be the only way to
move forward.



                                                                                       29
61. It is difficult to estimate the average time periods for service of enforcement
orders under Art. 410. Very roughly, in Sofia, where the procedure is the most
problematic, interviewees report that service takes a minimum of two months, not
least because many debtors deliberately try to avoid it. In other courts’ regions,
service takes up to a month with it being slightly slower in Varna, Plovdiv and in
small villages, in which courts rely on mayors to perform service.

4.7. Other issues (not related to discrepancies between the de jure and the de
facto map of the procedure)

62. Many interviewees were concerned about the frequent and at times frivolous
objections against enforcement orders. It was difficult to ascertain what percentage of
debtors object to the orders (with responses, based on interviewees’ personal practice,
ranging from 10% to 90% of debtors). Nevertheless when such objections are
frivolous, they not only can burden the courts with a full-blown civil case later on but
also can lead to an exponential increase in the costs of the procedures, which are first
born by the creditor, and later, only upon successful execution, by the debtor.

4.8. Costs

63. Overall, the procedures for issuance of enforcement orders can be quite costly,
especially when court fees, attorney’s fees and subsequent enforcement agents’ fees
are factored in.7 Annex 1 provides detailed information on the cost of the procedures
per the respective regulations (the Tariff for attorneys’ fees specifies what the
minimum amounts should be but there is no obstacle for attorneys and clients to
negotiate higher fees, which the debtor would have to pay upon enforcement). Annex
2 comprises specific examples of how these provisions would translate into the costs
of claims with specific values. The table below illustrates the costs of the procedure
for issuance of enforcement order and the subsequent execution for a claim of BGN
500.

  The costs are estimated under the assumption that creditors would choose to enforce using a private
enforcement agent. Private enforcement agents started operating in Bulgaria based on the Private
Enforcement Agents Act of 2005. They carry out all execution against debtors’ property, including
service of documents in the framework of the execution. An enforcement agent is engaged by the
creditor once he/she obtains a writ of execution. The creditor can choose between private and state
enforcement agents, whereas state enforcement agents’ fees are lower. If execution is successful, all
costs incurred by the creditor in relation to the execution are collected from the debtor.


                                                                                                    30

Total                                                                            BGN 1110

* If the debtor pays after the service of the invitation for voluntary performance and within the
two-week period for voluntary performance, no private enforcement agent’s fee shall be due on
the paid amount (per amendments ot the Tarriff of Private Enforcement Agents, effective as of 1
August 2014).



64. As illustrated in the above table, if the procedure for issuance of enforcement
order goes through all possible stages of its development, including objection of the
debtor and subsequent civil claim to ascertain the receivable, the amount of the costs
would increase exponentially and especially for small claims may well exceed the
value of the claim. For example, for a claim with a value of BGN 500, the cumulative
costs for all the stages of the procedure would be approximately BGN 1110 (that is, if
the attorney has received the minimum remuneration per the Tariff), which is more
than double the amount of the initial claim. On the other hand, if the debtor does not
object and pays voluntarily at the point of receiving the invitation for voluntary
performance, he/she would owe BGN 565 less in costs to the creditor, though the
debtor would still owe more in fees (BGN 545) than the debt itself. This is a very
telling illustration of the importance of avoiding frivolous objections by debtors.

65. One important feature of the court fees for the procedure for issuance of an
enforcement order is that these fees are not cost-based. Specifically, the examination
and the pronouncement on the request for issuance of an order under Art. 410 CPC,
for example, may take an average of half an hour of a judge’s time (since judges
review only the standardized form) and a pronouncement under Art. 417 CPC perhaps
double that time (because of the need to also review the attached documents).
Additionally, the effort needed for both procedures does not depend on the value of
the claim. Nevertheless, the court fee for both types of procedures is 2% of the value
of the claim.

66. On the other hand, the cost of the procedure for issuance of enforcement order and
the cost of the full-blown civil claim to ascertain the receivable in case of objection
are the same (2% of the value of the claim each) even though the former procedure
involves a desk review of the document(s) and drafting of the order whereas the latter
entails one or more open court hearings and all other steps typical for a court trial and
is thus much more burdensome to the court.
4.9. Recommendations

67. The mapping process identified numerous discrepancies in practice related to the
procedure for issuance of enforcement order. While most interviewees welcomed the
Interpretative Decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation that clarified many
questions raised by this procedure, many believed that there are still questions that
remain unanswered. The recommendations below will not address each and every one
of the key findings above but only the ones that are significant or not adressed by the
Interpretative Decision. However, it is important to keep in mind that future
interpretative decisions might be necessary in order to introduce further uniformity in
this procedure.



                                                                                              31
1) Jurisdictional checks: It is important to have clear guidelines at individual
   courts of when such checks should be done. Leaving such checks to the
   discretion of individual judges at the respective court could create perception
   of impropriety. At the same time, any practice of jurisdictional checks should
   take into account the time it takes to do the check at the individual court and
   whether it would affect the possibility to meet the legal timeline for
   pronouncement on the request for enforcement order. At courts where no such
   checks are performed, a mechanism could be introduced for tracking instances
   where jurisdiction was wrong and what had been the correct jurisdiction. If the
   mechanism demonstrates that the court is used for forum shopping, then it
   may be helpful to introduce jurisdictional checks. Ideally, a nationwide
   uniform practice in this respect would be the most appropriate solution.
2) Service of enforcement orders under Art. 410: In order to better protect
   debtors’ interests and to alleviate their doubts of impropriety of service,
   introduce a routine practice of describing circumstances of all three attempts
   to visit a debtor’s address, including time, etc., as well as requiring a
   description of the circumstances surrounding the placing of a note at the
   debtor’s address.
3) Frequency of objections: In order to develop a policy of addressing the issue
   of frivolous objections, it would be important to track statistically the
   approximate percentage of objections to enforcement orders. To do that, there
   needs to be a technological possibility for checking the number of cases under
   Art. 422 of CPC (the civil claim for ascertaining a receivable, which follows
   an objection) and under Art. 423 CPC (the civil claim for ascertaining a
   receivable, which follows a delayed objection before the second-instance court
   due to improper service). Comparing the number of such claims with the
   number of procedures under Art. 410 and 417 CPC (which form part of the
   official court statistics currently) would bring clarity with regard to the ratio of
   enforcement orders that are objected to annually, together with potential
   regional differences in that ratio. If the number of objections is significant, as
   interviews suggest, it would be necessary to work on discouraging frivolous
   objections. One way to achieve this would be to revise the standardized
   objections form, which is sent to the debtor ex officio together with the
   enforcement order. While it is commendable that the debtor is provided
   assistance in objecting to the order, it is also important that he/she understands
   the implications of an objection, especially in terms of costs. Introducing
   explanations of the consequences of objecting in the standardized form would
   be reasonable.
4) Costs: A revision to the court fees tariff could be considered to increase the
   difference in costs between the procedure for enforcement order and a
   subsequent civil claim (e.g., a 1 - 3 % fee differential rather than the existing
   2% and 2% charges). If this is done, the costs may more adequately reflect the
   effort of the court in each of the procedures. Additionally, the lower fee for
   issuing the enforcement order would leave the debtor with less of a financial
   burden if he/she pays at the stage of issuance of an enforcement order without
   resorting to objection. This change also could serve to discourage frivolous
   objections. The tariff of minimum attorneys’ fees could also be revised to
   mirror the court fees ratio between the procedure for issuance of the
   enforcement order and the subsequent civil claim by reflecting the spread of
   the effort between these two types of procedures and the nature of Art. 422

5. Key findings and recommendations regarding Sofia Regional Court

68. The mapping of the above two court procedures in Bulgaria found that timelines
in Sofia Regional Court are drastically different from timelines in other regional
courts in Bulgaria. Therefore, this court warrants special attention, especially in light
of the fact that the Sofia Regional Court hears approximately 30% of all first-instance
cases in Bulgaria.8
5.1. Key findings

69. There are numerous reasons for the dramatically different timelines in Sofia
Regional Court as compared to the rest of the country. Some of these are:

    1) Caseload: It has long been common knowledge that judges in this court have a
       caseload that drastically exceeds the caseload of other regional judges.
       Additionally, the court works with many fewer judges than approved judicial
       positions. Of the 171 approved positions for magistrates in Sofia Regional
       Court, 13 positions have not been filled yet and other 20 magistrates have
       been seconded to other courts.9
    2) Internal processes: It appears that the slow movement of cases at Sofia
       Regional Court is related not only to the large caseload of judges but also to
       the movement of documents and processes within the court. The slow pace at
       which filed claims obtain a case number or at which enforcement orders under
       Art 410 CPC that have entered into force result in writs of execution, are only
       few of the examples that have led court users to believe that there is a
       significant delay in reporting by the court administration to the respective
       judge. It appears that this delay is not necessarily due to an insufficient
       number of court clerks since the ratio of court clerks / magistrates in this court
       is a little higher than the average for regional courts in district towns10.
       Therefore, it may be that the very scale of the court makes logistics more
       cumbersome than elsewhere.
    3) Information systems: The court uses different systems for different types of
       cases, which creates difficulties, including with regard to processing
       information for the needs of the servicing department.
    4) Building: For many years the court has been housed in a building that could
       not meet its needs in terms of courtrooms, judges’ offices and administrative
       premises. In 2015, the Civil Division of the court was moved to a new
       building and the old building is currently used only by the Criminal Division,
       which is also expected to move to larger premises in the future. The move has
       provided sufficient space to the Civil Division but has created new, possibly
       temporary, difficulties ensuing from the process of transition and the fact that

                                                                                      33
        as a result of the move, the court functions in the two buildings while sharing
        a single administration.
     5) Service of process: Service of process in the jurisdiction of the Sofia Regional
        Court is slower than elsewhere in the country. These problems are largely due
        to the volume of work. According to the administration of the court, its 95
        service clerks perform approximately 630 000 services per year. In an attempt
        to optimize this activity, in the beginning of 2011, the court established an
        Urgent Services Department. Currently 15 clerks (out of the 95 total) work in
        that department and carry out service of process to entities with numerous
        cases in the courts (e.g. banks and utility companies), as well as service which
        has been marked by judges as “urgent” 11 . In 2014, the Urgent Services
        Department was responsible for serving a total of 346 061 notices of which
        3690 were “Urgent” and the rest were served to the so-called “large
        requestors”. The fact that 15 persons have been able to serve approximately
        50% of the notices in the court, leaving the remaining 80 service clerks to
        carry out service of the other 50% (approximately. 3500 services per year per
        service clerk) indicates that the specialization introduced through the creation
        of this department may have led to efficiencies. On the other hand, the 80
        service clerks who are not within the Urgent Services Department could
        perhaps deal better with the remaining approximately 50% of services. By
        way of comparison, the Regional Court in Blagoevgrad reports that its 3
        service clerks serve approximately 36 000 notices per year (approximately
        12000 services per service clerk). There was no opportunity to explore in more
        detail the ratio between the number of service clerks and the number of
        services per year in other Bulgarian courts but the comparison above suggests
        that difficulties in service in Sofia may be due not only or not mainly to
        insufficient staff numbers.
     6) Access to information: Court users overwhelmingly agree that access to
        information on cases in Sofia Regional Court is difficult and usually requires a
        personal visit to the court. The court has continuously worked to improve its
        website and provide easier access to information but is still perceived as
        lagging behind many other courts in the country in this respect.
5.2. Recommendations

70. To address the above issues that are specific for Sofia Regional Court, special
attention should be given to this court by taking the following measures:

     1) The caseload of the judges in the court should be brought down to as close to
        the national average as possible by making sure that the number of judges
        actually working at the court corresponds to the number of approved positions.
        This issue should be addressed by both holding competitions for the
        appointment of new judges and limiting the practice of removing judges from
        this court through judicial secondments (as proposed by the draft amendments
        to the Judicial System Act prepared by MOJ).
     2) Improve work processes of service clerks of the court to match work processes
        used by the Urgent Services Department.

11
   An example of urgent service are cases where a fast-track procedure is scheduled and 10-days before
the court hearing the judge finds that service has been irregular, which usually leads to postponement
of the hearing.


                                                                                                   34
3) Improve information available via the website of the court and the conditions
   for viewing documents and requesting information at the courthouses.
4) The Inspectorate at the Supreme Judicial Council should play a key role in
   improving the overall work processes at Sofia Regional Court. According to
   interviews, an inspection of the Court was completed recently and the results
   should be announced in due course. Hopefully, this report will comprise
   recommendations for improving work processes. Given the special
   circumstances under which the Court has operated in recent years (insufficient
   space and, later on, moving to new premises), it would be important to carry
   out a subsequent check in a year’s time. If within a year from the move to new
   premises, the timelines at the Sofia Regional Court are not the same as, or
   very close to, national averages (up till now the Court had good reasons for
   some of the inefficiencies), it would be important to launch a comprehensive
   project to examine internal work processes at this Court and prepare and
   implement a detailed action plan to improve internal functioning and user
   experience.
