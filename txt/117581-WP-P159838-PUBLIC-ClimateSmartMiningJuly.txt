       Foreword
     There is growing awareness that human activities are having a major impact on the
     earth’s ecosphere—so much so that many are now defining a new geological era: the
     Anthropocene, a time when humans have become the driving force in the earth’s physical
     changes. With the global human population expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050,
     urbanization, access to energy, infrastructure development, and poverty reduction will
     result in an unprecedented strain on our planet’s natural resources and environment. Given
     the long-term risk this presents for development, the World Bank continues to champion
     an integrated approach for sustainable development, including low carbon development
     strategies, renewable energy, and resilient cities and landscapes.

     As part of the transition to a low carbon economy, we are already seeing a remarkable
     growth in renewable energy technologies, now accounting for about 17% of global energy
     consumption. The need to meet future energy demands, while striving for a low carbon
     future, is not however immaterial.

     An impressive range of analysis covering the science and viability of response measures,
     including both adaptation to the impacts of climate change and measures to mitigate
     Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, was undertaken when more than 170 countries signed
     on to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in 2015. Mitigation issues typically covered
     the economic, policy, technology, and sustainability implications of reducing GHG
     emissions. However, relatively little analysis was conducted on the material implications of a
     carbon-constrained future.

     This is why it is important to explore and analyze the implications of the rapid uptake of
     climate-friendly technologies for commodity demand and the mineral resources required to
     manufacture these new technologies.

     With the release of “The Growing Role of Minerals for a Low Carbon Future,” the
     World Bank is contributing towards ensuring that this topic is given its rightful place in
     understanding the implications of a carbon constrained future.

     Based on climate and technology scenarios developed out of the International Energy
     Agency’s (IEA) Energy Technology Perspective, the Bank developed a set of commodities
     demand projections up to 2050. We did so by providing best estimates on the level of uptake
     of three discrete climate-friendly technologies—wind, solar, and energy storage batteries—
     required to help meet three different global warming scenarios of 2ºC, 4ºC, and 6ºC.

     “The Growing Role of Minerals for a Low Carbon Future” is intended to spark a more
     focused and coherent dialogue around the opportunities and challenges for the mining and
     metals industry in a carbon-constrained future. Certainly there are many technology-related
     issues that await further analysis, including analyzing the impact on mineral demand on a
     broader scope of carbon-constrained technologies than are studied in this report and the
     impact of recycling on extractives.

Another benefit of this analysis was to provide a critical space for opening a dialogue
between the climate, clean energy, and extractive industries constituencies. For too
long the dynamic between these groups has been predominated by polarization
and characterizations that have turned out to be self-defeating, particularly when it
comes to developing coherent climate and sustainable development policies that are
effectively aligned with a given country’s development plans. This lesson now needs to be
communicated and integrated at the national level: mineral resource development as a
complement and not competitor, to a greener, more sustainable future.

        Executive Summary
       Climate and greenhouse gas (GHG) scenarios have typically paid scant attention to the
       metal implications necessary to realize a low/zero carbon future. The 2015 Paris Agreement
       on Climate Change indicates a global resolve to embark on development patterns that
       would significantly be less GHG intensive. One might assume that nonrenewable resource
       development and use will also need to decline in a carbon-constrained future. This report
       tests that assumption, identifies those commodities implicated in such a scenario and
       explores ramifications for relevant resource-rich developing countries.

       Using wind, solar, and energy storage batteries as proxies, the study examines which metals
       will likely rise in demand to be able to deliver on a carbon-constrained future. Metals which
       could see a growing market include aluminum (including its key constituent, bauxite),
       cobalt, copper, iron ore, lead, lithium, nickel, manganese, the platinum group of metals,
       rare earth metals including cadmium, molybdenum, neodymium, and indium—silver, steel,
       titanium and zinc. The report then maps production and reserve levels of relevant metals
       globally, focusing on implications for resource-rich developing countries. It concludes by
       identifying critical research gaps and suggestions for future work.

       The report first develops a framework for estimating mineral demand in a low carbon future.
       The World Bank, in collaboration with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM),
       commissioned a predictive analysis of future metals demand to support the transition to a
       low carbon future, using the International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Perspectives
       2016,1 which focus on the renewable technology implications of meeting 2°C (2DS), 4°C (4DS)
       and 6°C (6DS) global temperature increase goals. Renewable energy generation (including
       hydropower and biomass) increases in the three climate scenarios from 14% of the current
       energy mix to 18% in the 6DS scenario, and a high of 44% in the 2DS scenario.

       The study focuses on wind, solar, and energy storage batteries as they are commonly
       recognized as key elements in delivering future energy needs at low/zero GHG emission
       levels. That said, we recognize that many other technologies and transmission modes are
       necessary for meeting the strong climate commitments made at Paris, covering power,
       transportation, buildings, industry, and land use management sectors. We intend, through
       this exercise, to engender a broader discussion on this critical issue, recognizing that many
       other technologies and transmission systems need to be covered.

       The next step addresses what materials are required in the scaled-up production of these
       technologies and to what degree will that demand be driven by a range of the global
       climate scenarios of 2DS, 4DS and 6DS. The report clearly shows that the technologies
       assumed to populate the clean energy shift—wind, solar, hydrogen, and electricity
       systems—are in fact significantly MORE material intensive in their composition than
       current traditional fossil-fuel-based energy supply systems. Precise estimates on the actual
       demand for metals is predicated by at least two independent variables: the extent to which
       the global community of nations actually succeeds in meeting its long-term Paris climate
       goals and the nature of intra-technology choices. In other words, for example, not only
       is it a function of how many wind turbines, solar panels, and low emission road vehicles




xii	
will be deployed, but which wind, solar technologies, and zero/low emission vehicles will
dominate.

The research also indicates that the low carbon technology requirements, and hence
relevant metals demand, rises rapidly between the 4DS and 2DS scenarios. The most
significant example of this being electric storage batteries, where the rise in relevant
metals—aluminum, cobalt, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, and nickel—grow in demand
from a relatively modest level under 4DS to more than 1000 percent under 2DS.

As a last step, the report examines how resource-rich developing countries might best
position themselves to take advantage of the evolving commodities market responding
to a low carbon energy transition. Nonrenewable mineral resources play a dominant role
in 81 countries that collectively account for a quarter of world GDP, half of the world’s
population, and nearly 70 percent of those in extreme poverty.2 As a result, a growing
number of low-income countries focus on resource extraction and processing activities as
fundamental to their economic growth plans. Such investments carry significant up-front
capital costs, with key assumptions about the longevity of relevant commodities often
reaching out more than half a century (due to the typical life span of mines).

It is important that developing countries become better positioned to decide how to take
advantage of the future commodities market responding to climate goals and related
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The report provides a comprehensive series of
global commodity maps tracking known production levels and reserves of the metals, as
noted above, that are assumed to play a potentially prominent role in the energy shift to a
carbon-constrained future.

The shift to low carbon energy will produce global opportunities with respect to a number
of minerals. The Latin America region (Chile, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and potentially
Bolivia) is in an excellent position to supply the global climate-friendly energy transition.
The region has a key strategic advantage in copper, iron ore, silver, lithium, aluminum,
nickel, manganese, and zinc. Africa, with its reserves in platinum, manganese, bauxite, and
chromium, should also serve as a burgeoning market for these resources.

With respect to Asia, the most notable finding is the global dominance China enjoys
on metals—both base and rare earth—required to supply technologies in a carbon-
constrained future. Both production and reserve levels, even when compared with resource-
rich developed countries (such as Canada and the United States, and to a lesser extent
Australia) often dwarf others. India is dominant in iron and steel and titanium, and Indonesia
has opportunities with bauxite and nickel, as does Malaysia and Philippines—with cobalt—
to a lesser extent. Finally, in Oceania, the massive reserves of nickel to be found in New
Caledonia should not be overlooked.

The research showed that significant gaps exist in providing current and robust data on
mapping relevant mineral/metal resources in developing country regions (Africa, Latin
America, and Asia). Also notable are anomalies in the geographical distribution of key
metals regarding production activities vs. reserve levels. For example, with respect to
bauxite, developing countries (without China) represent only 30% of bauxite production, but

       represent 63% of global reserves. In the case of Africa (Guinea), it represents just 6.5% of
       global production, but 26% of known reserves.

       In its concluding section, the report provides a series of recommendations regarding areas
       for further research or that fall into two categories: policy and technological.

       Policy-related areas of inquiry include the following:

       ◗◗ Implications for future environmental and material impact performance. Studies on
          commodity implications of a carbon-constrained future typically focus on current reserves
          and the relative level of availability and access to materials to supply clean technology
          production scenarios. However, there is also an increasing sensitivity that supplying
          clean technologies required for a carbon-constrained future could create a new suite
          of challenges for the sustainable development of minerals and resources. A dialogue is
          required at the national and civil society levels within resource-rich developing countries,
          between the mining–metals and climate–environmental–clean-energy constituencies, to
          develop a path forward that aligns a potential growing market for key commodities with
          a sustainable future.

       ◗◗ Mapping minerals in developing countries. There is a significant gap in data and mineral
          mapping in many developing country regions, particularly Africa. Capacity in this area is
          critical for resource-rich developing countries to best benefit from potential economic
          growth in their respective countries.

       ◗◗ Predicting technology choice based on supply constraints and demand patterns. As
          documented above, much of the uncertainty relating to the potential demand for many
          metals arises as much from intra-technology choices as it does from inter-technology
          choices. Understanding where supply constraints may lie, and where prices are most
          likely to rise, may help inform the possible direction of some of these choices, which, in
          turn, can help clarify demand.

       ◗◗ Developing networks and raising awareness. One of the outcomes of this analysis is the
          realization that the implications of this work go far beyond the traditional minerals and
          metals community. Linkages should be pursued and facilitated among research and
          social communities.

       Technology-related areas of inquiry pertain mostly to expanding the scope of future clean
       technologies.

       Areas to be covered might include the following:

       ◗◗ Electrical cabling and high-efficiency electric motors.

       ◗◗ Light-weighting of vehicles.

       ◗◗ Energy-efficient technologies and buildings.

       ◗◗ Transmission and distribution.


xiv	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
◗◗ Metal intensity of traditional and next-generation fossil fuel plants and nuclear facilities.

◗◗ Metal supply and metal families.

◗◗ Further work would also be useful with respect to key rare earth metals, with regard
   to both disaggregation capacity for these products (rare earth metals are typically not
   economically or physically retrievable as discrete ores, but often enmeshed with other
   base metals, as mentioned above for zinc) and their geological location.

◗◗ Recycling rate. The recycling of metals from end-of-life products can improve the future
   availability of those metals, but data on both current and future metal recycling rates
   are often poor. To further this analysis of metal criticality in the energy industry, data on
   current and future recycling rates should be improved.

By taking a close look at subsets of two of those critical components—power and batteries
used to fuel future transportation—this report is a first step in examining the implications
of changing material requirements for the mining and metals industry in supplying the low
carbon energy future. It is intended to engender a broader dialogue between the clean
energy, climate, and extractives communities on their respective roles in being part of the
global solution for a carbon-constrained future. Going forward, the World Bank intends to
work with these key constituencies in further defining the minerals and metals implications
of a carbon-constrained future and developing appropriate policies and measures that
will help ensure that the transition is managed in a way that complements the full array of
sustainable development priorities, from environmental and other material impact issues to
supporting continued economic and equitable growth in developing countries.

         Introduction
       With respect to prospects for the mining industry, much attention has been paid to the
       implications for the sector of a decline in the demand for coal over time (notwithstanding
       the potential for carbon capture and storage to help manage associated GHG emissions).
       In comparison, little attention has been paid to the implications of growing demand
       for materials required in the construction of renewable technologies and zero emission
       infrastructure. Minerals and metals will play a key role in the transition to a significantly
       lower carbon future, with potentially significant changes for the minerals and metals market.
       Metals are crucial to the way in which energy is generated and used. The future move to
       a low carbon economy, based on low carbon electricity generation and energy-efficient
       energy-using technologies, has huge potential to shift both the scale and composition of
       the demand for minerals and metals.

       An article in Nature explains, “a transition to a low carbon society, [is] a change that will
       require vast amounts of metals and minerals. Mineral resourcing and climate change are
       inextricably linked, not only because mining requires a large amount of energy, but also
       because ‘the world cannot tackle climate change without adequate supply of raw materials
       to manufacture clean technologies’” (Ali et al. 2017, 367).

       A review of the literature shows that the issue of commodities supply of the carbon-
       constrained future typically focuses on the minerals and metals that are required for
       specific technologies, concerns about the capacity of the industry to supply elements
       required to meet a low carbon future, the environmental and energy-use impacts of
       increased extraction of those resources, and the relative vulnerability of developed
       countries to the supply of critical elements required for the clean energy transition. This
       study provides a summary of the material implications of a low carbon transition. It uses
       wind, solar, and energy storage batteries as proxies, and focuses on base metals, including
       aluminum, copper, iron ore, nickel, lithium, and steel and some key rare earth metals such
       as molybdenum, neodymium, and indium. These metals were chosen because they are
       commonly identified as elements required for the manufacturing of greenhouse-gas-free
       technologies. The report then maps production and reserve levels of relevant metals
       globally, focusing on implications for resource-rich developing countries. It concludes by
       identifying critical research gaps and suggestions for future work.

       While the study’s intended audience is the World Bank Group and relevant client
       governments, it is also meant to engender a broader dialogue between the mining and
       metals constituency and the climate change and clean energy community. Too often,
       effective collaboration between the two has been hampered by perceptions of conflicting
       interests: this study is an attempt to break through that logjam, effectively demonstrating
       that a low carbon energy shift will be very much dependent on a robust, sustainable, and
       efficient mining and metals industry.

       The report’s objective—building awareness of the opportunities provided by a changing
       commodity market for mineral-rich developing countries—is relevant given the following:

       ◗◗ The high priority the WBG has assigned to playing an active role in supporting the global
          net zero carbon transition.


xvi	
◗◗ The lack of awareness, particularly among mining and metals actors in developing
   countries, of zero carbon future scenarios and even less of its implications for the
   commodities market.

◗◗ The opportunity it can provide for mineral-rich developing countries to contribute to
   addressing climate change while meeting national development and economic goals.

The report is organized along the following lines:

◗◗ Using the International Energy Agency’s 2015 Energy Technology Perspectives (IEA
   2015a) as the main reference climate and energy use scenario, chapter 1 provides a
   framework for defining the implications of a carbon-constrained future for the mining and
   metals industry.

◗◗ Chapter 2 estimates the mineral and metals implications of an accelerated increase in the
   deployment of three low carbon technologies—wind, solar, and energy storage batteries.

◗◗ Chapter 3 maps these metals to their known reserves globally, intending to identify
   specific implications for mineral-rich developing countries.

◗◗ Chapter 4 identifies key conclusions and research gaps and makes recommendations for
   follow-up activities to this study.

◗◗ Annex A summarizes the literature review conducted to establish which technologies and
   metals are most likely to play a significant role in a carbon-constrained future.

◗◗ Annex B provides an elaboration on energy storage battery scenarios.

◗◗ Annex C briefly reviews several deep GHG reduction scenarios.

                                        1. Research Methodology
   Numerous peer-reviewed scenarios have been developed over the past decade examining
   different options for the global transition from a carbon-based economic model. For
   the purposes of this report, these scenarios can be divided into two groups: The first set
   examines the likeliest prospects for making such a transition, irrespective of political goals
   established at national, regional, or international levels. These scenarios typically emanate
   from the private sector,1 and although they tend to regard decarbonization trends as
   potentially significant over the century, they are not anything close to the extent required
   to meet the Paris Agreement’s objective of avoiding a 2 degree Celsius (2°C) temperature
   rise. Hence, there is an assumption in these scenarios that over the next few decades, fossil
   fuels will continue to dominate, with renewables penetration still significant, but far from the
   levels necessary to avoid a 2°C rise.

   The second group of scenarios does not prejudge or examine whether the commitment
   to avoiding a global warming target well below 2°C is realistic or even achievable.2 These
   studies, in fact, go significantly beyond the 2°C scenario, and so tend to exaggerate
   potential growth prospects for the relevant metals.3 Others work on the basis of
   “development scenarios” with no specific linkage to climate change objectives.4 For a more
   in-depth analysis of future low carbon scenarios, please see annex C.

   As a result, the World Bank, in collaboration with the International Council on Mining and
   Metals (ICMM), commissioned a predictive analysis of future metals demand to support
   the transition to a low carbon future, drawing on the most current data available: the
   International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Energy Technology Perspective (ETP) scenarios,
   published in 2015 (IEA 2015a), which focus on the renewable technology implications
   of meeting 2°C (2DS), 4°C (4DS), and 6°C (6DS) global temperature warming scenarios.
   Although other scenarios were also taken into consideration, mostly to confirm assumptions
   about metal concentrations for particular technologies, the ETP scenario is the basis for
   projections of future demand for mining and metals emanating from a low carbon future.

   Figure 1.1 illustrates the technology implications derived from the IEA’s ETP scenarios.

     Renewable energy generation (including hydropower and biomass) increases in the three
     scenarios (2DS, 4DS, 6DS), from 14 percent of the current energy mix to 18 percent in the
     6DS scenario, and a high of 44 percent in the 2DS scenario. Given that wind and solar
     generation are the two renewable technologies whose use is expected to grow the most
     between 2013 and 2050 to meet a low carbon future, this report focuses on these two key
     energy generation technologies.

     It is also important to note that this study is limited to examining the metals used to
     manufacture these energy technologies, but does not investigate any additional metal
     requirements that may result from the growth of transmission infrastructure associated with
     a proliferation of distributed energy systems. When the power sector is expanded beyond
     generation to transmission, it is assumed that transmission infrastructure requirements
     will grow exponentially from business-as-usual cases to the building of smart grid systems
     integrated with solar and wind installations.

     Energy-using technologies abound throughout the global economy and vary greatly in
     scope and composition. This analysis focuses on one potential energy-using technology
     that is predicted to play a crucial role in the transition to a low carbon economy: battery
     storage units required for electric vehicles. Addressing climate change will be impossible
     without mitigating transportation emissions, which account for about 20 percent of the total
     (Bajželj, Allwood, and Cullen 2013). A significant electric vehicle fleet, and its supporting
     charging infrastructure, might also be used as widespread decentralized energy storage
     facilities. This could help a future low carbon energy system adapt to the inherent variability
     in wind and solar electricity generation. Electric vehicles therefore are a crucial part of a
     low carbon transition for both the generation and the use sides of the equation. For this
     study, the analysis is exclusively focused on potential battery storage facilities necessary for
     electric vehicles and intermittent renewable energy generation.5

     The ICMM–World Bank collaborative analysis was designed with a three-step methodology
     in mind:

      1.	 Literature scoping study—A review of literature on metal use in energy supply and
          energy-using technologies, relying on sources documented in annex A of this report,
          was completed. Based on this review, a list of metals for inclusion in the analysis (table
          1.1) was developed along with a list of energy technologies (table 1.2) to investigate
          that were directly relevant to the three renewable options that are the focus of this
          study. A full literature review, covering other, but not all, clean technologies, is provided

         During this literature review, data were collected on the weight of metals in table 1.1
         necessary to produce an amount of electricity generation capacity for the technologies
         in table 1.2, typically expressed in units of kilograms per installed megawatt. These
         data were categorized into “low,” “median,” and “high” data points if multiple
         conflicting data were found for the use of a metal in a particular energy technology.

         6DS scenarios were used for the energy system projections. These projections were

         for onshore and offshore wind will change from 98 percent and 2 percent, respectively,

          Scenario                                               Description
      IEA Energy         The 2DS is the primary focus of the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives. The
      Technology         2DS lays out an energy system deployment pathway and an emissions trajectory
      Perspectives 2°    consistent with at least a 50 percent chance of limiting the average global
      scenario (2DS)     temperature increase to 2°C. The 2DS limits the total remaining cumulative
                         energy-related CO2 emissions between 2015 and 2100 to 1,000 GtCO2. The 2DS
                         reduces CO2 emissions (including emissions from fuel combustion and process
                         and feedstock emissions in industry) by almost 60 percent by 2050 (compared
                         with 2013), with carbon emissions being projected to decline after 2050 until
                         carbon neutrality is reached.
      IEA Energy         The 4DS accounts for recent pledges by countries to limit emissions and improve
      Technology         energy efficiency, which help limit the long-term temperature increase to 4°C.
      Perspectives 4°    It should be noted that although the 4DS scenario is certain to result in harmful
      scenario (4DS)     climate change worldwide, it would still require significant changes from current
                         policy and technology practices. Moreover, capping the long-term temperature
                         increase at 4°C requires significant additional cuts in emissions in the period
                         after 2050.
      IEA Energy         The 6DS is largely an extension of current trends. Primary energy demand and
      Technology         CO2 emissions would grow by about 60 percent from 2013 to 2050, with about
      Perspectives 6°    1,700 GtCO2 of cumulative emissions. In the absence of efforts to stabilize the
      scenario (6DS)     atmospheric concentration of GHGs, the average global temperature rise above
                         preindustrial levels is projected to reach almost 5.5°C in the long term and
                         almost 4°C by the end of this century.

     Scenarios for energy storage are not explicitly included in the IEA Energy Technology
     Perspectives 2015 scenarios, so they were taken from other literature. See annex A for a
     detailed explanation of how this analysis included scenarios for energy storage batteries,
     but suffice it to say at this point that the three climate scenarios (6DS, 4DS, and 2DS)
     assume that 189 gigawatt (GW), 305 GW, and 500 GW6 of grid-scale energy storage output
     are needed, respectively. Decentralized (“behind the meter”) energy storage was assumed
     to be 10 percent of grid-scale energy storage in any given year.

     Table 1.4 provides some key assumptions used in the analysis.




4	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
Table 1.4  Key Assumptions Linking Metal Demand with Carbon-Constrained Scenarios


             Assumption               Description                        Risks and mitigation
    1   Assumption that          It was assumed that       Future metal demand could be
        metal demand per         the amount of metal       overestimated in this analysis if substitute

        constant                 through 2050.             amounts of specific metals. This assumption
                                                           is mitigated somewhat by including “low,”
                                                           “median,” and “high” data points for metal
                                                           use, where available.
    2   Assumption of            The mixes among sub-      Leaving the split among subtechnologies as

                                                           the model does not take into account
                                                           technology replacement rate limits when

    3   Assumption of            The lifetime of energy    This lifetime value is necessary for

                                 assumed to match          replace retirements every year. If technology
                                 today’s average           lifetimes increase, then less new capacity
                                 values.                   would need to be built every year, lowering
                                                           metal demand. This value can be modified

    4   Metal recycling rates    Metal recycling rates     This analysis calculates energy technologies’
                                 were ignored in this      total demand for metals, but does not
                                 analysis.                 include a factor for what portion of that
                                                           demand could be met by recycled metal.
                                                           Including a recycling rate would lower
                                                           demand for virgin metal by the amount that
                                                           is recycled annually.
aFor example, if a user sets the portion of onshore wind turbines that are direct drive in 2050 at 100 percent,

the model will assume that all geared turbines have been replaced by 2050, regardless of whether this is real-
istic with respect to the rate of geared turbines coming out of service through 2050.

     One final word: notwithstanding the care taken to provide a series of credible scenarios in this
     study, a number of challenges need to be kept in mind, including the following:

     ◗◗ A lack of consistent projections for a large range of generation and energy-using
        technologies. The IEA’s energy-generation scenarios do not include energy-using
        technologies. This study therefore combines scenarios from different sources, which
        raises consistency challenges. Many other scenarios (covered in annex B) do not directly
        address specific climate-based goals but use other parameters, so it is difficult to
        compare those results with the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives, which serve as the
        basis for this analysis.

     ◗◗ A lack of depth in projections for intra-technology choices. The choice between onshore
        and offshore wind may be as fundamentally important for metal demand as the overall
        scale of wind generation. However, there are few if any projections for such a choice.

     ◗◗ Large variation in estimated values for tons per megawatt for various metals for different
        technologies in the literature. Estimating where in this range future metal intensity of
        technologies will lie is difficult, increasing the overall uncertainty of the final estimates for
        metal demand in all scenarios.

6	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
 2. Implications of a Carbon-Constrained
 Future for Mining and Metals
The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change appears to indicate a global resolve to
embark on development patterns that would significantly be less GHG intensive, with
potentially significant implications for the commodities market. An assumption prominent
in some parts of civil society and the media is that natural resource–based economic
activities will become less prominent in a carbon-constrained future. This chapter tests
that assumption and examines the commodities for which demand will rise as a result of a
globally carbon-constrained future.

Material Requirements in Key Technologies
Chapter 1 established a framework for estimating demand for materials in a low carbon
future. This analysis is focused on three key technologies for realizing a low carbon future over
this century: wind, solar, and energy storage (batteries). Of course, many other technologies
and transmission modes are necessary for meeting the strong climate commitments made at
Paris, covering power, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use management sectors;
this report acknowledges that these other areas should also be covered, but remains focused
on the three technologies identified above,1 given the prominent role they are assumed
to play in a “net zero” or carbon-constrained future. That takes us to the next step: what
materials are required in the scaled-up production of these technologies and to what degree
will they be required to meet a range of global climate scenarios?

Before proceeding, it is worthwhile to note that the vast majority of climate and carbon
scenarios have paid little, if any, attention to the implications of the requirements for the
materials necessary to “feed” the carbon-constrained future. However, that situation is
changing, with a growing body of research—industrial ecology—examining the material
implications of different development scenarios (Clift and Druckman 2016).2,3 The
International Resource Panel has also recently provided updated research on the material
implications of a carbon-constrained future.4 Some nationally funded initiatives are also
examining the material needs of new “green” technologies and their ready availability for
countries. Examples include the US-based Critical Materials Institute5 and the European
Union–based Ad Hoc Working Group on Defining Critical Raw Materials (European
Commission 2014). In addition, the International Union of Geological Sciences has launched
an initiative addressing the long-term goal of ensuring a supply of mineral, energy, and
water resources for global society for the next century, which will also be focusing on
servicing the material needs of clean technologies.6 It should be noted that the objective
of these efforts is to examine potential shortages in the supply of minerals and metals
for clean carbon technologies; the objective of this report is simply to identify the critical
elements for a specific set of technologies and then strategically assess the potential for the
commodities market in mineral-resource-rich developing countries.

The results of the International Council on Mining and Metals–World Bank analysis
identifying metals and minerals impacts of three key low carbon technologies follows:

Key Metals for Wind Technologies
The technology options for wind are numerous and include the size of the turbine and
whether it rotates vertically or horizontally. To minimize cost, the industry has converged

		7
     on large, horizontally rotating turbines. For these designs, the basic choice, with significant
     impacts on metal demand, is geared turbines versus direct-drive turbines.

     Geared turbines currently make up the bulk of the installed base. They use a system of
     gears to convert the relatively low rotation speed of the turbine to a much higher speed
     (thousands of revolutions per minute) for the generator. Geared turbines use coil-driven
     generators that require significant amounts of copper, but do not have permanent magnets.
     In 2009, 85 percent of all installed wind turbine capacity was made up of geared models
     (Morris 2011). Geared turbines have traditionally had a cost advantage over direct-drive
     turbines, which must use a more expensive generator. But the reliability of geared turbines
     has traditionally been worse because of the complicated gearbox.

     Direct-drive wind turbines do not have a gearbox, so they are generally more reliable
     than geared models. However, they do use a more complicated and expensive low-speed
     generator, which is generally constructed with permanent magnets containing rare earth
     metals. This design has traditionally led to higher costs than for geared turbines. Because
     direct-drive turbines do not have the complicated arrangement of bearings and gears that
     geared turbines do, they have generally been used in places where higher wind speeds
     would put more stress on the gearboxes and it would be more difficult to access the turbine
     to perform maintenance. Both factors have led to direct-drive turbines being installed more
     in offshore locations with higher wind and more difficult access, while geared turbines have
     been installed in onshore locations with lower wind speeds and easier access.

     Wind Power International states that “The share of global wind turbine installations held by
     direct drive turbines increased from around 18.2% in 2006 to 19.8% in 2011, and is expected
     to increase to 29.6% in 2020.”7

     Among the metals examined in this study, the significant metal content of these two types of
     technologies do differ, as seen in table 2.1.

8	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
Key Metals for Solar Technologies
Each technology for constructing solar photovoltaic (PV) cells has distinct advantages and
disadvantages, as well as differing metal content. This section investigates four widely used
technologies:

◗◗ Crystalline silicon cells make up about 85 percent of the current market. They can either
   be manufactured as single crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous silicon.

◗◗ Copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) is a “thin film” solar technology. It can be made
   into thinner cells than crystalline silicon, which may reduce material and manufacturing
   costs while allowing for flexible cells.

◗◗ Cadmium telluride (CdTe) is another thin film technology. It is cost competitive with
   crystalline silicon and has good efficiency. However, the toxicity of cadmium and the
   future supply of tellurium make the future of this technology uncertain.

◗◗ Amorphous silicon or amorphous silicon-germanium solar cells are the final thin film
   technology considered here. This technology suffers from lower performance than
   crystalline silicon, but can be printed on flexible materials.

In 2015, the market share of all thin film technologies amounted to about 8 percent of total
annual production.

Among the metals examined in this study, the significant metal content of these
technologies differs widely, as seen in table 2.2.

Key Metals for Energy Storage Batteries
The total energy storage infrastructure for each of the three climate scenarios was split
between three technologies: lead-acid, lithium-ion, and “other.” The “other” category
includes many other battery chemistries, such as nickel-metal-hydride and sodium-sulfur

      batteries, as well as non-battery energy storage such as pumped-storage hydro, flywheels,
      and hydrogen. Lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries have distinct advantages and
      disadvantages, as well as differing metal content:

       1.	 Lead-acid batteries are the more mature technology, and have traditionally had a cost
           advantage over lithium-ion batteries. They have poor power-to-weight and energy-to-
           weight ratios.

       2.	 Lithium-ion batteries have excellent energy-to-weight ratios, and prices have
           decreased drastically in the past decade.

      The significant metal content of these technologies is dependent on the charge carrier,
      either lithium or lead, as seen in table 2.3; both battery types typically use either plastic or
      steel construction.


      Metal Demand Trend Predictions
      This section discusses demand trends for the metals supplying the three technologies—
      wind power, solar photovoltaics, and energy storage—in more depth.


      Wind Power
      Increases in wind turbine size, combined with economies of scale, have lowered wind
      electricity generation prices to the point that it is competitive with fossil fuel generation in
      many areas, and, according to Channell et al. (2013, 53), is even “approaching the average
      wholesale electricity price in a number of large markets—including Italy, Spain, the UK and
      China—and has already attained and surpassed parity in Brazil.”

      Figure 2.1 shows the wind energy production curves for the 2 degree, 4 degree, and
      6 degree Celsius scenarios (2DS, 4DS, and 6DS, respectively). In these scenarios, electricity
      production from wind power, particularly onshore wind, will rapidly increase through 2050.

  Note:  2DS = 2 degree scenario; 4DS = 4 degree scenario; 6DS = 6 degree scenario.




  It should be noted that although these three scenarios cover a range of possible future
  outcomes for the energy system in general, recent evidence points to overly conservative
  estimates of expected penetration levels of renewable technologies. For example, the
  International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Blue MAP scenarios,8 published in 2010, extrapolated
  that the world would produce approximately 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity from
  wind energy in 2015, when in fact the actual production in 2015 was 700 TWh, indicating a
  much more rapid build out of wind capacity than had been anticipated.

  Future metal demand. Future metal demand in the wind industry will depend on both
  the total amount of capacity installed and the choices between these two competing
  technologies. Elshkaki and Graedal (2013) assume that offshore wind turbines, which are
  assumed to be almost completely of the direct-drive design in the future, will be 50 percent
  of total installed generation capacity by 2050. But the split between onshore and offshore
  installations, and even between geared and direct-drive installations in these two locations,
  is not yet set. Morris (2011) notes that progress is being made toward increasing the
  reliability of geared designs and driving down the cost of direct-drive designs.

  Figure 2.2 provides an interesting illustration of one element, neodymium, whose projected
  demand is very much influenced by the type of wind technology that will gain prominence
  during this century.9

        scenario (2DS, 4DS, or 6DS) and set of assumptions about the market penetration of direct drive vs. geared wind
        turbine technologies. The height of the bar is the uncertainty in the intensity of metal demand (high versus low
        estimates of the amount of neodymium in each generator). In this figure, offshore wind turbines have a consistent
        75/25 split for direct-drive and geared systems, respectively, from 2013 through 2050. In the blue scenarios,
        onshore wind turbines have a consistent 25/75 split for direct-drive and geared systems, respectively, from 2013
        through 2050. In the green scenarios, direct-drive systems in onshore wind turbines move from a 25 percent market
        share in 2013 to a 50 percent market share in 2050.

12	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
  Solar Photovoltaics
  Solar PV technology converts sunlight directly to electricity. The high learning rate10 for solar
  PV, between 22 percent and 40 percent, has resulted in marked price reductions in solar
  PV technology costs in recent years—approximately $1 per watt currently, and projected
  to be $0.50 by 2025. Solar PV is now common at small scales (for example, for individual
  appliances in off-grid areas on house rooftops), at medium scale (for individual businesses),
  and at large scale (for example, solar PV farms generating many megawatts of electricity).
  Figure 2.4 lays out projected yearly electricity supply from solar PV for the 2DS, 4DS, and
  6DS IEA Energy Technology Perspectives scenarios (IEA 2015a). Global PV electricity
  production in 2013 was approximately 140 TWh, and is projected to rapidly increase in all
  scenarios. However, the IEA data do not specify the mix of solar technologies that might be
  used in the future.

  Future metal demand in the solar industry will depend on both the total amount of solar
  PV installed and choices between competing solar technologies. For example, the demand
  for indium depends not only on the penetration of solar PV, but also on what percentage
  of those installations are CIGS technology. Many studies assume that the majority of
  future solar PV installations will be of the crystalline silicon variety. As seen in figure 2.5,
  total demand through 2050 varies greatly depending on small changes in CIGS market
  penetration. These numbers can be compared with current annual indium production of
  700 tons.

        about the market penetration of different PV technologies. The height of the bar is the uncertainty in the intensity
        of metal demand (high versus low estimates of the amount of indium in each solar cell). In the blue-colored
        scenarios, CIGS increases its market share from roughly 7 percent today to 17 percent in 2050. In the green-colored
        scenarios, CIGS technology moves from a 7 percent market share in 2013 to a 25 percent market share in 2050, with
        a corresponding increase in demand for indium.




        Figure 2.6 plots the range of cumulative demand for silver from PV technologies. Silver is
        another example of a metal whose potential rising demand in a carbon-constrained future
        is very much subject to intra-technology choices. In contrast to the potential demand for
        indium, scenarios in which thin film technologies see increased market penetration reduce
        demand for silver in the PV industry, because only crystalline silicon PV cells use significant
        amounts of silver.11

        Figure 2.7 lays out a median scenario for solar PV and the resultant impact on key metals
        demand for 2DS and 4DS as compared with 6DS. The difference in projected metal demand
        for solar PV between 4DS and 2DS is even more marked than it is for wind technologies,
        with output of relevant metals projected to increase about 300 percent for solar PV (under
        wind, 2DS sees a 250 percent rise).

      Energy Storage
      Energy storage technology stores energy at the time it is generated for later use when it is
      needed. This analysis divides energy storage into three applications: automotive, grid scale,
      and decentralized. The energy storage landscape for automobiles (and other wheeled
      ground vehicles, including buses, vans, and trucks) is changing rapidly. All vehicles today
      have some battery energy storage, almost always a lead-acid battery, to help start the
      engine and to power vehicle electronics. New technologies to improve energy efficiency
      all require increased energy storage capacity. These technologies, from the smallest
      to the largest increase in energy storage capacity, are start-stop vehicles, micro-hybrid
      vehicles, hybrid vehicles, and electric vehicles. The increased market penetration of start-
      stop vehicles is likely to increase demand for lead-acid batteries, while lithium-ion battery
      technology is likely the only viable candidate for full electric vehicles because of its high
      energy-density-to-weight ratio. Energy storage technology choices for future hybrid vehicles
      are less certain, with lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries, nickel-chemistry batteries,
      compressed air storage, and flywheel energy storage all competing for market share.

      Grid-scale energy storage is used for a number of different purposes, including
      regulation of grid voltage (on very short time scales) and to store electricity produced by
      intermittent generation sources (solar PV and wind) for use when needed. Because grid-
      scale energy storage infrastructure does not require the high energy-density-to-weight
      ratio of automotive applications, there are many more competing technology options,
      including pumped-storage hydro, compressed air, a number of flow battery chemistries,
      hydrogen, lead-acid batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. Current grid-scale energy storage
      infrastructure is almost exclusively (more than 99 percent) pumped-storage hydroelectricity,
      where water is pumped up to a height to store energy and is then released to flow downhill
      and spin turbines to generate electricity.

      It is likely that batteries will gain an increasing share of future grid-scale energy storage
      because of declining costs and the limited number of new sites suitable for pumped-
      storage hydro. Decentralized (or “behind the meter”) electricity storage is used with
      individual, small-scale, renewable energy installations. For example, a home or business
      might use decentralized energy storage to store electricity from a rooftop solar PV panel for
      use during the night. These installations typically use battery technology (for example, lead
      acid or lithium ion), or a solution such as flywheels or thermal energy storage.

      Of the three energy technologies examined in this report, the future market for energy
      storage is regarded as the most difficult to predict and therefore the most uncertain. The
      IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives scenarios (IEA 2015a) do not contain explicit scenarios
      for energy storage. Figure 2.9 projects trends for battery energy storage for electric vehicles
      and other energy storage types.

      Future metal demand in the battery industry is highly dependent on the overall demand
      for storage in the energy system, the choice of energy storage technologies, and the
      development of less-metal-demanding technologies, particularly for lithium-ion batteries.

      Figure 2.8 illustrates a median scenario for energy storage technologies and the resultant
      impact on demand for key metals demand under 2DS and 4DS as compared with 6DS.

 Note:  2DS = 2 degree scenario; 4DS = 4 degree scenario; 6DS = 6 degree scenario. Figure shows change in metal
 demand for energy storage technologies as compared with the 6DS.


 Metals not shown in this figure are not used to any great extent in this technology. Most
 noteworthy is the remarkable difference in projected demand for relevant metals between
 the 2DS and 4DS configurations. Demand is expected to rise gradually under 4DS but is
 likely to rise more than 1,000 percent should 2DS come into effect.

 In this analysis, the energy storage required (in gigawatt-hours) for each of the three
 applications was projected from 2013 to 2050, as seen in figure 2.9. In figure 2.9, the
 potential extreme 2DS electric vehicle trend is clear. In this scenario (documented in
 International Energy Agency [2016a]), there are 140 million electric vehicles in operation by
 2030, versus approximately 25 million units in the more pessimistic 4DS and 6DS scenarios.
 Due to the lack of scenario data, the projections for automotive battery energy storage after
 2030 are based on growth rate assumptions of approximately 20% per year. The bottom
 panel of figure 2.9 provides a zoomed-in view of the energy storage capacity for other
 energy storage types.12

      Demand for Metal Will Increase, but for What Metals?
      The clear conclusion to be drawn from the above discussion is that the acceleration in
      deployment of the key low carbon technologies in the wind, solar, and energy storage
      areas has real implications for the commodities market, and not only rare earths, such


18	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
as indium and neodymium. Aluminum, copper, silver, bauxite, iron, lead, and others all
stand to potentially benefit from a strong shift to low carbon technologies. It would be
reasonable to expect that all low carbon energy systems are more likely than not to be
more metal intensive than high-carbon systems. In fact, all literature examining material
and metals implications for supplying clean technologies agree strongly that building
these technologies will result in considerably more material-intensive demand than would
traditional fossil fuel mechanisms.

The next critical question is which metals will experience strong increases in demand: the
answer remains far from clear, for the ways in which metal demand will increase depend
on both inter-technology choices, such as the balance between wind and solar power, and
intra-technology choices, such as the balance between onshore and offshore wind, the
choice between different types of solar PV cells, and the extent to which vehicles become
fully electric or mild hybrid and what types of batteries dominate.

These different choices have profound implications for the demand for individual metals.
Predicting the overall energy balance between individual renewable technologies, or the extent
to which electric vehicles will penetrate the market, is complicated enough, let alone predicting
the balance between specific technological choices within each renewable energy category.

This analysis attempts to quantify the three largest sources of uncertainty for metal demand:

◗◗ Evolution of the energy system

◗◗ Competition between different designs for the same technology, which may have higher
   or lower requirements for metals

◗◗ Innovation that may be able to reduce the amount of metals used in a particular
   technology per unit of service delivered.

Although exactly predicting the demand for specific metals is impossible, clear ranges
for their demand can be derived, and it can be clearly stated that any move to a more
renewable-energy-intensive economy will result in greater overall demand for metal.

Wind power shows the scale of the challenge. The technology as a whole is predicted
to become an increasingly important component of many countries’ energy systems,
especially those with significant wind resources. However, within wind energy, two main
types of technology choices are available: onshore and offshore wind. The main technology
difference between these geographically separated technologies is the use of permanent
magnets in offshore wind versus the use of geared drives in onshore. Permanent magnets
are a more expensive and metal-intensive option, but the use of such technology requires
less maintenance and replacement, and is therefore more suited to the challenging
conditions in which offshore wind operates.

Thus, an energy scenario that involves greater penetration of offshore wind would result in
much greater demand for permanent magnets and rare earth metals such as neodymium.
The demand for neodymium will therefore depend on the penetration of offshore wind,
which will, in turn, depend on a wide range of factors such as local planning restrictions for


	            Chapter 2: Implications of a Carbon-Constrained Future for Mining and Metals 	19
      onshore wind, marine management zoning decisions, developments in the robustness of
      offshore wind and its related infrastructure, and even the demand for rare earth metals from
      other sources, which will affect the price of permanent magnets and the choice between
      offshore and onshore wind.

      Solar PV cells are also predicted to become a crucial part of the overall energy mix, ranging
      from 2 percent of total energy production in the baseline scenario to 25 percent in the scenario
      that predicts the greatest penetration of renewable technologies. Yet within this broad category
      are at least four potential technology choices (with a much greater range of future options that
      are not commercially available): crystalline silicon, CIGS, CdTe, and amorphous silicon. The
      balance between these alternatives has huge implications for metals such as indium, silver, and
      zinc. Crystalline silicon PV requires much greater amounts of silver compared with the other
      technologies, while CIGS requires much more indium than the others. Thus, how the various
      technologies within the solar PV class develop, and how the economic and technological
      choices between these technologies evolve, will define the demand for a wide range of metals.

      Energy-storage technologies also lead to potential uncertainty for demand for specific
      metals. A major question that arises in predicting the future of transportation is not just the
      number of vehicles on the road, but the extent to which the vehicle fleet in the next few
      decades will be fully electric, dominated by hybrid vehicles that use both electricity and
      traditional gasoline, or even populated by vehicles that use previously predicted “golden
      bullets” such as hydrogen fuel cells.

      The emergence of one of these three options will define whether lithium, lead, or the platinum
      group of metals experiences large increases in demand. Any of these three options would
      require large changes from a baseline of the continuation of an internal combustion fleet,
      but more significant is the choice between the three options. A fully electric fleet is predicted
      to involve massive increases in the demand for lithium, used in the lithium-ion batteries in
      electric vehicles. In contrast, a fleet that involves less penetration by electrical technology
      and is dominated by mild hybrid vehicles could lead to much lower levels of lithium demand
      but much higher demand for lead for use in lead-acid batteries. If hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
      predominate, then demand for platinum group metals could increase rapidly. Which of these
      choices (if any) emerges again depends on a wide variety of factors, such as the scale of cost
      reductions in battery technology; the extent to which electric-charging infrastructure can be
      cheaply and feasibly constructed; the requirements for a vehicle fleet that can also be used as
      storage for intermittent renewable generation; shifting consumer preferences for low-emission,
      efficient vehicles; and even the relative costs of the key constituent metals.

      Predicting the groups of metals for which demand is likely to grow is therefore extremely
      difficult, although it can be stated with some confidence that one of these three clean
      energy vehicles is likely to grow dramatically. These three examples of how intra-technology
      choices for personal vehicles can affect overall demand for individual metals shows the
      scale of the task of understanding long-term demand for individual metals. Predicting the
      growth of any technology class is difficult, and predicting specific choices within each class
      is doubly so. Yet it is these choices that will define the demand for individual metals.

      Figure 2.10 provides an example of how one metal’s demand—in this case, lithium-ion—
      carries a considerable range of possibilities, depending on the penetration of energy
      storage batteries in servicing automotive, grid scale and decentralized energy.

  Note:  Each bar represents an energy storage scenario (2DS-ES, 4DS-ES, or 6DS-ES) and scenario for lithium-ion
  battery technology market penetration. The height of the bar is the uncertainty of the intensity of metal demand
  (high versus low estimates of the amount of lithium per unit of battery energy storage). In the blue-colored
  scenarios, lithium increases its market share from about 2 percent today to 30 percent in the automotive sector in
  2050 (measured by total energy storage capacity in gigawatt-hours), as well as from 0 percent to 40 percent in grid-
  scale energy storage, and 5 percent to 33 percent in decentralized energy storage. In the green-colored scenarios,
  lithium-ion batteries increase to 50 percent market penetration in all three sectors by 2050.



  As an illustration of how the metals market could be affected by carbon-neutral
  technologies, Oliveira (2017) reports in Mining Weekly that demand for key metals, such
  as lithium, is at risk of exceeding current production levels, with the potential to hold low
  carbon technology manufacturers hostage to lithium suppliers’ proclivities and capacities.
  Peer-reviewed academic journals are carrying the same narrative, with Fizaine and Court
  (2015) suggesting that interdependency between metals and energy production is
  increasing, in most part because of growth in carbon-neutral or -constrained technologies.

  Another example of volatility in the commodities market caused by rapid shifts in demand
  for carbon-neutral technologies is silicon. Over the past few years, silicon, a major element
  in crystalline silicon solar, has gone from undercapacity to overcapacity in a relatively short
  time, but there is still a risk that demand may once again outstrip supply should solar
  continue to grow at current rates, causing consequent impacts on the overall and long-term
  economic feasibility of specific solar technologies (Bye and Ceccaroli 2014).

  These examples drive home the message that producers need to be better prepared to not
  only meet increased overall demand for metals under low carbon scenarios but also to be
  flexible enough to meet shifting demand for individual metals as economic and technical
  developments cause these broad choices between technologies to begin to narrow.

      Figure 2.11 provides a very preliminary glimpse of how overall demand for metals by 2050
      might be affected by an increase in demand for the technologies identified in this report.
      This figure is intended to begin a story with respect to the links between metals and a
      carbon-constrained future, namely, that technologies supporting a carbon-constrained
      future will cause demand for a wide range of base metals, as well as for rare earth metals,
      to increase. It is important to keep in mind that this initial study does not include a number

       3. Implications for Developing Countries
      As noted in the World Bank’s Overview of the Extractive Industries,1 nonrenewable mineral
      resources play a dominant role in 81 countries that collectively account for a quarter of
      world GDP, half of the world’s population, and nearly 70 percent of those in extreme
      poverty. As a result, a growing number of low-income countries focus on resource extraction
      and processing activities as fundamental to their economic growth plans. Such investments
      carry significant up-front capital costs, with key assumptions about the longevity of relevant
      commodities often reaching out more than half a century (due to the typical life span of
      mines). It is important that developing countries become better positioned to decide how
      to take advantage of the future commodities market responding to climate and related
      Sustainable Development Goals, promoting, for example, affordable and clean energy.

      This chapter provides a comprehensive series of global commodity maps tracking known
      production levels and reserves of the following commodities assumed to play a potentially
      prominent role in the energy shift to a carbon-constrained future:2 aluminum (including
      alumina and bauxite), chromium, cobalt, copper, iron ore and steel, indium, lithium,
      manganese, molybdenum, nickel, platinum group metals, rare earth metals (which include
      cadmium, indium, and neodymium), silver, titanium, and zinc.

      For the purpose of this report’s objective—building awareness of the opportunities for
      mineral-rich developing countries resulting from a changing commodities market caused
      by a global shift to climate-friendly technologies—drawing coherent conclusions from the
      mapping exercise is not easy. In fact, the most striking conclusion to draw is that significant
      gaps exist in providing current and robust data with which to map relevant mineral and
      metal resources in developing country regions (Africa, Asia, and Latin America). For
      example, the U.S. Geological Survey’s 2016 global mapping of production and reserve
      levels of metals covered in this exercise show NO profile for potential contributions from
      Africa for cadmium, molybdenum, silver, rare earth metals, and zinc, and relatively small
      profiles for copper, iron ore, and lithium.

      Also notable are anomalies in the geographical distribution of key metals for production
      activities versus reserve levels versus estimated resources. For example, with respect to
      bauxite (figure 3.3; table 3.3), a key metal required for aluminum production, developing
      countries, excluding China, account for 30 percent of bauxite production, but 63 percent of
      global reserves. Africa, Guinea specifically, accounts for 6.5 percent of global production,
      but 26 percent of known reserves. The survey estimates that 94 percent of the world’s
      bauxite is found in developing country regions.

      Lithium (figure 3.12; table 3.12) is another example of a key metal required for the carbon-
      constrained future (particularly for energy storage batteries in electric vehicles) for which
      reserves are prominently located in developing country regions, especially in South
      America. Production is not high, but the actual resources are significantly higher. For




26	
example, in Latin America, Bolivia is listed as having no accessible reserves but is estimated
to actually have some 9 million tons embedded in its geological formations. In Africa, only
Zimbabwe is listed with relatively small reserves, but the Democratic Republic of Congo
is estimated to have 1 million tons in resources. The same can be said of manganese
(figure 3.13; table 3.13)—while Africa is estimated to have about 32 percent of the globe’s
reserves, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that South Africa alone contains 75 percent
of manganese resources worldwide.

It is striking that aside from China, Brazil, India, and Malaysia there are no recorded
production, reserve, or resource data for rare earth metals (figure 3.17; table 3.17) available
from any developing country regions. Although these critical metals can be found in these
areas, no concerted efforts have been undertaken to accurately map their existence, an
activity no doubt complicated by the reality that many of these elements are “secondary”
minerals embedded in base metals, such as zinc (figure 3.21; table 3.21).

Notwithstanding the limited data available at this point for some areas of the world,
particularly Africa and some other low-income countries worldwide, some trends are still
noteworthy. With respect to mineral-rich developing countries, it is evident that Latin
America is in a relatively strong position to become a “supplier” for the global climate-
friendly energy transition, with Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru being the best positioned
countries. Bolivia is also potentially set to benefit should it be able to translate its resources,
such as lithium, into recognized reserves. Particular metals for which Latin America holds
a key strategic advantage include copper (figure 3.7; table 3.7), iron ore (figure 3.10; table
3.10), silver (figure 3.19; table 3.19), and lithium; the region is also active in the aluminum,
nickel, manganese, and zinc sectors.

Africa’s potential role is also potentially significant given its ore reserves in platinum
(figure 3.16; table 3.16), manganese, bauxite, and chromium (figure 3.5; table 3.5). Most of
these reserves and production activities are limited to the southern African region, with the
exception of Guinea. And as mentioned, the lack of data and information on metals outside
of the south may be more the result of survey gaps than the actual absence of those metals.
For example, it is a relative certainty that Africa does, in fact, contain rare earth metals.
What has NOT occurred is any comprehensive survey of its potential resources and how
difficult it might be to translate those resources into reserves.

With respect to Asia, the most notable finding is the global dominance China enjoys
on the metals—both base and rare earth—required to supply technologies in a carbon-
constrained future. Both production and reserve levels, even when compared with resource-
rich developed countries (such as Canada and the United States, and to a lesser extent
Australia) often dwarf that of others. India is dominant in iron and steel and titanium, and
Indonesia has opportunities with bauxite and nickel, as does Malaysia, to a lesser extent.
Finally, in Oceania, the massive reserves of nickel to be found in New Caledonia should not
be overlooked.

      Global Distribution of Reserves and Production Levels of Key Metals Critical
      to a Clean Energy Future
      For the purposes of this exercise—mapping reserves to critical metals in the carbon-
      constrained future—the following minerals and metals are the specific focus of this annex: steel
      and its iron ore component, aluminum (including alumina and bauxite), cadmium, chromium,
      cobalt, copper, indium, lithium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, rare earth metals, platinum
      group metals, silicon, silver, titanium, and zinc. This annex maps these resources’ production
      and reserve levels and examines how well positioned mineral-rich developing countries are
      for supplying that market. The source for this information is the United States Geological
      Survey (USGS) Mineral Commodities Survey of 2016, which has been confirmed by cross-
      references to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Trade in Raw
      Materials website. We fully recognize that the data provided may not be fully consistent with
      other surveys, notwithstanding that the USGS data is assumed to be the most comprehensive
      currently available to the public. Comparison with OECD’s database for its “Trade in Raw
      Materials” website was performed and found data to be fairly consistent with USGS data.

      Also as a clarification, although the maps address production and reserve levels for the
      relevant metals, the USGS also, at times, alludes to “resource” levels, to be distinguished
      from reserves. The USGS Mineral Resources Program 2012 defines resources as “a
      concentration of naturally occurring solid, liquid or gaseous material in or on the Earth’s
      crust in such form and amount that economic extraction of a commodity from the
      concentration is currently or potentially feasible,”3 whereas reserves are defined as “that
      part of the reserve base which could be economically attractive or produced at the time
      of determination.”4 This report formally “maps” only reserve and production levels for the
      relevant metals; however, potential resource levels are noted when found relevant to the
      discussion. Specific mapping, however, of resource levels was not included because data
      were inconsistently applied across metals and regions.

Developing countries’ share of aluminum smelter production and capacity: With China
and Middle Eastern countries, 70 percent; without them and only including Brazil, India, and
South Africa, 6.5 percent.

World resources: Global resources are estimated to be between 55 billion and 75 billion
tons and are sufficient to meet world demand for metal well into the future.

Substitutes: Magnesium, steel, and titanium can substitute for aluminum in ground
transportation and structural uses. Composites, steel, vinyl, and wood can substitute for
aluminum in construction. Copper can replace aluminum in electrical and heat-exchange
applications.

      Developing countries’ share of bauxite production: 52 percent; without China, 30 percent.

      Developing countries’s share of bauxite reserves: 65 percent; without China, 63 percent.

      World resources: Bauxite resources are estimated to be between 55 billion and 75 billion
      tons: Africa (32 percent), Oceania (23 percent), South America and the Caribbean
      (21 percent), Asia (18 percent), and elsewhere (6 percent).

      Substitutes: Bauxite is virtually the only raw material used in the production of alumina
      on a commercial scale in the world, but that may be changing. Although currently not
      economically competitive with bauxite, vast U.S. and global resources of clay are technically
      feasible sources of alumina. Some refineries in China recover alumina from coal ash, and
      processes for recovering alumina from clay were being tested in Australia and Canada to
      determine if they would be economically competitive.

Note:  N/A = not available. Quantitative estimates of cadmium reserves are not available. It is typically recovered
from zinc ores at grade levels of 0.03 percent.



Developing countries’ share of cadmium production: 45 percent; without China, 11 percent.

World resources: Cadmium is generally recovered from zinc ores and concentrates.
Sphalerite, the most economically significant zinc mineral, commonly contains minor
amounts of cadmium, which shares certain similar chemical properties with zinc and often
substitutes for zinc in the sphalerite crystal lattice. The cadmium mineral greenockite is
frequently associated with weathered sphalerite and wurtzite. Zinc-bearing coals of the
central United States and Carboniferous-age coals of other countries also contain large
subeconomic resources of cadmium.

Substitutes: Lithium-ion and nickel–metal hydride batteries are replacing nickel-cadmium
batteries in some applications. However, the higher cost of these alternatives restricts their
use in less expensive products. Except where the surface characteristics of a coating are
critical (for example, fasteners for aircraft), coatings of zinc or vapor-deposited aluminum
can be substituted for cadmium in many plating applications.

      Substitutes: Chromium has no substitute in stainless steel, the leading end use, or in
      superalloys, the major strategic end use. Chromium-containing scrap can substitute for
      ferrochromium in some metallurgical uses.

World resources: World resources are estimated to be more than 800 billion tons of crude
ore containing more than 230 billion tons of iron.

Substitutes: The only source of primary iron is iron ore, used directly as direct-shipping
ore or converted to briquettes, concentrates, iron nuggets, pellets, or sinter. At some blast
furnace operations, ferrous scrap may constitute as much as 7 percent of the blast furnace
feedstock, iron nuggets, and scrap are extensively used for steelmaking in electric arc
furnaces and in iron and steel foundries, but scrap availability can be limited. Technological
advancements have been made that allow hematite to be recovered from tailings basins
and pelletized.

World Resources: Identified world lead resources total more than 2 billion tons. In recent
years, significant lead resources have been identified in association with zinc and/or silver or
copper deposits in Australia, China, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Russia, and the United
States (Alaska).

Substitutes: Substitution of plastics has reduced the use of lead in cable covering and cans.
Tin has replaced lead in solder for potable water systems.

46	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
Developing countries’ share of molybdenum production: 69 percent; without China,
31 percent.

Developing countries’ share of molybdenum reserves: 66 percent; without China,
27 percent.

World resources: Identified resources of molybdenum in the world are 19.4 million tons.
Resources of molybdenum are adequate to supply world needs for the foreseeable future.

Substitutes: There is little substitution for molybdenum in its major application as an
alloying element in steels and cast irons. In fact, because of the availability and versatility of
molybdenum, industry has sought to develop new materials that benefit from the alloying
properties of the metal.

      Developing countries’ share of nickel reserves: 37 percent; without China, 34 percent.

      World resources: Identified land-based resources averaging 1 percent nickel or greater
      contain at least 130 million tons of nickel, with about 60 percent in laterites and 40 percent
      in sulfide deposits. Extensive nickel resources also are found in manganese crusts and
      nodules on the ocean floor. The decline in discovery of new sulfide deposits in traditional
      mining districts has led to exploration in more challenging locations such as east-central
      Africa and the subarctic.

      Substitutes: Low-nickel, duplex, or ultrahigh-chromium stainless steels are being
      substituted for austenitic grades in construction. Nickel-free specialty steels are sometimes
      used in place of stainless steel in the power-generating and petrochemical industries.
      Titanium alloys can substitute for nickel metal or nickel-base alloys in corrosive chemical
      environments. Lithium-ion batteries instead of nickel-metal hydride may be used in certain
      applications.

      Substitutes: Less expensive palladium has been substituted for platinum in most gasoline-
      engine catalytic converters. About 25 percent palladium can routinely be substituted for
      platinum in diesel catalytic converters; the proportion can be as much as 50 percent in some
      applications. For some industrial end uses, one PGM can substitute for another, but with
      losses in efficiency.

Developing countries’ share of rare earth production: 86 percent; without China, 2 percent.

Developing countries’ share of rare earth reserves: 62 percent; without China, 19 percent.

World resources: Rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust, but discovered
minable concentrations are less common than for most other ores. World resources are
contained primarily in bastnäsite and monazite. Bastnäsite deposits in China and the United
States constitute the largest percentage of the world’s rare earth economic resources, and
monazite deposits constitute the second largest segment.

Substitutes: Substitutes are available for many applications but generally are less effective.

      Developing countries’ share of silver production: 40 percent; without China, 25 percent.

      Developing countries’ share of silver reserves: 46 percent; without China, 38 percent.

      World resources: Although silver was a principal product at several mines, silver was
      primarily obtained as a by-product from lead-zinc mines, copper mines, and gold mines,
      in descending order of production. The polymetallic ore deposits from which silver was
      recovered account for more than two-thirds of world resources of silver. Most recent silver
      discoveries have been associated with gold occurrences; however, copper and lead-zinc
      occurrences that contain by-product silver will continue to account for a significant share of
      future reserves and resources.

      Substitutes: Nonsilver batteries may replace silver batteries in some applications. Silver may
      be used to replace more costly metals in catalytic converters for off-road vehicles.

       4. Conclusion
      This study aims to build awareness of the critical role that mining and metals will need
      to play in the global zero carbon transition over this century, with a specific focus on the
      position and capacity of mineral-resource-rich developing countries to supply the carbon-
      constrained future.

      It is clear that meeting the Paris climate target of not exceeding 2 degrees Celsius (2°C)
      (and making best efforts to reach 1.5°C) global warming over this century will require
      a radical (that is, to the root) restructuring of energy supply and transmission systems
      globally.1 Furthermore, the technologies assumed to populate the clean energy shift
      (wind, solar, hydrogen and electricity systems) are in fact significantly MORE material
      intensive in their composition than current traditional fossil-fuel-based energy supply
      systems (Vidal, Goffé, and Arndt 2013). Our analysis in Chapter 2 indicates a rapid rise
      in demand for relevant technologies and corollary metals between reaching a 4DS and
      2DS climate objective. Relevant metals demand roughly doubles for wind and solar
      technologies, but the most significant upsurge occurs with energy battery storage
      technologies—more than a 1000 percent rise for metals required for that particular clean
      energy option.

      Key base metals including copper, silver, aluminum (bauxite), nickel, zinc, and possibly
      platinum, among others, are expected to benefit from a low carbon energy shift over the
      century. Key rare earth metals (at least for the three technologies analyzed in depth in this
      study) are neodymium and indium, among others. However, the actual metals that will
      experience dramatic increases is unclear and extremely difficult to predict.

      Furthermore, the form in which metal demand will increase depends on both inter-
      technology choices, such as the balance between wind and solar power, and intra-
      technology choices within particular technologies.

      Regarding intra-technology choices,

      ◗◗ For wind technologies, it is a matter of the eventual mix between geared (onshore) or
         direct-drive (offshore) technologies. To give but one example of the implications for
         metals, direct-drive systems require neodymium, while geared systems do not.

      ◗◗ For solar, it is a matter of the choice between different types of solar photovoltaic
         cells. For example, aluminum and copper feed different solar technologies, with real
         consequences for these metals’ prospective markets over the next few decades.

      ◗◗ However, it is in the area of transportation that the impacts on particular metals’ future
         markets is probably most pronounced. The current three options of electric (lithium),
         hybrid (lead), and hydrogen (platinum) each have their own particular metal needs.

      These choices suggest that the world needs to be prepared to not only meet increased
      overall demand for metals under low carbon scenarios but also to be flexible to meet
      shifting demand for individual metals as these broad choices between and within
      technologies start to narrow through economic and technical developments.


58	
Although many of the resources required to supply carbon-constrained technologies
are prominent in resource-rich developing countries, it is also clear that the level of
geographical data on critical metals, including rare earth metals, is wanting in many
developing countries (Brazil, Chile, China, and South Africa being among the exceptions).
Second, even when reserves have been identified in developing countries, more often than
not, production levels are markedly lower than in more developed countries (for example,
Australia). There are also a number of instances in which critical ore lodes (such as lithium
in Bolivia and the Democratic Republic of Congo) are not sufficiently developed to enjoy
“reserve” status.


Going Forward
This study is a relatively small first step toward identifying future metal trends resulting from
a low carbon future and determining the prospects for developing countries.

Areas for further research or investigation can fall into two categories: policy and
technological.

Policy-related areas of inquiry include the following:

◗◗ Implications for future environmental and material impact performance. Studies on
   commodity implications of a carbon-constrained future typically focus on current reserves
   and the relative level of availability and access to materials to supply clean technology
   production scenarios. However, there is also an increasing sensitivity that supplying
   clean technologies required for a carbon-constrained future could create a new suite
   of challenges for the sustainable development of minerals and resources. Simply put,
   a green technology future is materially intensive and, if not properly managed, could
   bely the efforts and policies of supplying countries to meet their objectives of meeting
   climate and related Sustainable Development Goals. It also carries potentially significant
   impacts for local ecosystems, water systems, and communities. A dialogue is required at
   the national and civil society levels within resource-rich developing countries, between
   the mining-metals and climate–environmental–clean-energy constituencies, to develop
   a path forward that aligns a potential growing market for key commodities with a
   sustainable future.

◗◗ Mapping minerals in developing countries. There is a significant gap in data and mineral
   mapping in many developing country regions, particularly Africa. The U.S. Geological
   Survey provides the most publicly available and sophisticated and updated information
   on commodity production and reserves, but its primary client, naturally, is the U.S.
   government. In addition, the United States, the European Union, and Japan have also
   established nationally funded programs tracking access to and availability of critical and
   rare earth metals that would also play a role in supplying clean energy technologies. No
   such institutional capacity is evident in most developing country regions. Capacity in
   this area is critical for resource-rich developing countries to best benefit from economic
   growth in their respective countries.

◗◗ Predicting technology choice based on supply constraints and demand patterns. As
   documented above, much of the uncertainty relating to the potential demand for many


	                                                                        Chapter 4: Conclusion 	59
        metals arises as much from intra-technology choices as it does from inter-technology
        choices. One likely driving factor for such choices is the availability, and most crucially
        the cost, of key metal inputs. Understanding where supply constraints may lie, and where
        prices are most likely to rise, may help inform the possible direction of some of these
        choices, which, in turn, can help clarify demand.

      ◗◗ Developing networks and raising awareness. One of the outcomes of this analysis is
         the realization that the implications of this work go far beyond the traditional minerals
         and metals community. Linkages should be pursued and facilitated among research and
         social communities, such as

        ◗◗ Relevant developing country governments and programs supporting resource
           extraction

        ◗◗ Climate change and clean energy communities and research organizations.

        ◗◗ Resource development and Sustainable Development research organizations

        ◗◗ Critical metals institutes and associations

        ◗◗ Industrial ecology academic programs

      Technology-related areas of inquiry pertain mostly to expanding the scope of future clean
      technologies. Although the literature review in annex A lightly covers additional clean
      technologies crucial to the low carbon future, more detailed research in each of those
      areas would be critical. Other technology options and transmission modes (for example,
      the infrastructure implications of decentralized grids) are also not included in the Literature
      Review but should be covered. Areas to be covered might include the following:

      ◗◗ Electrical cabling and high-efficiency electric motors. Both copper and aluminum
         have long been used as conductors in electric wire and electric motors. The spread of
         distributed energy generation and electricity access is likely to increase future demand
         for more electrical cabling. However, the demand increase for that cabling and the
         market share of copper versus aluminum cabling are unclear. Similarly, for electric motors,
         multiple studies indicate that motors with copper rotors and stators are more efficient
         than those with aluminum rotors (Kirtley et al. 2009; Waide and Brunner 2011). As the
         need for high efficiency motors increases, the demand for copper for motor applications
         may correspondingly increase, but quantitative projections on this trend are limited.

      ◗◗ Light-weighting of vehicles. Lighter vehicles are more fuel efficient. Creating them might
         involve changing alloy mixtures, replacing steel with aluminum, or replacing metals in
         general with carbon fiber. These substitutions may significantly affect metal demand.

      ◗◗ Energy-efficient technologies and buildings. A large part of any low carbon transition
         would be achieved through the implementation of energy-efficiency measures, including
         new technologies. The metal footprint of such technologies could be substantial, but
         little or no data exist in this area, save for some studies on light-emitting diode (LED)
         lighting.


60	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
◗◗ Transmission and distribution is a vital part of the energy system and is an important
   source of metal demand. Future transmission and distribution systems are also likely
   to look different from those of today, especially if distributed renewable generation
   increases significantly. The literature on the metal intensity of electricity grids is very
   limited, and few scenarios are available for the extent of future investment in grids.
   Further research in this area would be highly beneficial.

◗◗ Metal intensity of traditional and next-generation fossil fuel plants and nuclear
   facilities. Much of the literature focuses on the metal intensity of renewable technologies.
   However, a credible baseline must be constructed to fully understand the impact of a
   shift to a low carbon economy. There is a dearth of literature examining the current and
   potential metal footprint of fossil fuel generation technologies. The inclusion of nuclear
   plants complicates the picture even more because of the complex technological choices
   that are available in this area. The potential metal intensity of carbon capture and storage
   adds even a further layer of complexity because of the lack of commercially operating
   facilities. Further work is required here to create a good understanding of the current
   metal footprint of the energy industry, and what a business-as-usual metal footprint
   might consist of.

◗◗ Metal supply and metal families. The availability and cost of several critical metals is
   complicated by the fact that they are secondary metals found in ores such as bauxite or
   copper for which the primary metal accounts for the main economic value. For example,
   rare earth metals such as indium and germanium are dependent on zinc production,
   and the supply and demand balance for these three metals are, as a result, entangled. In
   short, how will demand for the coproducts drive demand for the base metal?

◗◗ Further work would also be useful with respect to key rare earth metals, with regard
   to both disaggregation capacity for these products (rare earth metals are typically not
   economically or physically retrievable as discrete ores, but often enmeshed with other
   base metals, as mentioned above for zinc) and their geological location. Currently, very
   little mapping of available rare earths in key regions of the developing world, particularly
   Africa, has been undertaken.

◗◗ Recycling rate. The recycling of metals from end-of-life products can improve the future
   availability of those metals, but data on both current and future metal recycling rates
   are often poor. To further this analysis of metal criticality in the energy industry, data on
   current and future recycling rates should be improved.

              . Literature Review
       Annex A
      Two types of studies assess demand for metals in a future low carbon economy. The first
      focuses on transforming the energy system and examines metal demand, and sources of
      supply, for a wide range of low carbon energy technologies. These studies focus on either
      a regional or a global scale. The second category of literature examines individual low
      carbon energy technologies in more detail. These studies outline the different options
      for designing each low carbon energy technology and discuss the metal implications for
      each option. These two types of studies investigate both energy-generating technologies,
      renewable and otherwise, and energy-using technologies such as lighting, vehicles, and
      motors.


      System-Wide Approach
      The U.S. Department of Energy (2011) examines the role of rare earth metals and other
      materials in low carbon energy in the U.S. economy for 2025. The report focuses on a
      number of low carbon technologies, including wind, solar photovoltaics (PV), electric
      vehicles, and lighting, finding that production of these technologies could be disrupted by
      short-term supply challenges for five rare earth metals (dysprosium, neodymium, terbium,
      europium, and yttrium). These metals are critical for producing magnets in wind turbines
      and electric vehicles and phosphors in energy-efficient lighting.

      Similar work in the European Union examines potential supply bottlenecks for abiotic
      and biotic materials (European Commission 2014) and for critical metals in meeting the
      European Union’s Strategic Energy Technology Plan by 2020 (Moss et al. 2011; Moss et al.
      2013). Moss et al. (2011) examine material requirements to produce wind, solar PV and
      concentrating solar power (CSP), carbon capture and storage, nuclear fission, bioenergy
      technologies, and an updated electricity grid. The study finds five metals were ranked
      “critical” for the roll-out of these technologies: tellurium, indium, gallium, neodymium, and
      dysprosium. The follow-up study (Moss et al. 2013) examines further technologies, including
      fuel cells, electricity storage, electric vehicles, and lighting. Eight metals were identified
      as critical for these technologies: dysprosium, europium, terbium, yttrium, praseodymium,
      neodymium, gallium, and tellurium.

      An extensive study by Grandell et al. (2016) examines a number of technologies, including
      wind, solar, fuel cells, batteries, electrolysis, hydrogen storage, electric vehicles, and energy-
      efficient lighting, looking for bottlenecks in the global transition to a low carbon economy
      by 2050. Using a global energy model, the authors find that silver is particularly critical
      for the energy transition and tellurium, indium, and dysprosium to a lesser extent. They
      conclude that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change renewable energy scenarios
      are wanting because they do not consider potential shortages in critical rare earth metals,
      particularly for solar PV and CSP.

      A report by Dawkins et al. (2012) examined the use of five key metals—cobalt, lithium,
      neodymium, indium, and tellurium—in low carbon technologies. Using scenarios from the
      International Energy Agency and the World Economic Forum, they find that the solar PV




62	
industry is most likely to be affected by metal shortages, with severe risks of cumulative
supply deficits of indium and tellurium, moderate risks for neodymium, and limited risks for
cobalt and lithium.

Speirs, Gross, et al. (2014) reviewed a range of modeling studies to examine the evidence
for future demand for and supply of critical metals in the low carbon transition. They focus
their investigation on cobalt, gallium, germanium, indium, lithium, platinum group metals,
rare earth metals, selenium, silver, and tellurium, which are used in key technologies such
as thin film PV, light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen fuel cells,
electric vehicles, CSP, nuclear, and wind turbines. From their review they conclude that
demand for these critical metals is expected to grow significantly; there is little evidence
to suggest that resource shortages are affecting production growth today or will in the
short term, but exponentially rapid rates of production cannot continue indefinitely. The
availability and cost of several critical metals are complicated by the fact that they are
secondary metals found in ores such as bauxite or copper for which the primary metal
accounts for the main economic value. Recycling of critical metals from end-of-life products
can assist in helping future availability but is unlikely to be sufficient to satisfy all demand.



Technology-Specific Studies
This section reviews studies that investigate the metal footprints of key energy-supplying
and energy-using technologies. Many types of renewable electricity generation
technologies could be deployed. Each is at a different stage of maturity. The literature on
the use of metals in renewable electricity generation has, however, focused predominantly
on two technologies: wind and solar power. Many other renewable options exist, such as
hydropower, geothermal, wave and tidal power, biofuels, and hydrogen fuel cells; there is,
however, a dearth of technology-specific literature, although these technologies have been
covered in much of the system-wide literature discussed above. There is agreement in the
literature that there are no anticipated issues for the supply of metals to produce these
technologies in future energy systems.


Wind
Wind energy is transformed to electrical energy by spinning wind turbines that drive
electrical generators. Wilburn (2011) estimates that meeting 20 percent of U.S. electricity
demand from wind by 2030 would require 1.5 million metric tons of steel, 310,000 metric
tons of cast iron, 40,000 metric tons of copper, and 380 metric tons of neodymium, but only
the supply of neodymium may be an issue.

In an investigation into the criticality of various metals for renewable energy technologies
in the European Union, Öhrlund (2012) finds that widespread deployment of wind and solar
PV may significantly increase demand for eight metals: gallium, indium, selenium, tellurium,
dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium, and terbium. Demand for these metals would be
met almost exclusively by virgin raw material extraction.

      Solar Photovoltaics
      Solar PV transforms light energy into electrical energy through the use of semiconductor
      materials. Candelise, Speirs, and Gross (2011) examine the evidence for future potential
      constraints on the production of thin film PV due to limited availability of tellurium and
      indium. Although the authors find little evidence that the supply of either material could
      constrain production, they conclude it may constrain future cost reductions for PV. This
      finding is supported by Houari et al. (2014) who, using a systems dynamic model, find that
      the maximum growth of thin film PV is less constrained by tellurium availability than had
      been estimated by previous studies, such as Andersson (2000).

      The potential for large-scale manufacture of PV and the metal requirements for such
      manufacture are estimated by Keshner and Arya (2004). In response to the possibility that
      metal availability could limit PV production, Wadia, Alivisatos, and Kammen (2009) examine
      extraction costs and supply constraints for 23 potential semiconductor materials, finding
      large differences in material extraction costs between them.

64	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
Fthenakis (2009) highlights that the supply of minor metals used in thin film PV production
may be constrained by the annual production of base metals, but this is unlikely to halt the
most aggressive scenarios for renewable energy deployment. Enhanced recovery during
primary production, recycling of modules at the end of life, and reducing the thickness of
semiconductor layers are anticipated to mitigate increases in demand.

      Concentrating Solar Power
      CSP uses a much smaller range of metals than PV because of the relative simplicity of the
      technology. Light is concentrated with reflectors onto a small area to heat a working fluid,
      which is then used to generate steam to drive an electric generator. The technology has
      been covered in the system-wide approach in both Grandell et al. (2016) and Moss, Gross,
      et al. (2011); both studies highlight the critical use of silver in the reflecting mirrors in CSP.
      See table A.3 for the metals necessary for CSP.


      Carbon Capture and Storage
      Kleijn et al. (2011) highlight that carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies make
      a low carbon energy system more metal intensive. They demonstrate that CCS for both
      gas- and coal-fired power stations are substantially more metal intensive than conventional
      generation, and that a significant expansion of current mining activity would be required to
      make the transition to a low carbon–based power generation system with significant CCS
      capacity. See table A.4 for the metals necessary for CCS.


      Nuclear Electricity Generation
      Peterson et al. (2005) examine the scale of steel and concrete inputs for various types of
      nuclear plant designs. They find that although recently constructed sites show considerable
      increases in steel and concrete inputs compared with designs from the 1970s, next-
      generation reactors show major reductions in steel and concrete intensity compared with
      both designs of the 1970s and current designs. See table A.5 for the metals necessary for
      nuclear generation.


      LED Lighting
      Wilburn (2012) completed a report on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey examining the
      dependence of LED production on rare earth metals and on metals that are the by-product
      of the mining of more common metals. The report identifies arsenic, gallium, indium, and
      the rare earth metals cerium, europium, gadolinium, lanthanum, terbium, and yttrium as
      being crucial to the production of semiconductors for LED. Because most production of
      these metals is currently in China and there is little to no recycling of LEDs, there is potential

      Hybrid and Electric Vehicles
      A variety of different types of hybrid and electric vehicles could become dominant in
      future transportation systems. These include micro-hybrids, full hybrids, plug-in hybrids,
      electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. Most of the research on the metal content of
      electric vehicles is included in the system-wide studies reviewed above. Sullivan, Kelly, and
      Elgowainy (2015) estimate the material composition for the power trains for a plug-in hybrid,
      a fuel cell vehicle, and an internal combustion engine, finding that fuel cell vehicles use less

metal content than plug-in hybrids, which in turn use less than standard internal combustion
engines. These vehicles can use a range of battery technologies, with lithium- or nickel-
based batteries providing propulsion functionality in full hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and full
electric vehicles.

Micro-hybrids are also used widely, especially in Europe, and use lead batteries to provide
start-stop functionality and to store energy from regenerative braking. Full hybrids, plug-in
hybrids, and full electric vehicles also all use a lead battery to power vehicle electronics (for
example, safety and comfort features).

Gruber et al. (2011) focus on one critical metal, lithium, and estimate future supply and
demand through 2100. They focus on the demand for lithium for batteries in electric
vehicles and examine the impact of the creation of a global electric vehicle fleet. Using data
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s growth scenarios and projections
of market penetration from Credit Suisse, they conclude that, even factoring in nonvehicle
demand for lithium batteries, identified reserves are sufficient to meet future demand
until the end of the century. In a later study, Speirs et al. (2014) conduct a similar analysis,
highlighting the wide range of both demand and supply estimates based on uncertainty
regarding material intensity, size of market, and market share. The authors conclude
that lithium demand is likely to grow sharply by 2050 but that existing reserves would be
sufficient to meet demand.

With regard to the availability of materials used in lead, lithium, and nickel batteries,
EUROBAT et al. (2014) conducted a study of the long-term availability of materials used
in battery technologies. This study concludes that there are no current or future resource
availability issues with the materials used to manufacture lead- and nickel-based batteries.
The high end-of-life recycling rates (99 percent in Europe and North American) and the
high recycled content of lead batteries (more than 85 percent) drive this result for lead. The
report highlights some future resource availability issues for battery technologies such as
lithium-ion batteries because of low end-of-life recycling.

See table A.7 for the metals necessary for electric vehicle manufacturing.



Energy Storage Batteries
Batteries are used to store electrical energy not only for electric vehicles, but also in mobile
electronics (mobile phones and laptops), and for decentralized energy storage for electricity
produced with decentralized, intermittent low carbon–generation technologies like solar PV
and wind.1 Although a number of battery chemistries are available, this review focuses on
lithium-ion batteries because they are likely to be a key player in the energy storage market
at sizes relevant for automobiles, mobile electronics, and small domestic energy storage
installations (Kempener and Borden 2015). However, it can be expected that a range of
battery technologies will be used, including lead, nickel, and newer batteries such as flow
batteries. See table A.8 for the metals used in lithium-ion batteries.

Gas Turbine Electricity Generation
Advances in gas turbine efficiency require higher temperature steam, which will change
metal requirements so that the turbine can endure these higher temperatures. Moss et al.
(2013) estimate that increasing efficiency through the use of advanced ultra-supercritical
designs will increase the demand for nickel-based alloys. Table A.9 shows their estimate of
the metal requirements for the nickel-based components of the turbine only. Unfortunately,
comparable data for the turbine composition of the current best available technology is not
available. Moss et al. (2013) also use life-cycle analysis data to estimate the metal content of
the balance of the plant, as seen in table A.10.

      Clean Coal-Fired Electricity Generation
      As with gas-fired electricity generation, more efficient coal-fired power plant designs
      are likely to be more metal intensive for chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, titanium, and
      particularly nickel, as shown in table A.11. These metals are important for constructing
      components that are resistant to higher temperatures and more corrosive environments
      compared with current designs.


72	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
Conclusions on Technologies and Metals to Examine
The purpose of this literature review is to produce lists of energy technologies and metals
to be examined in this project. Table A.12 lists the energy technologies that this literature
review identified as important.

Credible data were found for the energy-generation technologies in the initial list included
in the project proposal: wind, solar PV, CSP, nuclear electricity generation, and CCS. The
ranges for metal use for each of these technologies provide good evidence for different
technology choices within each category.2 For combined heat and power technology,
existing data indicate that metal use will not be substantially different from today’s systems.

For energy-demanding technologies, good evidence of metal use was found for electric
vehicles. Natural gas vehicles and light-weight vehicles were excluded from the study. For
the former, metal use per vehicle is not likely to change significantly from today’s vehicles,
and there is an absence of robust data for the latter. Changes in construction materials were
found to have little effect on metal use.

Lithium-ion and lead-acid battery energy storage technologies were investigated—they
are likely to be the energy storage technology that achieves wide deployment in the study
timeframe, and they have significant metal use implications. Table A.13 lists the metals that
this literature review identified as important for inclusion in this study.

Of the metals that the consultants initially identified for inclusion in the study in consultation
with the International Council on Mining and Metals, iridium, osmium, rhodium, and
ruthenium were not found to have significant use in the energy technologies investigated.
Uranium and thorium, while significant for nuclear technologies, were not included because
of their role as fuel rather than in capital equipment.

      Taking into account all of these technologies, figure A.1 lays out a “median” level scenario
      for key metals that could benefit from a low carbon transition.

      The results of this study were compared with the results of two similar studies, Vidal, Goffé,
      and Arndt (2013) and Kleijn et al. 2011. This comparison confirmed this study’s most basic
      conclusion, that increased penetration of renewable energy supply technologies, carbon
      capture and storage, and energy storage technologies will generally lead to greater
      demand for metal.3

            significantly more impact on metal demand from the deployment of renewable energy and
            related technologies. Vidal, Goffé, and Arndt (2013) conclude that a 5–18 percent annual increase
            in the production of aluminum, copper, and steel would be needed to generate 25,000 terawatt-
            hours of electricity from solar and wind technologies in 2050. Kleijn et al. (2011) assume that,
            in a 2050 scenario in which all primary energy comes from renewables, and where hydrogen
            and electricity are the two primary energy carriers, total global metal demand would increase
            dramatically. In addition to their extreme energy scenario, it includes estimates of metal use
            in hydrogen pipelines and electricity transmission infrastructure; these technologies are not
            included in this study.




76	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
  Annex B: Elaboration of Calculation
  of Energy Storage Battery Scenarios
For the automotive battery energy storage sector, a single scenario was taken from Pillot’s
(2015) projections through 2025. These projections were then extrapolated to 2050. Pillot’s
projection stipulates that lithium-ion batteries will increasingly penetrate the electric vehicle
and hybrid vehicle markets. At the same time, lead-acid batteries will continue to be used
for starting and ignition functions in combustion engine vehicles, and will be increasingly
used in start-stop technology and light-hybrid vehicles. Other automotive battery
technologies, including nickel metal hydride, are projected to lose market share to lithium-
ion and lead-acid chemistries.

Approximately 100 GW of grid-scale energy storage was online worldwide in 2015. Some
99.3 percent of this is pumped-hydro storage, with the remainder, outside of compressed
air energy storage, being almost exclusively sodium-sulfur batteries. The projections for
grid-scale energy storage are based on Inage (2009). Inage’s analysis states that because of
increasing penetration of renewables, “. . . simulations undertaken suggest that worldwide
energy storage ranging from 189 GW to 305 GW would be required.” Furthermore, the
2014 IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (IEA 2014) indicate that up to 500 GW may
be needed by 2050. These figures were converted into GWh of energy storage capacity
by assuming that grid-scale energy storage operates for 12 hours per day before being
recharged for 12 hours. This assumption of a 12-hour run time is supported by data on
current energy storage technologies. As seen in table B.1, the average energy-to-power
ratio of current grid-scale energy storage installations is approximately 12. However, this
ratio varies considerably between storage types. If the technology mix were to change in
the future, the energy-to-power ratio might change as well; this user input can be changed
in the model.

The figures in table B.1 were used to construct three energy storage scenarios to
correspond to the 2DS, 4DS, and 6DS ETP scenarios. These scenarios, 6DS-ES, ­
4DS-ES, and 2DS-ES, assume, respectively, that 189 GW, 305 GW, and 500 GW1 of grid-scale
energy storage output are needed. Decentralized (“behind the meter”) energy storage
was assumed to be 10 percent of grid-scale energy storage in any given year. This is an
approximate projection.

Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI) and Stabilization Wedges (Princeton
Environmental Institute)3
CMI is a project of Princeton University, supported by British Petroleum and Ford Motor
Company, that bases its work on the concept of “sectoral wedges,” first developed by
Robert Socolow in 2004. Socolow proposes a discrete set of wedges that would each work
to avoid (at a minimum) 1 billion tons of emissions per year by 2060. His team proposes
that some 9 billion tons of emissions per year would need to be avoided, calling for nine
wedges. The result would be to keep global emissions flat for the next 50 years, with
continued and significant reductions thereafter. Wedge strategies identified include the
following:

◗◗ Energy efficiency and conservation
  ◗◗ Increased transport efficiency*
  ◗◗ Reduced miles traveled
  ◗◗ Increased building efficiency*
  ◗◗ Increased efficiency of electricity production*
◗◗ Nuclear energy
  ◗◗ Nuclear electricity*
◗◗ Fossil-fuel-based strategies
  ◗◗ Fuel switching (coal to gas)*
  ◗◗ Fossil-based electricity with carbon capture and storage (CCS)*
  ◗◗ Coal synthesis with CCS*
  ◗◗ Fossil-based hydrogen fuel with CCS*


		79
      ◗◗ Renewables and biostorage
        ◗◗ Wind-generated electricity*
        ◗◗ Solar electricity*
        ◗◗ Wind-generated hydrogen fuel*
        ◗◗ Biofuels*
        ◗◗ Forest storage
        ◗◗ Soil storage

      Strategies listed with an asterisk are those that would require a shift or new technologies
      with implications for minerals and metals. It is clear that the vast majority of wedge
      strategies would require mineral or metal inputs. As with most scenarios, CMI provides no
      analysis on the material implications of its wedge strategies for the commodities market.


      Pathways to Deep Decarbonization (Deep Decarbonization Pathways
      Project [DDPP] 2015)
      The DDPP is a “bottom up” analysis that identifies deep decarbonization pathways for
      16 national economies, currently accounting for 74 percent of global emissions. It is bottom
      up in that each country’s deep decarbonization pathway is developed by “at home” experts
      and research institutes. Countries covered include Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France,
      Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United
      Kingdom, and the United States. It also works within a “back cast” framework, setting GHG
      emission reduction targets for 2050, consistent with the 2°C global warming scenario, and
      then examining what each country can do to help meet them. The DDPP’s current work
      establishes potential reductions of 9.8–11 gigatons or 48–57 percent below 2010 levels,
      while still assuming a GDP growth rate of 250 percent between 2010 and 2050.

      Specific technology change is emphasized for decarbonizing electricity, decarbonizing
      fuel production, and alternative vehicle deployment. It is estimated that successfully
      implementing these three measures would result in 3,800 gigawatts (GW) of solar electricity
      generation (at an estimate cost of US$844 billion; 4,100 GW of wind (at an estimated cost of
      US$127 billion); along with 1.2 billion electric, hybrid, and fuel cell passenger vehicles and
      250 million alternative fuel freight vehicles (at an estimated cost of US$911 billion).


      “100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water and Sunlight (WWS) All Sector
      Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World” (Stanford University
      and University of California at Berkeley; Jacobson et al. 2017)
      The scenario with the most extensive breakdown of countries’ potential and capacity to
      transform to a net zero carbon future, this analysis develops roadmaps for converting
      the all-purpose energy infrastructures (for electricity, transportation, heating and cooling,
      industry, and agriculture/forestry/fishing) of 139 countries to ones powered by wind, water,




80	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
and sunlight (WWS) with a conversion to WWS systems of 80 percent by 2030 and 100
percent by 2050. While many will legitimately dispute the claims in the study that such
an abrupt shift—by far the largest such transformation of any peer-reviewed scenario—is
technically and economically feasible, the point of using this scenario is to examine its
consistency with other scenarios in identifying the critical sectors and technologies required
to deliver a net zero carbon future.

In that respect, at a cumulative level, the study estimates that reaching a full WWS
transformation by 2050 would be met mostly through the following major technologies:
onshore wind (19.8 percent or 1.2 million 5 megawatt units), offshore wind (12.7 percent
or 761,000 5 megawatt units), photovoltaics at the utility level (40.4 percent or 503,000
50 megawatt utility-scale units), rooftop photovoltaics (6.5 percent or 779 million 5 kilowatt
units for residences and 42.2 million 100 kilowatt systems), hydropower (4 percent or 0 new
systems), and geothermal (0.8 percent or 840 100 megawatt geothermal plants).

In addition, specific measures with clear implications for technology change and the
minerals and metals that make up those technologies include the following:

◗◗ Development of super and smart grids

◗◗ No new fossil fuel power plants constructed by 2020 (including no nuclear or CCS)

◗◗ All new house and office ware appliances

◗◗ Full electrification and use of hydrogen in all transportation modes including ships, rail,
   and all road vehicles. Small aircraft to be electrified by 2040.



World Energy Outlook Special Report 2015: 450 Scenario (IEA 2015c)
Peer reviewed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
and major developing country national governments, the fourth chapter in this document
lays out a path for the globe to have a 50 percent probability to meet the 2 degrees Celsius
(2°C) global warming target of 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of GHG emissions. In
particular, it proposes three key measures to reach a net zero carbon future:

◗◗ Widespread deployment of low carbon technologies in the power sector

◗◗ Technological advances in industrial efficiency to sharply reduce the GHG emissions

◗◗ Achieving low carbon road transport.

Reforms in the power sector make up more than half of the emissions reductions
required to meet the 450 ppmv target, followed by industry sector reforms (26 percent),
transportation (16 percent), and buildings (6 percent). More specifically, the report identifies




	                                                   Annex C: Deep GHG Reduction Scenarios	81
      three sets of technologies that will be absolutely necessary for a net zero carbon future to
      have any prospects of success:

      ◗◗ Variable renewables: Increase their contribution to power supply from 3 percent today to
         20 percent by 2040 (installed capacity from 450 gigawatts today to 3,300 gigawatts in 2040)

      ◗◗ Carbon capture and storage: Rapid expansion required by, at latest, 2025 (looking
         to capture, cumulatively, 52 gigatons of carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions by 2040 with
         60 percent targeting the power sector, and the remainder heavy industry, including
         cement, iron and steel, and chemicals)

      ◗◗ Alternative fuel vehicles: By 2040, sales of electric vehicles exceed 40 percent of total
         passenger car sales globally. The report also allows for fuel cell vehicles but is not as
         optimistic about their impact in reducing emissions.

      A critical hurdle for renewables to take hold is energy storage, particularly for wind and solar
      energy installations, which is currently, as a technology, at a very nascent stage. Technology
      deployment in this area would need to increase to 400 gigawatts by 2050, which would also
      carry significant implications for metals required to build those batteries.



      Summary for Policy Makers of the Contribution of Working Group 3
      to the Fifth Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel
      on Climate Change (IPCC 2014)
      Working Group 3 of the IPCC is responsible for addressing the mitigation piece of the
      climate change puzzle. As such, it provides a summary of all relevant peer-reviewed
      literature addressing net zero carbon future scenarios and extensive analysis, with discrete
      chapters, of all sectors contributing to GHG emissions and their reduction. The Summary
      for Policy Makers attempts to synthesize the status of the extensive range of research on all
      issues related to mitigation.

      Regarding the 450 ppmv, 2°C scenario, it concludes that substantial reductions in
      anthropogenic emissions will be required by mid-century through large-scale changes in
      energy systems, amounting to 90 percent global reductions from 2010 levels by 2040–70
      and net zero levels by the end of the 21st century.

      Specific sectors identified that will be crucial to achieving reductions cover energy supply
      and energy end-use activities. With regard to the former, electricity is considered to be
      the first key step: the most rapid rate of decarbonization occurs with power supply, with
      low carbon sources (including renewables, CCS, and nuclear) comprising 80 percent of
      power supply by 2050, from the current share of 30 percent. This approach would include
      continuation of renewables as the majority of new installations (a milestone first achieved
      in 2012). Natural gas and bioenergy can play a “bridging role” in this scenario, but only if
      they are accompanied by CCS technologies. Although nuclear can potentially make a large
      contribution, the same degree of confidence in its use is not forthcoming because of a
      number of issues that have contributed to growing adverse public opinion.



82	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
On the energy end-use side, transportation is regarded as a key sector for bending the
GHG emissions trend. Reversing GHGs will be particularly challenging given baseline
projections of a doubling of CO2 emissions from all sources by 2050. At best, the Summary
for Policymakers concludes that emissions from this sector could be reduced by 40 percent
from the baseline projection (still representing absolute growth in GHG emissions). From
a technology perspective, this reduction would be achieved through fuel efficiency and
vehicle performance. Although electric-based power is mentioned, most confidence
is found in its use for trains and public buses over the short term. Electric vehicles and
hydrogen-powered passenger vehicles are constrained by issues relating to energy storage
and the relative low energy density of low carbon transport fuels.

Potential for emission reductions in the building sector can be found in the adoption of low-
energy codes and in the reduction of GHGs through improved technologies in buildings’
heating and cooling systems. Finally, for industry, emissions reductions can be achieved
through energy-intensity improvements via upgrades, replacement, and deployment of
best available technologies.


Summary of Findings
A comparative analysis of these deep GHG reduction scenarios is complicated by the fact
that each scenario uses its own set of matrices to measure what would be required to meet
the intended decarbonized goal. Nevertheless, a number of critical messages common to
all scenarios can help us identify the critical sectors and technologies needed to achieve a
climate-friendly future.

◗◗ The first and most critical sector to address is electricity, or power. All scenarios are
   in strong agreement that the sector most critical to beginning to meet the 450 ppmv
   target, and where the most potential lies for GHG reductions over the most immediate
   term, is the power and electricity sector. All scenarios agree that traditional renewable
   installations (particularly wind and solar) will need to grow by factors of 5 to 10 over
   their current levels by 2050. CCS is identified as a key component in the majority of
   scenarios, contributing GHG emissions reductions comparable to renewables. There is
   considerably less consensus on the potential contribution of nuclear in the power sector,
   with significant concerns raised about its costs, safety, waste disposal issues, and overall
   negative public view.

◗◗ The scenarios exhibit considerably less coherence on the potential of various energy
   end-use categories (transportation, buildings, and industry):

    ◗◗ Transportation is a challenge on two fronts: Expected growth in the sector is so
       strong that the most robust scenarios only envision a reduction in the growth of
       GHG emissions, and not absolute reductions, by 2050. Some posit that absolute
       reductions are possible but only toward the end of the century. Second, confidence
       in the capacity of zero emission vehicles (whether electric vehicles or hydrogen-based
       vehicles) to successfully penetrate the market is moderate, mostly because of
       continued concerns about supporting infrastructure and the battery storage capacity
       issue.



	                                                  Annex C: Deep GHG Reduction Scenarios	83
         ◗◗ The vast majority of reductions related to buildings are intimately linked to
            retrogrades, clean electricity provided to power heating and cooling systems, and the
            advent of “zero emissions” buildings.
         ◗◗ Opportunities for reductions in industry are typically related to energy efficiency and
            use of best available technologies, but interestingly, CCS is regarded as key as well,
            particularly for the cement, iron, steel, and chemical industries.
      ◗◗ Implications and impacts of scenarios do not account for elements required to
         manufacture relevant technologies. The described scenarios typically address issues
         related to economic impacts (for example, GDP), employment, equity, or related
         environmental and social issues. What none address is the potential availability of the
         materials required to service and supply a carbon-limited future—the very point of this
         report.

84	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
   Glossary
2DS 4DS, 6DS: Refers to global warming scenarios over the 21st century of 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and
6 degrees Celsius. In this study, used as reference for determining potential technology and metal
demands until mid-century.

Base Metals: Metals that oxidize, tarnish, or corrode relatively easily when exposed to air or moisture.
Base metals are widely used in commercial and industrial applications. They are more abundant in
nature and therefore far cheaper than precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. Base metals
include aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc.

Bioenergy: Renewable energy from biological sources. 

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Technology that seeks to redirect GHG emissions, especially
carbon, from the atmosphere into Earth’s geological structures. Often regarded as a key technology in
“decarbonizing” fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas.

Carbon Neutrality: See Net Zero Carbon.

Concentrating Solar Power (CSP): Solar power technology that uses mirrors to generate energy.

Critical Materials Initiative (CMI): Based within the U.S. Department of Energy, the CMI is managed
by a number of university-based research facilities focusing on technologies that can diversify the
sources of critical materials (nearly exclusively rare earth metals) required for supporting key modern
technologies, provide substitutes for materials that are in short supply, or improve the utilization of
existing resources through enhanced efficiency in manufacturing and improved recycling.

Electric Vehicles: Road vehicles that use electricity, in the form of battery storage, as power source.

Energy Storage Batteries: A primary technology in energy storage systems intended to manage
power supply to create a more resilient and cost-effective energy infrastructure. For the purposes
of this study, batteries in support of promoting a carbon-constrained future can be divided into two
categories:

    Lead-Acid Batteries are the more mature technology, and have traditionally had a cost advantage
    over lithium-ion batteries. They have poor power-to-weight and energy-to-weight ratios.

    Lithium-Ion Batteries have an excellent energy-to-weight ratio, and prices have decreased
    drastically in the past decade. Typically regarded as crucial for electric vehicles to have any
    prospect of future growth.

Energy Technology Perspectives (see International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology
Perspectives)

Gigawatt-hours (GWh): A unit of energy representing 1 billion (1,000,000,000) watt hours, equivalent
to 1 million kilowatt hours. Gigawatt hours are often used as a measure of the output of large
electricity power stations.

Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): In the context of this report, refers to the major global warming
contributions as a result of human activities, covering carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and
a number of more complex gases with high global warming potential but relatively low production
levels.

Hybrid Vehicles: In the context of this study, refers to road vehicles that use two distinct types of
power: the internal combustion engine and the electric motor.

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): Comprising recognized experts nominated by
national governments, the IPCC assesses the scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information
relevant for the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change.


		85
      International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM): Comprising 23 mining and metals companies
      and 34 regional and commodities associations, ICMM’s mandate focuses on a safe, fair, and
      sustainable mining industry.

      International Energy Agency’s Energy Technology Perspective (IEA’s ETP): Provides an annual
      update on the relative uptake of clean energy technologies in support of climate and sustainable
      energy goals. In 2015, the IEA ETP developed three power technology scenarios for reaching 2°C,
      4°C, and 6°C temperature increases over the century.

      Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs): Technology that emanates light with much less required energy than
      more traditional modes of lighting.

      Micro Hybrid Vehicle: Road vehicles that use regenerative braking technology to stop a combustion
      engine when the vehicle pulls to a stop, and to restart it when the driver accelerates.

      Net Zero Carbon, or Carbon Neutrality: Refers to a measured amount of GHGs released into the
      atmosphere balanced by an equivalent amount sequestered or offset, so that the net impact of the
      emissions in the global atmosphere is zero. There is strong consensus among experts that achieving
      the Paris goal of keeping the increase in global temperature to well below 2°C, would require the
      globe to become carbon neutral within this century, possibly by 2050.

      Paris Agreement: Global agreement negotiated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate
      Change in 2015 in which, for the first time in 25 years of negotiations, all countries agreed to
      undertake efforts to combat climate change. As such, it charts a new course in the global climate
      effort. The Paris Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate
      change by keeping the global temperature rise this century well below 2° Celsius above preindustrial
      levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5° Celsius. 

      Photovoltaic (PV): Solar energy technology that produces energy typically through the use of solar
      panels as conduction materials.

      Precious Metals: Metals considered to be rare or that have a high economic value. The higher relative
      values of these metals are driven by various factors, including their rarity, uses in industrial processes,
      and as investment vehicles. The most popular precious metals with investors are gold, platinum, and
      silver, and precious metals used in industrial processes include iridium, which is used in specialty
      alloys, and palladium, which is used in electronics and chemical applications.

      Rare Earth Metals: A set of 17 chemical elements in the periodic table, typically associated with
      elements that play a key role in supporting technologies associated with the modern economy—
      from the miniaturization of electronics, to the enabling of green energy and medical technologies,
      to supporting a myriad of essential telecommunications and defense systems. While named “rare
      earths,” they are in fact not that rare and are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust and tend to occur
      together in nature and are difficult to separate from one another and other base metals. However,
      because of their geochemical properties, rare earth elements are typically dispersed and are not often
      found concentrated as rare earth minerals in economically exploitable ore deposits.

      Reserves and Resources: In the context of this study refers to status of mineral deposits in geological
      formations. Resources typically cover a broader estimate of potential mineral outlays, while reserves
      are more formally defined and carry more detailed data. For more information, please refer to
      chapter 3 of this report.

      Solar Technologies: Technologies providing power supply through the use of energy from the sun that
      can be divided into four subcategories:

          Crystalline Silicon cells make up about 85 percent of the current market. They can either be
          manufactured as single crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous silicon.




86	   The Growing Role of Minerals and Metals for a Low Carbon Future
    Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) is a “thin film” solar technology. It can be made into
    cells that are thinner than crystalline silicon, and thereby may reduce material and manufacturing
    costs while allowing for flexible cells.

    Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) is another thin film technology. It is cost competitive with crystalline
    silicon and has good efficiency. However, the toxicity of cadmium and the future supply of
    tellurium make the future of this technology uncertain.

    Amorphous Silicon or Amorphous Silicon-Germanium solar cells are the final thin film technology
    considered here. These cells suffer from lower performance than crystalline silicon, but are able to
    be printed on flexible materials.

Start-Stop Vehicles: Motor road vehicles which systems automatically shut off the engine when the
vehicle is at rest and the restarts the engine automatically when the driver lifts off the brake or puts in
the clutch to select 1st gear.

Terawatt-Hour (TWh): A metric measurement unit of power. The terawatt is equal to 1 trillion watts
(1012W).

United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCC): The multinational negotiating body for
addressing climate change.

United States Geological Survey (USGS): An agency within the U.S. Department of Interior, the
USGS’s main responsibilities are to map public lands in the United States, examine geological
structures, and evaluate mineral resources both within the United States and globally. The USGS’s
mandate has expanded over the past few decades to cover research related to groundwater,
ecosystems, environmental health, natural hazards, and climate and land-use change. In 2012,
it established an Energy and Minerals Mission Area with a mandate to conduct research and
assessments on the location, quantity, and quality of mineral and energy resources, including the
economic and environmental effects of resource extraction and use.

Wind Technologies: Refers to technologies providing power supply through the use of wind. Wind
technologies are divided into two broad categories:

    Geared Turbines, which are typically found on land-based wind turbines and use a system
    of gears to convert the relatively low rotation speed of the turbine to a much higher speed
    (thousands of revolutions per minute) for the generator. Geared turbines use coil-driven
    generators that use significant amounts of copper, but do not have permanent magnets.

    Direct-Drive Wind Turbines are typically offshore installations and do not have a gearbox, so
    they generally feature greater reliability than geared models. However, they do use a more
    complicated and expensive low-speed generator, which is generally constructed with permanent
    magnets containing rare earth metals.
