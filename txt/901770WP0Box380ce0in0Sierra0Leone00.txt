Local Technical Assistant mainstreaming
The Local Technical Assistant mainstreaming team in
HRMO encountered difficulties as the restructuring
proposal for MOFED with the agreed organization,
positions and grades had not yet reached the Re-
grading Committee for approval and the revised policy
had not been approved by the Civil Service Steering
Committee. There is strong resistance within pockets
of the government to approving this document, for
example in the MOFED, where there are many Local
Technical Assistants. The document is not aligned with
the incentives of LTAs as it would likely mean large
pay-cuts for those who are currently Local Technical
Assistants. This DLI is not on track in this project, and
had already been cancelled from a previous World
Bank lending project for inclusion within the P&P
project. It is a long-standing and highly political issue
that requires a strong desire to make progress on, and
focused attention to do so.

Program Contributions
The World Bank Leadership Practice provided day-to-
day support to the rapid results coaches with strategic
guidance as needed to facilitate changes in planned
actions for priority areas of civil service reform. Adap-
tive leadership training and team-building activities
were designed to help staff in key agencies overcome
challenges and advance results. n
