Preface

          The objective of this report is to update the Government of Bangladesh, think
          tanks and researchers, the general public as well as the Bank’s senior management
          on the state of the economy, outlook, risks, progress on structural policy reforms
          and key challenges the economy is currently facing. The coverage includes
          developments in the real sector focusing on growth, inflation, and poverty;
          external sector developments focusing on the balance of payments, foreign
          exchange reserves and the exchange rate; fiscal developments focusing on revenue
          mobilization, public expenditures, and deficit financing; financial sector
          developments focusing on credit and interest rates; and monetary developments
          focusing on reserve money and broad money growth trends. The update also
          covers an assessment of Bangladesh’s prospect of graduating out of the LDC status
          and eligibility for concessional financing from the World Bank and the Asian
          Development Bank.

 Executive Summary




Bangladesh economy has maintained its progress on a 6 plus percent growth path, notwithstanding many external and
internal challenges. Headline inflation has decelerated, largely reflecting international commodity price declines; lending
rate declined modestly despite large excess liquidity; and the nominal exchange rate has remained stable while reserves
have reached new heights. Revenue and development budget implementation shortfall continue to haunt fiscal policy
while overall monetary management has remained cautious. The financial sector woes showed no sign of waning.

GDP growth                  For the second time in last three decades, GDP growth is estimated to have
surpassed 7 percent         exceeded 7 percent, driven on the supply side by services and on the demand side
in FY16, according to       by rise in public investment and consumption expenditures. Services and public
preliminary official        consumption growth largely reflected the impact of the public sector pay increase.
estimates.                  Private investment rate has continued to stagnate. The contribution of private
                            investment to GDP growth declined from 1.5 percentage point to 1.3 percentage
                            point.

                            The 7 percent official growth estimate is not easy to reconcile with growth related
                            indicators such as remittance, exports, industrial production, import of industrial
                            raw materials and capital machinery, tax revenue collection, and ADP
                            implementation, among others. The question is not about whether the
                            Bangladesh economy has done well. It has demonstrated resilience to internal and
                            external headwinds time and again. The question is about whether the official
                            estimate is consistent with other growth related indicators and whether the
                            resilience of growth can be sustained without getting the private investment rate
                            out of the recent 21-22 percent of GDP trap.

Macroeconomic             Headline inflation has moderated considerably. The external position remains

sustained.                kept the taka/US$ rate stable and restrained reserve money growth. Monetary
                          targets undershot due to restrained growth in domestic credit. Banking sector still
                          limping. The challenges confronting the state-owned commercial banks (SCBs)
                          and the specialized banks (SBs) are particularly daunting.

Budget deficit is         Revenue collection in FY16 is most likely to fall short of the target for the fourth
rising.                   consecutive year. Public expenditure is expected to be lower than the planned
                          budget size. However, the budget deficit in FY16 is likely to rise with revenue
                          shortfall exceeding the usual expenditure shortfall. While the deficit will remain
                          within sustainable thresholds, the composition of domestic financing of deficit
                          has continued to shift from low interest to high interest sources.

Structural reforms        The 7th Five Year Plan, the government’s medium-term development strategy

                          approved by the government. The nontransparent practice of changes import
                          tariffs through SROs has continued as did additions of several new projects in the
                          already stretched ADP portfolio.

Global outlook from Bangladesh perspective is mixed. Income growth prospects in Bangladesh’s main export markets
are uneven, but sustained low oil prices bode well on balance for external and internal balance. With modest fiscal
expansion and some easing of the infrastructure bottleneck, GDP growth is projected to rise towards 7 plus percent,
albeit gradually.

Financial and political shocks constitute the main risk to the outlook. Growth has remained constrained by
infrastructure bottlenecks, shortage of power and primary energy, absence of investment friendly climate and lack of
reform continuity. Structural reforms and public investment effort need to be intensified to overcome these impediments
in order to enhance the country’s growth opportunities.

                           overruns, delays, failed procurement, or unavailability of private financing are
                           common.Most overruns are foreseeable and avoidable.

Competitiveness            Apart from infrastructure, there are also regulatory constraints, highlighted by the
needs strengthening.       non-enviable ratings the country gets in international benchmarking exercises.
                           While the government has made progress in easing several regulatory constraints,
                           additional steps would help. They include: i) the enactment of rules under the
                           Civil Procedures Code (CPC) regarding mandatory mediation of civil and
                           commercial cases; ii) the approval of the new Customs Act; iii) the approval of the
                           new Companies Act (and the associated rules and regulations); and iv) the
                           approval of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution Act. Note that some
                           of the key obstacles to greater private sector efficiency are related to access to land.
                           Efforts to remove this bottleneck through the creation of industrial zones are
                           helpful, but the multiplicity of zones and oversight agencies with overlapping
                           roles at times undermine such efforts.

Financial sector           Weak bank balance sheets and governance failures limit lending capacity, divert
weaknesses further         credit away from productive investment, and, in the case of SBs, impose large
drag investment.           fiscal recapitalization costs. High levels of non-performing loans and the high

                           funding costs, putting upward pressure on interest rates. Priorities in the financial

                      graduating from IDA, the Asian Development Fund and Least Developed Country

                      concessional finance, access to technical assistance and preferential market access

 A. Recent Development




The Bangladesh economy has maintained its progress on a 6 plus percent growth path, notwithstanding many external
and internal challenges. Headline inflation has decelerated, largely reflecting international commodity price declines;
lending rates have declined modestly despite large excess liquidity; and the nominal exchange rate has remained stable
while reserves have reached new heights. Revenue and development budget implementation shortfall continue to haunt
fiscal outcomes while overall monetary management has remained cautious. The financial sector woes showed no sign of
waning.

GDP growth                 The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics released preliminary estimates of GDP growth

in FY16, according     is estimated to have exceeded 7 percent, driven on the supply side by services and

official estimates.    (Figure 1). Services contributed 3.4 percentage points to the estimated 7.05
                       percent growth in FY16, followed by manufacturing contribution of 2 percentage
                       points. Services alone contributed 0.4 percentage points out of the 0.5 percentage
                       point increase in FY16 GDP growth relative to FY15. Of this 0.4 percentage
                       points, 0.3 came from increased value added in public administration and defense
                       and education sectors, reflecting the impact of a very large public sector pay
                       increase implemented this year. On the demand side, private consumption
                       remained the largest single source of growth, although its contribution declined
                       from 3.8 percentage points in FY15 to 3.5 percentage points in FY16 (Table 1).
                       The contribution of public investment nearly doubled from 0.8 percentage points
                       in FY15 to 1.5 percentage points in FY16 while the contribution of private
                       investment declined from 1.5 percentage point to 1.3 percentage point.1

Sustaining 7 percent   Taking the 7 percent official estimate at its face value, sustaining it will be a
growth will be a       challenge since the boost out of the “6 percent trap” came largely from an increase
major challenge.       in growth resulting from the public sector pay increases. Private investment rate is
                       estimated to have declined from 22.07 percent of GDP in FY15 to 21.78 percent in
                       FY16. There are limits to sustaining such high growth just through better
                       utilization of existing production capacity. Without growth in productive
                       capacity, aggregate demand stimulus through fiscal expansion cannot indefinitely
                       increase growth. It is necessary to deal with supply-side factors such as the
                       responsiveness of technological change and investments to public policies.

Remittances have       With the decline in crude prices impacting the fortunes of oil exporters, remittances
weakened.              from workers from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to Bangladesh appears
                       to have been hit already. The Middle East is home to a large Bangladeshi diaspora and
                       the six GCC countries—Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
                       Arab Emirates—account for around 68 percent of Bangladeshi workers abroad. The
                       majority of migrant workers in GCC countries are low-skilled that include
                       construction workers. Predictably, remittances from Bangladeshis abroad are correlated
                       with investment demand in the Gulf countries, which includes spending on
                       construction projects. Bangladesh’s remittances amounted to around $15.3 billion in
                       2014-15, which was 7 percent higher than the level of remittances the year before.
                       About 64 percent of this growth came from GCC countries. However, in the first
                       seven months of FY16, total remittances declined by 1.1 percent. Decline in
                       remittances from GCC countries constituted nearly 2.2 times the total decline.
                       Historically, we find a fairly strong correlation (0.65 statistically significant coefficient)
                       between oil price and remittances from GCC countries.

Decline in share of    Growth in agriculture is estimated at 2.6 percent in FY16 with its share declining
agriculture has        from 15.5 percent in FY15 to 14.75 percent. FY16 has been relatively free from
continued despite      political unrest. Crop cultivation did not suffer as farmers got necessary inputs

                       1
                           It is difficult to understand where the BBS estimate of Tk 1313. 8 billion public
                           investment (in current prices) is coming from. Total capital expenditure in the FY16
                           central government budget is Tk 957.7 billion, not all of which is likely to be actually
                           spent. Expenditures budgeted for the state owned nonfinancial enterprises is Tk 284.9
                           billion, of which around 80 percent is capital expenditures. This leaves unexplained
                           about Tk 125 billion. It is implausible to assume local governments have the capacity
                           to finance investment of this size from outside the central government budget.

healthy production.      and could market their products in urban and semi urban areas without any
                         disruption. Aus and aman rice have been harvested, and boro plantation has been
                         completed. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) has set the target for
                         food grain production at 36.42 million metric tons (MT) for FY16 of which 35.02
                         million MT is for rice and 1.4 million MT for wheat, up by almost 1 percent from
                         the previous year’s actual production. Nearly 54 percent of the rice production is
                         expected from boro.2 Total area coverage for both aus and amanalmost reached
                         the target. Ausproduction has been targeted at 2.48 million MT for FY16 which is
                         more than 6 percent higher than the actual production last year. The
                         Amanproduction target has been fixed at 13.56 million MT which is about 3
                         percent higher than for the previous Amanseason. Although planting had been
                         hampered by erratic rain and floods, this target for Amanis expected to be
                         achieved. The total acreage of boro is expected to be 4.7 million hectares,
                         compared with 4.84 million hectares last year. Farmers are reportedly finding
                         growing wheat, potato and maize more profitable than boro.

recent years and         GDP in FY16. Over 17 million people are involved in the fish sector. Fish
continue to have         production in the country has been increasing to keep up with the growing
significant potential    demand at home and abroad for around a decade. According to the Department
for growth.              of Fisheries (DoF), the country produced 3.55 million tons of fish in FY15 and
                         3.45 million tons in FY14. For gearing up the production of fish, the government
                         has set up 120 hatcheries in different parts of the country to provide training to
                         the people and hatchery owners. The government also set a target to produce 4.52
                         million tons of fish by FY21. Proper utilization of the existing water bodies using
                         the latest technologies could boost fish production.

                         resources such as land to be diverted to expand the non-agricultural production

from both the                recent years. This weak global demand for imports affected not only Bangladesh
demand and supply            but also other exporting countries with a similar export basket. Domestic market-
sides.                       oriented enterprises also faced slow demand growth due to deceleration in the
                             growth of per capita income in recent years, in part due to slower growth in
                             remittances. Supply side factors affected production of both domestic and export-
                             oriented industries. These factors include: reduced export orders to factories that
                             do not comply with safety regulations (located mainly in shared buildings); real
                             exchange rate appreciation vis-à-vis those of competing economies such as India,
                             Vietnam and Indonesia; reduced supply and low pressure of gas; and a continued
                             lack of adequate infrastructure facilities. A perception among entrepreneurs that
                             infrastructure facilities are a key constraint has not changed much during recent
                             years, except a perception about the availability and quality of electricity.

                             sales have declined significantly over the last two years. Excess supply has forced
                             realtors to slash apartment prices by about 15-30 percent on average to
                             reinvigorate the depressed property market. According to the Real Estate and
                             Housing Association of Bangladesh (REHAB), around 14,000 ready flats worth
                             about Tk.120 billion are unsold. Sale of apartments fell as much as 60 per cent in
                             2013 and the situation is still unchanged. There are more than 2 million people
                             working in this industry and their livelihood depends upon these apartment sales.

                         production remained low because of gas shortage and also because some power
                         stations were shut for maintenance.While short-term actions for power crisis
                         management have contributed to sustaining growth, the longer term issues of
                         sustainable power and energy supply remain unresolved. This includes sustainable
                         development of local coal and gas where progress is almost non-existent. The
                         government has set a target to generate 24,000 mw electricity by 2021. With this
                         goal in view, the government increased the number of power plants, transmission
                         lines and distribution lines. To reach the target, the government would
                         concentrate on building big base-load power plants to generate electricity from
                         coal as it eyes producing 50 percent of the total electricity from coal. Furthermore,
                         the government would take up more large-scale renewable power projects. Also, the
                         government has decided to establish three new divisions - coal, renewable and
                         independent power producer (IPP) - to ensure smooth implementation of energy
                         projects. The government is also working to increase electricity import from
                         neighboring countries under regional cooperation and now giving priority to
                         import from Nepal and Bhutan. Addressing the inadequacy of primary energy
                         remain a key priority (Box 1).

The 7 percent official Is 7.05 percent a plausible growth estimate for FY16? One way to judge this is to
growth estimate is     ask what evidence is there from the high frequency growth correlates that can
difficult to reconcile justify the view that growth in FY16 has been 0.5 percentage points higher than
                       growth in FY15. As shown in the Table-2 below, with the sole exception of exports,
                       every other indicator grew significantly less in FY16 than in the corresponding
                       period of FY15. It is true that the large wage increase in the public sector has both
                       direct and indirect impact on growth. But the wage increase has not been fully
                       rolled out (and had not been at all by end-January, due to administrative delays)
                       and it would take an implausible degree of financial sophistication on the part of
                       both consumers and lenders for the future expected wage increase to translate fully
                       into actual consumption.

                                              Box 1: Towards Efficient Energy Pricing
 Energy pricing reform needed for attracting investments in primary energy. Bangladesh’s electricity market is
 a vertically integrated natural monopoly in the public sector. The electricity pricing policy is politically sensitive
 because prices are administered while the providers are public monopolies. Economic performance of these public
 enterprises is not satisfactory. Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and Bangladesh Petroleum
 Corporation (BPC) are the top two losers among the SOEs. The government has taken initiatives to involve
 private enterprises in the energy sector and has planned to mobilize private and joint venture investment during
 the Seventh Five Year Plan period. The most critical challenge is to diversify the energy-mix for electricity
 generation. New technologies raise the prospect of increasing the supply of onshore gas, providing clean and
 cheap energy for electricity generation. But Petrobangla lacks the technical capacity, making it necessary to attract
 investors with state-of-the-art technology into exploration and exploitation. However, natural gas tariffs in
 Bangladesh have been regulated at very low levels, which has led to abandonment of some very large gas
 development projects, exacerbating gas shortages. The tariffs were not adjusted between 2009 and September
 2015—except the tariff for compressed natural gas (CNG) for automotive use, which was raised twice in 2011. The
 2015 tariff increase was an encouraging step, but it did not affect fertilizer and power plants, which account for
 nearly half of the total gas consumption, and they continue to pay a mere US$1 per thousand cubic feet (mcf).
 Energy pricing policy needs to be reformed to encourage efficiency in production and use of primary energy.
 This is also an opportunity for shifting taxes on petroleum products so as to reduce carbon emissions.
 Negative externalities from energy use are substantial.Underpricing of oil products reduces incentives for
 investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. The high levels of vehicle traffic that are encouraged by
 subsidized fuels also have negative externalities in the form of traffic congestion, higher rates of accidents, road
 damage, and environmental pollution. While there are a very few countries globally that have reacted or made any
 efforts in this direction, Bangladesh as a global leader on protecting the climate – along with having among the
 world’s lowest fiscal revenue as a share of GDP – can set the direction of taxation reforms intended to reduce
 carbon emissions and raise additional public resources.
 A carbon tax would be a fiscally prudent measure to accomplish this goal. A carbon tax is a levy on the
 carbon content of fuels (principally coal, oil, and natural gas) that generate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions when
 burned. The tax typically applies at a specific rate per ton of coal, per barrel of oil, or per million cubic feet of
 gas, with the amounts adjusted to equalize implied taxes on carbon content. The rationale of such a tax is to
 reduce the greenhouse gas emissions primarily responsible for climate change.

                                     FY11 and FY14 (Table-3). GDP growth was 6.5 percent in FY12 when
                                     power generation growth reached the highest 12 percent. In FY16, power
                                     generation is projected to grow 10.4 percent, but GDP growth is estimated
                                     at unprecedented level.

                              could have come from either accelerated implementation of high priority public

The debate is not             Bangladesh is among the top 12 countries (with a population of 20 million or
about the resilience          more) out of 118 countries, who are likely to have achieved the 6 plus percent

                        The debate should rather focus on the sustainability and inclusiveness of the
                        growth process. Bangladesh is largely a private sector driven economy. Of the
                        total 60 plus million people in the labor force, 95 percent are employed in the
                        private sector. Bangladesh needs to increase the production capacity in the private
                        sector to absorb the 2 million new entrants in the job market every year. If it
                        cannot provide the existing and new entrants more and better jobs, growth will
                        fail to be inclusive. Without a rising investment rate in the private sector, quality
                        job creation will be in jeopardy. Hence, the immediate challenge for the country
                        is to sustain the growth.

                      percent in February 2016. However, nonfood inflation has picked up by 2.8
                      percentage points during this period to 8.5 percent (year-on-year). Against general signs
                      of weak demand, this uptick likely reflects one-off factors, including higher minimum
                      wages in the garment industry, large pay increases for public employees and hikes in
                      electricity and gas tariffs. Despite sustained lower international oil prices, domestic
                      retail fuel prices have not been reduced. The persistence of high inflation in an
                      environment characterized by declining commodity prices reflects the influence of
                      supply side bottlenecks and lack of pass-through of international prices to domestic
                      prices. Bangladesh’s current inflation target of 6.1 percent is higher than its trading
                      partners. India for instance has set a target of 4 percent, with a band of plus or minus
                      2 percentage points.

 Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)interbank messaging system and used the necessary codes to
 authorize SWIFT transfers. Among 35 transfer orders, five transfer orders worth of $101 million slipped through.
 Of this, $20 million was sent to Sri Lanka in favor of a NGO but the money was not disbursed because the
 NGO's name was wrongly spelled in the transfer order. The rest, $81 million was transferred to Philippines
 banking system to 4 accounts of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC). A Philippines Senate panel
 hearing held on the money-laundering investigation suggested that US $81 million ended up with at least one
 local casino and two gambling junket operators via a local businessman’s bank account.
 The US Federal Reserve Bank of New York ruled out the breach on its systems because the payments were vetted
 through the "standard authentication protocols”. Forensic investigation found that hackers installed a malware in
 the BB network, gathered the bank's confidential information and stole the money. The powerful malware
 destroyed the system on the computers itself, which are used by the officials to make transfer orders. It also
 destroyed data on the printers.
 After this incident BB Governor Dr. Atiur Rahman resigned and two deputy governors in charge of overseeing
 payment system and IT operations and communications were asked to resign. The government appointed
 FazleKabir, former Finance Secretary and Chairman of state-run Sonali Bank Ltd. as the new governor of
 Bangladesh Bank. The government has appointed a three-member panel, headed by former Bangladesh Bank
 Governor Mohammed Farashuddin, with a computer scientist and an Additional Secretary as members. The
 committee will examine the appropriateness of the steps taken by the Bangladesh Bank to prevent the payment,
 the reasons behind hiding the information on the heist from higher authorities, the possibility of getting back
 the stolen money, and suggest measures to prevent such incidents in the future.
 Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit (BFIU) is working with the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) of
 the Philippines to recover the money. Two engineers of SWIFT have come to Bangladesh to review its servers with
 the central bank. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID)
 has also started to investigate. Moreover, BB has written to Bangladesh representative to the United Nations, the
 Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, and the Philippines authorities for helping to get the money back.
 BB has requested assistance from the World Bank concerning the return of “stolen” assets. Along with others, the
 World Bank is working with Bangladesh Bank in their efforts to recover the stolen assets. The World Bank has
 been supporting BB to strengthen the financial sector (including a stronger cyber security in the Banking sector).

The banking sector            The Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking sector improved slightly as per
still limping.                BASEL II standards, but this increase in industry level CAR can partly be
                              attributed to a relaxation in the large loan rescheduling requirements introduced
                              by Bangladesh Bank (BB) for a specific period. A number of banks also failed to
                              maintain the regulatory capital this year, and the insolvency of the State-Owned
                              Commercial Banks (SCBs) significantly worsened. The asset quality of the overall
                              banking sector deteriorated, even though a number of banks took advantage of the
                              regulatory letup5 and rescheduled their possible candidates of large non-
                              performing loans to report lower NPL figures. Banking sector efficiency showed a
                              declining trend and their profitability showed a mixed result. Overall,
                              Bangladesh’s banking sector continues to struggle with large and uneven interest
                              rate spreads, high non-performing loans (NPLs) and uneven competition. Of late,
                              cybercrimes have begun to infiltrate as well (Box-2).

The challenges                Financial discipline of these banks was undermined by scams, high NPLs and
confronting the state-        inadequate capital followed by repeated recapitalization. Classified loans in the
owned commercial              banking sector increased during the third quarter of FY15 to 10.5 percent of total
banks (SCBs) and the          outstanding loans but declined in the fourth quarter to 9.7 percent of total
specialized banks             outstanding loans (Table 6). Despite the decline in classified loans at the end of
(SBs) are particularly        the fiscal year, the SCBs faced capital shortfall which in turn created additional
daunting.                     fiscal pressure for the government. The government provided Tk. 26.17 billion for
                              recapitalization of SCBs in FY15. It is understandable that large banks like the
                              Sonali Bank are too big to be allowed to fail. They need recapitalization in order
                              to continue their regular operations. However, it is important to harden their
                              budget constraints so that they complete a clean-up of all bad loans by a specified
                              date (Box-3).

 accumulated losses arising from the difference in market and book value of assets. These amounts are deducted from state-owned
 commercial banks' assets and regulatory capital. From June 2015, Bangladesh Bank started adjusting away these accumulated losses
 from banks' capital position. Additional adjustments to capital is made based on information from Bangladesh Bank for banks that
 availed themselves to the temporary relaxation in loan rescheduling rules between December 2013 and June 2014.

                                          Box 3: Linking Recapitalization with Reforms
Unconditional recapitalization provides no incentive for doing some deep surgery to repair the banks’
damaged balance sheets. The amount sought for recapitalization in FY17-18 is nearly $1.3 billion, equivalent to
0.6 percent of FY15 GDP. This is a huge burden on the budget. The Banking and Financial Institutions Division’s
(BFID) Annual Performance Agreement (APA) should have specific indicators on the solvency of each state-owned
banks (SCBs) seeking recapitalization. Disbursement from the budgetary provisions for recapitalization should be
linked to achieving the specified improvements in these indicators. Over the longer term, rising stress in the sate-
owned banks will require more radical reforms in the structure of governance of the SCBs. The fundamental
problems with the SCBs are the interdependence between banks and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the way that
banks are run as SOEs, and government’s improper influences on the operations of SOEs and banks. Also, many
private industrial companies have been hit by delays in making their investment projects operational due to
unavailability of basic utility connections such as gas, water and electricity, leaving them unable to repay loans to
SCBs. Though these problems have been around for a long time and are deeply rooted, they have never really been
solved. Without a thorough reform of the SOEs and the way that banks are run as SOEs, the problems with the
banking system will remain, even after the banks are fully or partially relieved of current NPL.

                      generally down mood of the market is clear from the fact that during January

                                         sufficient to offset weak revenue performance. As a result, the fiscal deficit
                                         (excluding grants) is estimated to have risen to 4.2 percent of GDP in FY15,
                                         compared with 3.5 percent in FY14. Although the share of external and domestic
                                         financing of budget deficit remained stable, the composition of domestic
                                         financing shifted significantly towards much costlier sources, particularly the
                                         National Savings Certificates (NSC).

Revenue collection            During the first seven months of FY16, National Board of Revenue (NBR) revenue
in FY16 is most               collection was 14.5 percent higher than the corresponding period of FY15 (Figure
likely to fall short of       10), well behind the 42.2 percent target for the whole year. NBR revenue will have
the target for the            to grow by 43.9 percent during February-June 2016 relative to the same period in
fourth consecutive            2015 to achieve the FY16 NBR revenue target. Such revenue in the last five
year.                         months of a fiscal year has not happened in recent memory.8 Non-tax revenue
                              collection of NBR and outside NBR have also not been very promising. There are
                              a number of reasons behind the shortfall in revenue collection: (i) the budget
                              target was overambitious to begin with, particularly in view of lackluster revenue
                              collection performance in FY15; (ii) international prices fell significantly for a
                              number of imported commodities, while the exchange rates against currencies of
                              major trading partners appreciated; (iii) a number of tax incentives provided in
                              the budget, including lower corporate income tax rate for publicly traded
                              companies, significant reduction in custom duties and supplementary duties,
                              adjustments as regards income tax rate at source for all export items from the
                              originally proposed rate of 1 percent (to 0.6 percent for both RMGand non-RMG
                              exports) and withdrawal of the proposed 2 percent advanced income tax (AIT) on
                              import of essential commodities; and (iv) administrative capacity and revenue
                              collection effort did not see any major improvement and the reform agenda failed
                              to gain any visible momentum. Much will also depend on Bangladesh
                              Telecommunication Regulatory Commission’s (BTRC) success to hold the auction
                              for mobile spectrum fee for 2G and 3G and subsequently its ability to collect the
                              installments by the end of this fiscal year. .

                implementation of the ADP, particularly that of growth enhancing infrastructure
                projects, remains a top policy priority. The carryover projects that could perhaps
                be completed by FY16 have not progressed fast enough. Further cost and time
                overruns for these priority projects cannot be ruled out.9 The ability to implement

The global outlook from a Bangladeshi perspective is mixed. Income growth prospects in Bangladesh’s main export markets
are uneven, but sustained low oil prices bode well for external and internal balance. With modest fiscal expansion and some
easing of the infrastructure bottleneck, GDP growth is projected to rise toward 7 percent, albeit rather slowly.

                            Kingdom (2 percent), and accelerated in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and
                            Malaysia. Global manufacturing activity was subdued through 2015, growing at nearly
                            half the pace observed during the previous five years. Services activity has been more
                            resilient, partly supported by robust consumer spending.

                            Weak growth among major emerging markets will weigh on global growth in 2016,
                            but economic activity should still pick up modestly to a 2.9 percent pace, from 2.4
                            percent growth in 2015, as advanced economies gain speed.11 Simultaneous
                            weakness in most major emerging markets is a concern for achieving the goals of
                            poverty reduction and shared prosperity because those countries have been
                            powerful contributors to global growth for the past decade. Spillovers from major

                         emerging markets will constrain growth in developing countries and pose a threat
                         to hard-won gains in raising people out of poverty. Global economic growth was
                         less than expected in 2015, when falling commodity prices, flagging trade and
                         capital flows, and episodes of financial volatility sapped economic activity. Firmer
                         growth ahead will depend on continued momentum in high income countries, the
                         stabilization of commodity prices, and China’s gradual transition towards a more
                         consumption and services-based growth model. Developing economies are forecast
                         to expand by 4.8 percent in 2016, less than expected earlier but up from a post-
                         crisis low of 4.3 percent in the year just ended. Growth is projected to slow further
                         in China, while Russia and Brazil are expected to remain in recession in 2016. The
                         South Asia region, led by India, is projected to be a bright spot. The recently
                         negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership could provide a welcome boost to trade.

Monetary                 In response to deteriorating global growth prospects and financial market turmoil,
accommodation            major central banks have adjusted their monetary policy stance towards further
likely to continue.      accommodation. After hiking policy rate in December, the Federal Reserve
                         indicated in February that it was closely monitoring external risks and the impact
                         of market turbulence on U.S. growth. Combined with evidence of declining
                         inflation expectations amid sharply lower oil prices, this has reduced the
                         likelihood of further hikes in coming months. Markets are now predicting that
                         policy rates will remain at current low levels well into 2017. The Bank of Japan at
                         the end of January joined the European Central Bank, the Danish National Bank,
                         the Swedish Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank in implementing negative
                         policy rates. In February, the share of European and Japanese government debt
                         trading at negative yields rose to record levels, accounting for respectively 34
                         percent and 55 percent of bonds traded. While supporting favorable financing
                         conditions, the combination of negative rates, large excess reserves, and low long-
                         term yields could undermine the profitability of banks by narrowing net interest
                         margins and revenues from traditional maturity transformation activities.

                         pushed OPEC’s output to a record 32.65 million barrels per day in January. U.S. shale
                         oil production is falling slowly, proving more resilient than expected due to efficiency
                         gains and cost reductions. Other producers are also maintaining output, despite sharp
                         cutbacks in investment.12 On the demand side, the January assessment of the
                         International Energy Agency anticipates slower growth in global demand for oil in
                         2016, following weak seasonal demand in the northern hemisphere. For 2016, prices
                         are expected to remain low, on average at $37 per barrel.

                       (Angola, Azerbaijan, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Russia), which in some cases
                       have been met with the imposition of foreign exchange controls (Azerbaijan, Nigeria).
                       Other challenges include accelerating inflation, tighter monetary policy (Colombia,

Narrowing                      Pressures on external balances, inflation, and government budgets are easing for
vulnerabilities and            oil importers. The lower price of energy imports has helped narrow persistent

                               high income countries. Fiscal balances have improved among several oil importers
                               (Egypt, India, Pakistan, Turkey, as well as Bangladesh), as budgetary outlays on
                               subsidies fall. In this context, several countries, both oil exporters (due to fiscal
                               pressures) and importers have sought to eliminate or reduce fuel subsidies. Gains
                               in consumer purchasing power, however, have not been able to offset the
                               weakening of global demand for goods and services in much of the world.

                               Growth is projected at 6.8 percent in FY17 on the back of further increase in
                               government consumption as the increased benefit package for government
                               employees is implemented, increase in public investment, and a recovery in private
                               investment, as regulatory and infrastructure constraints are eased and creditor

                               7). Despite the recent REER appreciation, Bangladesh retains a sizeable labor cost

                               producers move up the value chain. With the tapering of public pay increase in
                               FY18, growth is projected to fall back to 6 percent.

                               Inflation is expected to edge up in FY16–18 on account of higher public sector
                               wages, a one-off effect from the introduction of the new VAT, and overheating
                               with actual growth exceeding the potential growth rate. Private sector credit
                               growth is expected to average around 15.5 percent over the medium term, with its
                               share in GDP increasing by 2 percentage points to 40 percent by FY20. This is
                               consistent with the envisaged investment and GDP growth paths, and also with
                               pre-credit boom trends (prior to FY06) and cross country patterns of financial
                               deepening. On the back of investment-led growth, the current account deficit is
                               projected to widen to about 2 percent of GDP over the medium term.

Monetary policy                The overall monetary policy stance announced in the January 2016 MPS
continuity                     maintains policy continuity. Nominal GDP growth is unlikely to exceed 13.3
maintained.                    percent in FY16. Thus, the revised 14.3 percent reserve money and 15 percent
                               broad money growth targets are more than adequate to accommodate the
                               projected 6.8 percent real GDP growth and 6.07 percent inflation target for FY16.14
                               There was no reason to risk excessive divergence between nominal GDP growth
                               and the growth of broad money. The revised broad money growth target reduces
                               this divergence. Perhaps BB could have been a bit more ambitious in lowering the
                               inflation target below 6 percent.But then without favorable developments on the
                               supply side such a decrease in domestic petroleum prices, an inflation target well
                               below the previous year’s level is incongruent with a GDP growth target well above
                               both the previous year and also the economy’s potential growth rate.

Policy rates reduced.          The revised stance on policy rates provides a signal to bankers to expand private
                               credit by reducing lending rates. Demand for repo has been weak, understandably
                               so because of large excess liquidity in the system. Banks apparently are more
                               interested in parking their excess cash in reverse repo. The offered amounts in
                               reverse repo have far exceeded the amount accepted in recent auctions. Given that
                               the overall balance of payments is projected to have a large surplus, reserve
                               accumulation may have to continue for a while to prevent further erosion in the
                               competitiveness of the real effective exchange rate. This would require continued
                               sterilization. To avoid the adverse impact on the profits of the Bangladesh Bank,
                               this was an opportune time to reduce the reverse repo rate and correspondingly
                               the repo rate. These reductions signal to the banks to be more proactive in finding
                               bankable projects to lend in the private sector. There is not much more to this
                               than just the signaling aspect.15Even if the banks do not pass on the lower interest

                          Funding shortfall can result from careless lending too. BB will need to be careful
                          in accepting repo bids from poorly managed banks. The MPS does recognize that
                          some the recent rise in NPLs are “alarming” while assuring BB “will not be lenient

                          sterilized foreign exchange market intervention is warranted in the near term to
                          prevent further erosion in competitiveness which could eventually impact growth,
                          tax revenue, and bank asset quality. BB should monitor foreign exchange market
                          developments and export performance, and adjust interventions as needed. BB
                          should also consider using a basket of trading partners’ currencies as a benchmark
                          for such intervention, instead of implicitly pegging to the U.S. dollar alone. Given
                          the importance of the euro area as an export market, this would provide a better
                          basis for monetary and exchange rate policy. Arresting the trend of an
                          appreciating REER will require measures other than nominal depreciation of the
                          taka. These include reducing the inflation rate and the nominal rate of protection.

                                         Box 4: Small Savings Scheme Reform in India
On March 18, 2016 the Government of India cut interest rates on deposit schemes offered by the Government to
provide a risk-free investment option to households. The reduction across various schemes, ranging between 40bp
and 130bp, came into effect on April 1, 2016. From now onwards the interest rates on small saving schemes will be
reset on a quarterly basis, based on the average month-end Government security rates of comparable maturity in
the preceding three months. For example, for the Apr-Jun quarter, interest rates were based on Dec-Feb month-end
Government security rates.
This will be helpful in two ways:
x First, it should improve monetary policy transmission. Banks frequently cite the high small savings rate as
     competing away their bank deposits. Therefore, lower small savings rates, along with marginal cost-based
     pricing of loans from April 2016, should facilitate an improvement in monetary policy transmission (lower
     lending rates).
x Second, lower small savings rates will lower total accretion into these small savings schemes and increase
     government reliance on other sources of financing, especially market borrowings, to finance their fiscal deficit.
     However, this should reduce the interest burden for the central government as interest paid for borrowing
     from the National Small Savings Fund is higher than market rates.
Overall, the move to deregulate small savings rates is a win-win for both the government and the banks. It will give
banks greater flexibility to lower deposit (and lending) rates in tandem with falling inflation, while lowering the
interest burden for the government at the margin. While consumers will receive lower nominal interest on their
savings, greater monetary policy transmission into lower lending rates over time will benefit consumers and
corporates, boosting growth.

                          VAT. While public debt is moderate, its trajectory is highly vulnerable to revenue
                          shocks given the low revenue base and high debt service burden. The debt-to-GDP
                          ratio is projected to increase slightly and then stabilize as concessional external

                           Box-4 for information on how India has recently reformed rate setting on small
                           saving schemes). If NSCs are continued, their rates should be aligned with market
                           rates. Forced subscription of treasuries by banks (“devolvement”) need to be
                           eliminated. There is room to resort to more external financing for the fiscal
                           deficit, given the relatively low level of external debt, healthy reserve position, and
                           manageable currency risks.

Financial and political shocks constitute the main risk to the outlook. Growth has remained constrained by
infrastructure bottlenecks, shortage of power and primary energy, absence of investment friendly climate and lack of
reform continuity. Structural reforms and public investment effort need to be intensified to overcome these impediments
in order to enhance the country’s growth opportunities.

risks to the outlook.      affect fiscal sustainability, as would a failure to launch the new VAT. On the
                           external side, a protracted slowdown in the European Union (Bangladesh’s main
                           export destination) could hurt exports. Implementation of the Trans-Pacific
                           Partnership (TPP), of which Bangladesh is not a member, could also erode the
                           competitiveness of exports to TPP member countries (which account for around
                           one-fourth of Bangladesh’s exports), though the impact is likely to be moderated
                           by Bangladesh’s significant cost and scale advantages. Moreover, the outlook for
                           remittances (a major driver of consumption) is uncertain: while worker outflows
                           have recovered, persistent low oil prices could eventually affect investment and
                           employment in key host countries. While previous oil price shocks had limited
                           and short-lived effects on remittances, the current more pronounced and
                           prolonged decline coupled with fiscal tightening in many oil-exporting countries
                           is likely to hurt migrant worker earnings and consequently remittances. From a
                           broader perspective, natural disasters and global climate change pose major risks
                           for Bangladesh. Linkages with large emerging market economies and international
                           financial markets remain limited, cushioning against potential shocks from these
                           sources.

                           risk.

Private investment and growth remain constrained by disabling regulations, infrastructure deficiency,
financial sector weaknesses and political uncertainty.

                           Disabling regulations and continued bottlenecks in critical infrastructure, particularly in
                           energy and transport, may have become more binding in recent years as the
                           economy becomes more market-oriented. This is reflected in the non-enviable
                           rankings Bangladesh gets in international benchmarking exercises (Table-7). These
                           constraints stem in part from low public investment and inadequate infrastructure

                       often resulting from the fact that private investors cannot fully appropriate the

                       September 2015, paving the way for greater private participation in infrastructure
                       development. It would now be important to move quickly to draft regulations
                       and guidelines which can accelerate the use of PPPs in practice. This said, private
                       participation alone will be insufficient to address Bangladesh’s wide infrastructure
                       gap. A majority of investments in transport, or in river management, will require
                       public funding. But this is bound to be challenging in a country where tax
                       revenue amounts to less than one-tenth of GDP. To address this constraint it is
                       necessary to focus on both indirect and direct taxation.

                       Contrary to the standard pattern, participation in global value chains is not driven
                       by FDI companies or foreign diaspora. Yet, the country has not succeeded so far

                              Strengthening the SBs by: (i) appointing independent but accountable boards and
                              enhancing internal control and compliance; (ii) shoring up SB balance sheets
                              through recapitalization conditional on improved loan recovery and temporary
                              credit growth limits; and (iii) speedy completion of branch automation to
                              strengthen financial reporting and efficiency.

                              Enhancing financial sector regulation and supervision, by strictly enforcing existing
                              rules and avoiding regulatory forbearance; and completing implementation of risk-
                              based supervision, contingency planning, and lender of last resort policies. Loan
                              rescheduling and restructuring policies should reflect the costs of such
                              adjustments on bank balance sheets. Adoption of a coherent macro-prudential
                              framework to mitigate risks and shore up financial sector resilience should also be
                              considered.

                Improving the legal and financial framework for loan recovery. Difficulties in realizing
                collateral and lengthy dispute resolution processes have weakened banks’ ability to
                bring down non-performing loans. It is critical to institute simpler court

                Addressing risks from concentration and macro-fiscal linkages. It is important to reduce

                Political turmoil and uncertainty. Episodes of violence have affected economic
                activity both directly and via uncertainty. This appears to be reflected in subdued
                private sector credit growth. Credit growth slowed since mid-2013, with the private
                credit-to-GDP ratio below trend. However, causality also runs from weak domestic
                demand to slower credit because of uncertainties.

D. Bangladesh’s Path to Developed Country Status




Bangladesh moved into lower-middle income status (LMIC) in 2015, when the FY14 GNI per capita reached $1,080.
This follows a commendable social and economic performance over the last decade. If fast and shared economic growth
continues, Bangladesh can hope to step up the ‘development ladder’ further, including graduating from IDA, the Asian
Development Fund and Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Bangladesh will need to maintain its economic
momentum as it slowly loses the benefits it gains from its LMIC and LDC status. These include access to concessional
finance, access to technical assistance and preferential market access for its exporters. The focus topic below discusses
Bangladesh’s path to Developed Country status and some of the policies that can help guide the country along the path.

                            Bangladesh attained lower middle income status in 2015 thanks to strong
                            economic and remittance growth. Experience of other countries suggests that the
                            next step up will be tough. In a recent study, Felipe, Kumar and Galope (2014)17 of
                            the Asian Development Bank found that it takes the average lower middle income
                            country over half a century to reach upper-middle income status.18 The average
                            country moves from upper-middle to high income in just 15 years. But these
                            averages disguise two groups of countries: fast-growers, and slow-growers.
                            Bangladesh will need to keep working hard to make sure it is in the first group.
                            As Bangladesh succeeds, its access to external resources to finance development
                            and the other benefits it receives – notably preferential market access – may come
                            under pressure. While this may not be an immediate risk, it matters.

Post-independence           Bangladesh has achieved significant success in economic and social indicators
economic and social         since independence. When it joined the group of Least Developed Countries
successes…                  (LDCs) in 1975, Bangladesh was a post conflict, agrarian economy with a
                            population of 72 million, a GNI per capita of $200, and weak links to the global
                            17

                                 Lower-middle income was defined as $2,000 per capita income at 1990 purchasing
                                 power, upper-middle income defined as $7,250 and high income as $11,750.

                       economy. In the 40 years that have followed, the population has more than
                       doubled to around 156 million, GNI per capita has increased by more than five
                       times, industries other than agriculture – notably ready-made garments (RMGs)
                       have thrived, and Bangladesh has much stronger linkages to the global economy.19
                       Bangladesh has already met several MDG targets including attaining gender parity
                       at primary and secondary education (attaining a ratio of 1.1 girls to boys, 2013),
                       reducing under-five mortality (38 per 1000 of the population, 2015), containing
                       HIV infections with access to antiretroviral drugs (45 percent of the population,
                       2012), increasing the proportion of children under five sleeping under insecticide
                       treated bed nets (to 92.2 percent in 13 high risk malarial districts, 2014), detecting
                       and curing tuberculosis (to 53 percent, 2014). In addition, Bangladesh has made
                       remarkable progress in the areas of poverty reduction (6.5 percent poverty gap,
                       2010), reducing the prevalence of underweight children (32.6 percent of children
                       under the age of 5 years, 2014), increasing enrolment at primary schools (97.7
                       percent, 2014), lowering the infant mortality rate (32 per 1000 live births, 2013)
                       and maternal mortality ratio (170 per 100,000 live births), improving
                       immunization coverage and reducing the incidence of communicable diseases.20
                       Many of these improvements have been achieved using domestic resources but
                       Bangladesh has also benefited from a considerable amount of overseas
                       development aid (ODA). In addition, a private sector that benefits from
                       preferential market access to developed economies has helped to increase output
                       and employment growth, particularly of women, driving social change.
                       These improvements are reflected in the fact that Bangladesh graduated from low-
                       income to lower-middle income on 1st July, 2015. This graduation was the first
                       step of a long ladder out of least developed country status. The country has the
                       potential for three more graduations: second – to graduate from the group of
                       countries receiving International Development Aid (IDA), third – to graduate
                       from the group of countries receiving assistance from the Asian Development
                       Fund (ADF) and fourth – to graduate from Least Developed Country (LDC)
                       status, and on to even higher status. But these continued successes would mean the
                       help Bangladesh receives in terms of aid and market access would shrink little by
                       little as resources are diverted toward less successful countries.

…with a little help While graduation from IDA, ADF and LDC status will reflect an improved quality
from my friends     of life for Bangladeshis, this growth will come with challenges (Box 5). In
                    particular, Bangladesh will need to come to terms with slowly reduced
                    development aid, or aid with hardened conditions. Increased debt servicing costs
                    will, among other things, require higher and more diversified sources of revenue
                    for the Government and/or a higher return public investments that increase
                    productivity, growth and incomes.

                           Box 5: Counting up the benefits from IDA, ADF and LDC status
 Benefits from Asian Development Fund (about $2.78 billion over 3 years)
 Bangladesh, as an ADB blend (Group B) country, receives both highly concessional ADF and less concessional
 Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). In the period between 2016 to 2018 the indicative resources available for
 sovereign operations amount to $2.78 billion of which ordinary capital resources (OCR) is $1,502 million and
 Asian Development Fund resources is $1.276 billion with a tentative annual Technical Assistance program that
 averages about $3.7 million a year in the same period (see ADB Country Operations Business Plan, Oct. 2015). As
 an OCR beneficiary, Bangladesh has already started the transition of reducing its dependence on highly
 concessional loans.
 Benefits from International Development Assistance (about $3.9 billion over 3 years)
 Bangladesh is the largest recipient under the 17th replenishment of IDA. Its financing envelope accounted for 9
 percent of IDA resources (about $3.9 billion) in the FY15 to FY17 cycle. While not yet a blend country,
 Bangladesh’s low risk outlook means that IDA resources are administered as highly concessional loans.
 While graduation from IDA is not imminent, it is something that Bangladesh should aim toward as it will reflect
 improving living standards. Graduation from IDA will bring positives and some things to be dealt with.
 Assuming that Bangladesh’s low risk outlook continues, upon graduation Bangladesh will have access to a
 broader range of sources and borrowing instruments. With the need for IDA much diminished, accelerated
 repayments are triggered once Bangladesh is judged creditworthy for IBRD borrowing and its per capita GNI
 exceeds the IDA threshold for three consecutive years. Should Bangladesh not be judged creditworthy, as a blend
 country, it will be able to access IDA resources but in lower volumes and on harder terms than currently. In the
 event that Bangladesh's income per capita continues to improve (beyond the threshold) but its debt risk outlook
 deteriorates, it would not be eligible for IBRD assistance either as a blend country or as an IDA graduate. It
 would instead be classed as a “gap country” and the terms of IDA loans are hardened – increased servicing cost
 and shorter loan periods.
 Benefits from Least Developed Country status
 LDC specific support provides Bangladesh with five principal benefits:
 Access to concessional foreign assistance - with 0.15-0.2 percent of GDP of OECD countries allocated to LDCs
 Preferential market access - duty and quota free market access on goods and services exported under the
 Everything-But-Arms arrangement
 Priority access to technical assistance for capacity building - research, policy analysis and advice, advocacy,
 support relevant intergovernmental processes
 Flexibility in the implementation of different international agreements - in the areas of trade, intellectual
 property, standards, etc.
 Reduced financial obligations - budget caps for LDC contributions to regular budgets of international
 institutions – United Nations (UN) Secretariat, International Labor Organization (ILO), United Nations
 Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) etc. – and access to
 a special travel funds providing financial assistance to attend UN and World Trade Organization (WTO)
 meetings
 LDCs can continue to receive some of the special and differentiated treatment for six to nine years after
 graduation to assist the transition to developing country status. In practice this would mean that if Bangladesh
 meets the LDC graduation thresholds in 2018, it would not be until 2024 (at the earliest) with no transition
 period or 2027 that special and differentiated treatment will stop.


                         Similarly, Bangladesh will need to develop a more diversified external sector to
                         capture greater value added from the global value chains that Bangladeshi
                         exporters are linked to. While room to expand within Bangladesh’s conventional
                         growth drivers – principally the RMG sector – exists, a more sustained exit from
                         LDC status will be more likely if Bangladesh can diversify both what it exports as
                         well as who it exports to. A duel strategy of capturing more value added from
                         RMG exports while at the same time developing new export products and markets
                         will strengthen Bangladesh’s resilience to global shocks, enhance macroeconomic
                         stability and preserve growth trends as preferences are withdrawn.

How dependent is                                Net ODA as a percentage of GDP has fallen from around 6 percent at the time of
Bangladesh on the                               joining the group of LDC to about 1.3 percent in 2015 (Figure 12). However, as a

                                               With one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios globally at 10-11 percent of GDP and
                                               the current number of taxpayers being only 1.2 million in recent years in a
                                               country with a population of 160 million, the Ministry of Finance has recognized
                                               the need to take action. Also with investment accounting for about 40 percent of
                                               total government expenditures, the government needs to address institutional
                                               capacity issues to utilize the increasing level of unused foreign aid, although this
                                               stems partially from an increasing aid pipeline (Figure 13).
                                               As a percent of exports, ODA is about 10 percent. While this has halved since
                                               2001 it still remains significant, and replacing the value of ODA with increased
                                               export revenues would prove a challenge given Bangladesh’s dependence on a
                                               narrow range of export products as well as export markets.
                                               Merchandise trade is important to Bangladesh and accounts for about 45 percent
                                               of GDP. Exports of goods and services, of which 90 percent are manufacturing,
                                               account for 17 percent of GDP. Of exports, three-quarters are ready-made
                                               garments. In the past 15 years earnings from this sector have increased over eight
                                               times with growth averaging about 16.5 percent per annum. While export sectors
                                               other than RMG - jute and shrimp - have also been important to Bangladesh,
                                               export values are at much lower levels.
                                               By destination, two-thirds of Bangladesh’s exports are sold to European Union
                                               (EU) and United States (US) and while garments are exempt from US preferential

                      the Everything-but-Arms (EBA) agreement. The EU accounts for 28 percent of all
                      woven exports and 92 percent of all knitwear exports from Bangladesh. Together
                      woven and knitwear RMG account for 80 percent of Bangladesh’s total exports.
                      One of the biggest risks to Bangladesh’s development progress for the next five
                      years is a sudden loss in its competitiveness in RMG exports. A removal of EBA
                      would cause substantial economic disruption for Bangladesh. The challenge faced
                      by Bangladesh in the next decade will be one of diversifying exports and markets
                      so that when least developed country benefits, particularly trade preferences, are
                      phased out Bangladesh has built sufficient resilience to preserve prosperity.
                      Reduction of other LDC benefits may also have an impact. The impact of
                      removing priority access to technical assistance for capacity building, flexibility in
                      the implementation of different international agreements, and reduced financial
                      obligations, will be important though this may not be as significant as the benefit
                      Bangladesh receives from ODA and particularly trade preferences.

The road to           Despite the challenges ahead, Bangladesh should continue to chart its
developed country     development course. As it becomes wealthier and moves through the graduations,
status may be long.   some of the challenges discussed above will become lighter, as more domestic
                      resources (public and private) are created and channeled into development.
                      Bangladesh graduated from low-income to lower-middle income 40 years after
                      becoming an LDC. This graduation was the first step of a long ladder out of least
                      developed country status. In the next 12 years Bangladesh has the potential to
                      graduate from the group of countries receiving IDA, the group of countries
                      receiving assistance from ADF and LDC status, and on to even higher status.
                      While exiting from low-income status means that Bangladesh passed the GNI per
                      capita threshold of $1,046 set by the World Bank on 1st July 2015, graduating
                      from IDA, ADF and LDC status will require sustaining, and even surpassing, this
                      performance across a broader set of targets. As the graduation criteria become
                      more stringent each year Bangladesh must also outpace future movements in these
                      thresholds. Here, we assess where Bangladesh is relative to current thresholds.

Graduation from       Countries with a per capita income of less than $1,215 (as of FY15) qualify for
International         IDA. As a country approaches this threshold, IDA will undertake an assessment to
Development           determine whether graduation procedures should begin.22 The process of
Assistance (IDA).     graduation would normally take five years, although the World Bank adopts a
                      flexible approach to facilitate a sustained exit from IDA.

                      x    For IDA countries in which there is a strong case for graduation, a graduation
                           program is formulated in the Country Partnership Framework (CPF), under
                           which the World Bank and the government agree on areas of cooperation.
                           This comprises a phase-out of IDA lending, a phase-in of IBRD lending,
                           special economic and sector work studies and technical assistance to help

                           In the case of India, exceptional transitional support was agreed by IDA Deputies in
                           the IDA17 replenishment discussions. To be eligible India needed to have a GNI per
                           capita below the historical ceiling ($1,985), was able to show a strong forward agenda
                           on poverty reduction, and demonstrate a marked reduction in new IDA commitments
                           from the World Bank.

                      With a GNI per capita of $1,080 and a low risk outlook, Bangladesh is an IDA-only
                      country with 100 percent of its allocation administered as concessional loans by the
                      World Bank. Currently its income per capita level is still some way below the
                      threshold of $1,215 (and the threshold increases over time) and although it has a low
                      risk outlook, it has yet to be judged suitable for IBRD loans and therefore blended
                      assistance. Before reaching the graduation threshold for IDA, Bangladesh may first
                      become a blend country, as it is already classed by the Asian Development Bank.

Graduation from       Similar to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank operates two forms of
Asian                 financial assistance - the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and regular Asian
Development Fund      Development Bank assistance/ordinary capital resources (OCR). Beneficiaries of
(ADF).                these funds are classified into three groups - Group A (ADF only), Group B (Blend
                      Countries) and Group C (OCR only) - determined by two criteria - GNI per capita
                      and creditworthiness. Bangladesh is currently classified as a Group B blend
                      country, which allows it to receive a mix of ADF and OCR financial support.
                      The ADB uses the same income threshold as the World Bank. Graduation from
                      ADF resources is normally triggered when a country exceeds the per capita GNI
                      threshold and achieves adequate creditworthiness for OCR. Graduation involves
                      close consultation with the beneficiary country. The process of graduation
                      normally takes about four years to complete, after crossing the income threshold.
                      As the ADB follows the same income threshold as IDA, Bangladesh is still below
                      the threshold of $1,215. However, unlike the IDA, Bangladesh is already classified
                      as a blend country allowing it access to both ADF and OCR financial resources. It
                      is therefore developing its credit history with the bank and capacity to take on
                      future OCR finance on more commercial terms.

Graduation from       Every three years the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) reviews the
Least Developed       list of LDCs based on recommendations from the Committee for Development
Country (LDC)         Policy (CDP). The CDP assesses LDCs against three criteria - income, human
Status.               development and economic vulnerability. Countries recommended for graduation
                      must fulfil two of the three graduation criteria or have a GNI per capita of at least
                      twice the graduation threshold level.

                           Accelerated payments of IDA loans are triggered when a country is creditworthy for

                           eligibility for 3 consecutive years.

                              graduation threshold. The graduation threshold set for the 2015 review was

                              is used to measure a country's stability both in terms of the degree to which
                              they are exposed to stress and the potential impact from trade and natural
                              shocks.26 Countries with an Economic Vulnerability Index of 32 or less meet
                              the level set for graduation for this threshold.

                              In the LDC review of 2015 Bangladesh scored 25.1 for the Economic
                              Vulnerability Index (EVI), 63.8 for the Human Asset Index (HAI) and had a 3-

                              Bangladesh met only one of the three graduation thresholds - EVI - and will
                              need to wait until 2018 before it can be assessed again for graduation.

                         x    GNI per capita threshold - Bangladesh is still some way from meeting this
                              threshold. In the years FY14 to FY16, Bangladesh would need to achieve an
                              average GNI per capita of at least $1,242. With FY14 GNI per capita at $1,080,
                              Bangladesh would likely need to surpass the $1,242 threshold in both FY15
                              and FY16 to bring the average up to the new higher threshold set for 2018.
                              Assuming that the income threshold remains unchanged, Bangladesh would
                              therefore need to surpass recent levels of income growth to achieve this goal in
                              2018. 2021 seems more likely and if Bangladesh is able to meet the thresholds
                              set for the Economic Vulnerability Index and Human Asset Index it will have
                              more time to meet the income per capita threshold.

                              impact of a shock, the EVI takes into account the country's trade openness as well as
                              past impacts from natural shocks measured by the number of victims in past events
                              and degree of resilience in agricultural production.

                                   graduation in 2018 if it is able to sustain its performance on economic
                                   vulnerability and improve human development. Table 10 shows that in the
                                   2015 review Bangladesh was close to meeting the graduation threshold set for
                                   the HAI. As Table 11 and Table 12 show, Bangladesh needs to address human
                                   development shortfalls in the areas of adult literacy, the secondary school
                                   enrolment rate and nutrition if it is to comfortably meet the HAI threshold in

graduation…                 the objective for Bangladesh will be to sustain this performance. If Bangladesh can
                            improve on this score in 2018, it is likely that this will be sufficient to pass the
                            threshold. This would definitely be the case if the threshold of the EVI decreased
                            by the same amount between the 2012 and 2015 reviews (36 to 32 respectively).

 … fromIDA and               There are two thresholds relevant to IDA and ADF graduation – income and
 ADF?                        creditworthiness. Graduation is not mechanistic and relies on careful case-by-case
                             evaluations. The eligibility and graduation criteria are constructed around the
                             concept of relative poverty, as measured by GNI per capita below the IDA
                             operational cut-off and the absence of creditworthiness. Countries typically move
                             from IDA-only, to IDA-gap to IDA-blend and then to IBRD-only. Similar to the
                             threshold set for middle income status, graduation proceedings are set in motion
                             when an IDA or ADF beneficiary (including blend countries) GNI per capita
                             exceeds the threshold. This has been set at $1,215 for FY15.

                          A positive assessment of IBRD creditworthiness is required to reclassify a country
                          from IDA-only to blend status (IDA/IBRD). Once a country has been declared
                          creditworthy for IBRD, IBRD financing is phased in gradually. The assessment of
                          creditworthiness is based on a rigorous evaluation of eight broad components,
                          namely political risk, total external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public
                          debt burden, balance of payment risks, economic structure and growth prospects,
                          monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and corporate sector
                          debt. The second criterion relevant to graduation is the level of Bangladesh’s
                          creditworthiness. Since the ADB assesses Bangladesh to be a blend country, the
                          ADB finds Bangladesh as having the capacity to take on ADB debt on regular
                          ADB/OCR terms.

                      amount.28 Bangladesh is unlikely to meet the income threshold for LDC graduation
                      until 2021 (Table -13)

   Human              Bangladesh has met the Millennium Development Goal indicator for under 5
   Development        mortality, but has some way to go on making sufficient progress on nutrition,
                      adult literacy and secondary school enrolment to improve its HAI score. Some of
                      these indicators are more slow-moving than others (for example, adult literacy).
                      However, Bangladesh may be able to make faster progress on secondary school
                      enrolment and nutrition.
                      In the absence of the individual scores associated with the four indicators which
                      make up the HAI, it is only possible to infer from the performance of
                      comparators (or now somewhat dated MDG assessment) what more Bangladesh
                      needs to do in each of these three areas. Graduation, however, is not mechanical.
                      It is preceded by detailed impact assessment and vulnerability profile. The views
                      of the country are also taken into consideration.

Policies to sustain   Over the time period of these graduations, the Bangladesh economy will evolve. In
growing income for    the three forthcoming graduations there exist in-built transition mechanisms to
Bangladeshis          facilitate Bangladesh’s smooth and sustained exit. However, these transition
                      measures alone are not enough and the GoB, civil society and donors will have a
                      role to play to help shape the economic structure of Bangladesh allowing it to
                      replace existing channels of concessional finance and trade support with
                      sustainable alternative sources of finance. The direct effects of these graduations
                      will be felt in terms of aid flows, trade flows, debt and debt-servicing costs,
                      institutional contributions and other forms of technical assistance. Bangladesh has
                      already highlighted the way forward through investment-led growth in its Seventh
                      Five Year Plan. Currently the investment rate is below what is needed to increase
                      growth to 8 percent by the end of the Plan period. Its strategy for increasing
                      public, private and foreign investment in Bangladesh is ambitious. Achieving this
                      higher level of ambition would require modernizing the country’s infrastructure;
                      increasing the availability and affordability of energy; and boosting the country’s
                      overall competitiveness.
