       The Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) is a voluntary
    partnership of governments, businesses, and civil society organizations
    that works to catalyze action toward the successful design and
    implementation of carbon pricing initiatives around the world, helping
    maintain competitiveness, create jobs, encourage innovation, and
    achieve meaningful emissions reductions. Launched in 2015 at
    COP 21, the Coalition brings together leaders from government and
    business to build the evidence base for successful carbon pricing;
    to mobilize business support; and to have constructive dialogues,
    country by country, about how to advance effective carbon pricing. 25       i

Definition of carbon pricing: For the purpose of the State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report series, and also
applicable to this brief, carbon pricing refers to initiatives that put an explicit price on greenhouse gas emissions. This
includes emissions trading systems, offset mechanisms, carbon taxes, corporate carbon pricing and results-based
finance, using a metric directly based on carbon (i.e. price per ton of CO2e). Policies that put an implicit price on
carbon, for example removal of fossil fuel subsidies, fuel taxation, support for renewable energy, and energy efficiency
certificate trading, are not included as they are outside the scope of this brief.
