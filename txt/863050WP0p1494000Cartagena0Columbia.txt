Cartagena: A Dynamic Cultural and Industrial City
The District of Cartagena has a population of around one million inhabitants and has experienced
rapid growth with the population doubling over the last two decades. Due to its history and
spectacular natural scenery, Cartagena is Colombia’s largest tourist area, with an annual influx
of around one million visitors. In 1984, UNESCO declared the key landmarks of Cartagena as
a World Cultural Heritage Site. Cartagena also has a thriving industrial sector with important
petrochemical, beverage, and seafood processing industries. In 2012, the Port of Cartagena was
Colombia’s main container port and the third busiest port for transportation of grain.

The socio-economic structure of Cartagena is complex and the city suffers from high levels of
poverty. Thirty-five percent of the population is classified as extremely poor, or “Strata 1” in the
Colombian system, implying that they cannot meet their basic needs. Another 30% falls under the

3 Restoring the Coastal Environment in Cartagena, Colombia
Resetting the Institutional Framework for Wastewater Management
Prior to 1995, Cartagena’s water and sanitation service suffered with an inefficient water utility
that was owned and controlled by the municipal government. Due to low tariffs and inefficient
operations, the lack of cost recovery on behalf of the water utility contributed to financial problems,       BOX 2

responsible for implementing the capital works program. However, the contract has evolved over time
and ACUACAR now self-finances a significant share of capital works through its tariff revenue.


Developing New Environmental Institutions
In 1993, a new National Environmental Law created the Ministry of Environment, formulated a
framework for environmental management, and established autonomous regional environmental
authorities which are responsible for implementing national environmental policies at the local
level. The regional environmental authorities in Colombia are governed by a combination of
national, regional, and local government representatives, as well as stakeholders from the business
community, non-governmental groups, and indigenous peoples. While the regional environmental
authorities have a steady funding stream based mainly on a 15% environmental property tax

Improving Water Circulation in the Ciénaga de la Virgen: While ACUACAR focused on water supply and
high-priority drainage issues in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the District of Cartagena and CARDIQUE
developed an innovative project to improve water quality in the Lagoon. The Lagoon originally had numerous
outlets to the sea and its brackish waters supported a diverse and highly productive aquatic-ecosystem.
However, the construction of a road along the coastline in the late 1980s sealed off most of the natural
outlets, thus severely curtailing tidal circulation in the estuary. By 2000, the Lagoon was receiving around
60% of Cartagena’s untreated wastewater and the combination of high pollution loads with poor water
circulation had created an environmental disaster.
The District of Cartagena and CARDIQUE, with the financial and technical support of the Government of the
Netherlands, constructed a stabilized tidal inlet entrance known as “La Bocana Project” in the early 2000s.
The project consists of an enlarged canal entrance to the Lagoon, self-actuating tidal gates to increase
flow into the Lagoon, and a long seawall within the estuary to route the tidal flows through the Lagoon and
help flush out the pollution. The project helped to significantly improve the water quality in the Lagoon and
halted the environmental decline until ACUACAR could complete its wastewater master plan.

Collecting, Treating, and Disposing of Cartagena’s Wastewater: By the early 2000s, ACUACAR, with the
support of a US $85 million loan from the World Bank, was poised to fully implement its wastewater master
plan. The plan, which is summarized in Figure 2, consists of the following components:

n	   Convey the wastewater from the Cartagena Bay drainage area to the new central pump station;

n	   Complete the wastewater collection system in the Laguna drainage area, particularly in the poor, low-
     lying squatter neighborhood along the Lagoon, and convey the wastewater to the new central pump
     station;

n	   Pump all of Cartagena’s collected wastewater from the central pump station to a new treatment plant
     located 19 kilometers to the north; and

n	   Treat the wastewater at a new wastewater treatment plant, and then discharge the effluent through a 4.3
     kilometer long, 2 meter diameter, submarine outfall into the Caribbean Sea at a depth of approximately
     20 meters.

A submarine outfall, coupled with preliminary wastewater treatment was the selected alternative due to
its relatively low costs and the adequate natural conditions close to Cartagena’s coast. The preliminary
treatment plant was designed to remove floatable material such as oils and plastic bags, as well as sand
and grit particles. The submarine outfall technology efficiently reduces organic material and suspended
solids, producing up to a 99% reduction in the concentration of these key pollutants outside the designated
mixing zone around the outfall diffusers. Extensive modeling was done with international experts to confirm
the feasibility of a submarine outfall and the plan was approved by CARDIQUE. The treatment plant layout
also allows for upgrading the treatment process in the future if so required.                                   The Castle San Felipe, the

             However, the selection of a submarine outfall option, combined with
             preliminary treatment, was not without controversy. The fishing village
             located near the start of the 4 km long marine outfall pipe, composed mainly
             of people of Afro-Caribbean desent, were concerned that the outfall would
             affect their livelihoods. Local property developers also initially opposed
             the plan because of fears of odor and seawater quality problems. Finally, a
             group of technical experts preferred other technical alternatives consisting
             of large wastewater treatment lagoons.

             The marine outfall approach was contested in the Colombian environmental
             regulatory system, and in 2002 the Ministry of Environment ratified the
             environmental license originally approved by CARDIQUE. Opponents of the
             outfall option also appealed to the World Bank’s Inspection Panel in 2004,
             which after a lengthy and extensive review endorsed the outfall alternative
             as an acceptable solution. In late 2010, an accident occurred in the towing
             of the outfall pipe which resulted in delay of over two years; the accident
             was accompanied by a scandal as the responsible contractor fled leaving
             ACUACAR to complete the installation with its own financing while the matter
             is addressed in the Colombian legal system.


             Commissioning of Cartagena’s Wastewater System: In spite of many
             complications, the wastewater treatment system was commissioned in early
             2013. Recognizing the importance of this achievement, President Juan           La Bocana is a water control structure at the inlet to the Ciénaga de la Virgen
