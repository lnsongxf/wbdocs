EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This policy note provides a snapshot of human resources for health (HRH) in health centers
in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) based on an analysis of a health facility
survey (the UFGE-CNP health center survey) that collected information from a nationally-
representative sample of 120 public health centers (HCs) from 2013 to 2014. The survey
was conducted as a baseline for health sector reform plans, to inform policymaking as Lao
PDR scales-up programs to attain health-related MDGs, expand basic health services, and
attain universal health coverage (UHC).


                                          Key Messages
 •	 At the national- and regional-level: The supply of critical human resources for health (HRH)
    was maldistributed (by geography, level, and type) and low – just over half WHO recommen-
    dations – although public spending on HRH, as a proportion of general government health
    expenditure, was within global and regional norms. A strategic review of the distribution of
    frontline HRH, with an adequate mandate, should be conducted and acted upon, to improve
    the allocative efficiency and equity of HRH.
 •	 At the facility-level: Health centers (HCs) were staffed typically with four health workers who
    were relatively underutilized, with only six consultations per health worker per day on average.
    Investments are needed to reduce demand-side barriers (physical, cultural, and financial) to
    increase the extremely low utilization of essential health services, especially in rural areas, as
    underutilization is driving low productivity and low clinical ability.
 •	 HC workers, comprised mainly of medical assistants and nursing professionals, with mid-level
    degrees, and four years of work experience at the HC, received a mean income of 1,599,000
    kip (≈149 percent of monthly prorated GNI per capita), including income from supplementary
    sources outside the HC for 40 percent of health workers. These sources were almost entirely
    agriculture or small enterprise-derived, with only few related to medical ‘dual-practice’.
 •	 Almost half (44 percent) of HC staff had never undergone any in-service training and where
    training was received, it was often mismatched with the type of health services being provided
    by the health worker. There are substantial gaps in clinical knowledge related to the manage-
    ment of MDG-related clinical situations, particularly for treating undernutrition and treating
    a woman bleeding after childbirth. Training programs and supervision will hence need to be
    strengthened significantly to address this critical issue.
 •	 With regard to gender, although most (57 percent) HC workers were female, 42 percent of
    health staff conducting deliveries were male, which may compound the already high cultural
    barriers in accessing essential maternity services. With regard to language, although 85 per-
    cent of HC workers spoke the most common language in the community (typically Lao), only
    31 percent spoke the second most common language, and 7 percent spoke the third most com-
    mon language.
 •	 Poor service readiness (infrastructure, availability of medicines and equipment), in addition
    to poor compensation, were the main sources of dissatisfaction among health workers, sug-
    gesting that supply-side investments in medicines and equipment would not only improve the
    technical capacity of health centers but also health worker satisfaction.

    Introduction
    While on-track for child health and maternal health MDGs, Lao PDR continues to have some
    of the worst maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes, both globally and in the East Asia
    and Pacific (EAP) region. Under-five and infant mortality rates are high relative to GDP per
    capita, and utilization of essential health services is low, given significant demand-side
    barriers including physical access, cultural, and financial barriers. Furthermore, about a
    third of all children under-five remain underweight and almost half are stunted. Lao PDR is
    hence off-track on the nutrition-related MDG 1c. In addition to poor aggregate measures,
    there are significant economic, urban-rural, geographic, and ethnic group-related inequali-
    ties in health and nutrition outcomes.

    This policy note provides a snapshot of human resources for health (HRH) in health centers
    in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) based on an analysis of a health facility
    survey (the UFGE-CNP health center survey) that collected information from a nationally-
    representative sample of 120 public health centers (HCs) from 2013 to 2014.1 This survey
    was conducted as a baseline for health sector reform plans, to inform policymaking as Lao
    PDR scales-up programs to attain health-related MDGs, expand basic health services, and
    attain universal health coverage (UHC). This note complements a related health financing
    note2 which includes health center financing data from the same survey. Key findings from
    that note include low government health spending, associated with a high reliance on out-
    of-pocket (OOP) spending and external financing, which translates to underfunding of HCs
    (especially non-wage recurrent expenditure) and dependence on OOP revenue from revolv-
    ing drug funds (RDFs).

    The HC survey includes information on the supply, qualifications, and demographics of
    HRH, training, clinical abilities, productivity, income, satisfaction, ethnolinguistic charac-
    teristics, and gender considerations. As the Government of Lao PDR moves forward on the
    national strategic policy for HRH, which has four objectives – (i) strengthen leadership and
    management of HRH; (ii) ensure availability of an adequate number of suitably qualified
    health workers at all levels of the health system; (iii) ensure a competent and motivated
    health workforce through improved training and supervision; and (iv) ensure maximum ef-
    ficiency, quality, and acceptability of the health workforce through attention to equity is-
    sues3 - findings from this survey can help inform the actualization of these objectives.

    This policy note is organized as follows: Section 1 provides stylized facts about the nation-
    al HRH context, including the supply, distribution, and public financing of health workers;
    Section 2 presents findings from the national public HC and HC worker survey, including
    workforce characteristics, gender and ethnolinguistic dimensions, distribution, income,
    training, satisfaction, productivity, and ability; and Section 3 concludes with key recom-
    mendations and limitations.

1. The National Human Resources for Health Context

          1.1 Health Workforce Supply, Distribution, and Financing

          1.	      The supply of HRH in Lao PDR was low, at just over half that recommended by
          WHO (1.23 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1,000 population) in 2012, although this is
          in the context of extremely low utilization of health services. HRH is a key building block of
          any health system, for which WHO has established a norm of at least 2.3 doctors, nurses,
          and midwives per 1,000 population in order to adequately provide essential health ser-
          vices.4 In Lao PDR, there were 1,981 physicians and 6,027 nurses and midwives in 20125,
          implying an additional 6,975 doctors, nurses, and midwives are needed, once demand-side
          utilization constrains are addressed. This needs gap has slightly widened since it was last
          estimated at 6,226 workers.6 7 HRH headcounts per capita in Lao PDR, although much low-
          er than other countries in the region (Table 1), are not the only factor which affects popula-
          tion health outcomes. For example, Cambodia, which has a similar supply of HRH, attains
          much better population health outcomes.

             planned, since these 2012 figures. This compares with the quota for 2012-13 which was 1141.

2.	      Inequalities remain with regard to the provincial distribution of critical HRH in
Lao PDR. About one-third of the doctors, nurses, and midwives serve just one-fifth of the
population, as visualized using a Lorenz curve which plots the cumulative share of doc-
tors, nurses, and midwives, with the cumulative share of the population (Figure 1). The GINI
coefficient9 for this HRH distribution was 0.16 but this does not take into consideration
inequalities within provinces – past analysis on urban and rural HRH inequalities found an
estimated 20 percent of the health workforce serving some 80 percent of the population
living in rural areas.10

     3.	     The maldistribution of HRH cannot be purely explained by misallocation of HRH
     expenditure, as although there was a clear correlation between per capita provincial HRH
     spending and provincial HRH headcounts, there are many outliers. For example, Kham-
     muane province spends a similar amount on HRH as Xiengkhuang province per capita, but
     was able to maintain a much larger per capita headcount of doctors, nurses, and midwives
     (Figure 2). These differences could be attributed to hiring choices between different types of
     health workers and/or due to different seniorities, but suggests that there may be fiscally-
     neutral solutions to improving HRH headcounts.

     cial HRH spending

4.	     Despite the relatively low numbers of health workers in Lao PDR, the fraction of
general government health expenditure spent on wages, salaries, and allowances12 in Lao
PDR, at 43 percent, was already comparable both with the global average and the WHO
Western Pacific Region (Figure 3), even before Lao PDR implemented a major salary incre-
ment for the civil service. This suggests that the relative deficiency in HRH headcounts is
reflective of an overall underfunding of the public health system, rather than a selective
underfunding of HRH relative to other components of the system.

ment health expenditure (GGHE), 200613




5.	     In 2013 (just prior to this survey), a large increase in the salaries and benefits
for public employees was implemented. The civil service salary index rose by 37 percent
in 2013, and was expected to rise by a similar percentage in 2014 and 2015 as part of the
three year plan. The IMF noted that this two-fold increase in civil service compensation
from 5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 10 percent in 2013 puts Lao PDR ‘well above the average
level for international comparators’. Hence, although [IMF] staff ‘recognize the need for an
increase in civil service pay … especially in health’, a ‘more measured pace of future com-
pensation increases’ will be required.14 An earlier World Bank study also noted that although
the formal salary for civil service workers was well below private sector comparators, the
private sector premium disappeared when intangible benefits (for example, work hours and
in-kind benefits) were factored in.15

     6.	     The implied average monthly compensation, including allowances, for government
     payroll health workers of 14,18916 was 1,290,000 kip in 2012, equivalent to US$1,933 per
     year (152 percent of GNI per capita).17 Hence although there is a long term need to increase
     headcounts to address HRH shortages, initial policy steps should focus on improving the
     technical and allocative efficiency, and quality, of the existing workforce, within the con-
     text of the current fiscal environment, and should certainly not be at the expense of non-
     wage recurrent spending on health which is already under significant pressures.18

2. The Health Center Workforce Survey
16   Lao PDR Health Center Workforce Survey



     2.1 Sampling and Design

     1.	     The UFGE-CNP HC survey sampled 120 public HCs across the country (Figure 4)
     between 2013 and 2014.19 Hospitals and private facilities were not included as the focus
     was on public primary care providers. For each HC, two health workers (all types and cad-
     res) were sampled randomly without replacement, resulting in a total health worker sample
     of 232.20 The survey included modules on demographics, in-service training, hours worked,
     income (including dual-practice), satisfaction, and clinical knowledge, as assessed by vi-
     gnettes of hypothetical cases related to child health (preventive and curative), maternal
     health, and nutrition.

     Figure 4: Map showing the HCs sampled for this survey and p HRH densities21




     19
        Of the 120 health centers surveyed, 36 were in the North region; 36 from the Central region; and 48 from the
        South region. Of the 120, 81 were in rural areas and the remaining 39 were urban health centers. Sampling:
        Of the 120 health centers, 80 health centers were randomly sampled with equal probability of selection, from
        a register of all health centers in Lao PDR obtained from the Department of Health Care, and data collec-
        tion took place from May to June 2014. This sample was combined with an earlier sample, which used nearly
        identical survey instruments, of 40 health centers which were surveyed as part of an impact evaluation of
        a project in the central and southern provinces. There were no significant differences in relevant parameters
        between the two samples. Data collection was performed from May to July 2013.
     20
        The missing eight health workers are officially on the health worker roster but could not be located after three
        attempts or did not consent for an interview.
     21
        Sampled health centers are indicated with red dots, whose size is proportionate to number of health center
        workers. Source for HRH (Doctors, Nurses, and Midwives) density data is the Department of Organization

2.2 Health Center Workforce Characteristics

2.	      The median number of health workers per HC was four, typically comprising three
civil servants and one volunteer22 or donor/NGO-funded health worker assigned to the HC.
Considering that these were basic public primary care facilities, most HC workers were ei-
ther medical assistants (30 percent) or nursing professionals (37 percent). Midwives who
provide critical antenatal and obstetric services comprise 15 percent of the HC workforce,
and only 4 percent of those sampled were medical doctors (Figure 5). Almost all (99 per-
cent) of the HC workers had a basic, mid-level, or high-level degree (Figure 6). Most medical
assistants (87 percent) are mid-level degree holders, while nurses are typically either mid-
level degree holders (69 percent) or basic-level degree holders (28 percent).23

Figure 6: HC worker education




22
     Volunteers are a term used to denote health workers who have started work at a health facility, while await-
     ing an official civil service appointment.
23
      Basic training requirements for health workers are as follows: Medical Doctors (6-year training), Gradu-
     ate Nurses (4-year training), Registered Nurses (3-year training), Midwives with Bachelors Degree (4-year
     training), Registered Midwives (3-year training), Community Midwives (2-year training), Medical Assistants
     (3-year training), and Paramedics (3-year training).
18   Lao PDR Health Center Workforce Survey



     3.	     A typical HC worker would be a 30-year old female with a mid-level degree that
     was completed more than five years prior to the time of survey and had worked at the HC
     for just over four years. Within the HC, an HC worker could occupy one of several positions,
     the most common being the HC head and the deputy (Figure 7), followed by various spe-
     cialized functions (for example, providing MCH services) and responsibilities (for example,
     managing the revolving drug fund). HC heads are not necessarily the most highly-educated
     of the positions, as indeed some do not have post-secondary qualifications, although they
     are presumably the most senior in service.

     Figure 7: HC worker position




     4.	     Small urban-rural24 differences in HC staffing characteristics were noted, with the
     average urban health center in the sample staffed with 4.4 health workers compared with
     3.8 in rural health centers. Women comprise a large majority (71 percent) of urban health
     center health workers, compared with just below 50 percent, in rural HCs. Non-Lao ethnici-
     ties are similarly more represented among rural rather than urban HCs (45 percent com-
     pared with 29 percent).

     5.	     The distribution of employment duration is positively skewed (Figure 8), suggest-
     ing either a high turnover of HC workers or a recent sharp increase in employment. The
     median duration of employment for civil servants employed at the current HC is 4.5 years,
     but the mean is 7.0 years. For volunteers who are essentially awaiting civil service appoint-
     ments, the median period of employment in that volunteer status, was 1 year (mean of 1.5
     years).




     24
          For the national census, the Lao Statistics Bureau defines urban-rural status on a village-by-village basis,
          based on several criteria including population size and amenities. As HCs serve multiple villages, adapted
          criteria based on these village-level criteria were used to generate urban-rural status at HC-level.

2.2.1 Ethnolinguistic Concordance and Gender Dimensions

6.	     Lao PDR is one of the more ethnically diverse countries in the region, with 49 dif-
ferent ethnic groups and 160 subgroups recognized by the Lao Front for National Construc-
tion. The ethnolinguistic fractionalization index for Lao PDR, which is the probability that
‘two randomly selected individuals from a population will belong to two different groups’, is
high at 0.514.25 The relevance is that such cultural indices, along with income, income in-
equality, and female education can ‘explain practically all of the variation in child mortality
across countries’.26

7.	    There were large differences in the health coverage indicators by ethnolinguistic
groups. For example, 59 percent of women from Lao-Tai headed-households had deliveries
assisted by skilled attendants, compared with 21 percent for Mon-Khmer, 18 percent for
Hmong-Mien, and 18 percent for Chinese-Tibetan-headed households (Table 2). Stunting
prevalence and DPT3 coverage similarly vary by ethnolinguistic group. The linkages be-
tween the ethnicities and language skills of health providers and that of their catchment
populations is explored in Box 1.

8.	      Gender is also an important HRH policy consideration, both from the demand-side
perspective (for example, gender-related barriers to accessing health and gender discrimi-
nation in health expenditure) and from a supply-side perspective (as health care provid-
ers).27 This survey explores both these perspectives in Box 2 based on empirical survey data.

 Box 1: Ethnolinguistic Concordance

 Health centers are key frontline health facilities, which provide critical MCH services, to both ur-
 ban and rural communities in this ethnically diverse country.

 This survey finds that HC workers by and large mirrored the diverse ethnicity of the country
 - approximately 61 percent were Lao, 10 percent were Khmu, and 9 percent were Hmong; which
 was comparable to the national distribution of 55 percent, 11 percent, and 8 percent respective-
 ly. However, even though the ethnic composition of HC workers mirrored the national aggregate
 composition, there was assortment in the placements of HC workers such that only 56 percent of
 HC workers were of the same ethnicity as the most common ethnicity in the catchment popula-
 tion (Figure 9). A further 29 percent had the same ethnicity as either the second or third most
 common ethnicity in the catchment population.

 Linguistic concordance may be more important as health workers and their patients need to be
 able to communicate. This survey finds that although 85 percent of HC workers were able to
 speak the most common language of the catchment population (Figure 10), typically the Lao
 national language, very much fewer were able to speak languages other than the most common
 language – only 31 percent of HC workers were able to speak the second most common language
 of the catchment population and only 7 percent of HC workers were able to speak the third most
 common language of the catchment population. A household survey would be required to ade-
 quately determine the percentage of households for whom there are no common languages with
 any of the HC workers, but the sharp drop in language skills for languages other than the most
 common language suggests that language may be a barrier in accessing health care services for
 non-Lao speakers. Furthermore, 15 percent of HC workers would not be able to use their first lan-
 guage to communicate with most of the people in their catchment population.

 This is not due to a lack of linguistic ability on the part of health workers, as almost half of HC
 workers reported being able to speak two or more languages, with Lao being the most widely-
 spoken language (96 percent), followed by Khmu (20 percent), and Hmong (17 percent). However,
 the linguistic diversity of Lao PDR, especially in rural areas, presents an inherent challenge for
 frontline health care service delivery. Targeted recruitment of health workers from rural ethnolin-
 guistic groups, coupled with an intentional deployment back to their communities, may mitigate
 this challenge, and has been used successfully in Vietnam.30

Box 2: Gender Dimensions

Gender dimensions can be explored from two perspectives: Firstly, from the patient-client’s per-
spective, in particular, whether pregnant women are able to receive maternity care from a female
provider; and secondly, from the perspective of gender equity in employment.

With regard to patient-client perspectives, this survey finds that of all the HC workers who con-
ducted a delivery (either at the HC or as outreach) within the last three months of the survey,
42 percent were male, typically medical assistants and male nurses. This is somewhat unusual
given that most health workers were female, especially for health workers who are midwives and/
or had MCH responsibilities (Table 3). The utilization of maternity services is already low in Lao
PDR, with skilled birth attendant rates of only 31 percent in rural areas. Cultural barriers hence
may be compounded by the lack of gender sensitivity in the provision of MCH services. Consider-
ing that the HC workforce already includes many female health workers trained in NCH, it may be
helpful to explicitly allow pregnant women the choice, where feasible, to be attended by a female
birth attendant.

With regard to gender and employment, this survey finds that women make up the majority
(57 percent) of HC workers, and that their aggregate compensation is equal to that of male
counterparts, although they are on average three years junior to their male counterparts (Table
3). Certain positions and grades are dominated by women – midwives and MCH providers – but
most HC heads are male (only 37 percent are female). In some grades and positions, women are
compensated less than their male counterparts (for example, as medical assistants and mid-
wives) although the reverse is true for some other grades and positions. There is some suggestion
that there is an experienced cohort of women serving as deputy HC heads. Female HC workers
are more highly educated – all have at least a basic degree, 77 percent had a mid-level degree
compared with 64 percent for males, and 18 percent had a basic-level degree compared with 25
percent of males.

Many of these findings could be explained if HCs in the past had mainly been staffed by male
health workers, but that recent times have seen the entry of a more highly educated and mainly
female cohort of health workers. If true, such reforms would be welcome.

2.3 Health Center Workforce Distribution

9.	     There are large inequalities in the distribution of HC workers, as shown by Lorenz
curves (Figure 11) of HC workers (all positions and grades), for urban HC catchment areas
and, separately, for rural HC catchments areas. These inequalities do not merely reflect an
urban-rural divide, as even within rural areas alone, the least served half of the rural popu-
lation was served by only 26 percent of rural HC workers. In urban areas alone, the least
served half of the urban population was served by only 28 percent of urban HC workers. In
other words, there is significant maldistribution of the health workforce within rural areas
and within urban areas, not just between urban and rural areas, which may have implica-
tions on the allocative efficiency of service delivery.

     Lorenz curves and GINI coefficients can be used to measure imbalances in the geographic distribution of
     health workers. Munga, Michael A., and Ottar Mæstad (2009). “Measuring Inequalities in the Distribution
     of Health Workers: The Case of Tanzania.” Human Resources for Health, 7 (1): 4. doi:10.1186/1478-4491-7-

     10	     Comparisons with Tanzania also highlight an interesting feature. Whereas in Tan-
     zania the distribution of health workers in rural districts is more equal compared with urban
     districts, in Lao PDR, this trend is reversed as rural HC catchment areas have greater mald-
     istribution of health workers than urban HC catchment areas. This characteristic – greater
     imbalances in the distribution of HRH within rural areas, where, for example, 27 percent
     of rural HC workers have been allocated to provide services for just 5 percent of the rural
     population - should be explored further. There is also some suggestion that health workers
     in Lao PDR are distributed inequitably (GINI of 0.16 at provincial-level) compared with Tan-
     zania (GINI of 0.229 at district-level, which are of comparable size to Lao provinces). See

2.4 Health Center Workforce Income

11.	     Mean monthly income of HC workers, including allowances and other income, is
1,599,000 kip (or 149 percent of monthly prorated GNI per capita,37 or 123 percent exclud-
ing other income), comprising 1,187,000 kip as salaries, 131,000 kip as allowances, and
282,000 kip as other income (including dual-practice). Excluding other sources of income,
this is close to the national mean compensation for civil servants in the health sector of
1,290,000 in 2012 and is approximately four times per capita households consumption in
2012-13 (mean household size in Lao PDR is 5.238), although in some Sub-Saharan coun-
tries, salaries are thirty to forty times GNI per capita.39 Although HC workers from rural and
urban areas have very similar total incomes (Figure 12), the composition is different – with
rural workers tending to have higher salaries but lower supplementary sources of income,
compared with urban workers.

     12.	   Among the different grades of health workers, medical doctors have the highest
     salaries and nurses have the lowest salaries, although the overall picture is of a highly
     compressed salary scale which may indicate directions for reforms (Figure 13). Allowances
     and supplementary sources of income were significant contributors to total income.

     13.	    The situation was less equitable when it comes to different employment statuses,
     as HC volunteers took home less than one-third of the total income of a HC civil servant
     (Figure 14). ‘Salaries’ for volunteers were comparable in quantum to their income from sup-
     plementary sources.

 Box 3: Dual-practice and Supplementary Income

 Almost half of HC workers (40 percent) had a supplementary source of individual income (not
 including income from other members of the household) outside the HC. Uniquely for Lao PDR, less
 than 2 percent were involved in health-related dual-practice even though there is no legal block on
 additional private work which takes place outside public sector working hours.40 This contrasts
 with other countries in the region where dual-practice is described as ‘ubiquitous’ in Cambodia
 where 90 percent of the income of dual practitioners is ‘from private work’. In Indonesia, ’70 per-
 cent of publicly employed puskesmas physicians’ are dual-practitioners, and in Vietnam, ’84 per-
 cent of public health staff’ are dual-practitioners.41 Although there is no empirical evidence avail-
 able to confirm this, the relatively low rates of health-related dual-practice in Lao PDR could be
 due to weak demand for private primary care services in the rural areas, and hence, almost all
 sources of supplementary income are from agricultural activities and/or small enterprises.

 HC workers reported that the main reason for seeking additional income sources was due to inad-
 equate income (88 percent), although the baseline salary and allowances profile for HC workers
 with and without supplementary income is similar (Figure 15). Among those with supplementary
 income, the mean monthly supplement was 712,000 kip. The average time spent on work outside
 the HC was 12.9 hours per week.

     2.5 Health Center Workforce In-Service Training

     14.	    Almost half (44 percent) of HC staff had never undergone any in-service training
     (Figure 17), and only 40 percent underwent any training in the last one year. The three most
     common training topics provided were on (i) Nutrition and Growth Monitoring, (ii) Family
     Planning, and (iii) Antenatal and Postnatal Care (Table 16). Urban-rural differences were
     small – with urban HC workers reporting that 46 percent had never undergone any in-ser-
     vice training, compared with 42 percent for rural HC workers.

     15.	     Training investments on critical topics even for staff directly involved in providing
     such critical services was inadequate – for example, 67 percent of HC staff who conducted
     a facility delivery in the last three months, had never received in-service training on Basic
     and Essential Obstetrics and Newborn Life Savings Skills (BEONLSS) (Figure 17). Similarly,
     67 percent of staff who treated a patient for malaria in the last three months, had never
     received in-service training on malaria.

2.6 Health Center Workforce Satisfaction

16.	   Most health workers expressed overall satisfaction with their work, especially
with regard to work and community relationships (Figure 18). That these aspects are val-
ued and lead to health worker satisfaction should not be underestimated by health policy-
makers, as it is important to preserve and to protect the ‘right’ reasons for work perfor-
mance and motivation.

Figure 18: Factors for HC worker satisfaction




17.	    However, service readiness (the availability of medicines, equipment, and health
facility infrastructure) and compensation (salary, benefits, and opportunities for promo-
tion) are the main sources of dissatisfaction (Figure 19). This highlights the added value of
investments in service readiness, beyond only improving service readiness, but in improving
job satisfaction. The finding of dissatisfaction over salaries is consistent with other stud-
ies.42

     2.7 Health Center Workforce Productivity and Efficiency

     18.	    HC workers in Lao PDR were underutilized, with a mean of only 5.6 consultations
     per HC worker per day (median 4), despite working a median of 40 hours a week, five days
     a week (mean is 54.6 hours and 5.4 days respectively) (Figure20). By contrast, in rural Tan-
     zania, the median number of consultations per day per health worker was 14.43 Hence, even
     though HC workers only received modest compensation, the implied unit cost of labor per
     consultation was relatively high at 13,500 kip.44

     Figure 20: Consultations per HC worker per day




     19.	     Part of the underutilization of HC workers may be attributed to the maldistribu-
     tion of health workers in rural and remote areas in Lao PDR, but given that outpatient
     utilization is low in Lao PDR nationally (0.44 outpatient consultations per capita per year
     in 2012),45 demand-side aspects such as health seeking behaviors, perceived quality con-
     cerns, financial, physical, cultural, and other barriers, will need also to be addressed. The
     irony of relative underemployment despite the scarcity of Lao health workers due to low
     utilization of health services attributed to demand-side factors has been noted before.46

20.	 Furthermore, despite the relative scarcity of health workers, health workers
spent 15 percent of their time completing forms, reports, and other monitoring activities,
a mean of 8.7 hours per week (Figure 21). Although there is some degree of underutilization
of health workers, this administrative burden may still affect frontline service delivery as
health workers who spend the most time on clinical work, especially medical assistants
and midwives (Figure 22), are also the health workers who spend the most time on these
administrative tasks. Medical assistants spend 10 hours per week on administrative tasks
in addition to 54 hours per week spent on, or being available for, clinical work. Considering
HC worker salaries, the implied cost of these monitoring activities is 341,000 kip per month
per HC worker. In the context of an overall undersupply of health workers, the use of roughly
one-seventh of health worker time to complete forms, reports, and other monitoring activi-
ties, may be unaffordable.

      Box 4: How efficient are HCs in Lao PDR?

      Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)47 is a commonly used method for analyzing the efficiency of
      health facilities, based on measured inputs and outputs. Due to data limitations for this analysis,
      the input used is the total number of HC workers, and the outputs are deliveries (both in the HC
      and by outreach), immunizations, and outpatient consultations, and inpatient discharges.

      DEA of HCs surveyed found that HCs overall were operating at only a 45 percent level of efficiency,
      with rural HCs slightly outperforming urban HCs. These findings contrast with findings from DEA
      done in other countries – for example, in Kenya, the mean efficiency of public HCs is 0.73 while the
      mean efficiency for public district hospitals in Zambia is 0.63 (0.73 in private district hospitals),
      thus highlighting the significant scope for improvement in the efficiency of HCs in Lao PDR (Table
      5). Further analysis on determining the scale efficiencies and the causes of inefficiencies are pos-
      sible but beyond the scope of this report.

2.8 Health Center Workforce Ability

21.	    Based on an analysis of clinical vignettes applied to HC workers,49 this survey
finds that only 56 percent of HC workers would ask about breastfeeding, only 72 percent
would ask about complementary feeding practices, and only 21 percent would ask about
hygiene and sanitation during a consultation for a child for growth monitoring (Table 6).
These are critical aspects of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) as the prevalence of
stunting (44 percent of under-fives) and underweight (27 percent of under-fives) is very high
in Lao PDR.50 Although the causes for this are multisectoral, the health sector plays a role
in providing nutrition advice and key commodities such as Vitamin A, deworming medicine,
and iron supplements.

22.	    Most HC workers would weigh and measure the length/height of the child, and
were able to correctly interpret the growth chart, but not many would then act on the im-
plications of these findings - only about one-third of health workers would have then treat
the child with Vitamin A or deworming medications, and 42 percent would have provided
advice on hygiene and sanitation.

23.	 A further concern is that, in areas where health workers considered the preva-
lence of stunting to be higher than usual, these health workers tended to undertreat chil-
dren, perhaps indicating an incorrect consideration that where stunting is common, it can
be considered to be ‘normal’.

24.	   Health workers who had experience providing child growth monitoring services in
the last three months were associated with above average scores, and this association
was confirmed in a basic regression model as detailed in Annex 1.

     25.	 Knowledge of routine immunizations among HC workers was fair overall, with
     more than three- quarters of HC workers aware of the recommended age for administer-
     ing three of the four routine immunizations tested, but the application of WHO guidelines
     on when immunizations can or cannot be administered was weak (Table 7). Less than half
     of HC workers would have administered a vaccination to a child if the child had a mild fever,
     although WHO guidelines indicate that ‘any minor illness, such as respiratory tract infec-
     tions or diarrhea with temperature below 38.5 C’ is not a contraindication to immunization
     and hence the immunization should have been provided.51 The availability of guidelines on
     immunization at the HC (85 percent have this available) appears to improve scores for this
     case.

     Table 7: Knowledge of immunizations and the immunization schedule




     26.	   Knowledge of basic treatment of severe dehydration in a child with diarrhea with
     intravenous fluids and oral rehydration salts was reasonable. More than three-quarters
     of HC workers would have administered these given the scenario (Table 8), interventions
     which could have contributed towards reducing the high under-five mortality rates in Lao
     PDR which was 71 per 1,000 live births.52 The availability of Integrated Management of
     Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) guidelines appeared to improve scores but HC workers who re-
     ceived the current method of training on IMCI appeared to have performed more poorly
     than average.

     The administration of antibiotics (either oral or injectable) in this situation was judged to be
     an inappropriate intervention by Delphi consensus, but was nevertheless mentioned by a
     small percentage of health workers.

27.	    Knowledge of basic treatment for a woman bleeding after childbirth was poor. Ma-
ternal mortality rates are 220 per 100,000 live births and postpartum hemorrhage (bleed-
ing after childbirth) is the most common cause of death.53 Only two-thirds of HC workers
would administer intravenous fluids and fewer than 10 percent would perform basic ma-
neuvers (which require neither drugs nor equipment) to reduce bleeding, such as uterine
massage and bimanual compression (Table 9). Fewer than half would treat with oxytocin
(a fraction which does not seem to be dependent on whether or not stocks of oxytocin are
available), a critical intervention, and only 58 percent would refer the woman to hospital if
she had continued bleeding. These findings are very disconcerting, especially as neither the
current method of training nor the availability of guidelines appear to improve scores, but
are consistent with an earlier assessment of skilled birth attendants in Lao PDR commis-
sioned by UNFPA, with all cadres – high-, mid-, and low-level – scoring poorly on a problem
solving scenario involving recognizing and treating shock due to hemorrhage.54

     28.	 Experience appears to be an important factor in improving scores. HC workers
     who have experienced a similar postpartum hemorrhage case before and those from HCs
     which are above the median in the number of deliveries conducted score better. However, in
     a basic regression model (as detailed in Annex 1), training appears to be negatively associ-
     ated with scores.

     plied to postpartum hemorrhage




     29.	   In terms of scores by position within the HC, HC heads performed the best overall
     and deputy HC heads performed the worst, especially in the case for child growth monitor-
     ing and the diarrhea with severe dehydration case (Table 10).

     30.	   By grade, medical assistants, who are the largest single cadre by grade and com-
     prise 37 percent of all HC staff, performed the worst, especially for the postpartum hem-
     orrhage case and the child growth monitoring case. Midwifery professionals performed
     better on the postpartum hemorrhage case, but unsurprisingly did not perform well on
     cases they were not explicitly trained for such as diarrhea with severe dehydration. Medi-
     cal doctors appear to have performed the best compared to all other grades although the
     number of medical doctors in the sample was small.

     31.	    There are no significant performance differences between male and female HC
     workers but rural HC workers appear to underperform relative to urban HC workers. HC
     workers with more years of experience since graduation, perhaps reflecting an earlier gen-
     eration of training, appear to perform less strongly, but HC worker satisfaction appears not
     to have much impact on scores.

32.	   The total number of health workers in an HC is strongly associated with better
provider ability scores based on a basic regression model (Annex 1), meaning that health
workers with more colleagues performed better than those with fewer colleagues. Using
the same model, health workers in HCs at higher elevations (above sea level), which in the
Lao PDR context is a measure of isolation, performed worse than those at lower elevations.

     Composite scores and aggregated scores are explained in further detail in Box 5, but in simple terms: a score
     of zero is the mean score, positive scores are better than the mean, and negative scores are worse than the
     mean.
40   Lao PDR Health Center Workforce Survey




      Box 5: Method used for analyzing HC workforce ability

      In order to measure provider ability in this survey, four cases were chosen reflecting the health pri-
      orities of Lao PDR, namely maternal health, child health, and nutrition. The four cases used were
      (i) a routine growth monitoring visit, (ii) routine childhood immunizations, (iii) a child with diarrhea
      and severe dehydration, and (iv) a delivery complicated by postpartum hemorrhage. National and
      international guidelines were consulted in order to construct the case and potential responses, in
      a contextualized manner. In order to determine whether responses were correct or incorrect, an
      expert panel comprising Lao PDR Ministry of Health central staff from the relevant department
      such as the Maternal and Child Health Center and the National Nutrition Center, and district-level
      staff was convened.

      The Delphi consensus method was then used to query the panel to determine, given the local Lao
      context, whether potential responses to each question were (i) critically important life-saving in-
      terventions, (ii) correct interventions, (iii) neutral interventions with neither harmful nor beneficial
      effects, (iv) harmful interventions which may impact the patient negatively, (v) life-threatening
      interventions which may result in the death of the patient. Health worker responses were then
      scored against the expert panel consensus for each of the questions. In addition, composite scores
      were generated by weighting the individual responses56 and normalizing the total score for each of
      the four cases such that the scores are presented as standard deviations from the mean derived
      separately for each case.

      A composite score of zero ‘0’ (yellow color) means that a health worker received the average (mean)
      score for all health workers for that particular case. A composite score of ‘-1’ (orange-red color)
      means that the health worker scored one standard deviation below (worse) the average (mean)
      score for all health workers for that particular case; while a composite score of ‘+1’ (green color)
      means that the health worker scored one standard deviation above (better) the average (mean)
      score for all health workers.

      As there are four cases, a further measure – the ‘combined’ score – is an arithmetic unweighted
      mean composite score of all four cases.

      In addition, basic econometric models were used to regress outcomes scores for vignettes with
      factors such as training received, availability of guidelines, experience, health worker demograph-
      ics, and HC characteristics. Findings from these are consistent with intuitions from the tabula-
      tions of scores provided earlier, and detailed findings are available in Annex 1.




     56
          The weights are as follows: +5 for mentioning a critically important intervention, -1 for omitting to mention
          a critically important intervention; +3 for mentioning a correct intervention; -1 for mentioning a harmful
          intervention; -2 for mentioning a life-threatening intervention.

3. Key Recommendations
Lao PDR is a sparsely populated, mountainous, and land-locked country, with a diversity
of ethnicities and languages, and weak land transport infrastructure, thus posing an in-
herent service delivery challenge, especially with regard to HRH. This study finds that the
per capita density and distribution of critical HRH was low and inequitable, although this
occurred in the context of extremely low utilization of health services, which means that
the productivity of health workers was also low. Improving clinical ability, for which there
is some evidence of a positive association with health worker experience and with HC staff
working in large lowland health centers, is hence a major challenge.

In terms of informing broader HRH policy, the HC survey data used here is limited by the
non-inclusion of (i) private providers, (ii) secondary and tertiary health facilities, (iii) other
cadres, notable village-level agents, and managerial, administrative, and support staff.
With these limitations in mind, we would like to make the recommendations below, based
on the empirical findings from this public HC worker survey.

1.	     Conduct and act on an effective strategic review of the distribution of frontline
HRH nationally. Considering the geographic, socioeconomic, and ethnolinguistic context of
Lao PDR, HRH policies and implementation are noted to be particularly challenging in Lao
PDR and this is acknowledged. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to address the sig-
nificant inefficiencies in health service delivery related to the maldistribution (geographic,
level, and type) and underutilization of frontline human resources, using fiscally neutral
solutions. Although this review should be conducted at the national-level, the role and rel-
evance of provincial-level stakeholders is critical to ensure buy-in and the inclusion of local
considerations.

The terms of reference for this review should include (i) taking stock of the current supply
and production of HRH, (ii) assessing, with adequate geographic granularity, population
health needs (not just short term current demand) and utilization patterns at a subdistrict
level, (iii) taking note of the infrastructure and networks for referrals (with particular focus
on obstetric emergencies), (iv) taking into consideration ethnolinguistic and gender inclu-
sivity and sensitivity, and (v) based on these, to make an objective determination of where
the current and future supply (numerically, and by type and level) of HRH should be con-
centrated, in view of its scarcity. This may include necessitating the consolidation of HCs
in extreme cases where they are too thinly spread or fragmented to be effective – with the
key concern being the demonstration in this study that low utilization and few opportuni-
ties for experiential learning in isolated HCs health is associated with poor clinical ability
in managing emergencies – in addition to efficiency considerations. Any such consolidation
must be preceded by investments in strengthening community-level referral systems and
an active program of outreach (beyond a uniform policy of quarterly visits only), which lev-
erages and empowers village-level health agents (such as village health volunteers and/or
village health workers.
42   Lao PDR Health Center Workforce Survey



     This strategic review will need a sufficiently powerful political mandate such that poten-
     tially unpopular recommendations, which may include the closure and relocation of some
     HCs, and the relocation and retraining of health staff, can be followed through. Neverthe-
     less, some flexibility would be needed to allow transitions to occur over a fair amount of
     time, perhaps linked to overall investment plans for health facilities and linked to overall
     career development plans for health staff. In addition, an appropriate consultative process
     for local stakeholders will be needed to ensure that all relevant information and concerns
     are taken into consideration through the process.

     This distributional review can be complemented by related HRH reviews such as the Repro-
     ductive, Maternal, and Neonatal Health Workforce Assessment used elsewhere,57 to pro-
     vide a model for projecting and costing various HRH development strategies.

     2.	     Leverage the vast opportunities to improve training programs and supervision.
     This survey finds substantial gaps in the clinical abilities of frontline health workers in the
     management of MDG-related clinical situations, and highlights a significant gap in the
     quality of health education beginning at the pre-service stage (including entry regulations/
     requirements for health workers) and continuing throughout the professional life of the
     health worker.

     Firstly, the delivery of in-service training needs to be improved as there is evidence that
     HC workers who received in-service training performed worse than those who didn’t, and
     that health workers scored best on questions which relate to a repetition of facts (for ex-
     ample, immunization schedules) rather than an application of principles (for example, ad-
     ministration of vaccines in a child with a mild fever). Furthermore, even though HC workers
     were able to correctly identify the problem of undernutrition in a child, they did not follow
     through with the appropriate treatment actions.

     Secondly, the mode of learning should emphasize experiential and practical forms of peda-
     gogy, as there is evidence that prior and recurring experience is associated with better
     scores. Given the team nature of HCs (and indeed individuals in larger HC teams had better
     scores), health workers should be encouraged to consult with and learn from one another
     through mutual mentoring. The existing mechanism for supportive supervision can be lev-
     eraged further, to specifically enable (and make supervisors accountable for) mutual men-
     toring.

     Thirdly, greater contextualization and orientation of training materials to the Lao PDR con-
     text is needed, in order to address the specific weaknesses and gaps in Lao PDR. For exam-
     ple, specific weaknesses and knowledge gaps have been identified in clinical cases involving
     nutrition and maternal health emergencies. Certain weaknesses in performance may even
     be due to a dilution of standards to the local norms – for example, there is some evidence
     that health workers would undertreat undernourished children, where they perceive that
     the children are from a community with above average stunting prevalence. Direct trans-
     lations of international guidelines to the Lao language would alone not be able to address
     such cognitive biases.

Fourthly, the selection and matching of staff for in-service training can be improved. HC
workers who were providing critical services such as malaria treatment and delivery ser-
vices, were more often than not HC staff who had never received in-service training on
these topics. In larger HCs which serve larger catchment populations, specialization be-
tween staff may be helpful in order to improve quality. Prioritization of rural HC staff for in-
service training should also be considered, as these had below average scores in general on
all four of the clinical cases used, once in-service training programs are improved. District
and provincial stakeholders should be empowered to play a critical role in planning HRH
training, and be held accountable for this.

3.	     Invest in reducing demand-side barriers such as physical access barriers, ethno-
linguistic and gender barriers, and financial barriers, in order to increase the utilization of
essential health services, as underutilization in rural areas is a substantial driver of health
workforce inefficiencies in HCs. This will involve a combination of interventions (beyond the
scope of this policy note) including community-based initiatives to address health seek-
ing behaviors and cultural barriers, and health financing interventions to reduce financial
barriers. HRH-related interventions in order to improve linguistic concordance and gender
sensitivity will also be required, for example, by targeted recruitment of ethnic groups and
deployment back to their communities, and allowing pregnant women more choice on the
gender of those providing maternity services.

4.	     Invest in improving the service readiness of public health facilities. The share of
public expenditure on HRH as a fraction of general government health expenditure in Lao
PDR is already well within global and regional norms, although inadequate headcounts are
noted. Hence, in the near term, further investments to ensure the availability of essential
health commodities, equipment, and infrastructure in order to improve the service readi-
ness of HCs should be prioritized, as the lack of these are noted to be just as much (if not
more) a source of HC worker dissatisfaction as salary is. The supply-side readiness of HCs
to provide maternal health services has been previously noted to be low.58 Hence, such in-
vestments will have the synergistic effect of improving both health worker satisfaction as
well as improving the technical readiness of health facilities to provide quality health ser-
vices which improve health outcomes.

Annex 1: Regressions

For each of the four cases – nutrition, immunizations, curative child health (IMCI), and ob-
stetrics (IMPC) – a basic regression model was used, with the normalized case score as the
dependent variable and independent variables as detailed in Table 11. In addition, Table 12
contains results from another basic regression model with the normalized combined case
scores as the dependent variable. Notable findings are the strength of associations with
markers of the degree of isolation and size of HCs. Health workers working in large HCs with
many health workers in lowland environments scored significantly better than average
