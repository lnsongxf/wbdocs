       The GEF-6
biodiversity
       strategy
Foreword
                              It is my great pleasure to present in this publication the GEF-6
                              biodiversity strategy for 2014-2018.

                              As the financial mechanism of the CBD the GEF provides funding
                              to help countries implement the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity,
                              2011-2020, and achieve the Aichi Targets. I am pleased that donors
                              during the recently completed replenishment pledged $1.296 billion
                              towards the biodiversity focal area for GEF-6, making it the largest

                              Consistent with the CBD Strategic Plan, the goal of the GEF’s biodiversity
                              strategy is to maintain globally significant biodiversity and the ecosystem
                              goods and services that it provides to society. To achieve this goal,
                              the strategy encompasses four objectives:
                              1) 	improve sustainability of protected area systems;
                              2) 	reduce threats to biodiversity;
                              3) 	sustainably use biodiversity; and
                              4) 	mainstream conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity into
                                  production landscapes/seascapes and sectors.

                              The GEF-6 biodiversity strategy is composed of ten programs that, through
                              a continuum of measures, address the most critical drivers of biodiversity loss
                              across entire landscapes and seascapes. The programs include direct
                              conservation/protection, threat-reduction, sustainable use, and biodiversity
                              mainstreaming approaches. Each program provides a focused and calibrated
                              response in a specific ecosystem or location in a landscape or seascape.
                              In addition, for the first time, the strategy addresses the most critical underlying
                              driver of biodiversity loss; the failure to account for and price the full economic
                              value of ecosystems and biodiversity.

                              Achieving the Aichi Targets will require more than money. To have transformational
                              results will require landscape-level and sector-wide approaches that integrate the
                              sustainable management of biodiversity into multiple sectors and that require
                              engagement and ownership with stakeholders beyond the environment sector.

                              GEF’s new biodiversity strategy acknowledges this reality and provides ample
                              opportunities for countries to pursue new biodiversity management solutions
                              that are systems-oriented, that address underlying drivers and direct pressures
                              of biodiversity loss, and that engage all sectors of Government and society.

                              We look forward to supporting a new generation of biodiversity investments that
                              match the scope of the challenge and the aspirations inherent in the Strategic Plan
                              and we commit to work together with the CBD, donors and recipient countries,
                              GEF agencies, and civil society towards the joint achievement of the Aichi Targets.

*	   The global standards for identification of key biodiversity areas are currently under revision through a broad scientific consultation process
     convened by IUCN’s World Commission on Protected Areas/Species Survival Commission Joint Taskforce on Biodiversity & Protected Areas.
     These will be launched at the 2014 World Parks Congress. In the interim, the criteria and thresholds for key biodiversity area identification as
     presented above will be applied. It is likely that the great majority of sites meeting these criteria will also be considered key biodiversity areas
     under the new standard.

                                                    ABOUT THE GEF

                                                    The Global Environment Facility is a partnership for international
                                                    cooperation where 183 countries work together with international
                                                    institutions, civil society organizations and the private sector,
                                                    to address global environmental issues.

                                                    Since 1991, the GEF has provided $12.5 billion in grants and leveraged
                                                    $58 billion in co-financing for 3,690 projects in 165 developing countries.
                                                    For 23 years, developed and developing countries alike have provided
                                                    these funds to support activities related to biodiversity, climate change,
                                                    international waters, land degradation, and chemicals and waste in the
                                                    context of development projects and programs.

                                                    Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP) the GEF has made more than
                                                    20,000 grants to civil society and community based organizations for a
                                                    total of $1 billion.

                                                    Among the major results of these investments, the GEF has set up
                                                    protected areas around the world equal roughly to the area of Brazil;
                                                    reduced carbon emissions by 2.3 billion tonnes; eliminated the use of
                                                    ozone depleting substances in Central and Eastern Europe and Central
                                                    Asia; transformed the management of 33 major river basins and one-third
                                                    of the world’s large marine ecosystems; slowed the advance of
                                                    desertification in Africa by improving agricultural practices—and all
                                                    this while contributing to better the livelihood and food security of
                                                    millions of people.
