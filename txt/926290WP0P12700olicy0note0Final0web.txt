   This note was prepared to synthesize a series of knowledge products developed under the self-employment
   and small-scale entrepreneurship project (P127002). Useful inputs and suggestions were provided throughout
   the project by Xavier Cirera, Leonardo Iacovone, and Esperanza Lasagabaster. The authors also thank Graham
   Dixie, Sukanya Garg, Hyewon Kang, David Margolis, and Marta Malgorzata Milkowska for their contributions.
   The World Bank Education Team, led by Alexandria Valerio, provided invaluable input through the provision of
   data from their Entrepreneurship Education and Training database which accounts for half of the inventoried
   programs in this paper. Helpful comments were received from Mary Hallward-Driemeier, Cem Mete, Jamele
   Rigolino, and Dena Ringold in their role as peer reviewers. Rita Almeida, Louise Fox, Mattias Lundberg, Iftikhar
   Malik, Lucian Pop, Patrick Premand, Maria Laura Sanchez Puerta, and conference participants at the 9th IZA/
   World Bank Conference on Employment and Development in Lima, Peru, provided useful inputs. For more
   information, contact Yoonyoung Cho (ycho1@worldbank.org), Task Team Leader of this activity.

Box 2. Value chains: connecting to or moving within subsectors

 Value chains—also referred to as subsectors, clusters, or supply chains—are relevant for SSE programs for two reasons.
 First, many producers, particularly in farm and nonfarm activities, are connected in one way or another to these chains.
 In these cases, horizontal (between channels) or vertical movements within the chain can lead to gains in productivity
 and earnings. Second, for certain producers of tradable goods and services who are only operating in local markets,
 connecting to one of these subsectors can be an opportunity to expand sales and earnings. In fact, identifying the right
 value chains could be a precondition to make SSE programs viable and avoid saturating local markets and bringing down
 prices and earnings.

 Two important processes need to be considered when integrating SSE programs into value chains: (1) mapping the rel-
 evant subsectors, and (2) identifying the types of interventions needed to increase earnings (usually by reducing costs,
 improving quality, and/or increasing productivity).

 Mapping the relevant subsectors

 There are several methods and instruments to map markets. These methods are often based on interviews with key infor-
 mants to identify the main actors, their interactions, and their consumption and supply of different products. Since these
 specialized assessments are usually conducted by management consultants, trade associations, business development
 service agencies, government development agencies, and NGOs, program and project managers would need to mobilize
 the necessary expertise. It is important to note, however, that while in many assessments the entry point is a given prod-
 uct, in SSE programs the value chains would need to be selected/designed to be accessible to the target population of
 beneficiaries. In all cases, many producers of the same goods and services would need to be brought together—primarily
 because it is often through aggregation that the correct scale of the business can be achieved to compete within a given       21
 value chain. Also, aggregation through associations, cooperatives, and firms reduces contact costs, because the program
 does not have to coordinate with businesses individually.

 Identifying interventions to create jobs and/or increase earnings

 Once the business areas to be aggregated and the relevant value chains have been identified, various alternative inter-
 ventions are possible. These will usually focus on one or more of the following: connecting beneficiaries to the value
 chains; improving production technologies to improve quality, reduce costs, and/or increase productivity; facilitating
 vertical or horizontal movements within the value chain; or collectively addressing bottlenecks and regulatory failures.

 The challenge is to get skills up to the quality standards required by the value chain and to identify viable business for
 the group. Traditionally, the value chain approach has mostly sought to address the constraints of those already in the
 value chain, or at its margins. To this end, it is important to identify a value chain that does not only have a high poten-
 tial for increased productivity, but already includes targeted groups. When trying to integrate new actors (the self-em-
 ployed) into a value chain, a comprehensive approach that includes entrepreneurship sensitization and business and
 technical skills development is needed.
