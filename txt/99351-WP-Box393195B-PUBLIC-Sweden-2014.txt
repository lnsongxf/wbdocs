 The Country Profiles produced by the Enterprise Analysis Unit of the World Bank Group provide an overview of key business environment indicators in each economy, comparing them to
 their respective geographic region and group of countries with similar income levels. The same topics are covered for all countries with slight variations of indicators. All indicators are based
 on the responses of firms. To learn more about the Enterprise Analysis Unit and to obtain Country Profiles for other countries, please visit www.enterprisesurveys.org

However, trading also requires that firms deal with
customs and trade regulations, and often firms are also
required to obtain export and import licenses.

The ES quantify the trade activity of firms and collects
information on the operational constraints faced when
exporting and importing. Figure 9 provides a measure of
the intensity of foreign trade in the private sector,
captured by percentage of firms’ exporting (either
directly or indirectly) and also the percentage of
manufacturing firms using inputs or supplies of foreign
origin.

and on the characteristics of their financial transactions.
Figure 11 compares the various sources used to finance
purchases of fixed assets (investments). Investment
purchases can be financed by internal sources, banks,
inputs’ supplier credit, or other sources, including non-
bank financial institutions or personal networks.
Excessive reliance on internal funds may indicate
potentially inefficient financial intermediation.

Regulations, Permits, and Taxes
Good economic governance in areas such as regulations,
business licensing, and taxation is a fundamental pillar of
a favorable business environment. Registered firms pay
taxes and are supposed to comply with regulations.
Permits and licenses are usually required for business to
operate, build a new structure, and to import directly,
among other activities. Ideally, these regulations and          Complying with regulations is coslty for businesses.

Inefficient regulations constrain firms’ operations as they
present opportunities for soliciting bribes, where firms
are required to make “unofficial” payments to public
officials to get things done. In many economies bribes are
common and quite high and they add to the bureaucratic
costs in obtaining required permits and licenses. They can
be a serious impediment for firms’ growth and
development.

Figure 17 provides a composite index of corruption, the
bribery incidence, that reflects the percentage of firms

  1.    The sample for each economy is stratified by industry, firm size, and geographic region. The level of detail of the stratification by industry depends on
        the size of the economy. Stratification by size follows the three levels presented in the text: small, medium, and large. Regional stratification includes the
        main economic regions in each economy. Through this methodology estimates for the different stratification levels can be calculated on a separate basis
        while, at the same time, inferences can be made for the non-agricultural private economy as a whole. For more details on the sampling strategy, review
        the Sampling Note available at www.enterprisesurveys.org.
