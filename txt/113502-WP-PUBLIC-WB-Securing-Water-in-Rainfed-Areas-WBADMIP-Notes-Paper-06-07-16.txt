 Impacts and learnings of an ongoing Project
 �	Compulsory inclusion of a chapter on hydrology in the Scheme Development and Management Plan.
 �	Use of web-based tools for planning, supervision and monitoring of different project parameters ensures high levels of
   accuracy, resource efficiency and transparency.
 �	Introduction of village-level planning maps using scientific information corroborated by community perceptions for
   technical feasibility and community ownership.
 �	The state government allocating INR 500 crores for development of water resources in semi-arid areas of the state.
   Earlier, the focus was always on irrigated areas.
 �	Targeting the poor, ensuring efficient use of resources and delivering environmentally sustainable production
   solutions can work conjunctively and successfully with focused planning supported through the use of right
   information and tools.




The Watershed Development Component of the PMKSY (erstwhile Integrated Watershed Management
Programme-IWMP) is being implemented across rain-fed areas covering 28 states of India, following the Common
Guidelines for Watershed Management Projects (2008, revised 2011). The Programme in essence follows an area
development approach for treatment with topography playing a major role in the planning and design of land and
water related interventions. With the current focus on ensuring water availability to every farm, the experiences
and evolving lessons from the WB-ADMI Project can provide the water-related specificity to an overall integrated
area treatment approach within the PMKSY.
