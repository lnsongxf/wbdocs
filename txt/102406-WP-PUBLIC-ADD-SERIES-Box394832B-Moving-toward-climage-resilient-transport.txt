      Adaptation 
                 constitutes “The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human sys-
      tems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems,
      human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.” (IPCC AR5 Glossary)

      Resilience is the “capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or
      trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential functioning, identity and
      structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.” (IPCC AR5 Glossary)

      Deep uncertainty i s defined as uncertainty that occurs when parties to a decision do not know or cannot agree
      on (1) models that relate the key forces that shape the future, (2) probability distributions of key variables and
      parameters in these models, and/or (3) the value of alternative outcomes. In general, most of future socio-
      economic conditions (population, prices) are deeply uncertain, and so is climate change. (Lempert et al. 2003)

      Decision making under uncertainty    methodologies are state-of-the-arts methods that help plan for robust
      projects, despite these deep uncertainties about the future. They move away from relying on predictions of the
      future in project design and place the decision back into the center by asking the question “what are the future
      conditions that make my system (e.g. road network) fail?”. The systems or projects are stress-tested under hun-
      dreds of combinations of plausible future conditions—that include changing climate conditions. Once the main
      risks and the specific vulnerability thresholds of the system are identified, planners can evaluate them and
      explore options that may reduce these risks.

The ND-GAIN index summarizes a country’s vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges. It uses six
measures describing exposure, sensitivity and capacity in each of six major sectors; food, water, health, ecosystems,
human habitat and infrastructure. These 36 measures are combined to give a vulnerability score for each country. 
The ND-GAIN index also includes an estimate of a country’s readiness to absorb and apply resources to actions
to adapt to reduce its vulnerability. Readiness is based on 9 measures that indicate its economic, governance and
social capacities. The figure shows the overall vulnerability score based on 2013 data.

           Republic of Moldova’s INDC

           The INDC submitted to the UNFCCC by the republic of Moldova includes an objective to “Assure the develop-
           ment of climate resilience by reducing at least by 50  percent the climate change vulnerability and facilitate
           climate change adaptation in six priority sectors (agriculture, water resources, forestry, human health, energy
           and transport) by 2020.”

           Adaptation measure are identified for the transport sector to reduce losses and risks in the event of significant
           changes in temperature and extreme rainfall:

           •	 For increases in extreme precipitation events: developing new, adverse climate conditions-resilient paving
              materials; overlaying roads with more rut-resilient asphalt; using the most efficient technologies to assure
              sealing and renewal of asphalt concrete; broader use of efficient road maintenance methods; conducting
              risk assessments for all new roads; improving flood protection; making more use of sensors to monitor water

              increasing warnings and providing updates to dispatch centers, crews and stations.

           Given the long planning horizons for transport infrastructure the INDC highlights the need determine whether,
           when, and where the long term impacts of climate change could be consequential.

        BOX 3  Integrating Climate and Disaster Risk Considerations
        into Systematic Country Diagnostics

        At the World Bank Group, the Country Partnership Framework (CPF) guides support to a client country.   It is
        informed by a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) that identifies the most important challenges and oppor-
        tunities at a country level for reaching the goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity in
        a sustainable manner.  Climate and disaster risk considerations are integrated into this process under a policy
        commitment under the seventeenth replenishment of IDA; the Bank’s fund for the poorest countries.   

        A recent review of experience, shows that SCDs/CPFs for regional programs in Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar
        are including disaster response measures and should consider transport systems and mobility across and within
        countries.

        In Honduras the SCD notes its high vulnerability to natural hazards and disaster risks and related socio-economic
        impacts.  It identifies the need to further develop knowledge and disaster risk assessments to reduce existing
        high levels of structural vulnerability in public assets as well as integrating disaster risk reduction criteria in ter-
        ritorial and sector planning processes.

        In the Pacific Region the SCD notes the high vulnerability of Pacific Island counties to climate and disaster events.
        It highlights the importance of integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into policy,
        planning and investment decisions.  It also notes that investments in improved disaster risk management and
        early adaptation show unambiguously high rates of return, particularly for people and assets in coastal areas.

    BOX 5  Accessibility and Resilience of Road Networks

    In a study of “Road Networks, Accessibility, and Resilience,” the World Bank developed a methodology for testing
    the resilience of the national road networks in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru to climate-related shocks (Briceño-
    Garmendia et. al. 2015). The resilience of the road network is its ability to remain operational as a system, even
    though particular links in the system are substantially degraded or out of service entirely.

    Faced with the challenge of having to allocate resources efficiently and prioritize the most urgent investments
    on the road networks, decision-makers struggle to identify the most critical links and evaluate their vulner-
    ability, in face of uncertain future events and uncertainties about their impact. In this study, the World Bank
    sought to answer three key questions: (1) How can we identify the most critical roads in the national network?
    (2) Given the existing uncertainties, what are the expected annual losses linked to flood disruptions of critical
    group of links? (3) How can we best reduce these losses and choose between available ex-ante options and ex
    post interventions?

    To help answer these questions, the study illustrates how to effectively combine traditional transport models,
    like HDM-4, with innovative network analysis and state-of-the-arts methods for managing uncertainties about
    the future.

    By using the interdiction technique on thousands of links, this study shows how to select the most critical links.
    It then demonstrates how to select the most exposed and vulnerable of these links to floods and landslides.
    It also shows that the analyst can easily take into account additional qualitative information on the strategic
    or economic relevance of some links, to improve the decisions. Finally, by running hundreds of scenarios of
    possible events and their impacts, it applies a robust decision-making approach to guide a cost-effectiveness
    analysis of policy options available when a road network is exposed to unpredictable climate events.

BOX 7  Integrating Disaster Risk into the Lifecycle Management of Transport
Infrastructure in South Asia

The asset management system can be used as a decision-making framework for incorporating adaptation con-
cerns into a transportation agency’s management approach (Meyer, Amekudzi, and O’Har 2009). Given that all
transportation agencies have some form of an asset management system, it provides a convenient and targeted
way to integrate climate-induced change into transport decisions.

In the case of roads, asset management relies on monitoring the performance of systems and analyzing the
discounted costs of different investment and maintenance strategies. For existing infrastructure, the key issue
is making efficient choices about maintenance and replacement. When building new infrastructure, asset man-
agement involves evaluating total life-cycle costs—both the initial capital costs and the subsequent costs for
operation, maintenance, and disposal. The aim is to ensure that projects are prioritized appropriately and are
built cost effectively. This could include, for example, making a larger initial investment in a thicker pavement
to provide a greater-than-proportional increase in pavement life; or shortening the period between pavement
overlays, which could reduce fuel and maintenance costs for road users. Climate change monitoring tech-
niques and adaptation strategies can be factored into an asset management system in several ways. Table B4.1
describes the experience with such approaches in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

In South Asia, the World Bank piloted the integration of disaster risk into the life-cycle management of transport
infrastructure. A transport asset management system was developed in Bhutan that incorporated appropriate
vulnerability attributes. The database helps monitor assets to plan operations and maintenance activities but
also helps identify critical and weak links in the transport network that are vulnerable to disasters. Additional
pilots of the approach are being prepared in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Belize. The objective of these engagements is
to raise awareness beyond the ministries of transport, particularly with ministries of finance, on the importance
of understanding current risks, reducing transport infrastructure vulnerability, and ensuring future risks are
fully taken into account in new transport infrastructure investments and plans.

    BOX 8  Emerging Lessons from Screening Transport Projects
    for Climate Risk in IDA Projects

    A recent portfolio-level review looked at the experience with using the World Bank’s climate and disaster risk
    screening tools for transport projects financed by the World Bank’s International Development Association
    (IDA). The review yielded a number of conclusions and insights.

    •	 Exposure to climate hazards, particularly extreme precipitation and flooding, but also coastal hazards, sea
       level rise, and storm surge, is rising.

    •	 A project’s overall sensitivity to climate change drives potential impacts on physical infrastructure, such as
       road-surfacing materials, bridges, and ramps.  This includes increases in the variability of temperature and
       precipitation and increases in the intensity of extreme events like flooding and heat waves. Extreme precipi-
       tation and flooding are especially highlighted.

    •	 Considering climate risks early in project design matters. For instance, coastal hazards such as sea-level rise
       and storm surge were not prevalent in many projects analyzed, but where they are present they are expected
       to present high risks to the location and physical investments. Designing projects in a way that accounts for the
       current and future risks can help to reduce the sensitivity of transport investments in the medium and long term.

    •	 “Soft” measures such as capacity building, data gathering, policy development, and strategic planning are
       important for improving the adaptive capacity of the institutions and people that manage and rely on trans-
       port networks and should be enhanced.

    •	 The broader development context, including the nationwide transport sector and socioeconomic and political
       factors, present challenges and opportunities for managing climate risks. This highlights the need to address
       systemic problems at the country level and integrate the principles of climate resilience where possible.

           BOX 9  Building Resilience in Can Tho City, Vietnam

           Can Tho City is the 4th largest city in Vietnam and the economic engine of the Mekong Delta Region. In 2014 the
           city reported annual GDP growth of 12 percent.a As one of the 13 Mekong Delta provinces, and being located
           along the Bassac River (Hau River), Can Tho City shares the hazards of the larger Mekong Delta. The city is sus-
           ceptible to flooding caused by Mekong alluvial overflow, high tides, and extreme rainfall events. Seasonal flood-
           ing typically impacts 30 percent of the city area, but has recently increased to 50 percent (Huong and Pathirana
           2013), and the city was seriously flooded every year from 2011 to 2014.

           Transport infrastructure in Can Tho is predominantly dependent on roads, rendering the transport sector vul-
           nerable to disruptions caused by seasonal flooding. While the city has assessed transport investments based
           on flood risks, the link between transport and urban land-use planning is not fully considered. In general, road
           investments in Can Tho have tended to focus on improving access to existing communities or providing access
           to large-scale economic development sites. The scale and nature of land use along the roadways has not been
           sufficiently monitored or planned, and the result has been sprawling growth into low-lying areas.

           The city authorities had plans to upgrade the road network to the North of the city in order to improve freight
           delivery from the industrial zones lying in the Mekong Delta. They also counted on that upgrade to help them
           with disaster recovery.  A World Bank diagnostic revealed however, that pursuing a program of road upgrades
           outside the city center would actually attract settlement in the plains, around the new roads. The plains being
           susceptible to flooding, this would only increase the vulnerability of the population.

           The diagnostic showed also that if more provisions were not made to encourage more settlement in and imme-
           diately adjacent to the historic center—which is not only the main generator of jobs of the region, but also the
           highest elevation within Can Tho city limits—urban sprawl would probably take place on the other side of the
           Mekong River, to the Southeast of the city center, where the national government had just constructed a bridge
           across the river.

           Based on this diagnostic, the city of Can Tho reprioritized its investments, choosing instead to strengthen the
           city center with a bridge connecting the new city bus terminal with the traditional city center, and a ring road
           providing better connection to other provinces, while allowing traffic to avoid the city center.

        Pacific island countries are highly vulnerable to climate change and severe weather events.a Roads are typically
        located adjacent to the coast, often less than a meter above sea level. Severe damage to road networks can block
        access to other services and critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, port facilities, power plants, and
        airports. Between 2012 and 2015, tropical cyclones caused physical damage and economic losses in Samoa,

        assisting Pacific island governments in the following ways to meet their severe transport challenges.

        •	 Spatial planning and risk-based tools to more effectively prepare for climate change and severe weather.
           Samoa and Tonga, for example, are making effective use of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology,
           which provides high-resolution aerial photographs to generate elevation data and strengthen spatial hazard
           mapping analysis. Samoa integrates LiDAR with an existing a citizen-engagement planning tool that assesses
           the resilience of coastal infrastructure for extreme weather events.

        •	 Fit-for-purpose infrastructure solutions for elevating low-lying main roads, installing drainage, using geocell
           paving technology for low-volume roads and strengthening coastal infrastructure.

        •	 Strengthening the enabling environment by building the capacity of government and supporting legal and
           regulatory reforms that improve the delivery of government resources.

        •	 Post-disaster recovery support.

        Early lessons from Kiribati, Samoa, and Tonga point to (1) the importance of resilient roads to ensure economic
        growth and intra-island connectivity, (2) the need for financial sustainability and long-term donor engagement,
        and (3) the need to raise awareness among road authorities on these issues. Achieving positive project out-
        comes depends on keeping design and implementation arrangements simple and ensuring that local communi-
        ties are engaged in projects from start to finish.

      BOX 11  Decision Making under Uncertainty in Africa

      In Africa, the World Bank applied decision-making techniques to look at the resilience of road networks to future
      climate change (World Bank 2015f). The study assembled a database of reasonably foreseeable road infrastruc-
      ture in Africa through 2030 was assembled.  Ninety-one possible climate scenarios for each link in the road
      network were applied to explore climate vulnerability. Based on the assumption that each scenario is equally
      plausible, a limited but likely set of discrete adaptation responses were evaluated against two criteria: minimiz-
      ing “maximum regret” and satisfying the widest range of possible futures.   

      The results constituted a significant case for adapting road design in Africa to temperature stressors but not to
      precipitation and flood stressors. Although the study was complex and required enormous computational power,
      its results indicated that methodologies for decision making in the face of deep uncertainty have great potential.

       BOX 12  Risk Planning and Resilient Infrastructure Codes in Madagascar

       Madagascar’s National Unit for the Prevention and Management of Disasters developed building codes for
       weather-resistant transport infrastructure, relying mostly on local experts. The country was divided into risk
       zones based on hydro-geological characteristics, existing assets, river morphology, and projected climate
       change scenarios. Safety return periods and improvement in designs were then developed for the different risk
       zones and types of infrastructure, as illustrated here.

       The experience of Madagascar provides several important lessons. The codes were developed at very low cost
       and relied heavily on local knowledge and dedicated national champions. The codes were extensively field
       tested and discussed with industry and communities. Awareness, training, and regulatory incentives were as
       important as the codes themselves. A proposed decree on building codes was discussed at length with legal
       experts and experienced implementers to ensure that potential loopholes would be addressed. The adopted
       decree was kept very simple to help ensure compliance.

     BOX 13  Moving toward Climate Resilience through the Disaster Risk-Management Cycle

     Practical measures can be implemented to build resilience in transport systems in all phases of the disaster risk
     management cycle, from disaster preparedness to rebuilding (see World bank 2015e):

     Risk Assessment and Management as Part of Disaster Preparedness

     •	 Define a central agency that can coordinate and mediate the responsibilities across the system.

     •	 Apply a design approach that is sensitive to the environment and the performance of the whole network over
        time.

     •	 Specify the resilience of the system as a key objective in transport planning.

     •	 Define the role of asset owners in mainstreaming as part of policy development.

     •	 Document the condition of existing infrastructure assets and provide access to such data as part of infrastruc-
        ture planning and design.

     •	 Engage in cross-sector coordination and innovative financial arrangements to incentivize resilience.

     •	 Increase awareness of resilience so that all stakeholders understand the need for resilience and what it entails.

     Emergency Response and Risk Reduction

     •	 Priorities immediately after a disaster are restoring critical lifeline routes and regaining basic access and
        mobility so that society can quickly resume a basic level of functionality.

     •	 Consider redundancy, diversity, flexibility, and robustness when planning for emergency recovery.

     •	 Effective recovery requires relevant and timely information and the capacity to rapidly mobilize resources.

     Postdisaster Recovery and Reconstruction

     •	 Establish an enabling predisaster framework that involves coordination among all stakeholders to  improve
        the resilience of assets and systems after a disaster.

     •	 Predisaster planning must encourage a shift from a “like for like” approach in reconstruction to “building back
        better.”

the building of resilience in the transport sector will require a
much more systematic approach.                                      At the World Bank, we will scale up resources and expertise to
                                                                    help meet these needs together with our clients and partners.
The good news is that we are not starting from scratch, as          We will deploy our technical expertise, our capacity to convene,
demonstrated in this report and by emerging work beyond             and our engagements on the ground to further develop and
the World Bank. An important opportunity now exists to work         refine tools and approaches tailored for policy makers, practi-
with partners to gather this experience, crowd-in the necessary     tioners, and local stakeholders. The process will allow climate
expertise, and translate it into a comprehensive toolkit. The       change analysis to be more easily integrated into transport

tion, design, and implementation of plans and operations that       mate resilience.
would enable transport policy makers and practitioners to
incorporate climate vulnerabilities in their decisions.
