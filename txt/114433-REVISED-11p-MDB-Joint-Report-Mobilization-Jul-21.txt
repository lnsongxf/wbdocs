Introduction

In 2015, the global community adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that underpin it, as well as actions needed to fulfill the
commitments made at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on
Climate Change.

As we highlighted at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July
2015, the financial resources needed to achieve the SDGs far exceed current financial flows.
Indeed, as explained in a paper prepared for the Conference and endorsed by the World Bank/IMF
Development Committee in April 20151, the world needs to move from billions to trillions of
financing in order to meet the challenge of promoting inclusive, sustainable growth, reducing
poverty and inequality, and protecting the planet.

At this time, we came together as Multilateral Development Banks to reaffirm our pledge to
catalyze more investment from private investors and other sources of capital such as pension funds,
sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies. We do this by leveraging our own capital base
by borrowing from capital markets to increase our own ability to finance development. In addition,
we catalyze greater private investment by: i) helping evaluate and structure high quality
investment projects; ii) helping mitigate risk (real and perceived) associated with investments that
have a positive development impact; iii) mobilizing resources from and co-investing alongside
both traditional investors and new sources of commercial financing for development; and iv)
developing new financial products to help unlock additional flows.

While we each report the leverage of our own balance sheets according to accepted financial
reporting standards, the mobilization and catalyzation of private investment through our financing
and advisory activities has not been measured and reported in a comprehensive and consistent way.
We have therefore lacked a common basis on which to track progress in increasing our contribution
to catalyzing private investment to support our shared development objectives.

To remedy this, we worked together to develop a joint framework and methodology to measure
private investment catalyzed by the MDBs. This would allow us to measure private investment
catalyzed on a consistent basis by applying common definitions and methodologies, and to report
more fully on our contributions to a range of development priorities, including climate change and
infrastructure development. By coordinating measurement and reporting across MDBs in this way,
we will increase the transparency and accountability of our work, and identify potential gaps and
opportunities to do more.

Building on our work to harmonize reporting on climate finance, we have agreed on an initial set
of definitions and methodologies to measure the total amount of ‘private cofinancing mobilized’
in our operations, and its component parts of ‘private direct mobilization’ and ‘private indirect
mobilization’ for most of our financial products and for direct transaction advisory services.

We note that different measures can be tracked and reported with different degrees of accuracy.
Because private direct mobilization involves a transactional relationship between the MDB and
the client, this metric can be captured with the greatest accuracy, and in some MDBs is audited.
Private cofinancing of an MDB-supported project or activity may not directly involve the MDB in
arranging the financing, and therefore measurement relies on voluntary reporting by the client or
estimates by the project team. It is therefore likely to be less accurate. This does not imply that it
is less important to measure – indeed the amounts are substantially larger.

We have made efforts to avoid double-counting where more than one MDB is involved in a
transaction, and we have applied attribution rules to this end. Since this is the first time we are
reporting using these new definitions, our information systems are not yet fully in place and the
basis for accurate estimation and attribution is incomplete. We therefore acknowledge limitations
on the accuracy of the results and we urge caution in using the data from the first year of reporting
as a baseline for projecting future amounts. We expect to fine-tune the methodology, establish
more robust information systems, and otherwise improve the reliability of the data in future years.
This may result in upward or downward movement of the reported amounts independent of the
actual amounts mobilized.

We recognize that we also catalyze private investment on a much broader scale through advice,
support for policy reform, capacity building, demonstration effects, and other activities which
trigger an investment response from private investors, or which open new opportunities for private
investment. We will continue to explore ways to measure and report on this broader private
investment catalyzation. We will also explore ways to capture the mobilization impact of a wider
range of MDB advisory work. We recognize that without the ability to measure these wider
impacts, we are capturing only a part of our overall efforts to catalyze private investment.

We emphasize that these measures of private investment mobilization and cofinancing track the
size of the financial flows, but do not measure the development impact of these flows. We continue
to measure and report on the development impact of our operations through our established results
measurement systems.

2016 Results

Based on 2016 commitment data2, we estimate that the total amount of long-term co-financing
mobilized by the MDBs from private investors and other institutional investors (including
insurance companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds) in all countries of operation was
US$163.6 billion. Of this, private direct mobilization is estimated at US$49.9 billion. In addition,
we estimate the MDBs’ private direct mobilization through short-term finance was US$3.7 billion.
Mobilization of short term finance from the private sector was focused on closing market gaps in
trade and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance.

This financing supported investment in a range of sectors. In view of the importance of private
financing to meet the enormous infrastructure financing needs of developing countries, we
estimate the proportion of total long-term cofinancing for infrastructure (including power, water,
transportation, telecoms, IT and social infrastructure (such as schools and hospitals)) in all
countries of operation was US$68.7 billion. Private direct mobilization for infrastructure was
US$7.1 billion.

Annex – Disaggregated Results

The data contained in this annex disaggregates MDBs’ aggregate amount of Direct and Indirect
Mobilization from private investors and other institutional investors (including insurance
companies, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds) on a consistent basis. Please refer to the
“Joint MDB Reporting on Private Investment Mobilization: Methodology Reference Guide”
(www.worldbank.org/mdbmobguide) for further information and detailed methodologies.

The data is disaggregated by country income group (i.e. low income countries, low income
countries and other least developed countries, middle income countries, and high income
countries) and by institution. “Low income countries”, “middle income countries” and “high
income countries” are defined using the World Bank Atlas method. “Least developed countries”
are defined as per United Nations Committee for Development.
