Executive Summary


Recent economic developments

The Ethiopian economy continued its strong expansion in FY14 with real GDP growing by 10.3 percent.
Growth was driven mainly by the services sector from the supply side and public investment from the demand side.
At the same time, inflation has remained in single digits for the last two years on account of tighter monetary policy
and lower international commodity prices. However, in recent months in 2015, domestic food prices are increasing
partially as a result of shortage rainfall during the short rainy season. On the fiscal side, the budgetary stance at
the general government level has been cautious even though recently rising debt levels and borrowing costs are
cause of concern. In an effort to adjust for the rising cost living, the FY15 budget incorporates an increase in public
sector salaries after years of no increases which could also be the first step to adjust the balance between capital
and recurrent expenditure. The salary increase accompanied by a supplementary budget in the middle of the fiscal
year could potentially increase the budget deficit.
   The current account balance weakened due to trade balances and declining transfers. The deterioration
is on account of a worsening trade deficit which was driven by weak export performance and large imports of capital
goods for public investment programs. Goods exports showed positive growth in 2013/14 but rates remained far
below their historical growth; furthermore, export growth fell into negative territory again in the last quarter of 2014
and first quarter of 2015. In addition, private and official transfers, one of the largest external resources to Ethiopia,
dropped over the past year and accounted for 7.4 and 2.1 percent of GDP          , respectively, in 2013/14.
   The strong economic growth in the past decade helped to reduce poverty significantly. The poverty
headcount, measured by the national poverty line, fell from 38.7 percent in 2005 to 29.67 percent in 2011. Measured
with the international poverty line (US$1.25 per day) Ethiopia saw the second fastest rate of reduction in Africa.
Economic growth, particularly in agriculture, has been an important driver of poverty reduction in the last decade.
Favorable weather conditions and improving terms of trade for rural producers have been reasons of this past trend
supported by strong improvements in access to basic services and rural safety nets. Low levels of inequality have
been maintained with the Gini coefficient remaining stable at 0.30.

Economic outlook and challenges

The recent fall in global oil prices is expected to have a positive economic impact on Ethiopia. The
country is a net importer of fuel, which accounts for one-fifth of goods imports. The growth effect is expected to
be positive in part because declining oil prices increase disposable real income and support stronger domestic
consumption. The price decline will result in an estimated 1.8 percent reduction in the price of goods and services.
Improvements in terms of trade also support the external sector: Staff estimates suggest Ethiopia’s terms of trade
could increase by about 6 percentage points in FY15. Inflation is also expected to decline, especially due to indirect
impact and its positive effect on expectations. The current account deficit is expected to improve by 1.5 percentage
points of GDP in FY15.
   Growth will remain high in the short term while gradually declining in the medium term. While a
rising working age population will continue to support potential GDP growth, total factor productivity growth and
investment are gradually expected to decline. High growth and lower oil prices will drive further reductions in poverty.
   Lower oil prices will aid poverty reduction. This comes through a reduction of consumer prices by an
estimated 1.8 percent for the average Ethiopian household. This reduction will be relatively larger for urban and
wealthier households. For those rural households that depend on cereal sales, welfare gains from lower consumer

    prices may be partially offset by lower cereal prices. Lower oil prices reduce import prices and require local cereals
    to be more moderately priced to be competitive.
      An appreciated real effective exchange rate does not help competitiveness, especially in
    manufacturing. The real exchange rate appreciated by 22.5 percent (y/y) at the end April 2015 showing a
    cumulative appreciation of 71 percent since the nominal devaluation in October 2010. In addition, Ethiopia is now
    on an appreciation path against all currencies that are depreciating against the US$. This is because the Birr is closely
    managed against the US$. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement by the
    IMF (2013b). The authorities describe it as a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The
    annual pace of nominal depreciation, however, has been stable at 5 percent in recent years. There is concern that
    the appreciated currency does not help improving export competitiveness; much more, since exports are falling again
    and the Government is trying to encourage a thriving manufacturing sector to develop. Maintaining a competitive
    exchange rate is an important component of maintaining external competitiveness, but its macroeconomic effects,
    for instance on import prices and inflation need to be managed closely (World Bank, 2014a).

    Growth and transformation through the manufacturing sector

    The Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) seeks to transform the economy toward an industrialized
    economy and to increase per capita income of its citizens by 2025. To this effect, the Government has
    adopted policy focused on the development of the manufacturing sector through the use of industrial parks to attract
    FDI and to support SMEs. Targeting SMEs is important as they are an engine for jobs creation and a manifest of a
    thriving and dynamic economy. But, with services and agricultural sectors contributing almost 90 percent of GDP
    the GTP has not been able to accelerate structural transformation. At the same time, the share of the manufacturing
    sector in GDP remained just above 4 percent of GDP for most of the past decade. Furthermore, Ethiopia has not
    made significant progress in pulling labor out of agriculture into more productive and industrial jobs. The share of
    employment in the manufacturing sector has changed only slightly and is virtually unchanged since 1999 at below
    5 percent of total employment.
      Ethiopia is wage competitive, but productivity performance varies across firms. In Ethiopia, productivity
    performance is heterogeneous among firms; foreign owned, publicly owned, and older firms appear more productive
    than domestic, private, young firms. Although labor productivity in Addis Ababa compares well with firms in peer
    countries with same level of development, this appears to reflect higher capital intensity rather than more efficient
    production. Still, low wages in Ethiopia of about $1,100 per worker per year enable (based on data from Enterprise
    Survey, 2011) firms to remain competitive even if firms in other countries are more productive.
      A key determining factor of productivity is the ability of an economy to supply the skills needed
    for companies to grow and to thrive. Ethiopia has made significant progress in expanding access to education, but
    challenges remain. A more literate and trainable labor force would not only increase productivity in Ethiopia, but also make the
    country more attractive to international firms seeking to invest in Africa. Yet, skills shortages in Ethiopia constitute a key constraint
    to growth and improved productivity in the manufacturing sector despite the country has made significant progress in expanding
    access to education. In the short run, Ethiopia may not need to wait for higher levels of enrollment and improvements in the
    quality of education provision at secondary and tertiary education levels to stimulate the growth of the manufacturing sector. In
    fact, its education sector policy should focus, inter alia, on the provision of a diverse range of TVET and second-chance general
    education programs for primary and secondary graduates who seek further education and skills development.
       Private investment, both domestic and foreign, is crucial for developing the manufacturing sector.
    A better investment climate that fosters the growth of existing firms, while encouraging the creation of new firms is
    key to attracting and increasing private sector investments. The business environment affects the performance of all
    firms, irrespective of their size; however certain aspects such as regulatory burden and information asymmetry may
    be of particular consequence to SMEs. Access to finance is a top obstacle to SMEs as firms in Ethiopia are more
    likely to be credit constrained than global comparators. There is strong evidence that lending to micro-enterprises
    and larger firms in Ethiopia is relatively adequate, while SMEs are left behind (“missing middle phenomenon”). The
    intensity of business operational constraints and entry barriers vary depending on whether firms are large, FDI-
                                                                                                      Executive Summary    xi




financed, or domestic SMEs. Business entry regulations and processes are consistently highlighted by the private
sector as burdensome and obstructive of firm entry and dynamism.
   The Government is implementing an industrial parks (IP) development program to address
investment-climate-related issues to land access, infrastructure, and logistic and customs processes,
and to further the attraction of FDI. Combined with comparatively low labor costs in Ethiopia, the IP program
is beginning to attract FDI especially in the manufacturing sector. But given that about half of FDI firms in Ethiopia
cite investment climate or regulation related issues as important impediments to investment, more FDI could be
attracted by addressing those constraints and furthering its IP program. Still, cumulatively more FDI firms succeed in
moving from the investment stage to operational phase than domestic firms. But while FDI has a better “conversion”
rate over domestic investors, there is still room for substantial improvement. Currently two out of three potential FDI
firms do not reach operational state. Important lessons could be drawn from the IP experience around the world. For
instance, the performance for IPs is greatly dependent on how well they are designed, implemented and integrated
into the local economy. Despite the concept of enclaves, in practice, the success of IPs comes once they are entwined
with the overall economy, and the institutional capacity of the Government. The importance of promoting linkages
and spillovers with domestic firms and the role of services in developing value chains is key. Thus, addressing the
investment constraints faced by firms outside the Industrial Parks needs to remain a simultaneously advanced critical
issue.

Policy recommendations

This Economic Update offers seven policy recommendations, which could contribute to the development
of the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia. The recommended actions focus on the key operational constraints
and entry barriers both for FDI companies and SMEs.
1.	Focus on skills development which is vital for increasing firm productivity.
2.	Implement measures to improve access to finance for firms especially “the missing middle,” small and medium
   sized enterprises, the majority of which are fully credit constrained.
3.	Address binding constraints relating to access to land and access to electricity.
4.	Improve tax administration and advance the simplification of the MSME tax system.
5.	Improve trade logistics, customs procedures and trade regulations, which primarily impacts large (exporting firms)
   and FDI.
6.	Simplify business entry regulations and processes to facilitate entry and exit of firms, which is a key requirement
   for a dynamic and thriving business sector.
7.	Utilize a strategic and phased approach for the development of Industrial Parks in line with international experience
   and to ensure efficient utilization of and demand for IP infrastructure.

This method leaves out those companies that were only featured in the data for one year, and it does not recognize the first year productivity

     Box 1: China’s secret weapon in light manufacturing: Small and Medium
     Enterprise-oriented “Plug and Play” industrial zones
     The success of Chinese manufacturing growth in recent decades is indisputable and has irrevocably shifted the global landscape
     for manufacturing competitiveness. In contrast, manufacturing in other regions has failed to deliver broad-based growth and
     poverty reduction on anything close to the scale as has been observed in East Asia. Although the importance of China’s coastal
     special economic zones has been well-recognized and documented (e.g. as platforms for attracting export driven FDI and
     testing grounds for key reforms), China’s experience with smaller industrial zones mostly catering to domestic SMEs is less well
     known—and yet these have also played a critical role in China’s astonishing industrial development over the last twenty years.
        One spectacular example of China’s success and the role played by zones is the Weihai Zipper Company in Zhejiang. Starting
     from virtually nothing, over a span of two decades, it now exports $15 million worth of zippers to about 60 countries. It currently
     employs 3,000 workers with an estimated daily output of 4 million zippers. This company is part of a zipper industrial cluster
     which counts more than 500 companies (China has more than 75 percent of the world’s market share in zipper, with the industry
     employing more than a million workers). Weihai Zipper Company decided to move to an industrial zone because the government
     offered a great package of cheap and abundant land and a predictable supply of utilities, especially water and energy. The
     manufacturer said that moving to the industrial zone enabled the scale up of the company by providing more space for plant
     expansion and for workers’ dorms in the park.
        China has more than 1,000 industrial zones following a central government policy encouraging the development of such
     zones. Most cities and counties have followed the models set by the large zones developed by the central and provincial
     governments. The local governments are motivated to develop industrial zones to get tax revenues and revenues from selling
     land, as well as nice records of administrative performance. Of course, not all Chinese industrial zones have been successful;
     the better ones were built on existing or potential industrial strengths, in other words, local comparative advantages. These
     industrial zones played a critical role in facilitating the growth of Chinese SMEs from family operations catering to the local
     market to global powerhouses. These zones not only provided Chinese SMEs with good basic infrastructure (e.g. roads, energy,
     water and sewage), security, streamlined government regulations (e.g. government service centers) and affordable industrial
     land, they also provided technical training, low cost standardized factory shells allowing Chinese entrepreneurs to “Plug and
     Play” as well as Chinese workers with free and decent housing accommodations right next to the plants. Hence they played a
     very critical role in helping Chinese small enterprises to grow into mid-size and large enterprises, avoiding the “Missing Middle”
     problems that other countries face.
        These industrial “Plug and Play” zones considerably reduced the start-up investment costs and risks for SMEs at a phase in their
     development where they are still too risky for bank loans. They also facilitated the development of industrial clusters allowing
     tremendous economies of scale and scope for Chinese industries (the emergence of clusters was further facilitated by the Chinese
     government’s support for the development of input and output markets). In a nutshell, the Chinese government facilitated SME
     development through the efficient provision of public goods and market information about sellers and providers but not subsidies.
     For example, firms pay market prices for the use of utilities. Most importantly, competition between firms is intense. The government
     does not bail out failing firms. It should also be noted that most of these zones did not preselect particular light industries, letting
     market forces drive the organic development of specialized clusters.
        A large proportion of China’s 350 million migrant workers from the Western Provinces live inside these zones in free housing
     located right next to the plants. These free accommodations provide decent housing at very low economic costs to the country
     (they are built using large scale productive techniques). The companies also provide very cheap food through cost effective
     means to the zones. Not having to spend much on food plus free housing and no need for transportation means that a worker
     in China can save up to 80% of her salary. In other developing regions, most of the wage is gone by the time the worker pays for
     his housing (often in slums), food and transportation. This, combined with the fact that a worker can increase her salary by 50
     percent through extra hours and productivity bonuses, goes a long way in explaining why Chinese workers are so motivated and
     productive while costing relatively little (it also explains a big part of the more than 40 percent of GDP saving rate in China)—these
     workers can earn and save in a few years enough money to change their and families’ lives.
        By contrast, Vietnam did not develop such SME-oriented zones, relying exclusively on FDI linked industrial zones to develop
     manufacturing exports and has successfully done so. However, there are limited linkages between such zones and the vast majority
     of small, informal SMEs which focus on the domestic market and remain small. Export growth in Vietnam does not bring about as
     much value addition as found in China (20 percent vs 33 percent in China from manufacturing value added) as the large firms
     also suffer from not being plugged into local clusters and value chains—they import most of their inputs. The Chinese system of
     SME-oriented “Plug and Play” industrial zones is thus one of the most important and least well publicized factors behind China’s
     extraordinary competitiveness in light manufacturing industry.
