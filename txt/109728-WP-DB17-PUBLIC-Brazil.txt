This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        Obtain Technical Term of Responsibility -ART

        Before the application process, the engineer and architect
        responsible for the project need to obtain an ART. An ART is a
        document required by the Engineers Syndicate (Crea) that
        defines, for legal purposes, who is responsible for the execution
        of works or services and provides an opportunity for
        professionals to register their works or services with Crea.

        The ART is required for each project according to the Federal
        Law N° 6.496 of 7 December 1977. It is possible to obtain it
        online within a couple of hours and it costs BRL 167.68. The value

      Register employees with the Social Security Office

      For each construction site, BuildCo must register employees
      separately with the Social Security Office (Instituto Nacional de la
      Seguridad Social, INSS). This procedure can only be done
4     whenever there is a proof of land tax payment,so it cannot be          0.5 days      no charge

      Request and obtain construction approval permit and
      construction execution permit

      BuildCo must apply for construction approval permit and the
      construction execution permit with the Municipality. If the
      project conforms to municipal legislation, zoning laws, and the
      municipal building code, the Municipality will issue a document
      approving construction. To apply for these permits, BuildCo must
      submit the architectural drawings and real estate documentation
      (real estate title or real estate tax).

      After examining the project’s architecture and engineering and
      issuing the permit, the Municipality examines the practical and
      installation aspects and begins the process of issuing an              274 days      BRL 4,200

      execution permit.

      BuildCo can request both permits simultaneously, but the
      Municipality grants the permits in a specific order.

      Valid for a year, the construction approval permit is a
      prerequisite for subsequent procedures. The construction
      execution permit is valid for 3 years. Due to backlog of projects,
      the time required for this procedure is at least 9 to 10 months.

      Submit project for analysis by Fire Department and obtain
      report

      Build Co must present the building project to the Fire
      department for approval and obtain a report which includes all
      the fire security measures that need to be implemented. This can
      be done in parallel with the approval permit request, so it can be
      a simultaneous procedure.                                             30 days        BRL 83

      Request and obtain construction approval permit and construction
      execution permit

      BuildCo must apply for construction approval permit and the
      construction execution permit with the Municipality. If the project
      conforms to municipal legislation, zoning laws, and the municipal
      building code, the Municipality will issue a document approving
      construction. To apply for these permits, BuildCo must submit the
      architectural drawings and real estate documentation (real estate title
      or real estate tax). After examining the project’s architecture and
      engineering and issuing the permit, the Municipality examines the
5     practical and installation aspects and begins the process of issuing an      365 days       BRL 805
      execution permit. BuildCo can request both permits simultaneously,
      but the Municipality grants the permits in a specific order. Valid for a
      year, the construction approval permit is a prerequisite for subsequent
      procedures. The construction execution permit is valid for 3 years. Due
      to backlog of projects, the time required for this procedure is at least 9
      to 10 months. This procedure cannot be simultaneous with the previous
      one since BuildCo. needs to register its employees.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

      Pay transfer tax (ITB I) and other fees at a commercial Bank

      Pay transfer tax (ITB I) at the Bank

      The buyer has to pay the transfer tax before the parties can sign the
      transfer deed. The majority of notaries prefer to receive the tax payment
      themselves and then take care of transferring it to the Municipality
      because they are responsible for checking that the tax payment is
      correct. Notaries also have to file to the tax authorities a declaration of              2% of the property
10    all the transactions that they were part of, given that they are jointly       1 day

      liable. Therefore, the notary provides the payment on behalf of the buyer
      and the parties pay at the notary. The payment needs to be done in
      person at any of the Banco Santander agencies in Rio de Janeiro.

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                                   The most likely procedure applicable to our case study would be a
                                                   reorganization, which will then be converted into a liquidation.
                                                   Mirage may use the reorganization proceeding to gain time, find a
                                                   new investor, or renegotiate its debt. Insolvency proceedings will
                                                   therefore start with Mirage (debtor) filing for court-supervised
                                                   reorganization (recuperação judicial) with the Bankruptcy Court of
                                                   the District of São Paulo. Mirage will benefit from the automatic stay

                                                   case will be converted into liquidation, for the following reasons: (i)
                                                   BizBank will most likely vote against the plan, since for BizBank the

                                                   achieved through a reorganization), and (ii) no plan can be approved
                                                   without Mirage’s consent, as it is the only creditor holding secured

                                                  will approximately take 4 years in total. According to the Bankruptcy

       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless

Job quality
Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
