EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report presents the findings of the Service Delivery Indicators in the education sector in Togo in 2013.
Survey implementation was preceded by extensive consultation with Government and key stakeholders on
survey design, sampling, and adaptation of survey instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments,
training of field staff, and field-work took place in 2013.

Information was collected from 200 primary schools, 1,141 teachers, and 1,938 grade four pupils in Togo.
The results provide a representative snapshot of the quality of service delivery and the physical environment
within which services are delivered in public pr i ma r y schools. The survey provides information on three
levels of service delivery: measures of (i) teacher effort; (ii) teacher knowledge and ability; and (iii) the
availability of key inputs, such as textbooks, basic teaching equipment, and infrastructure (such as sanitation,
quality of lighting etc.).

The results indicate an adequate number of teachers to serve the population’s ne eds, but they lack the
necessary skills and inputs. Absence rate is a factor, although relatively lower than in other countries, except
during teacher strikes. The reliance on volunteer teachers also creates challenges as only the present
discounted value of future earnings can be considered a source of motivation for them.1 Efforts are needed in
all major dimensions surveyed (competence, absence rate, inputs), although recent textbook provision efforts
appear to have already made an impact.

What providers know
Pupils cannot learn more from their teachers than what the teachers know. On average, Togolese primary
school teachers mastered 45% of an exam set at the lower primary level and only 2.5% of fourth grade
teachers (1.8% of primary school teachers) scored 80% or higher. Among fourth grade teachers in 2013/14
and/or third grade teachers in 2012/13, the average score was 43 percent overall, and 2.7 percent of
teachers had a score of 80 percent or higher. Teachers in private and urban public schools did better than
their public or rural public peers.

What providers do (teacher effort)
Overall, 21.6 percent of teachers were not in school during an unannounced and a further 15 percent were at
school, but not in the classroom. When in the classroom, teachers taught 79.2 percent of the time, meaning
that nearly one-fifth of the time was devoted to other activities. Cumulating the sources of lost teaching time,
pupils have roughly 48.9 percent of the scheduled teaching time.


What providers can use (availability of key inputs)
The pupil-teacher ratio averaged 43 pupils per teacher, slightly higher than the 40 pupils that are the norm in
Togo, but 29 pupils per class were observed during the survey on average. However, there are important
input deficiencies that make teaching more difficult. Roughly one-quarter (22.8 percent) of schools had the
minimum infrastructure, primarily because one school in four (24.4 percent) has functional, private, and
accessible latrines. Similarly, 14.6 percent of schools have the minimum teaching equipment, although public
schools are more likely to have textbooks for their pupils than private schools.


Does Ownership Matter?
In most areas, private schools performed better than public schools. The strongest differentials were in
infrastructure and classroom teaching time, while the absence rate among non-volunteer teachers was
generally similar. Although public school teachers devote a greater share of class time to instruction, private
school teachers spend more time teaching and are more likely to be in class (one-half the rate of classrooms
with pupils but no teacher). This adds up to 34 minutes of extra teaching time per day for private school
pupils. At the fourth-grade level, this is approximately an extra class of French or mathematics. Not only is
there more teaching, but private school teachers are, on average, more competent that their public school
1   Their earnings may have been as low as 5,000 FCFA/month, or roughly $5.

peers. However, their absolute levels remain low; this is a major concern for the state of the educational
system in Togo.

Geographic and gender differences
Aside from class sizes, public school pupils in rural areas are at a disadvantage compared to their urban
peers. Combined with other factors, this translates into significantly lower scores on the learning evaluation,
despite relatively closer non-verbal reasoning skill levels (a proxy for intelligence). Likewise, girls do worse
than boys in the tests. These effects are also cumulative: rural boys do worse than urban ones and rural girls
do the worst.

How does Togo compare with other countries?
Table 3, below, compares Togo with other countries for the public sector. 2 In terms of teacher effort, Togo has
a slightly higher absence rate than the average of the other counties, but the absence from the classroom was
lower, despite the strikes. Togo and Senegal are tied for the highest number of hours of effective instruction
time per day. However, teacher knowledge is particularly low; it is the greatest differential among all the
indicators, despite the positive correlation between student and teacher performance (Table C14 and Table
C15).

Compared to the other SDI countries, Togolese schools have the highest level of textbook availability, which is
positively correlated with student learning outcomes in French and mathematics (Figure 8).

Togo has the second-highest infrastructure gap (Nigeria is worst) and the worst availability of pedagogical
materials. Infrastructure lags primarily due to electricity and latrines, while the gap on pedagogical materials
is principally linked to the low number of schools that had all three items simultaneously (even using a 90
percent threshold for pens and exercise books).

    I.    INTRODUCTION
Located in the Gulf of Guinea between Benin and Ghana, Togo is a country with an estimated population of 6.2
million which is growing at 2.8 percent annually and likely to double in 25 years (DGSCN, 2011). With a
population density of 109 people per km2, it is much denser than the Sub-Saharan African average (35 people
per sq. km). Per capita income (US$589 in 2009) is low compared to Sub-Saharan Africa (US$1,675) and Low
Income Countries (US$676) averages. Poverty decreased from 62 percent in 2006 to 59 percent in 2011,
although extreme poverty rose during this same period. Poverty is most pronounced in rural areas and in the
Savanes region, where 73 percent of people lived in poverty in 2011 (64 percent in 2006). 3

Since 1990, Togo experienced a long period of socio-political crisis that ended with the parliament elections
in October 2007. Encouraged by the success of those elections and the new government’s reform platform,
donors reengaged with Togo after more than 15 years of very limited assistance. Presidential elections were
held in March 2010 and were well received by the observers. Togo reached the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative decision point in November 2008 and reached the Completion Point in 2010.

Togo’s general education system is divided into four levels: (i) a three-year pre-school cycle designed for 3-5
year olds, (ii) a six-year primary cycle designed for 6-11 year olds, (iii) a seven-year secondary education
cycle designed for 12-18 years old, consisting of a four-year junior level and a three-year senior level and (iv)
a higher education system. There are also (i) technical and vocational education at the junior and senior
secondary levels and (ii) literacy programs.

Enrollment and progression. Although gross primary enrollment has increased nearly 18 percent (from 113
percent to 133 percent) over the period 2000-2012, net primary enrollment has increased only 8 percent in
2000-9 (last year with data). Although repetition has decreased nearly 35 percent in the between 2000 and
2012, the primary completion rate has increased 15 percent, primarily due to a nearly 30 percent increase for
girls. This represents a reduction of 59 percent in the disparity between girls and boys in this time period.
The gross enrollment rate disparity between students from the poorest and the richest families has also
reduced by 11 percent over 2006-2011.

There are five factors to keep in mind when analyzing the results of the education survey. First, for pupils not
sitting for examinations, the school year was nearly over. Some teachers were also absent, proctoring or
grading the training exams (“CEPD blanc”), which could not be avoided. 4 As Figure 1 shows, there were a
number of strikes, both by civil servants and employees of faith-based schools that were felt differently in
rural and urban areas (Figure 1). Consequently, the SDI results reflect these realities. First visits were
reprogrammed to the extent possible so that teams conducted the first visits on days when there were no
strikes. However, second visits were allowed to fall on strike days to reflect the reality faced by pupils.
Indicators affected by this are presented with and without striking teachers (respectively, Table 2 and Table
19, for all schools and only schools without strikes). Finally, 44 of the 172 fourth-grade classrooms of schools
that had strikes in neither visit were taught by a volunteer teacher, with more in rural (N=37; 77 percent)
than in urban and in public (N=36; 68 percent) than in private. Unless otherwise stated, the main text
analyzes all schools.

4Where this is noted as a reason for absence, it is coded as “approved”, but it will bias upwards the rates of both overall an d
approved absences. Twelve schools’ records mention CEPD-related disruptions.

    Box 1. Analytical Underpinnings
    Service delivery outcomes are determined by the relationships of accountability between
    policymakers, service providers, and citizens (Figure 2, World Bank 2004). Human development
    outcomes are the result of the interaction between various actors in the multi‐step service delivery
    system, and depend on the characteristics and behavior of individuals and households. While delivery
    of quality education is contingent foremost on what happens in classrooms, a combination of several
    basic elements have to be present in order for quality services to be accessible and produced by
    teachers at the frontline, which depend on the overall service delivery system and supply chain.
    Adequate financing, infrastructure, human resources, material, and equipment need to be made
    available, while the institutions and governance structure provide incentives for the service providers
    to perform.

    policymakers




    Service Delivery Production Function
    Consider a service delivery production function, f, which maps physical inputs, x, the effort put in by
    the service provider, e, as well as his/her type (or knowledge), θ, to deliver quality services into
    individual level outcomes, y. The effort variable e could be thought of as multidimensional and thus
    include effort (broadly defined) of other actors in the service delivery system. We can think of type as
    the characteristic (knowledge) of the individuals who are selected for a specific task. Of course, as
    noted above, outcomes of this production process are not just affected by the service delivery unit,
    but also by the actions and behaviors of households, which we denote by ε. We can, therefore, write
                                                   y = f(x,e,θ) +ε
    To assess the quality of services provided, one should ideally measure f(x,e,θ). Of course, it is
    notoriously difficult to measure all the arguments that enter the production, and would involve a huge
    data collection effort. A more feasible approach is therefore to focus instead on proxies of the
    arguments which, to a first‐order approximation, have the largest effects.

    Indicator Categories and the Selection Criteria
    There are a host of data sets available in education. To a large extent, these data sets measure inputs
    and outcomes/outputs in the service delivery process, mostly from a household perspective. While
    providing a wealth of information, existing data sources (like Living Standards Measurement Survey
    (LSMS), Welfare Monitoring Surveys (WMS), and Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire Survey
    (CWIQ)) cover only a sub‐sample of countries and are, in many c ases, outdated.

    Box 1. Analytical Underpinnings (continued)
    The proposed choice of indicators takes its starting point from the recent literature on the economics
    of education and service delivery, more generally. Overall, this literature stresses the importance of
    provider behavior and competence in the delivery of education services (as opposed to water and
    sanitation services and housing that rely on very different service delivery models). Conditional on
    service providers exerting effort, there is also some evidence that the provision of physical resources
    and infrastructure has important effects on the quality of service delivery.

    The somewhat weak relationship between resources and outcomes documented in the literature has
    been associated with deficiencies in the incentive structure of school and education systems. Indeed,
    most service delivery systems in developing countries present frontline providers with a set of
    incentives that negate the impact of pure resource‐based policies. Therefore, while resources alone
    appear to have a limited impact on the quality of education in developing countries, it is possible
    inputs are complementary to changes in incentives, so coupling improvements in both may have large
    and significant impacts (see Hanushek, 2006). As noted by Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2011), the fact
    that budgets have not kept pace with enrollment, leading to large pupil‐teacher ratios, overstretched
    physical infrastructure, and insufficient number of textbooks, etc., is problematic. However, simply
    increasing the level of resources might not address the quality deficit in education without also taking
    providers’ incentives into account.

    SDI proposes three sets of indicators: (i) provider effort; (ii) knowledge of service providers and (iii)
    availability of key infrastructure and inputs at the frontline service provider level. Providing countries
    with detailed and comparable data on these important dimensions of service delivery is one of the
    main innovations of the Service Delivery Indicators.

    Additional considerations in the selection of indicators are (i) quantitative (to avoid problems of
    perception biases that limit both cross‐country and longitudinal comparisons), (ii) ordinal in nature
    (to allow within and cross‐country comparisons); (iii) robust (in the sense that the methodology used
    to construct the indicators can be verified and replicated); (iv) actionable; and (v) cost effective to
    collect.

    Box 2. The Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) Program

    A significant share of public spending on education is transformed to produce good outcomes at
    schools. Understanding what takes place at these frontline service provision centers is the starting
    point in establishing where the relationship between public expenditure and outcomes is weak within
    the service delivery chain. Knowing whether spending is translating into inputs that teachers have to
    work with (e.g. textbooks in schools), or how much work effort is exerted by teachers (e.g. how likely
    are they to come to work), and their competency would reveal the weak links in the service delivery
    chain. Reliable and complete information on these measures is lacking, in general.

    To date, there is no robust, standardized set of indicators to measure the quality of services as
    experienced by the citizen in Africa. Existing indicators tend to be fragmented and focus either on final
    outcomes or inputs, rather than on the underlying systems that help generate the outcomes or make
    use of the inputs. In fact, no set of indicators is available for measuring constraints associated with
    service delivery and the behavior of frontline providers, both of which have a direct impact on the
    quality of services that citizens are able to access. Without consistent and accurate information on the
    quality of services, it is difficult for citizens or politicians (the principal) to assess how service
    providers (the agent) are performing and to take corrective action.

    The SDI provides a set of metrics to benchmark the performance of schools in Africa. The Indicators
    can be used to track progress within and across countries over time, and aim to enhance active
    monitoring of service delivery to increase public accountability and good governance. Ultimately, the
    goal of this effort is to help policymakers, citizens, service providers, donors, and other stakeholders
    enhance the quality of services and improve development outcomes.

    The perspective adopted by the Indicators is that of citizens accessing a service. The Indicators can
    thus be viewed as a service delivery report card on education. However, instead of using citizens’
    perceptions to assess performance, the Indicators assemble objective and quantitative information
    from a survey of frontline service delivery units, using modules from the Public Expenditure Tracking
    Survey (PETS), Quantitative Service Delivery Survey (QSDS), and Staff Absence Survey (SAS).

    The literature points to the importance of the functioning of schools and more generally, the quality of
    service delivery. The service delivery literature is, however, clear that, conditional on providers being
    appropriately skilled and exerting the necessary effort, increased resource flows for health can indeed
    have beneficial education outcomes.

    The SDI initiative is a partnership of the World Bank, the African Economic Research Consortium
    (AERC), and the African Development Bank to develop and institutionalize the collection of a set of
    indicators that would gauge the quality of service delivery within and across countries and over time.
    The ultimate goal is to sharply increase accountability for service delivery across Africa, by offering
    important advocacy tools for citizens, governments, and donors alike; to work toward the end goal of
    achieving rapid improvements in the responsiveness and effectiveness of service delivery.

II.       Methodology and Implementation
The SDI indicators draw information from a stratified random sample of 200 schools, comprised of 148
public, 28 faith-based, and 24 private non-denominational schools. This sample provides a representative
snapshot of the learning environment in both public and private schools. The details on the sampling

procedure are in Annex 1. The education work was implemented as part of the ongoing work with the
Government of Togo on improving educational quality and development of the Ministry of Education’s
capacity to produce, analyze, and use statistical information for policy formulation and evaluation. The
standard SDI survey instruments were adapted to the Togolese context through a participatory process
involving technical discussions, training, and piloting with the Ministry of Education’s National (Education)
Evaluation Commission (Commission nationale d’évaluation; CNE).5

The education survey was also coordinated with the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) project’s PASEC -
inspired survey. A single team that undertook both surveys went to each school and the supervisors were
from the CNE. The survey was implemented by the CNE with support and supervision from the World Bank’s
Service Delivery Indicators (SDI) team. The modules of the survey instrument are shown in Table 5 below.

Table 5. Survey modules
              Module                   Description
    1.   School                        Administered to the director to collect information about school type, facilities,
         information                   school governance, number of pupils, and school hours. Includes direct
                                       observations of school infrastructure by enumerators.
    2.   Teacher                       Administered to director and individual teachers to obtain a list of all school
         information and               teachers, to measure teacher absence and to collect information about teacher
         absence                       characteristics.

                                       Includes an unannounced visit (Module 2B) to evaluate absence using the best
                                       known method from research on the subject.
    3.   School finances               Administered to the director to collect information about school finances.
    4.   Classroom                     Information on teaching activities, classroom conditions; collected through
         observation                   direct observation in the classroom.
    5.   Pupil assessment              Test of randomly selected grade-four pupils to measure their learning
                                       outcomes in mathematics and language.
    6.   Teacher                       Evaluation of teachers’ subject knowledge (mathematics and language) and
         assessment                    teaching skills.

The sample of schools used in the SDI survey was the same as the PASEC-inspired survey. The sample chosen
closely reflects the distribution of school usage across facility types and poverty status, as shown in Table 6
and Table 7.

schools, of which 74 percent were public schools and the remaining 26 percent either private for-profit or
private not-for-profit schools. The survey assessed the knowledge of 831 primary school teachers, surveyed
1,141 teachers as part of the study of the absence rate, and observed 192 grade four lessons.6 In addition,
learning outcomes were measured for 1,938 grade four pupils.

Survey implementation was preceded by extensive consultation with Government and key stakeholders on
survey design, sampling, and adaptation of survey instruments. Pre-testing of the survey instruments,
training of field staff, and field-work took place in 2013.

Five primary school teacher types were captured in the questionnaire: civil servants ( fonctionnaires),
auxiliaries (auxiliaires), volunteers (volontaires), private sector contractuals (contractuel du privé), and
community (financé par la communauté). Auxiliary teachers are in the probationary period and will either be
confirmed as civil servants or else dismissed. Their earnings are lower than civil servants. Volunteer teachers
are individuals who do not have the necessary qualifications to be recruited as auxiliaries and therefore work
as volunteers in hopes of being integrated to the civil service rolls at a later date. These individuals earned
less than 5,000 FCFA/month ($10) in 2013. Community teachers are supported by the community, but have
no expectation of integration into the civil service.

III.      RESULTS
       A. Teacher effort

Absence from school
       During the first announced visit, a maximum of ten teachers are randomly selected from the list of all teachers who
       are on the school roster. The whereabouts of these ten teachers are then verified in the second, unannounced, visit.
       Teachers found anywhere on the school premises are marked as present. This is limited to teachers who are not
       volunteers; details on volunteer teachers are in Annex 3.

       The statistics are weighted, with the interpretation of the indicator being the percentage of teachers who are absent
       during an unannounced visit.


The indicators relating to teacher effort (Absence from school, Absence from class, and Time spent teaching)
and the differences in outcomes between public and private, and urban and rural schools, respectively, are
presented in Table 8. They are summarized in Figure 3, which shows that out of 100 teachers only 53
percent were in class teaching on a given day. Roughly one teacher in five (21 percent) is absent from school
and a further 15 percent were at school, but not in the classroom. 7

Table 8 shows that less than one teacher in five was absent on any given day in Togo. 8 Among public schools,
teachers are nearly twice as likely to be absent from school in rural relative to urban areas (24 percent and
17.7 percent, respectively), although the adherence to the wave of strikes that took place during the survey
fieldwork was stronger in rural than in urban areas. Excluding schools that had strikes during the second
visit, the pattern remains broadly similar, although the absence rate in public school falls to 19.4 percent in

7 These statistics differ from those in Table 8, because they are calculated directly based on the teachers rather than first
aggregating at the school level. The figure does not include volunteer teachers.
8 This excludes volunteer teachers, who are not contractually bound to be present in class. When including them, the absence rate

from school rises to 21.4 percent. Annex 3 contains additional tables for all schools and all teachers (Table 20) and only non-
volunteer teachers in schools without strikes (Table 21).

rural and the difference with urban (2.7 percentage points) is reduced further. Whether or not schools with
strikers are included, the rural-urban difference is between six and 11 percentage points (p<0.05 for the
universe of all schools).

In general, non-volunteer teachers are present in school even in the strike environment. Fully 61 percent of
schools have no teachers absent, 70 percent of schools have one teacher in six absent (normally, there are six
active teachers in a Togolese school), 80 percent have one in three teachers absent, and 10 percent have more
than two-thirds of teachers absent. Reasons for absence are varied (Figure 4), but strikes were clearly the
most important reason. Excluding schools where at least one teacher was on strike, slightly more teachers are
present on average. Absence from the classroom follows similar trends.

Absence from class


           The indicator is constructed in the same way as the school absence rate indicator, with the exception
           that now the numerator is the number of teachers who are either absent from school, or present at
           school but absent from the classroom. A small number of teachers may be found teaching outside, and
           these are marked as present for the purposes of the indicator.

           The interpretation of the indicator is the percentage of teachers who are absent during an unannounced
           visit.

The behavior of teachers is generally the same whether or not the striking schools are included or excluded,
so what follows is for all schools. Given the importance of volunteer teachers in Togo, they will be included in
the following discussion. On any given day, 35.8 percent of teachers are not in the classroom, with rural
teachers 6.6 percentage points more likely to be absent than their urban counterparts (Table C3). Of those
teachers at school but not teaching, almost all were not in the classroom at all. Relative to private school
teachers, public school teachers are less likely to be at school and marginally less likely to be in class when at
school.

The comparison of absence from school and absence from class shows that roughly 58 percent of the absence
rate of teachers from the classroom is driven by absence from the school. This phenomenon is invariant with
respect to the schools with strikers. Estimates for absence from school, absence from class, and absence from
class, at school, broken down by teacher type are in Table C5. Unsurprisingly, private school (contractual)
teachers are statistically significantly more likely to be present than any other teacher category, however
their absence from the classroom is primarily due to teachers who are at school, rather than those who do not
show.9 Those closest in presence are auxiliary teachers, who have strong future earnings incentives from
integration into civil service, then civil servants, then volunteers.10

Table C7 reports regression models of absence from school and the classroom for teachers in all schools.
There are four broad categories of variables in the models: (i) teacher-specific variables, (ii) school-specific
variables, (iii) geographic effects, and (iv) poverty levels. Looking at the results, individual and supervision
incentives seem to be the most important aspects.

Individual incentives relate to contractual status and self-selection (teacher’s training college degree). Those
with less stable contract types (private school teachers) or greater long-term incentives (auxiliary teachers;
p<0.1 for absence from school) are more likely to be present than those with low incentives (volunteer
teachers). Teachers in poorer cantons are somewhat less likely to be absent (p<0.05). 11

Supervision incentives are those exerted by hierarchical superiors, whether in the facility or in the ministry.
An absent school director (over one standard deviation increase) and strikes during the second visit (0.7-0.8
standard deviation increases) are among the strongest predictors of teacher absence from school. They are
significant at the one percent level in both models.

Efforts by the ministry to reduce the absence rate in the Savanes region are difficult to measure precisely.
Although the absence rate module was done both in January and in May, there is not information both times
about the number of visits by supervisors, so it is not possible to estimate whether or not the resources for
increased supervision intensity had an effect upon the absence rate. Within the limitations of the sample size,
it appears that the public school absence rate is relatively higher in the Savanes region relative to other
regions, as reported Table C8, and shown in the regression results.



9 For more information on the characteristics and absence rates of teachers, see Table C6.
10 This excludes two community-financed teachers found in the sample.
11 Poverty information is from Coulombe, H. and C. Malé (2012), “Togo: Profil de pauvreté 2006 -2011”, UNDP and DGSCN,

and merged at the canton (first level below the region) level.

Time spent teaching per day

     This indicator combines data from the staff roster module (used to measure absence rate), the classroom
     observation module, and reported teaching hours. The teaching time is adjusted for the time teachers are
     absent from the classroom, on average, and for the time the teacher teaches while in classrooms based
     on classroom observations.

     While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and non-teaching activities. Teaching is
     defined very broadly, including actively interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil's work,
     asking questions, testing, using the blackboard, or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling, or
     memorization. Non-teaching activities is defined as work that is not related to teaching, including
     working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class, or doing nothing and thus leaving pupils not
     paying attention.

     The interpretation of the weighted indicator is the percentage of time taught in fourth-grade classrooms
     in an average day when accounting for absence from the classroom.


This indicator measures the amount of time a teacher spends teaching in a school during a normal day. It is
calculated by recording the reported scheduled time of a teaching day from school records, i.e., five hours
and 29 minutes after break times (Table 8). This number is multiplied by the proportion of teachers
absent from the classroom. The idea being that if 10 teachers are supposed to teach five hours and 23
minutes per day, but 3.3 of them are absent from either the school or the class at any one time, then the
scheduled teaching time is reduced to 2 hours and 56 minutes (five hours and 29 minutes x 0.489).

On average in Togo, a teacher will teach for two hours and 55 minutes (Table 8). That is, teachers teach
approximately 48.9 percent of the scheduled time (the r ep o rt e d scheduled time for grade four pupils is
five hours and 29 minutes after break times). Table C9 reports some intermediate inputs used in the
calculation of the indicator.

Even when in the class, however, teachers may not necessarily be teaching. The percentage of the lesson lost
to non-teaching activities is measured through observation of a grade four lesson.12 As reported in Table
C9, 48.9 percent of a typical day is devoted to teaching, while the remainder to non-teaching activities, such
as interruptions, and the teacher being absent from class. To account for this, the effective time for teaching
is multiplied by the proportion of time that teaching occurs in the classroom. From the initial five hours and
29 minutes, this leaves two hours and 40 minutes. The distributions of the underlying variables are shown
in Figure 5. Taken independently, it appears that there is a group of teachers who are frequently absent from
the classroom and a group who teach relatively little while in the classroom; combined, these effects
significantly reduce the overall teaching time for Togolese pupils.

Comparing Table C9 with Table C10, it is clear that volunteer teachers are more frequently absent, teach less
than the others, and perform worse on the evaluation. When considering these tables, it is worth keeping in
mind that there are very different incentive, accountability, and compensation frameworks for different
teacher categories, particularly volunteer teachers.

However, Table 8 also shows that there is some variation between public and private schools in teacher
effort. While the scheduled teaching time and the overall proportion of time taught are close, there is a
12 This is most likely an upper bound on the time devoted to teaching during a lesson; since presumably a teacher is more likely
to teach when under direct observation (i.e. Hawthorne effects will bias the estimate upward). During the observation,
enumerators first had to judge whether the teacher was teaching or not. If they judged the teacher to be teaching, they were
supposed to indicate how much time the teacher spent on any of the following teaching activities: teacher interacts with all
children as a group; teacher interacts with small group of children; teacher interacts with children one on one; teacher reads or
lectures to the pupils; teacher supervises pupil(s) writing on the board; teacher leads kinesthetic group learning activity; teacher
writing on blackboard; teacher listening to pupils recite/read; teacher waiting for pupils to complete task; teacher testing pupils in
class; teacher maintaining discipline in class; teacher doing paperwork.

          significant difference in the use of classroom time. Private-school teachers spend four percentage points less
          time teaching (76 percent and 81 percent, respectively) than do public-school teachers. The variation within
          public schools across rural and urban is statistically insignificant.

          In Togo, public schools are far more likely to have orphaned classrooms. 13 Overall, 19 percent of classrooms
          are orphaned, with strong patterns among the different breakdowns. Public schools are more than twice as
          likely as private schools to have such unsupervised environments (p<0.05). This phenomenon is generally
          more pronounced in rural areas than in urban ones (92 percent more likely; p<0.05).

          13This is measured by inspecting the school premises, counting the number of classrooms with pupils, and recording whether a
          teacher is present in the classroom or not. The share of orphaned classrooms is then calculated by dividing the number of
          classrooms with pupils but no teacher by the total number of classrooms that contained pupils.

       B. Teachers with minimum knowledge


     This indicator measures teacher's knowledge and is based on mathematics and language tests covering
     the primary curriculum administered at the school level to all mathematics or language teachers that
     taught grade 3 in the previous year or grade 4 in the year the survey was conducted. It is calculated as the
     percentage of teachers who score more than 80 percent on the language and mathematics portion of the
     test. In Togo, the teachers of grades 2 and 5 whose classrooms were included in the PASEC sample were
     included in the knowledge evaluations. This increased the number of grade 2 and 5 teachers in the
     sample. An effort was made to include all possible teachers and the results reported in

     The indicator is representative of the average teacher in the universe of teachers in the country rather
     than the average teacher at the average school.


The objective of the teacher test is to both evaluate mastery of basic and more advanced reading, writing, and
mathematical skills and to evaluate mastery of pedagogical skills. Taken together, these are critical elements
in the pupils’ acquisition of subject knowledge. The basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills that lower
primary pupils need to have in order to progress further with their education are interpreted as the
minimum knowledge required for the teacher to be effective and serve as the basis for the "Share of
teachers with minimum knowledge” indicator.

in Togo, teachers taught all subjects in primary school. The test was validated against the Togolese primary
curriculum and 12 other Sub-Saharan primary school curricula.14

The minimum knowledge indicator was calculated as the percentage of teachers who scored more than 80
percent on the lower primary part of the language and mathematics test (Table 9). The test also contained
more advanced questions in both subjects, as well as a pedagogy section. Satisfactory mastery of content
knowledge among Togolese teachers was quite low as only 2.7 percent of the teachers in grade 4 (2013/14
school year) and grade 3 (2011/12 school year) achieved a score of 80 percent or higher in the combined
French and mathematics sections. With a score of 7.2 percent, private school teachers were nine times more
likely to achieve proficiency than the public school teachers (0.8 percent). The results are generally similar
when all evaluated teachers are included, even though the average score rises to 45 percent from 43 percent.
As the cumulative density plots in Figure 6 show, there was a steep gradient in performance when using all
teachers, independently of the class taught.

         The heavy reliance on volunteer teachers in the Togolese context reduces the overall competence, although
         not as much as might be thought. Comparing the average scores on French and math with civil servants as
         the reference category (see Panel B of Table C11), auxiliaries (11.7 percentage points higher, p<0.05) and
         private school teachers (9.9 percentage points higher, p<0.10) do better, while volunteer teachers (9.7
         percentage points lower, p<0.05) do worse. 15

15   Additional details are in Table 26.

15
French

          As Table 26 shows, no matter the breakdown, teachers do better in French than they do in mathematics.
          Looking specifically at the French section of the assessment (Table 10), private school teachers perform
          14.6 percentage points better than their public school counterparts (p<0.01) and urban public school
          teachers perform 6.6 percentage points better than their rural counterparts (p<0.01).

          Teacher performance declines as the difficulty level rises, although the decrease is less marked for public
          school than for private school. On the grammar assessment, teachers averaged 74 percent. 16 Teachers in
          private schools, urban public schools, and urban schools all performed better than their comparators at the
          one percent significance level (p<0.01). In the Cloze task, private and urban public teachers performed far
          better than their comparison groups.17 Finally, the composition task, the only significant difference was
          recorded in public schools, where urban teachers scored roughly five percent higher than their rural
          counterparts.18

          Panels C and D of Table 26 show that teachers with more years of academic training do better, as do
          teachers who teach higher grades. Those with a teaching diploma from a teacher’s training college do better
          than those without such a diploma (Panels E and F of Table 26). Interestingly, the performance is not a
          monotonic function of the diploma level as those teachers without diplomas score better, on average, than
          teachers with the first diploma.

      year of the survey. Differences are relative to public or rural private, respectively. Superscript (*) denotes
      that the difference is significant at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) significance level.

Mathematics

          Teachers who taught grade 3 in the year prior to the survey or grade 4 in the year of the survey, correctly
          completed 30.2% of the basic mathematics examination (Table 11). As with French, teachers in private,
          urban, and urban public schools outperformed their comparator groups at the p<0.01. In almost all sub-
          categories of mathematics, urban public school teachers perform at or above (particularly for Venn
          diagrams) the level of private school teachers.

          The patterns in the sub-categories of the math section are consistent with the notion that more difficult
          items should have lower scores. Taken together, two reasons explain why fractions are not an exception to
          this rule (13.2 percent average score): fractions are only taught in sixth grade and teachers tend to teach the
          same class each year. Hence, most teachers would have learned about fractions while in school, but may
          not have taught them in years. Two other areas that proved quite difficult are the Venn diagram and graph-


16 This asked teachers to complete sentences with the proper verb forms
17 This activity assesses vocabulary and text comprehension. It consisted of a short story with blanks where certain words were
removed, which the teachers had to complete in a meaningful way.
18 This section of the assessment required teachers to correct a letter written by a pupil, which contained grammatical,

punctuation, and spelling errors.

Pedagogy

          Although this component is not included in the minimum knowledge variable, it does provide some insight
          into teachers’ ability to prepare and deliver lessons and evaluate students. The overall score in pedagogy
          was quite low, with fourth grade teachers averaging 19.6 percent (Table 12). There are no major
          differences across ownership, rural/urban within public, or rural/urban school teachers, suggesting that this
          is a general weakness for teachers. However, other teacher characteristics show generally monotonic
          patterns: teachers with more years of schooling do better, as do those who attended teachers’ training
          college, hold higher teacher training diplomas, and those teaching higher grades.

          Looking at the sub-categories of the pedagogy section, teachers performed poorly on the lesson preparation
          (average score: 28.1 percent) and did worse at pupil comparison (15.8 percent). The evaluation of pupil
          learning showed poorest performance (6.5 percent). Both sections of the evaluation (math/French and
          pedagogy) had the same allotted time, but teachers often failed to complete entire sections of the pedagogy
          evaluation. Panels A to F of Table 26 show that increased academic learning, teacher training
          qualifications, diplomas from teacher training institutions, and grade taught are all positively associated
          with better pedagogical performance.

          Although the teacher evaluation does not directly measure classroom performance, it measures elements
          necessary for the preparation of teaching such as lesson planning, ability to compare learning performance,
          and assessment of learning progress. Taken together, there are clear problems with teacher mastery of
          subject matter and of key aspects of teaching.

Teacher knowledge and use of instruction time

The use of instruction time has gained increasing attention as a key element of learning. The information on
teacher subject and pedagogical knowledge provides an opportunity to examine the situation in Togo in
various ways, including by defining performance quartiles for the different knowledge elements (overall,
French and mathematics, and pedagogy). At the beginning of class, teachers with higher pedagogy scores are
more likely to provide an introduction (p<0.10 for quartiles 2 and 4 relative to quartile 1). They are also twice
as likely to close class with a summary of what was learned (p<0.10 for quartiles 2 and 4 and p<0.05 for
quartile 3). Aside from these results, there are few other areas that prove to be significant across student
engagement and teacher behaviors. Statistically speaking, teacher behavior in Togo is relatively similar across
various dimensions of teacher classroom behavior and engagement of students.

Availability of inputs at the school

          Functioning school infrastructure
          Minimum infrastructure resources is a binary 0-1 capturing availability of: (i) functioning toilets
          operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii) sufficient light to read the blackboard
          from the back of the classroom.

          Functioning toilets: Whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the enumerators as being
          accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender separation).

 Electricity: Functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether the light in the classroom
 works and gives minimum light quality. The enumerator places a printout on the board and checks
 (assisted by a mobile light meter) whether it was possible to read the printout from the back of the
 classroom.

 Availability of teaching resources
         Equipment availability is a binary variable equal to 1 if (i) the randomly selected grade 4 classroom has
         a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils with pens is equal to or above 90 percent,
         and (iii) the share of pupils with notebooks in that classroom is equal to or above 90 percent.

          Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a functioning blackboard in
          the classroom, measured as whether a text written on the blackboard could be read at the front and back
          of the classroom, and whether there was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

 Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with pencils or pens and
 notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the number of pupils in the classroom, one can then
 estimate the share of pupils with pencils or pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.

 Availability of textbooks
 The indicator measures in one randomly selected grade 4 class the number of pupils with the relevant
 textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which randomly selected class is observed), and
 divided by the number of pupils in the classroom.

          Pupil-teacher ratio
          The indicator of teachers’ availability is measured as the number of pupils per teacher in one randomly
          selected grade 4 class at the school based on the Classroom Observation Module.




18
        The indicators Availability of teaching resources, Functioning school infrastructure, Pupil-teacher ratio,
        and Pupils per textbook are all constructed using data collected through visual inspections of a grade four
        classroom and the school premises in each primary school. Table 13 summarizes the findings.

Functioning school infrastructure


          Minimum infrastructure resources is a binary 0-1 capturing availability of: (i) functioning toilets
          operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and (ii) sufficient light to read the blackboard
          from the back of the classroom.

          Functioning toilets: Whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the enumerators as being
          accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender separation).

 Electricity: Functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether the light in the classroom
 works and gives minimum light quality. The enumerator places a printout on the board and checks
 (assisted by a mobile light meter) whether it was possible to read the printout from the back of the
 classroom.

        As Table 14 shows, the inequality of the distribution of toilets is the most marked among the infrastructure
        indicators. Only one school in two has a toilet. Averaging across all schools, one school in four has
        functioning toilets that are accessible to its pupils, with cleanliness and privacy the primary constraints.
        Pupils in private schools are roughly twice as likely (p<0.01) as their public school counterparts to have
        any dimension of toilets (clean, private, and accessible). In general, public schools are similar, although
        there are significantly more private latrines in urban than in rural schools.

Note: Weighted means. Differences are relative to public and rural public, respectively. Superscript (*) denotes
that the difference is significant at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) significance level.


           Equipment availability is a binary variable equal to 1 if (i) the randomly selected grade four
           classroom has a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the share of pupils with pens is equal to or
           above 90 percent, and (iii) the share of pupils with notebooks in that classroom is equal to or above
           90 percent.

           Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a functioning blackboard
           in the classroom, measured as whether a text written on the blackboard could be read at the front
           and back of the classroom, and whether there was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

 Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with pencils or pens and
 notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the number of pupils in the classroom, one can
 then estimate the share of pupils with pencils or pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.

Availability of teaching resources

         SDI measures whether or not all elements of the minimum teaching resources are simultaneously present in
         a given school rather than individual or average presence of the elements. Minimum teaching resources is a
         pressing constraint. A visual presentation of the co-availability of the inputs is in Figure 10.

         Although the general level is particularly low for contrast (32 percent) and insufficient for exercise books
         (68.5 percent), there are strong rural-urban differences in public schools. Rural schools are 28 percentage
         points more likely to have blackboards with suitable contrast than in urban schools (p<0.01). Public school
         students are 30.8 percent more likely to have textbooks than their private school counterparts (p<0.01).
         As a check of the field staff’s evaluations of the blackboard contrast, which is part of the equipment
         indicator, a sufficient level of light (measured with a lux meter) is more than twice as common in rural
         than in urban schools, with a difference (20.2 percentage points; p<0.05) that is larger than the urban
         average.19

         While chalk and boards are generally available, pupils’ learning resources are somewhat less available.
         Most pupils have access to a pen and an exercise book, however all pupils have a pen in only 47 percent of
         classrooms and an exercise book in only 28 percent of classrooms. These are the factors that drive down
         the overall infrastructure indicator. In many classrooms, Togolese schoolchildren use slates and chalk as a
         substitute for paper and a pen, but the average availability of such items is far lower (19 percent of
         schoolchildren) than for exercise books (74 percent). There is no statistical difference in the availability of
         exercise books across ownership status or location. However, the use of slates is 2.3 times more likely in
         the public (22.8 percent of pupils) than in the private sector (p<0.05) and 2.7 times more likely in rural
         than in urban environments (p<0.01).

Availability of textbooks

 The indicator measures in one randomly selected grade 4 class the number of pupils with the relevant
 textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which randomly selected class is observed), and divided
 by the number of pupils in the classroom.



19Values above 300 lux are considered sufficient light. Since the rainy season had started, classrooms with small or poorly placed
windows were often at risk of having poor light if storms were in the offing or if it was raining.

20
         At the end of the observation in French and mathematics classes, textbook availability was directly
         measured by asking pupils to raise the textbook for the subject observed by the field teams. Government’s
         recent efforts to increase textbook availability in Togo are visible when comparing public and private
         schools. In Togo, 68.5 percent of pupils have access to a textbook, although there are some disparities.
         Private school pupils are 70 percent as likely to have a textbook as their public school counterparts
         (p<0.01) and only 55 percent as likely to have a math textbook as their public counterparts (p<0.01). 20 The
         general level of textbook availability is not significantly different across public schools in rural and urban
         areas.

Pupil-teacher ratio

           The indicator of teachers’ availability is measured as the number of pupils per teacher in one randomly
           selected grade four class at the school based on the classroom observation module.


         Fourth grade pupils in Togo have nearly 42 classmates on average, compared to the average of 39
         classmates from the government’s education statistics. Private school pupils have nearly seven fewer
         classmates (p<0.05) than their public school counterparts. While urban classrooms are generally larger
         than rural ones, this hides the extra ten classmates that an urban public school pupil has relative to his rural
         counterpart (p<0.01). This represents an extra 24 percent of pupils for the teacher and may contribute to
         reducing teaching effectiveness.




20The Global Partnership for Education-financed operation in Togo provided 2.9 million textbooks in the years immediately
prior to the survey, which may explain this result.

Assessment of pupil learning

It is instructive to think of the Service Delivery Indicators as measuring key inputs, with a focus
on what teachers do and know, in an education production function. These inputs are actionable
and are collected using objective and observational methods at the school level. The outcome in
such an education production function is pupil learning achievement. While learning outcomes
capture both school-specific inputs (for instance, the quality and effort exerted by the teachers) and
various child-specific factors (for instance, innate ability) and household- specific factors (e.g.
household welfare), and thus provide, at best, reduced form evidence on service provision, it is
still an important measure to identify gaps and to track progress in the sector. Moreover, while the
Service Delivery Indicators measure inputs (learning outcomes are not part of the Indicators), in
the final instance we should be interested in inputs not in and of themselves, but only in as far as
they deliver the outcomes we care about. Therefore, as part of the collection of the Service Delivery
Indicators in Togo, learning outcomes were measured for grade four pupils. This section reports
on the findings.

The objective of the pupil assessment was to assess basic reading, writing, and arithmetic skills.
The test was designed by experts in international pedagogy and based on a review of primary
curriculum materials from 13 African countries.21 The pupil assessment also measured nonverbal
reasoning skills on the basis of Raven’s matrices, a standard IQ measure that is designed to be valid
across different cultures. This measure complements the pupil test scores in French and
mathematics and can be used as a rough measure to control for innate pupil ability when
21For details on the design of the test, see Johnson, Cunningham, and Dowling (2012) “Draft Final Report, Teaching Standards
and Curriculum Review”.

comparing outcomes across different schools. Thus, the pupil assessment consisted of three parts:
mathematics, French, and non-verbal reasoning (NVR).

The test was examined by the CNE for suitability in the Togolese context, judged generally
acceptable, and was administered to fourth-grade pupils.22 The reason for the choice of grade four
pupils is threefold. First, there is no standardized national or international evaluation of this level,
although PASEC evaluates grades two and five. Second, the sample of children in school becomes
more and more self-selective as one goes higher up due to drop-out rates. Finally, there is growing
evidence that cognitive ability is most malleable at younger ages. It is therefore especially
important to get a snapshot of pupil’s learning and the quality of teaching provided at younger
ages.

The test was designed as a one-on-one test with enumerators reading out instructions to pupils in
their mother tongue. This was done so as to build up a differentiated picture of pupils’ cognitive
skills, using oral one-to-one testing allows us to evaluate whether a child can solve a
mathematics problem even when her reading ability is so low that she would not be able to
attempt the problem independently. The French test consisted of a number of different tasks
including knowledge of the alphabet, word recognition, reading out loud, and reading
comprehension. The mathematics test contained tasks such as identifying and sequencing
numbers, addition of one- to three-digit numbers, one- and two-digit subtraction, and single digit
multiplication and divisions. The non-verbal reasoning section consisted of four questions.

Pupils in Togo achieved an average score of 45.1 percent on the assessment (Table 15). This masks
very large variations in the ownership and location dimensions that are almost always significant at
the one percent level. These differences are correlations, but cannot be read as causal statements,
since there are both omitted variables and historical effects for which there is no accounting.
Private school pupils scored 64 percent or fully 26 percentage points more than their public school
counterparts. 23 Likewise, urban public pupils score 30 percent, or 11 percentage points higher
than their rural peers. This pattern is matched by urban schoolchildren, who score 50 percent, or
20 percentage points, more points than their rural peers (Table 15).




22 The curriculum guidelines give the following time table for division: conceptual introduction in February, single-digit division
in March, and continuation in April and May. Division is introduced based upon the multiplication table. Multiplication is
initially taught in January.
23 It stands to reason that pupil absences hinder knowledge acquisition. However, the school-level absence data do not provide a

conclusive answer, whether using the data from the fourth-grade class observation or the data for all grades in the school.
Generally, private school children are less absent than their public school counterparts (Table 29).

The regressions reported in Table 31 (French) and Table 32 (math) and shown graphically in

deviations worse than their male peers in French (math) and the results are at least significant at
the five percent level in all models. Rural students do worse in French (generally significant at
p<0.10), but not in math.

Geographically speaking, the simple models suggest that as the school’s region is increasingly far
from the capital, the negative association with student performance becomes stronger (with the
exception of the Centrale region). Interestingly, after controlling for canton-level poverty, the
regional and rural dummies are no longer significant, perhaps reflecting the results from the last
poverty survey, which showed 29% percent poverty in the capital area, 41% percent in other
towns, 67% percent in the rural south, and 86% percent in the rural north.

Table 6 shows a clear pattern in schooling types: in the poorest quintile eight percent of children
attend public schools and 10 percent attend private (faith-based or NGO) schools; in the richest
quintile 41 percent attend public schools and 57 percent attend private schools. The relative shares
of public and private decline and increase, respectively, in a linear fashion from the lowest to the
highest quintile. Those children of the lowest quintile who attend private school overwhelmingly
attend faith-based schools. As a family’s income rises, children attending private school are
increasingly likely to attend non-faith based schools. This pattern of inequality is clearly
highlighted in the comparative performance of pupils in public and private schools (Figure 9) and
in the pupil performance regressions.

Table 16 presents breakdowns across gender and school location, while Table 17 breaks down the
data across gender and school ownership. The results in language show strong differences. As
shown in Figure 9, private school pupils score 29 percentage points, or 78 percent, better higher
than their public school counterparts (significant at the one percent level). Among public schools,
urban pupils score 12.8 percentage points higher than rural ones (p<0.01). In general, rural pupils
score 22.7 points lower than their urban counterparts (p<0.01). Consistently, the scoring gap rises
across basic skills and peaks at the capacity to read a simple sentence, while remaining nearly as
high for the comprehension elements. At this peak difference, private school pupils perform 4.6
times better than their public counterparts, urban public pupils 2.7 times better than rural public
pupils, and urban pupils 3.3 times better than rural ones. This is borne out in Figure 9. A similar
pattern exists between rural and urban schools (Figure 11).

In mathematics, the differences are less pronounced in percentage terms, but private school pupils
still score 11.1 percentage points higher than public school pupils (p<0.01) and urban public pupils
perform 2.7 percentage points better than rural ones. Generally, private school pupils perform at
least 1.2 and 3.6 times as well as their public school counterparts (generally significant p<0.01).
When comparing across genders and school ownership, the major difference is public/private
rather than boy/girl, as Table 17 shows. Private school girls do better in all areas than their male
classmates. However, private school boys do significantly better than public school boys and girls,
generally at the one percent level. Interestingly, public school girls do not do better than public
school boys.

Gender inequality (Table 16) is both marked across public/private and across locations. However, the larger
differentials are clearly across locations as rural pupils’ score roughly one-third lower than their urban peers.
Overall levels are low and there is no significant gender inequality in these results, although boys generally
score two to three points higher in all sections (except non-verbal reasoning) than girls in a given location.
However, comparing genders across locations, there are strong differences in all areas. The same is true
when using public/private instead of rural/urban (Table 17), except in private schools, where girls generally
do better, if not statistically significantly, than boys.

Language factors may play an important role in overall performance. While gender inequality is not very
marked across-gender and within-location, it is quite different within-gender and across locations. This is
suggested by the difference in the distributions in mathematics and language. Although there are differences
in mathematics, they are far smaller than those in language.




What does this mean for Togo?
It is useful to consider the Togolese context as the Education Sector Plan for 2010-2020 was being
prepared. In 2006, slightly more than three-quarters (78 percent) of all boys completed primary
school as compared to 61 percent of girls. Rural literacy rates were 48 percent female and 74
percent male, and more than one adult in four (28 percent) who had completed primary school did
not remain literate as an adult. The results of the 2010 PASEC evaluation, particularly when
compared to the 2000 evaluation, showed a system that was regressing. The Education Sector Plan
(2010-2020) set as its priority objective to achieve universal quality primary education by 2020. It

27
proposed a balanced development of the education and training system as a whole with emphasis
on improving quality and external efficiency of post-basic education for contributing better to
economic growth.

The commitment to improvement was in a positive context as Togo reached the HIPC Completion
Point in 2010. According to the Togo BOOST data, salaries and investments are the two largest
budgeted items for the ministry.24 However, the execution rates make investments the worst
performer for the ministry. Although the ministry receives above-average allocations, its execution
rates for personnel (average) and investments (28 percent percentile or below) limit its ability to
deliver services. The Creditor Reporting System of the OECD/DAC allows the disaggregation of
funds by sector; in the case of primary education in Togo, it shows limited resources. External
financing, remained quite limited relative to the overall aid envelope (average value USD 3.6 million
in constant dollars per year for 2004-2012, or one percent of the overall aid budget), albeit with
lower volatility (the standard deviation is 50 percent of the median as compared to 148 percent of
the median). It was also limited relative to government’s own budgetary execution for the sector
(even after excluding investments that might be externally-financed). From the financing
perspective, this would have created a context with little room for improvement, limited funds for
inputs (functioning stayed flat in the face of the effect of free primary education), and limited
physical capital improvements.

These budgetary pressures in the face of growing pupil populations and insufficient teachers led to
a strategy of lower-cost teachers, which may have lowered the quality of teachers. (Vargas and De
Laat, 2003) In addition, there is an important element of volunteer teachers, who did not achieve
entry to teachers’ colleges, but attempt to join the civil service ranks through years of teaching
experience. PASEC evaluations conducted in the 2000/1 and 2010/1 school years showed a marked
decline in the level of both second and fifth-grade teachers, suggesting considerable challenges in
the primary education system. (PASEC and MEPSA, 2012).

The results of these and other factors is that educational system in Togo shows clear divisions in
the dimensions of provider ownership (public/private) and location (rural/urban). For inputs,
private is superior to public in both infrastructure availability (31 percent versus 27 percent) and
teaching equipment availability (39 percent vs. 15 percent; significant at the one percent level)
while urban public is better than rural public for infrastructure (20 percent vs. 14 percent), but not
for equipment (nine percent vs 31 percent, significant at the one percent level). Although Togo is
still primarily rural (62.3 percent; 2011 census), there is greater pressure in urban public
classrooms, where the pupil-teacher ratio is 10 pupils higher than in rural classrooms (significant at
the one percent level). Likewise, private school pupils have nearly seven less classmates than their
public peers (significant at the five percent level).

These factors are compounded by generally weak levels of minimum knowledge; less than two
percent of Togolese teachers score 80 percent on an evaluation of their math and French
knowledge at the lower primary level. Private school teachers do three times better than their
public school peers, but still score only three percent. Urban public school teachers are five times
more likely to be proficient by this metric, but also score three percent. The absence rate statistics
are biased upwards affected by the strikes, but the general pattern is that teachers are absent from
school and absent from the classroom in roughly similar proportions across all breakdowns.

In the end, the production function is designed to equip pupils with knowledge and skills to either

24   From http://isdatabank.info/boost_togo/, accessed on 9 September 2014. Transfers were larger than investments in 2009.

28
continue with their education or to join the workforce. The situation depicted in Figure 9, Figure
11, Table 16, and Table 17 show strong inequalities of pupil learning outcomes across school
ownership, school location, and pupil gender. These remain the ultimate challenge for the system.

Comparing Togo with other countries that have done SDI

In the area of teacher effort, Togo has a school absence rate that is similar to most countries, but the
classroom absence rate is lower, despite the teacher strikes. Teaching time is likewise relatively
similar to other countries that have done SDI surveys, even across languages, with the notable
exceptions of Nigeria and Kenya that have roughly three-quarters of an hour of additional teaching
time. However, minimum knowledge among teachers is particularly low in Togo—this is the most
significant negative deviation among all of the indicators, although they are positively correlated
with pupil performance in the evaluated subjects (Table 31 and Table 32).

Compared to the other countries surveyed, Togolese schoolchildren have a higher share of pupils
with textbooks than almost any other country. This was positively correlated with pupil
performance in both mathematics and French in the regression analysis (Figure 8).

Togo lags behind countries like Kenya and Uganda in infrastructure availability and is significantly
worse on teaching equipment availability. The former is largely due to problems with electricity
and latrines, while the latter is imputable primarily to the relatively few schools that have all
required elements simultaneously (even allowing for 90 percent availability of pencils/pens and
exercise books).




29
Annex 1. Sampling
The SDI survey was done jointly with the PASEC survey undertaken by the Ministry of Education’s
CNE and therefore used its sample. What follows is a synthesis of the sampling approach for that
survey; the detailed information is available in the survey report.

The population of interest was defined as the universe of second, fourth, and fifth graders enrolled
in Togolese primary schools that adhered to the national curriculum.25 Only formally-recognized
primary schools are considered, excluding community schools and special-needs schools (e.g.
handicapped). A community schools stratum was considered and abandoned, since government
routinely adds them to the list of official schools and then provides normal support even during the
school year.

The sample frame was drawn from the 2011/2 school statistical yearbook produced by the
statistical department (DPEE) of the Ministry of Education. The yearbook contains a list of all
recognized schools that have a primary cycle. For sampling purposes, the yearbook contains the
universe of schools, the size of each grade in each school, the administrative geography, and the
physical geography (rural/urban). Inferences about the expected population of pupils in grades
two, four, and five pupils in 2012/3 were based upon the 2011/2 information for pupils in grades
one, three, and four and assumptions regarding progression rates.

The sample frame was stratified along ownership and regional lines to maximize within-group
homogeneity. There are eight strata that may be broken down into public and non-public and
further within each group. Public schools are broken down by education regions (six in total) and
non-public schools are broken down into faith-based and non-denominational institutions.

Depending upon the concepts of interest, the sampling procedure is done in two (absence rate,
classroom observation) or three stages (pupils). In all cases, the first stage is the drawing of schools
independently and without replacement from the different strata. The draw was done with
probability proportional to the size of the school, defined as the sum of first, third, and fourth
graders in 2011/2. This is the first weight. The different approaches are explained below.

To calculate the absence rate, a secondary sampling frame of all teachers who work at the school is
prepared (Module 2A). The methodology requires ten teachers, or all those in the school if it has
less than ten teachers. Volunteer teachers are excluded from this count, since they have no
contractual obligation to be present at any given time. If a school has more than ten teachers, a
random selection without replacement is undertaken where each teacher has equal probability of
being selected. This gives the inflation factor, or weight, for the teacher absence rate, defined as the
inverse of the product of the probability of selecting the school and the probability of selecting a
given teacher in the school.

For classroom observation, the secondary sampling frame is the number of fourth-grade
classrooms in use in the school (Module 1). A simple random selection with equal probability of
selection was undertaken if there was more than one relevant classroom in the school, giving a
probability weight for classrooms. This secondary sampling unit was used for the selection of
pupils, the third-stage sampling unit.

From the classroom selected for observation, the procedure is to draw up to ten pupils for the

25   This excludes, among other cases, all schools adhering to other curricula, e.g. “American” or “English” schools.

30
evaluation of their learning outcomes (Module 5). The sample frame for the selection of students
for this was the teacher’s pupil roster updated to remove pupils not present on the day of the first
visit. A random selection without replacement and with equal probability of selection was
undertaken if there were more than ten pupils in the classroom. A risk of pupils not returning after
lunch was identified during pre-testing and mitigated during piloting through two steps. The field
teams were instructed to learn from the teacher which sampled pupils might not return after lunch
in order to minimize the risk of truncating the lower tail of the performance distribution. In the
same sample procedure, the teams also drew three extra pupils that were kept in reserve in case
one of the first ten pupils was not available. A probability weight is calculated for these pupils as the
inverse of the product of the probabilities of selecting the school, the classroom, and the student
and is used to estimate pupil-related indicators.

The size of the sample was determined by the experience of the PASEC surveys and the tradeoff
inherent in the clustered sampling of pupils rather than simple random sampling. PASEC has
estimated the intra-cluster correlation to be 0.4.

Based upon the research done by Ross and Postlethwaite (1988) for the IEA, a sample slightly
larger than the size required to provide the equivalent level precision for the population mean of a
simple random sample of 400 pupils for clusters of 15 pupils was drawn. This sample is also
expected to provide five percent precision for the estimation of proportions. With an (assumed)
intra-cluster correlation of 0.4 and a cluster size of 15 pupils (PASEC), a sample of 176 schools was
required. To leave a margin for error, 200 schools were selected. In the case of Togo, the observed
intra-cluster correlation from the sample is 0.44 for the overall score, 0.42 for the language, 0.37 for
the math, and 0.12 for the non-verbal reasoning. This is both consistent with what is observed in
other SDI samples (range: 0.33 to 0.53) and, more generally, in the field.

Grading of teacher evaluations was done by the Laboratoire des Sciences de l’Education et de la
Formation of the University of Lomé. To ensure inter-rater reliability, 15 percent of the sample was
doubled-graded blindly. These were monitored for quality using both pair-wise correlations and
Cohen’s Kappa as measures of reliability. Initial correlations were above 95 percent on the
language and mathematics sections and the Kappa scores were all significant. Problems identified
by across graders were corrected and used to identify broader potential problems that were also
corrected.

                    observations While inside the classroom distinction is made between teaching and
                    non-teaching activities. Teaching is defined very broadly, including actively
                    interacting with pupils, correcting or grading pupil's work, asking questions, testing,
                    using the black board, or having pupils working on a specific task, drilling, or
                    memorization. Non-teaching activities is defined as work that is not related to
                    teaching, including working on private matters, maintaining discipline in class, or
                    doing nothing and thus leaving pupils not paying attention.
 Minimum knowledge among teachers
 Share of teachers      This indicator measures teacher's knowledge and is based on mathematics and
 with minimum           language tests covering the primary curriculum administered at the school level to
 knowledge              all mathematics or language teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or
                        grade four in the year the survey was conducted. It is calculated as the percentage of
                        teachers who score more than 80 percent on the language and mathematics portion
                        of the test. The indicator is representative of the average teacher in the universe of
                        teachers in a given country rather than the average teacher at the average school.

                         Test score: This indicator measures teacher’s knowledge and it is calculated as the
                         overall score of a mathematics, language, and pedagogy tests covering the primary
                         curriculum administered at the school level to all mathematics and language
                         teachers that taught grade three in the previous year or grade four in the year the
                         survey was conducted.
 Infrastructure availability
 Unweighted average              Minimum infrastructure resources is a binary variable capturing availability of:
 of the proportion of            (i) functioning toilets operationalized as being clean, private, and accessible; and
 schools with the                (ii) sufficient light to read the blackboard from the back of the classroom.
 following available:
 functioning                     Functioning toilets: Whether the toilets were functioning was verified by the
 electricity and                 enumerators as being accessible, clean, and private (enclosed and with gender
 sanitation                      separation).


32
                                Electricity: Functional availability of electricity is assessed by checking whether
                                the light in the classroom works and gives minimum light quality. The
                                enumerator places a printout on the board and checks (assisted by a mobile light
                                meter) whether it was possible to read the printout from the back of the
                                classroom.
 Teaching Equipment availability
 Unweighted average               Equipment availability is a binary variable equal to one if (i) the randomly
 of the proportion of             selected grade four classroom has a functioning blackboard and chalk, (ii) the
 schools with the                 share of pupils with pens is equal to or above 90 percent, and (iii) the share of

 blackboard with                  Functioning blackboard and chalk: The enumerator assesses if there was a
 chalk, pencils, and              functioning blackboard in the classroom, measured as whether a text written on
 notebooks                        the blackboard could be read at the front and back of the classroom, and whether
                                  there was chalk available to write on the blackboard.

                                  Pencils/pens and notebooks: The enumerator counts the number of pupils with
                                  pencils or pens and notebooks, respectively. By dividing each count by the
                                  number of pupils in the classroom, one can then estimate the share of pupils with
                                  pencils or pens and the share of pupils with notebooks.
 Share of pupils with textbooks
 Number of               The indicator measures in one randomly selected grade four class the number of
 mathematics and         pupils with the relevant textbooks (mathematic or language conditional on which
 language books used     randomly selected class is observed), and divided by the number of pupils in the

Note: Superscript (*) denotes that the difference is significant at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) significance level. The
survey-weighted model is estimated in standard errors of the dependent variable. One standard deviation is 1.68 points.
Model standard errors are jackknife estimates and account for clustering at the school level. Poverty headcounts are from
the poverty mapping results in Coulombe and Malé (2012) and are for the canton in which the school is located.
