Executive Summary

The first basic question this report should respond to is whether a program like the National
Local Development Program (PNDL) should exist to begin with. The short and simple answer is:
yes. Romania’s need for infrastructure investments at the local level is large and cannot be
covered solely from EU funds and from local budgets. Moreover, when it joined the EU,
Romania committed to reaching a number of goals (e.g., increasing the number of people with
access to water supply and wastewater systems), which it cannot reach using only EU funds.
More broadly, Romania should not rely exclusively on European grants for public investments –
it should have its own state-budget-funded investment programs. Investment priorities and
needs go beyond what may be defined in the Partnership Agreement with the EU, and
adequate national budget funds should be allocated to cover those needs. However, the way
public funds are managed through state-budget-funded programs has to improve
dramatically along the entire cycle (i.e., from program design through evaluation, prioritization,
implementation, and monitoring and evaluation).

This report’s main aim is to propose a methodology for assessing state-budget-funded
projects based on a rigorous selection model, including clear and effective prioritization
criteria. This report first argues that project prioritization and selection should be optimized
against four dimensions: absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity. Second, it provides a
diagnostic of the National Program for Local Development (PNDL), managed by the Ministry of
Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA), as the most significant source of
state-budget funding for local infrastructure projects. The PNDL’s current design and
implementation leaves room for improvement, as reflected by the lack of strategic direction in
allocating funds and the continued rise in the number of projects that get started without a
feasible timeline for their completion. Further, this report makes recommendations for
improvement of project evaluation and selection procedures for local infrastructure
development projects, with a special focus on prioritization criteria and viable funding sources
for each type of investment. The practical purpose is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness
of proposed investments, maximizing impact in the context of inherently limited available
financial resources. A complementary focus is on opportunities for harmonizing and better
coordinating investments across various sources of funding, in the context of nearly EUR 40
billion available to Romania from the EU for the 2014-2020 programming period.

A primary desideratum that a program like the PNDL should fulfill is to avoid duplication or
crowding-out of alternative sources of funding, especially EU operational programmes. If a
local authority determines that for a needed investment it can more easily access funds through
a state-budget-funded program, there is a risk of leaving large EU grants unused. Obviously, EU
funds come at much lower financial costs than national budget funds. Consequently, whenever
a specific investment can be financed with such funds, it is the EU operational programmes
that should be the first target for potential beneficiaries . It is thus critical that the PNDL be
designed in tandem with EU operational programmes, and it should have a coordinated and
harmonized approach with all investment programs in Romania. In fact, the PNDL should be




                                                                                                     ix
seen as complementary funding mechanism to EU programmes, rather than a
parallel/alternative funding source. Ideally, the PNDL would have as part of its mission
statement the need to function as a complementary instrument, with matching funds for EU-
funded programmes.

A second desideratum for the PNDL is to ensure that the limited funds it has at its disposal go
to the projects with the largest potential impact, chosen based on a rigorous selection model.
Currently, PNDL funds are more or less allocated on an ad-hoc basis, without a clear view of
where the biggest needs are. Moreover, the way the PNDL, and most State Budget funded
programs are designed, does not allow for an efficient use of available funds. Some of the key
policy measures can include the following:

          Multi-annual implementation timeline. Currently, the PNDL is implemented on a year-
           to-year basis, although it is almost impossible to have even small projects go through a
           full project cycle (from pre-application to post-implementation) in a single year. In
           practice, this means that a project may receive funding one year and no funding the
           next. Partly because of this, most applicants have projects that have an average value
           three times smaller than that of similar EU-funded projects (e.g., from the Regional
           Operational Programme or the National Rural Development Programme). Moreover,
           without a clear deadline for implementation (i.e., a date by when committed funding
           would be “lost”), investment programs tend to never be really finished . For example,




                                                                                                                                                    x
       a national program for the rehabilitation of national roads was started in 1994. By 2014
       it managed to achieve only 20% of its initial targets.

      Multi-annual budgeting. The simplest and most important instrument for proper
       prioritization of investments is a clear multi-annual budget. If a public authority knows
       it has only EUR 1 billion to use for needed infrastructure investments, it will also try to
       determine what investments it can finance with this budget and it will have a bigger
       incentive to channel available funds to the highest priority projects. Currently, the PNDL
       has contracted or committed to finance around 3,950 projects, with an estimated total
       value of RON 22 billion (roughly EUR 5 billion). Assuming that the budget it will have at
       its disposal is similar to the allocation received at the beginning of 2014 (i.e., around
       RON 1.5 billion), at least 15 years will be needed to finish all 3,950 projects . Obviously,
       this is neither an efficient, nor a realistic implementation timeline. It is also critical to
       take into consideration inter-annual linkages, as the budget execution in one year
       affects the planning for the next year. For example, the experience of EU-funded
       programs shows that a bulk of the budget is required towards the end of the planning
       period.

      Specify and follow clear priorities. If a clear implementation timeline and budget are
       available, it is also important to determine the priorities that will be addressed within
       the set implementation timeline and the available budget. Currently, the PNDL primarily
       finances roads, water, and wastewater projects. This in itself is a step in the right
       direction because it provides a certain focus that is much needed for an investment
       program. However, there is no clear prioritization between these individual sectors –
       i.e., it is not clear which sector should receive a higher allocation. Rather, applications
       are currently received on an ongoing basis and, if they pass a number of basic
       eligibility/conformity checks, projects are deemed financeable. Consequently, there is
       an overrepresentation of projects that are easier to design and implement by
       beneficiaries – e.g., communal roads, which now represent 45% of the total value of
       PNDL projects. This lack of prioritization by sector basically makes the PNDL a de facto
       local budget supplement rather than a real investment program. Normally, if central
       government funds are made available to sub-national authorities, these funds should
       be directed towards investments that are deemed to be a national priority. For
       example, the need to meet ambitious EU targets in the water and wastewater sector,
       and the much higher needs for water and wastewater investments (EUR 30 billion) as
       opposed to communal roads investments (EUR 4.7 billion), could be a reason for
       allocating more PNDL funds for water and wastewater.

In accordance with the issues mentioned above, a number of recommendations were made
for the PNDL. Some of these include:

   1. Follow the EU programming cycle. The first step to a harmonized and coordinated
      approach with EU-funded programs is to use the same planning timelines. This would
      create incentives for doing planning together before the start of the programming




                                                                                                       xi
       period; it would enable the elaboration of coordinated evaluation and selection criteria;
       it would create the premises for integrated development; and it would ensure efficient
       delivery within a similar timeframe. Consequently, the PNDL should now be designed
       for the 2014-2020 programming period and it should be harmonized and coordinated
       with the EU operational programmes, as well as with other state-budget-funded
       investment programs (e.g., the Environment Fund).

    2. Establish multi-annual budgeting. Starting from the initial allocation for 2014 and
       assuming conservative economic growth and a modest inflation rate, the following
       2014-2020 budget is proposed:

                Proposed PNDL Budget allocation for 2014-2020 (in million RON)
               2014         2015        2016        2017        2018        2019        2020
               1,591        1,671       1,754       1,842       1,934       2,031       2,132

       The total budget for the PNDL 2014-2020 thus comes together to a total of around RON
       13 billion (roughly EUR 2.8 billion) – a sum that is manageable and can help cover a
       number of infrastructure gaps that EU funds will not address during the 2014-2020
       programming period.

    3. Define the priorities of the PNDL 2014-2020. The PNDL currently focuses on four major
       types of investments: county roads; communal roads; water and wastewater; and,
       social infrastructure. The main report discusses several scenarios on how the proposed
       PNDL 2014-2020 budget could be allocated by priorities, and the final proposal is
       included in the table below:

    4. Determine the PNDL 2014-2020 budget allocation for each county. This should be
       done according to actual needs rather than on an ad-hoc basis. County-level
       prioritization criteria for different types of investments (county roads, communal roads,
       water, wastewater, educational infrastructure, health infrastructure, cultural centers,
       and sports facilities) were elaborated to determine where infrastructure investment
       needs were highest. The map below sums up the proposed PNDL 2014-2020 budget
       allocation by counties.




                                                                                                                       xii

5. Develop/refine prioritization criteria for PNDL projects. The PNDL does not have the
   staff, financing, or capacity to put a full evaluation and selection system in place, the
   way EU operational programmes have. It was therefore proposed to create
   prioritization criteria that could easily be applied upfront, allowing the staff of the
   Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, as well as the staff of
   county and local authorities, to determine the priority level for the projects they will
   receive. The priority lists will be done for specific types of investments, as follows:

        a. County Roads: Prioritization will be done at the county road level, with a list of
           priority projects for each county.

        b. Communal Roads: Prioritization will be done at the territorial administrative
           unit (TAU) level, including for each county a list of TAUs with the highest need
           for investments in communal roads.

        c. Water: Prioritization will be done in accordance with the regional water
           masterplans, with a focus on the localities with more than 50 people that are
           not covered or could be covered by an EU-funded program (e.g., Large
           Infrastructure Operational Programme 2014-2020 or the National Rural
           Development Programme 2014-2020).




                                                                                                    xiii
       d. Wastewater: Prioritization will be done in accordance with the regional water
          masterplans, with a focus on the agglomerations with more than 2,000 people
          equivalent that are not covered or could be covered by an EU-funded program
          (e.g., Large Infrastructure Operational Programme 2014-2020 or the National
          Rural Development Programme 2014-2020).

       e. Social Infrastructure: Prioritization will be done at the territorial administrative
          unit (TAU) level, including for each county a list of TAUs with the highest need
          for investments in: educational infrastructure; health infrastructure; cultural
          centers; sports facilities.

6. Monitor and evaluate the impact of PNDL. Project-specific performance indicators
   have been proposed as monitoring tools for the success of the PNDL. Moreover, the
   Territorial Development Index (TDI), developed by the Ministry of Regional
   Development and Public Administration, and the Local Human Development Index
   (LHDI), developed by Prof. Dumitru Sandu, were proposed as measures for determining
   whether funded infrastructure investments actually have a development impact.

                                                                                                 xiv
                            The Local Human Development Index for 2011




   The methodology for calculating the Local Human Development Index was modified for
   enabling a yearly calculation of the index and real-time monitoring.

7. Consider relying on County Councils as “intermediate bodies ” (IBs) for the PNDL. The
   same way Regional Development Agencies help take some of the work burden off the
   Managing Authority (MA) of the Regional Operational Programme, county councils can
   help with the management of the PNDL. The figure below shows how the workload
   could be split. To avoid subjective treatment of PNDL applicants by County Councils – as
   reported for the allocation of budget balancing transfers, in some cases – strict
   oversight from the MRDPA would still be required. As under the the ROP, the MRDPA,
   as the Managing Authority of the program, is fully responsible for how the
   implementation unfolds. That said, if clear and transparent selection and prioritization
   criteria are adopted, the room for potential misallocation of funds at the County
   Council/IB level would remain limited.

Coordination with Component 1 of the RAS Program

The prioritization criteria detailed in this report will be used for the elaboration of a full
Project Selection Model under Component 1 of the RAS (Reimbursable Advisory Services)
Program. One of the key issues the Component 1 will elaborate on, includes the finalization of
priority lists for all sectors covered by PNDL, as follows:
- County roads: a priority list of county roads;
- Communal roads: a priority list of territorial administrative units (TAUs) that would most
     benefit from investment in communal roads;
- Water Infrastructure: a priority list of localities (villages, communes, or towns) that would
     most benefit from investments in water infrastructure;
- Wastewater Infrastructure: a priority list of localities (villages, communes, or towns) that
     would most benefit from investments in wastewater infrastructure;
- Social Infrastructure: a priority list of TAUs that would most benefit from investments in
     social infrastructure.

In the case of an investment program that would be about to start, these priorities lists could
have been used to ensure the quick evaluation and selection of applications. However, in the
case of the PNDL, there already seems to be an overcommtiment of funds. As the table below
shows, for all the sectors, with the exception of Social Infrastructure, there is an over-
commitment compared to the proposed 2014-2020 allocations. Basically, there are more
projects in the pipe-line then (likely) available funding for finalizing these investments. This
means in essence, that the priority lists that will be prepared for Component 1, will be used to
identify the projects with the highest priority score from the existent PNDL project portfolio.
Thus, rather than having individual calls for proposals or yearly applications (different project




                                                                                                                            xvi
application scenarios will be discussed in Component 1 of the RAS Program), the proposed
selection process will first tackle the existing stock of projects, with small openings for social
infrastructure investments (which are currently under-represented in the PNDL project
portfolio).

                Comparison of current distribution of the value of PNDL projects,
                and the proposed allocation for the PNDL 2014-2020 (in mil. Euro)

The following steps are envisaged:
    1. The sector priority lists will provide scores for the main types of projects financed by
         the PNDL;
    2. Preparing a list of projects that should be submitted for EU funding, or that should not
         be funded altogether.
    3. The sector allocations by county will indicate how much funding is available per sector
         for each county.
    4. The projects from the PNDL project portfolio with the highest score will be selected
         within the limit of the county sector allocation.

The benefit of this approach is that it creates an incentive to propose PNDL projects for EU
funding . Since only a limited number of projects from the PNDL project portfolio will be
financeable, the MDRAP could encourage some applicants to submit their projects for EU
funding, to allow more projects from their portfolio to receive funding.

As the programmatic documents and the applicant guides for EU funded projects will be
finalized, it will also become clearer how EU investments and State-budget investments could
be coordinated and harmonized in a more efficient manner. It is critical to see the PNDL as a
complementary funding mechanism to EU programmes, not as a parallel/alternative source of
funding.

Introduction

1.       In the context of Romania’s push toward sustainable and inclusive development,
the Government has asked the World Bank to support the harmonization of public
investments financed by the European Union and the state budget. This work is a follow-
up to the World Bank’s Regional Development Program in Romania (November 2012 -
March 2014) and aims to encourage synergies across public investments in local
infrastructure, regardless of the funding source, and deliver stronger impact overall. Four
components were agreed with the Ministry of Regional Development and Public
Administration (MRDPA) under the overall project focused on harmonizing local
infrastructure projects:
      Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
       state-funded investments in infrastructure;
      Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
       projects in MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of
       potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020 programming period;
      Component 3 – Assistance with improving the use of efficient designs and
       technologies in investments overseen by the MRDPA;
      Component 4 – Assistance with the design of a Housing and Infrastructure
       Development Strategy.

2.      The second aforementioned component (in italics ) focuses on the existing
portfolio of investment projects financed by the MRDPA and further includes two sets of
interrelated deliverables:
            a. Proposal of enhanced prioritization criteria for local infrastructure
               development projects, including clear performance and monitoring
               indicators, assessment of project implementation timelines, and guidelines
               on identifying viable financing sources per type of project ;
            b. Assessment of a sample of projects, at the level of technical-economic
               documentation (i.e., feasibility studies and/or detailed technical designs),
               to identify potential opportunities to leverage EU instruments and/or funds
               from the state budget.
The current final report covers the former sub-component (in italics), making a set of
specific proposals for policy measures on how to prioritize local infrastructure development
projects in the three main sectors currently covered by MRDPA investments: roads, water
and wastewater, and social infrastructure. While prioritization criteria are at the core of
this work, it is important to recognize that they are only one element of a larger chain of
actions required for the successful completion of local infrastructure projects – from
concept design and project preparation to application, selection and prioritization,
implementation, and post-implementation. As such, this report does not treat prioritization



                                                                                               1
in isolation from all other components, but rather as part of the larger whole. The next sub-
section on the report’s objective and scope details this approach further.

3.       This work is correlated with findings and recommendations from the broader
current engagement with the MRDPA. In particular, the analysis of the strategic
correlation of strategies, plans, and investment programs at different levels (component #1
described above) helps define a filter for selecting local interventions that contribute to
higher-level plans and objectives. Moreover, recommendations from the work related to
innovative and efficient designs and technologies (component #3 described above) will
assist in the engagement of local authorities to improve technical proposals to ensure the
adoption of optimal solutions. The team also expects to refine the set of prioritization
criteria proposed in this report (under component 2) with the occasion of completing the
intermediary and final reports on the strategy of prioritization of state-budget-funded
projects (due on March 27 and August 27, 2015, respectively), which will include all
available data and additional insights from multiple rounds of field interviews.

4.    This report includes observations and recommendations based on research
conducted from June through November 2014. The main sources of data and key
documents reviewed include the following:
       2013-2016 Governing Program, which defines the current cabinet’s priorities
        across and within key development sectors in Romania.
       Legal framework for the PNDL’s implementation , including the text of the
        ordinance establishing the program, implementation norms, eligibility and
        selection criteria, and application templates. Other legislative provisions related to
        the implementation of EU and state-funded investment programs have been
        considered.
       Programmatic documents and applicant guides corresponding to EU-funded
        instruments for 2007-2013 (e.g., the Regional Operational Programme - ROP, the
        Environment Operational Programme, National Rural Development Programme
        etc.) and for 2014-2020 (only in draft form as of November 1, 2014).
       County-level master plans for water and wastewater , with a particular focus on
        proposed selection and prioritization criteria.
       Regional Development Plans prepared for 2007-2013 (in final form) and for 2014-
        2020 (in draft form) for each of Romania’s eight development regions.
       Interviews with key stakeholders at the local, regional, and national level. For the
        current report, the team has interviewed key stakeholders in the MRDPA’s
        Directorate General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI), at both
        managerial and technical levels. Between September 8 and 26, the team also
        successfully completed one round of field interviews at the local level, covering
        three county councils (Cluj, Bistrița Năsăud, and Sălaj) and 6 communes in the
        three aforementioned counties. Over the next phases of the engagement, the team
        has planned multiple rounds of field interviews across the entire country. To this




                                                                                                 2
        end, it has provided the MRDPA a full list of potential locations and is waiting for
        the Ministry’s confirmation and support in finalizing the schedule (as of November
        1, 2014). As more field data become available, recommendations included in this
        report will be updated through the future deliverables under component #1
        described in the beginning of this introductory chapter.
       Feasibility studies corresponding to projects in the PNDL’s pipeline. Preliminary
        observations are based on the results of a technical screening process of feasibility
        studies. It was carried out in July 2014 by a Bank team of five evaluators. The team
        focused on a sample of 159 feasibility studies for roads, water supply, wastewater
        systems, and social infrastructure, selected based on a pre-agreed methodology. 1
       Database of projects to be financed under the 2014 PNDL , with a budget of close to
        RON 1 billion and spanning three types of basic infrastructure investments across
        the country: roads, water, and waste water.
       Database of projects in the broader MRDPA portfolio (i.e., including interventions
        not covered by the 2014 PNDL). A sample of technical documentations to be
        analyzed as part of this work was selected for the other report prepared under this
        component, which builds on the current assessment of procedures and criteria and
        undertakes a deep dive into the MRDPA project portfolio.
       Database of EU-funded infrastructure programs managed by the MRDPA, i.e., the
        ROP 2007-2013.
       Draft database of public infrastructure projects managed by other Ministries,
        including the Ministry of Environment through OP Environment 2007-2013 and the
        Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) through the National Rural
        Development Program (PNDR). This was provided in draft form by the MRDPA.
       Data provided by the National Institute of Statistics.
       Data provided by a variety of national and sub-national stakeholders.
       Previous World Bank analyses. Specifically, this work draws on applicable insights
        that emerged from the World Bank’s 2011 Func tional Review of the Ministry of
        Regional Development and Tourism – now the MRDPA – as well as from a series of
        reports produced under the 2012-2013 World Bank Regional Development
        Program, including “Competitive Cities: Reshaping the Economic Geography of
        Romania,” “Identification of Project Selection Models for the ROP 2014 -2020,” and
        “ROP 2.0.: MA-IB Collaboration and Support for Applicants and Beneficiaries of the
        ROP.”

Objective and Scope
5.       This report aims to provide a methodology for assessing state-budget-funded
projects – submitted for financing to the MRDPA – based on a set of clear and effective
prioritization criteria. As noted earlier, the scope is broader than a simple proposal of new
criteria, which cannot be treated in isolation from the other steps of an investment. As
such, this work aims to improve the entire cycle involved in the MRDPA’s project portfolio
assessment and strengthen the preparation and prioritization of investments for the 2014-
2020 programming period. To this end, this final report includes: (i) a theoretical
framework for project prioritization and selection, optimized against four dimensions
(absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity); (ii) a diagnostic of the National Program for
Local Development (PNDL), managed by the MRDPA, as the most significant source of
state-budget funding for local infrastructure projects; (iii) an overview of how EU-financed
infrastructure programs select and prioritize projects, including monitoring and
performance indicators; and (iv) recommendations for improvement of project evaluation
and selection procedures for local infrastructure development projects, with a special focus
on prioritization criteria and viable funding sources for each type of investment. The
purpose is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed investments,
maximizing impact in the context of inherently limited available financial resources. As
reflected throughout the broader engagement (i.e., the four activities mentioned above), a
key focus is on opportunities for harmonizing and better coordinating investments across
various sources of funding, in the context of nearly EUR 40 billion available to Romania
from the EU for the 2014-2020 programming period.

6.       One of the key issues that this technical assistance tries to address is how to
ensure that the existing technical documentation will eventually lead to completed,
impactful projects. Based on lessons of previous programs, not all project proposals that
have been developed by local authorities can/should actually be pursued. As such, a first
step in the evaluation of existing documentation will require the triage of the projects that
are financeable and those that are not. A second step should involve a determination of
those projects that would be eligible for EU funding and should be directed to the
respective decision making stream. As a matter of principle, whenever possible, EU funding
should be sought, while state budget funds should be used only for activities that are not
eligible for EU funding or for investments that are expected to complement or expand EU
investments in areas that suffer from a funding gap.

7.      Together with the report assessing the MRDPA portfolio of projects, this analysis
also provides guidance on how to improve projects’ technical documentations in order to
ensure a higher quality of applications for EU funds and for the PNDL. For example, in the
current setting financing may be sought for a wastewater treatment plan that will service
only one small locality, where it should ideally serve a cluster of localities. In the same vein,
funding may be sought for the development of a communal road before the development
of water or wastewater infrastructure along that road, which may result in the need to
damage the road shortly after modernization in order to undertake water sector




                                                                                                    4
investments. The proposals in this report try to facilitate as much as possible the
integrated, coherent use of all sources of funding for local governments.

8.      Another important area of focus for the current repo rt is to determine
appropriate sources of funding for various project proposals, with the hope of turning
projects in the MRDPA pipeline into EU-funded investments for 2014-2020. At this point
in time, the PNDL management and staff, the county councils, and the local authorities
applying for funding do not have clear institutional mechanisms to determine whether
existing technical documentation is appropriate for seeking EU funding going forward. It
may be desirable, but practically impossible to already elaborate formal evaluation criteria
for PNDL that take into account whether proposed projects could receive funding from an
EU-funded program for the 2014-2020 programming period. This approach may be
developed only in the next stages of this assistance project, when final documentation
pertaining to the upcoming set of structural instruments (e.g., programmatic documents,
applicant guides, etc.) should become available upon formal approval by the EC.

9.      Even so, it is ultimate responsibility of the Intermediate Bodies and the Managing
Authorities for the respective Operational Programmes to determine whether a project is
actually eligible or not. Formally, the MRDPA can only recommend that a specific applicant
try to apply for EU funds rather than for PNDL if it determines that this course of action
may be successful (i.e., if it would fit the key basic criteria for various EU funding sources
available). This should limit the risk of situations when a solid application assessed by PNDL
team as eligible for EU funding – and hence denied support via PNDL – is eventually not
accepted by the Managing Authority of the respective OP.

10.      There is also a need to identify projects that may likely receive EU financing or
PNDL support, provided that beneficiaries of funding (i.e., local authorities) make some
adjustments in the documentation. For some projects, the technical documentation may
be incomplete or it may include outdated or irrelevant data/information. In this case, the
applicant should be notified and further informed about how the technical documentation
should be improved to make it eligible for financing. Through a similar notification, the
PNDL team may inform an applicant if their project is eligible (in the opinion of the PNDL
team) for funding from any of the EU Operational Programmes. The notification should also
underline that applicants should consult directly with the Intermediate Bodies and the
Managing Authority of these operational programmes and, if possible, provide references
to the respective documents or contact details to such institutions in charge of EU funding.
For the documentation submitted and eligible for PNDL funding only, it will be the PNDL
team’s responsibility to provide clear feedback and instructions for improvement to limit
the risk of requiring multiple rounds of clarifications or modifications.

11.      With respect to its sectoral focus, this report covers infrastructure investments
overseen by the MRDPA, primarily in: communal/county roads; water; wastewater; and
social infrastructure. The scope is primarily centered on PNDL projects approved for 2014 –
particularly with respect to the diagnostic of the status quo – given data made available
through this stage of the engagement. The analysis focuses on projects that are still in the



                                                                                                 5
preparation/planning phase, leaving aside those investments for which implementation on
the ground has already begun, which involves legal commitments to winning bidders and a
host of other requirements. As such, this work serves mainly as a tool for identifying,
selecting, and prioritizing infrastructure investments in the MRDPA portfolio for 2014 and
beyond.

Audiences
12.     The primary audience of the current report includes the staff of the Directorate
General for Regional Development and Infrastructure (DG RDI) within the Ministry of
Regional Development and Public Administration, which manages the PNDL. The report
provides these key stakeholders with a first proposal of a methodology for screening,
evaluating, selecting, and prioritizing projects submitted for t he DG RDI’s consideration.

13.    Other stakeholders who may benefit from this assessment include:
           At the national level: (a) ministries and agencies in charge of planning and
               implementing state-budget-funded interventions and (b) Managing
               Authorities and Intermediate Bodies of EU-funded operational programs,
               which may draw on recommendations for streamlining the evaluation of
               projects across EU and state-funded programs;
               At the regional level: Regional Development Agencies, which are in charge
                of regional-level planning and coordination (through the Regional
                Development Plans developed for each programming period), and have
                also previously contracted technical evaluators for assessing projects
                submitted under the Regional Operational Programme;
               At the county and local level: local communities and, more specifically,
                public authorities that prepare projects and submit applications to various
                EU and state-funded programs (including technical staff within local
                governments responsible for working with designers and other
                consultants).
               Finally, for its part, the European Commission (EC) may leverage this
                study’s findings and replicate the recommendations in other Member
                States. Certainly, the issue of effective coordination and harmonization of
                evaluation procedures across EU and state-funded programs is relevant
                beyond the Romanian context.

Report Structure
14.     The observations and conclusions of this final report are grouped into the
following chapters:
      Chapter I: Context
            o This chapter provides a summary of infrastructure development needs in
               Romania and the challenges ahead for public authorities in Romania.




                                                                                              6
        o In addition, the chapter provides an overview of a few key ingredients
          required for an effective project selection model: absorption, impact,
          legitimacy, and capacity.
        o Finally, the chapter offers discusses the need to customize project selection
          models and prioritization criteria based on project size and sector.

   Chapter II: The National Program for Local Development (PNDL)
       o This chapter first describes the history, objectives, and legal framework of
           the PNDL, providing background information on the program.
       o Further, this chapter covers the main stages that a PNDL project goes
           through, from the pre-application phase through application,
           implementation, and post-implementation.
       o The final section summarizes the PNDL’s current framework and presents
           potential improvements for streamlining the PNDL’s management and
           operationalization, taking into account current constraints, particularly
           with respect to institutional capacity.

   Chapter III: Good Practices of Project Selection for EU-Funded Programs
       o The chapter describes evaluation and selection procedures and criteria
           deployed for EU funds, highlighting good practices that may be replicated
           under state-budget-funded programs like the PNDL.
       o Select examples reviewed include: the Regional Operational Programme
           (ROP) – relevant axes (i.e., for roads and social infrastructure); OP
           Environment and county-level Master Plans (for water and wastewater);
           the National Rural Development Programme (for basic rural
           infrastructure); and the World Bank’s Romanian Social Development Fund
           (RSDF).

   Chapter IV: Assessment and Policy Measures for the Overall PNDL Project Selection
    Model
       o The chapter makes recommendations regarding ways to improve specific
           steps in the PNDL application process, from the preparation of
           documentation through the submission of the application, its evaluation/
           selection/prioritization, contracting, etc. In particular, a specific sub-section
           is dedicated to ways for improving feasibility studies submitted by
           applicants. This is based on a screening of a sample of feasibility studies
           considered for financing under the 2014 PNDL.
       o The chapter also includes a proposal for triage of projects proposed by sub-
           national authorities, for which technical documentation (i.e., feasibility
           studies/DALIs and/or detailed technical designs) has been already
           developed. The focus is on roads, water, and wastewater projects.
           Prioritization criteria will also be elaborated for social infrastructure
           projects, in a subsequent deliverable, as more inputs will be generated for

            comprehensive strategy in the housing sector”).

   Chapter V: Proposed Prioritization Criteria for Enhanced Selection of PNDL Projects
       o This chapter makes very specific proposals for how to allocate funds across
           counties and how to prioritize specific projects within counties/regions
           (i.e., at the locality level).
       o The sectors covered include: county and communal roads; water and
           wastewater; and social infrastructure (health, education, culture, and
           sports).

   Chapter VI: Performance Monitoring System for the PNDL
       o This final chapter includes recommendations on proper monitoring and
           evaluation (M&E) systems for the PNDL.
       o Specific focus is on clear performance indicators for each type of
           investment, as well as general impact indicators at the territorial
           administrative unit level.

Chapter I: Context
Romania’s Local Infrastructure: Needs, Priorities, and Funding
15.     Nearly twenty-five years after its democratic revolution, Romania continues to
face important development challenges – from transport to education, health,
environment, labor, agriculture, public administration , etc. This is not surprising for a
country that went through a long and complex transition from communism and a centrally
planned economy. For one, there is still no highway connection from Constanța, Romania’s
eastern port on the Black Sea, to the Western border, which about 70% of exports cross. 2
Public utilities infrastructure is still deficient, as some areas of the country, particularly in
the East and South, have fewer than half of the housing units connected to running water
and sewage. Now Romania also faces the risk of EU infringement procedures and potential
financial penalties, particularly in the water and sanitation sector, where it needs to hit
clear targets and allocate significant funds over the coming years. The examples of
persistent needs abound but, against this backdrop, recent progress particularly in large
urban centers – with Bucharest surpassing cities like Madrid, Berlin, Rome, Lisbon, and
Athens in terms of GDP per capita (PPP)3 – suggests that Romania has a high growth
potential, provided that people have access to the right opportunities.

16.       As argued in th e World Bank’s 2013 Competitive Cities report, the key to
unlocking Romania’s growth potential involves a range of interventions, targeted to the
specific needs of leading and lagging areas.4 The first priority is improved connectivity and
accessibility for people to take advantage of opportunities in Romania and abroad. Second,
the government should nurture functioning institutions to ensure basic living standards for
its citizens – essentially, the same start in life for all (i.e., drinking water, sewage, electricity,
heating, good schooling, effective land and housing markets, affordable healthcare, etc.).
Last but not least, targeted efforts for marginalized communities are required to address
the specific factors that limit their mobility. By the same token, there are major negative
consequences of the current situation, marked by slow progress and persistent needs:
every day, people across Romania miss out on critical opportunities for personal and
professional growth due to the lack of proper access to connective infrastructure and basic
services. This further undermines the country’s potential to boost individual productivity
and achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, slowing down progress toward
achieving convergence with the EU. While knowing the right priorities is vital, a sine-qua-
non condition for Romania’s successful development is having access to sufficient financial
resources for supporting critical investments.

17.     Over the years, key stakeholders have channeled human and financial resources
toward addressing key gaps in local infrastructure development to enable higher
economic productivity and growth. At the local level, after 1990, county and
city/town/commune-level authorities have been granted increasingly more authority over
the provision of basic infrastructure services and the ownership of related assets. While
more aware of local needs than the central government, few of these players (i.e., only
some of the largest cities) have been able to generate sufficient own resources, enter PPP
arrangements, attract private investment, or convince financial institutions to lend them
the funds to fully finance the heavy costs involved in the upgrade, rehabilitation, and/or
expansion of roads, water supply, and/or wastewater systems. In this context, the
development of local infrastructure has depended on two main types of financing: internal
(mainly the central government) and external (international partners, including the EU, the
World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, etc.).

18.      Internally, since the 1990s, the central government has launched numerous
legislative acts and investment programs with 100% state-budget financing. These
include: Government Decision (GD) 577/1997 for local and county roads, water supply, and
wastewater systems; GD 530/2010 for “the rehabilitation and upgr ade of 10,000




                                                                                                                                 11
kilometers of County and Local Roads”; Government Ordinance (GO) 7/2006 for sport
infrastructure in rural areas, etc. Not all such programs appear to have been properly
designed and implemented, as they have lacked clear strategic prioritization and
coordination, adequate funding, and effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
mechanisms. The MRDPA – previously, the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism
(MRDT) – has spearheaded many such initiatives, attempting to improve the coordination
of various interventions through common strategic planning and implementation. Beyond
good intentions, however, Romania has not been able to significantly expand infrastructure
development programs from its own sources because of limited availability of investment
budgets, constrained opportunities to contract loans, and strict targets with respect to
maintaining low annual deficits.

19.      In this context, funds from external partners have played a critical role and will
continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The largest source of financing comes from
the European Union (EU), which allocated a further EUR 40 billion for the 2014-2020
programming period. A substantial part dedicated to local infrastructure development
(particularly through the Regional Operational Programme, Large Infrastructure
Operational Programme, and the National Program for Rural Development – PNDR). But
past experience suggest that Romania faces significant constraints that have limited its
capacity to absorb such funds, for a variety of reasons: incomplete alignment with EU
legislation and best practices, particularly in the area of public procurement; lack of
resources for co-financing and running costs of EU-funded projects; public authorities’
weak capacity to prepare, implement, monitor, and evaluate complex interventions; heavy
bureaucracy and excessive audits, etc. 5 Even it was able to fully absorb substantial EU
structural funds and take advantage of other forms of international assistance, Romania
would still face critical infrastructure needs far exceeding available funding.

20.       Moreover, EU funds cannot possibly address Romania’s entire need for basic
infrastructure. For example, in 2012, 34,000 km of county and communal roads were made
of dirt or gravel and required modernization, at a cost of around EUR 8.1 billion. An
additional 21,000 km of county and communal roads only had only surface treatment and
may require rehabilitation. As a point of comparison, only EUR 0.87 billion were allocated
for the modernization/rehabilitation /extension of county and urban roads under the
Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013. Furthermore, by 2015 and 2018, around EUR
19 billion need to be invested in the water and wastewater infrastructure respectively, just
to fulfill EU requirements – i.e., increase the share of Romanians with access to such
infrastructure to 70% (from 52% in 2004). However, only around EUR 3.3 billion were
allocated for such investments under the SOP Environment 2007-2013.

                                                                                                    12
The Imperative of Harmonized Investments
21.     In this context, Romania has the opportunity to integrate, harmonize, and
mutually reinforce investments in local infrastructure, across all sources of funding –
particularly EU programs and state-budget-funded efforts led by the MRDPA. With
careful planning, programs financed by the central government can complement EU
assistance, as in the case of communities that may not eligible for EU financing for
particular projects. Moreover, an effective coordination across EU and state-funded
investments can leverage substantial synergies and help Romania close the infrastructure
gap faster.

22.     By contrast, a multitude of uncoordinated funding sources can lead to
duplication, inefficiencies, and lower appetite for EU funds. Some of these negative side-
effects became obvious after the launch of the now-closed National Program for
Infrastructure Development (PNDI), a past initiative of the former Ministry of Regional
Development and Tourism. The 2011 World Bank Functional Review of Romania’s regional
development sector recommended that programs funded 100% from the state budget
“[should] avoid duplication with EU-supported [interventions].” 6

23.       The PNDI was a EUR 4 billion program fully funded by the GOR, which could have
effectively crowded out EU-funded structural instruments like the ROP, OP Environment,
and the National Rural Development Programme (PNDR). For one, the PNDI targeted
similar types of infrastructure investments (e.g., county roads, water and sewage networks,
health and education infrastructure etc.). Second, it lacked rigorous and transparent
selection processes, and staff in the then MRDT became quickly overwhelmed with
requests and technical documentations (e.g., prefeasibility and feasibility studies, detailed
technical designs, etc.) submitted by public beneficiaries from across the country. There
was no system for the independent assessment of projects (unlike the requirement to have
external evaluators of EU-funded projects) and a programming document defining
eligibility and selection criteria was completely lacking (unlike the extensive programming
documents corresponding to EU-funds, which are prepared by different OPs and approved
by the European Commission).

24.     In the absence of clear selection criteria and prioritization measures, the PNDI
project portfolio expanded quickly. Two key insights are worth highlighting: (a) the
demand for infrastructure investments far exceeds available funds; and (b) beneficiaries
much preferred to apply for funds under the PNDI, avoiding the lengthier procedures
involved in accessing EU funds. Anecdotal evidence suggests that not only applications
were easier under the PNDI, but also the implementation phase came with less rigorous
monitoring and controls. The direct consequence was that state-budget funds – in the case
of PNDI, in the form of long-term liabilities of the central government to commercial banks

and developers – crowded out EU grants, which were cheaper by all measures, yet harder
to access. In the meantime, the change in government in 2012 brought the PNDI to an end,
but this is just one example of how state-budget investment programs have typically
operated in Romania.

25.      An additional key shortcoming of previous programs financed from different
sources is that they have lacked strategic correlation. At the level of local authorities,
development strategies and plans are often geared toward specific funding opportunities,
without considering actual needs on the ground in an integrated manner (e.g., most cities
produced integrated urban development plans as a requirement for accessing ROP funds,
failing to address broader development challenges). At the central level, as the World Bank
2010 and 2011 Functional Reviews showed, communication and coordination across
different ministries is deficient, leading to disjointed interventions (e.g., paving the road,
then digging to upgrade the water and sewage networks) and failing to leverage potential
synergies (e.g., financing back-to-back roads or “linking” two EU -funded water projects
with a state-budget-funded extension).

The Task at Hand: Current Challenges and Opportunities
26.       In April 2013, the MRDPA launched the National Program for Local Development
(PNDL) through Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) 28/2013. This was meant to
bring multiple disparate investment efforts under the same program, precisely to ensure
improved planning coordination. The PNDL focuses primarily on roads, water, and sewage
projects, but other types of investments (e.g., educational infrastructure, healthcare
facilities, cultural sites, sports centers, etc.) can also be eligible to receive financing. The
next chapter provides an in-depth description of PNDL’s history, objectives, sub-programs
and intervention areas, and implementation norms.

27.      At a practical level, the MRDPA and local/county authorities now have thousands
of projects in their portfolio, at the stage of feasibility study or detailed technical design,
or even in various phases of implementation. Most of these investments are stopped or
advancing very slowly. The main reason is lack of funding through state-funded programs.
As a solution, the government would like to incentivize local governments to reintegrate
some of these projects into the project cycles of EU-funded activities. Through proper
evaluation, selection, and prioritization, these projects can ensure a solid pipeline for the
2014-2020 programming period and, upon completion, generate substantial impact at the
local, regional, and national level. There are therefore two main challenges facing the
MRDPA and particularly the Directorate General for Regional Development and
Infrastructure (DG RDI), which is directly in charge of implementing the PNDL and other
state-budget-funded programs:
       Optimal prioritization, sequencing and selection of projects to be financed, both
        from the portfolio of existing applications and from new ones submitted for
        consideration; and




                                                                                                   14
         Correlation of public investments overseen by DG RDI with EU and other state-
          funded interventions for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programming periods.

28.     While the history and evolving causes for the current challenges may be complex,
the overall message is simple: Romania continues to face great development needs and
limited financial resources. This makes value for money a principle of paramount
importance for all its public investments. Put differently, the GOR should pursue an agenda
focused on maximizing impact for the given funding available for investment programs,
whether from the EU or from the state budget.

29.      In this endeavor, it is critical to ensure that investment funding is allocated and
prioritized based on clear, fair, and effective criteria that take into account the specific
characteristics and needs of leading and lagging areas. Such principles and procedures are
generally upheld in the disbursement of EU funds, including through the Regional
Operational Programme (ROP) managed by the MRDPA. 7 There is an opportunity to adopt
good practices from EU structural instruments to state-budget programs like the PNDL,
which would ensure an improved correlation and coordination of interventions across
sources of funding, delivering stronger synergies and development impact.

Optimal Project Selection: Disbursement, Impact, Legitimacy, and Capacity
30.     First and foremost, what are the main objectives and requirements of an o ptimal
project selection model? At a basic level, a model for selecting investments should
maximize value for money (i.e., most impact for least cost). In reality, however, the picture
is more complex. The framework presented below is based on the World Ba nk’s 2014
report on “Identification of Project Selection Models for the Regional Operational
Programme 2014-2020.” Still, the same principles apply to any investment program,
regardless of the source of financing (state budget or EU funds).
31.     An optimal project selection model has four core objectives (disbursement,
impact, legitimacy , and feasibility ) and six corresponding requirements (efficiency,
effectiveness, clarity, fairness, transparency, and capacity) . The following sections assess
each of them, though it is important to recognize that they are all ultimately interrelated.
An investment program may also have to make deliberate trade-offs between them: for
example, it could be highly efficient and spend the funds rapidly, but focus solely on low-
impact interventions; or it may be able to select only the proposals with the highest
expected impact through a complex mechanism, but may lack transparency (and, hence,
legitimacy) or may exceed the management system’s capacity with numerous procedures,
leading to delays and even blockages. In short, all four goals are important, though not all
may be achievable at the same time.

                Figure 4. Key objectives and requirements of a sound project selection model




Disbursement (efficiency)
32.     First, an optimal selection model needs to ensure that the budget allocated for a
particular program is spent efficiently – i.e., “disbursed ” – in a given time horizon. For EU-
funded interventions in Romania, this is usually 9-10 years. 8 In the case of the PNDL or of
many state funded activities, the money is allocated annually, per Romania’s current
practice of single-year budgets. Disbursement is a concern particularly in the case of highly
cumbersome procedures in the pre-application/application phases, which would therefore
slow down the entire process and leave insufficient time for the project’s implementation
and to receive reimbursements of eligible expenses.

Impact (effectiveness)
33.     Equally important, given the inherently limited nature of the fundin g available,
an optimal selection model should distinguish between more and less impactful
interventions, prioritizing the former for higher effectiveness. This is easier said than
done, as there is no single definition of a project’s impact . Several types are worth
considering: financial/economic impact (as measured by a cost-benefit analysis, net
present value or internal rate of return calculations, etc.); social impact (i.e., impact on

    The exact timeline depends on which rule applies (i.e., n+2 or n+3, where n is equal to 7).




                                                                                                  16
poor and/or marginalized communities); and environmental impact (e.g., changes in
greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in non-recyclable waste, etc.). Additionally, a project
may generate direct impact (the immediate result of completing the intervention, e.g.,
faster travel times on a newly modernized road); indirect impact (a positive or negative
effect on a related sector, such as the development of a residential neighborhood close to
a rehabilitated road); and induced impact a positive or negative effect on a non-related
sector (e.g., a new road sparks economic activity in a region, generating more jobs and
higher disposable income for residents, who consume more and thus further contribute to
growing the local economy). (Later in the report we discuss the opportunity of using
composite indexes for measuring impact – in particular, the Territorial Development Index
and the Local Human Development Index.)

Legitimacy (clarity, fairness, and transparency)
34.      In addition to absorption and impact, an optimal project selection model should
be legitimate for all stakeholders involved – particularly for applicants and beneficiaries –
through clear, fair, and transparent rules and procedures. Clear application requirements
and selection/prioritization criteria help set the right expectations and reduce room for
interpretation. Fairness depends on applying the same standards to similar proposals and
only deciding based on the formal criteria that are noted in the funding facility’s
regulations. Along the same lines, the full application, evaluation, and selection mechanism
should be described in transparent terms. This will boost applicants’ confidence in the
proceedings and also strengthen the accountability of technical evaluators and other
stakeholders who may intervene during the project cycle.

Capacity (feasibility)
35.     Finally, a project selection model may optimize for absorption, impact, and
legitimacy, but it will be of little practical use if it does not also account for feasibility
given the system’s capacity constraints. In general, the more complex a framework, the
more resources (staff numbers, staff knowledge, time, and money) it requires to run
smoothly and flawlessly. Of course, there are hard constraints (e.g., a fixed budget
dedicated to the program’s management each year) and softer ones (e.g., internal staff
may be limited, but additional external evaluators may be hired if there are sufficient
financial resources available).



Customized Selection Models: Project Size and Sector
36.     In addition to the four core dimensions described above, project selection models
should take into account the size and sector or proposed interventions. Put differently,
the exact formulas for optimizing for absorption, impact, legitimacy, and capacity differ
across small and large investments, as do the prioritization criteria for selecting roa ds vs.
water/wastewater systems vs. schools vs. hospitals, etc. There is no ideal one-type-fits-all
selection model that can be applied without proper consideration of project size and
sector.




                                                                                                 17
Project size
37.      First of all, why does project size matter for choosing one selection model over
another? For one, project size can be a good proxy for potential impact – larger projects
will typically generate a higher impact than small-scale investments, though there are
certainly exceptions to this rule. This suggests that for more costly proposed projects, the
applicable evaluation system should be more sophisticated and thorough. In the World
Bank’s previous report on the Regional Operational Programme’s Project Selection Models,
the recommendation is to: (i) “pre -select” large projects based on local/regional/ national
strategies and more complex impact assessment methods (including, where possible, cost-
benefit analyses); (ii) select medium-size projects competitively, based on a comparative
set of evaluation criteria applied to similar types of investments; and (iii) award small
projects, which tend to have limited impact, based on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) rule. 9

38.      In recognition of the principles described above, the Government Emergency
Ordinance (GEO) 88/2013 from September 20, 2013 established a new set of
prioritization criteria for large projects only, based on the following classification:
    (a) large – the total project cost is higher than RON 100 million;
    (b) medium – the total project cost is between RON 30 and RON 100 million;
    (c) small – the total project cost is below RON 30 million.

39.    The following stages must be followed in the implementation of a large
investment project (i.e., over RON 100 million or roughly EUR 22.5 million):
    a) Stage 1 – Project identification: The idea is transposed into a conceptual note
       capable of offering information in a rigorous manner. During this phase, the pre-
       feasibility study is completed, as a tool that guides the decision-making process
       with respect to the best solution to address a need or issue faced by the
       beneficiaries of a proposed investment project.
    b) Stage 2 – Feasibility study: At least three options are explored and the most viable
       alternative from a technical, economic, and social perspective is then analyzed in
       detail. In this phase, the main credit release authority (i.e., the potential
       beneficiary of the funding, such as a Local or County Council) develops the
       complete project design and the studies meant to determine the project size, the
       environmental impact assessment, etc. In order for a project to pass to the
       following stages, the feasibility study must be approved by the credit release
       authority according to current legal provisions.
    c) Stage 3 – Selection and budgeting: The selection stage takes place when a certain
       new project is considered to have fulfilled all requirements related to its degree of
       preparation. The budgeting stage, including the detailed technical design, defines

Operational Programme 2014-2020,” World Bank, 2014.




                                                                                                      18
        when a new project will be included in the budget of the following year and when
        the resources are allocated in order to continue the implementation of the project
        in the following years, as per the fiscal and budgetary strategy. The fact that a
        project is “selected” does not necessarily mean that it will be “budgeted , ” because
        it is possible that in a certain year the government does not have the financial
        capacity necessary to finance all the projects deemed to be “ ready. ” By law
        however, it is allowed to elaborate the technical design if appropriate funds have
        been allocated for the project.
    d) Stage 4 – Project implementation / execution: The project that received a
       reasonable budgetary allocation allowing it to be completed within the anticipated
       timeframe begins to be implemented. The projects for which the budgetary
       allocations are minor in comparison to their total cost and have a timeframe for
       completion that exceeds the initial estimate are deemed to be in stand-by or in a
       minimum execution stage.
    e) Stage 5 – Completion, operation, and maintenance of the objective: This phase
       begins once the “reception” and start-up stages of the project are complete, and
       the project is ready to operate. In this stage, the delivery of the services can start.
       The beneficiary of the investment (i.e., a Local or County Council) will monitor the
       delivery of services to make sure that the new assets reach their goal during their
       usage period. The quantity and quality of the services offered, as well as the
       operation of the objective, will be monitored over time.
    f) Stage 6 – Ex-post project assessment: The purpose of this phase is to measure,
       assess, explain, and disseminate the real results of an investment project based on
       practical measurements and cost-efficiency analyses.

40.      For medium and large projects, as defined by GEO 88/2013, the following
prioritization principles must be followed (the actual criteria are provided in Annex 1):
       Principle 1: Appropriateness of the Project in the Policy Context [20 points]
       Principle 2: Economic and Social Justification [40 points for new projects/30 points
        for continuing existing investments]
       Principle 3: Affordability and Financial Sustainability [20 points]
       Principle 4: Implementation Arrangements/Implementation Performance [20
        points for new projects/30 points for continuing existing investments]

41.     While these principles aim to ensure optimal allocation of public resources and
the maximization of value for money in public spending, they do not formally cover small
projects. Indeed, the question remains: what should be done to select and prioritize small
projects for which adopting the full project cycle and evaluation procedures, as defined by
GEO 88/2013, would be excessive? In a few words, the answer is the following: the
applicable procedures should be proportional to the cost and complexity of each project.

42.    The PNDL, as the main state-budget-funded program managed by the MRDPA
finances primarily small and lower-middle-sized investments. Following the methodology




                                                                                                 19
used in the “Project Selection Models” report and using the Ministry of Finance’s definition
for large projects, PNDL projects were sub-divided in the following categories: large
projects (more than RON 100 million); upper-middle-sized projects (RON 30 – 100 million);
small/lower-middle-sized projects (RON 1.5 – 30 million); and very small projects (less than
RON 1.5 million). Very small projects (less than RON 1.5 million) constitute 2.5% of the
PNDL portfolio, while small/lower-middle sized projects represent the bulk of projects, with
an average value of around RON 6 million (~EUR 1.4 million). Both very small and lower-
middle sized projects fall under the category of “small projects” according to the GEO
88/2013, i.e., they are under the threshold of RON 30 million.

43.      This suggests that PNDL proposals should be evaluated and prioritized against
simpler, more straightforward selection criteria compared to the framework proposed by
GEO 88/2013, which in any case is not applicable for investments under RON 30 million.
Criteria for the PNDL should take project impact into account, without attempting highly
precise estimates of direct/indirect/induced effects or requiring elaborate cost-benefit
analyses. For efficiency purposes, there should be a selection process able to go through a
large number of small-sized projects (as opposed to large projects for which the important
factor is to thoroughly assess each individually or in comparison to other large projects, as
part of a strategic decision-making process).

Project sector
44.      First of all, on the topic of deciding priorities across sectors (e.g., whether to
invest more in roads than in water/wastewater), there are multiple options for coming to
an “optimal” allocation (Chapter V discusses a number of scenarios in more detail) . One
theoretical option is to finance what each jurisdiction proposes, in any sector of choice
(e.g., from public parks to roads and business centers). The idea of investment programs,
however, is that some investments add more value than others; for example, a road
connecting a remote commune to a neighboring city is typically a lot more useful than a




                                                                                                                  20
business & IT center that would lack both interested investors and the required human
capital. Keeping in mind the need for coordinated actions that deliver high development
impact, both EU instruments and state-budget-funded programs define a limited set of
eligible interventions, in line with key national/regional priorities, as defined in documents
such as the Europe 2020 strategy, the Governing Program, the National Sustainable
Development Strategy, etc. The reports corresponding to component (1) under the current
engagement of the Bank with the MRDPA address precisely the topic of harmonizing
strategies and plans for a coordinated prioritization of interventions at the national,
regional, and local level.

45.     Identifying the concrete needs in individual sectors also can help identify where
resources should be allocated. Especially if State Budget programs are designed to
complement EU funded programs, it is important to know where the needs are highest. If
investment needs are particularly high in one sector, but less high in another sector, a
larger allocation should go for the sector with the higher needs.

46.      If a sector-by-sector needs analysis is not available, every new cabinet in
Romania is required to present in front of Parliament (and the general public) an
overarching policy document that describes its priorities in each sector and across
sectors. Interestingly, the Governing Program 2013-2016 (still valid as of November 2014,
ahead of the election of a new President) argues that there has been a chronic shortage of
financing of services offered by local authorities and a lack of public investment
prioritization, with clear financing criteria, which has led to ever-larger discrepancies
between various areas in Roma nia. Under action items for Romania’s development, the
Government Program emphasizes the need to continue and finish infrastructure projects
that have been started in the past, based on clear priorities and consultations with
beneficiaries. The same document also prefaces the National Program for Local
Development (PNDL), calling for “financing a minimum package of required public
investments,” which include water and sanitation systems, along with roads and various
types of social infrastructure.

47.     While the Governing Program does not provide specifics (e.g., a certain
percentage for each type of supported investments), the reference to the “minimum
package” implies that none of the basic infrastructure investments should be neglected.
Indeed, in practice, the way funding was allocated for the PNDL in 2014 appears to support
the hypothesis that basic infrastructure needs (transport, water, and sanitation) receive
comparable levels of attention from the government. More specifically, the total number
of projects considered for the 2014 financial exercise is 3,952: roughly 52% are roads and
35% are water/wastewater investments. The number of social infrastructure investments
financed in 2014 through the PNDL is small. The table below provides more details of
sector composition of projects in the portfolio. Of these 3,952 projects, 2,530 were new
projects, while 1,422 were projects that were started in previous years and received PNDL
financing for 2014. Of the 1,422 started projects, 1,188 had a completion rate of less than
1% - i.e. they could technically be considered new projects. Less than 150 projects had a
completion rate of 60%.

Chapter II: The National Program for Local Development (PNDL)

48.      The Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) 28/2013 legally established the
National Program for Local Development. Along with its formal justification (“notă de
fundamentare”) and the Methodological Norms for its application (Ministry Order
1851/2013), this act sets the PNDL’s design and implementation framework. At the time,
the PNDL was an important expression of the new cabinet’s commitment to the
development of local infrastructure, as reflected in the 2013-2016 Governing Program (as
approved by Parliament through decision 45/2012). For example, one of the key objectives
for Romania’s regional development is defined as the financing of a basic package of
services for rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social infrastructure
etc., “for achieving [at least] minimum standards of living.” 10 The same document further
emphasizes the need to prioritize public infrast ructure projects to contribute to Romania’s
sustainable, balanced development. 11

49.      The GEO 28/2013 defines three sub-programs as components of the PNDL: the
modernization of Romanian villages; the urban regeneration of municipalities and towns;
and the development of county-level infrastructure. Eligible beneficiaries vary across sub-
programs: while the first one targets communes (rural localities), the second one is aimed
at cities and the latter at counties. GEO 30/2014 and MRDPA Ministry Order 919/2014
included Intercommunity Development Associations (IDAs) among the list of eligible
beneficiaries for PNDL funding. Article 7 in the GEO describes the list of intervention areas
(similar to “axes” of EU-funded programs):
        Water supply systems and drinking water treatment plant;
        Sewage systems (networks) and wastewater treatment plant;
        Education units (kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, high schools, etc.);
        Healthcare units in rural areas (clinics, pharmacies, etc.);
        Public roads (i.e., county roads, local interest roads, commune roads and/or public
         roads within localities);
        Bridges, culverts, and/or footbridges;
        Local cultural facilities, such as libraries, museums, multi-functional cultural
         centers, and theaters;
        Landfills;
        Public, commercial markets, fairs, cattle fairs, as applicable;
        Sports facilities; and
        Headquarters of local public authorities and other subordinated public
         institutions. 12

12 The last category (i.e., headquarters of public institutions) was introduced through GEO 30/2014.




                                                                                                       23
The types of eligible works include construction of new infrastructure, as well as extension,
rehabilitation, and upgrading of existing infrastructure. Essentially, through such broad
conditions, the PNDL is able to cover the MRDPA’s entire vast portfolio of projects – both
previously-financed interventions (at various stages of completion) and brand new
investments, by all types of local public beneficiaries (from local councils in communes and
cities to county councils).

50.    In addition to the overall objective of supporting Romania’s regional
development, the PNDL has sought to integrate three investment programs that had
operated independently in the past:
          The infrastructure program based on Government Decision (GD) 577/1997 targeted
           the modernization of communal roads and connecting villages to water supply,
           sanitation systems, and electric and phone networks. Before its integration under
           PNDL, this program was managed by the MRDPA (formerly the MRDT) through the
           Public Works Directorate. County councils played a main role by centralizing
           funding requests from all potential beneficiaries in the county and communicating
           them to the MRDPA.
          The Rural Infrastructure Development Program, based on Government Ordinance
           (GO) 7/2006, also aimed at the “development and modernization of Romania’s
           rural areas, […] by connecting them to roads and water and wastewater
           networks.”13 In its initial form, this program was managed by a Commission,
           presided by the Prime Minister and bringing together representatives of 6
           ministries, the Prime Minister’s Chancellery, and the Association of Romanian
           Communes. The Ministry of Transport was responsible for monitoring the
           program’s implementation.
          Multiannual Priority Programs for Water and the Environment, based on GO
           40/2006, defined specific intervention sectors in certain geographical areas (for
           example, “water and wastewater infrastructure for the Criș river basin, Vaslui
           County, and the municipality of Ploiești”). 14 Other projects targeted varied
           interventions, from increasing the safety of river dams to developing an integrated
           IT system for the environment sector and the sustainable development of the
           Danube Delta biosphere.
Moreover, GEO 28/2013 establishing the PNDL also dismantled the Program for the
Rehabilitation and Upgrade of 10,000km of County and Local Roads.” The reason
mentioned by the formal justification note is that the program had not received funding
and thus had not financed any investment projects since its establishment in 2010.

51.     In essence, the PNDL brought under the same management and strategic
direction three different investment programs that had had similar objectives. As noted
by the government, this change was intended “to enable a more efficient use of public
funds through an integrated implementation of infrastructure development programs in
rural and urban areas.” 15 Indeed, it makes sense that central government programs with
the same target intervention areas would be merged under a single design and
implementation unit – i.e., the MRDPA. As emphasized publicly by the MRDPA, the PNDL
was never meant as a successor to the now-closed PNDI, which was based on a financing
scheme whereby contractors would finance the cost of the project and get reimbursed
upon completion. Still, PNDL norms make it possible that other projects previously started
receive financing to finish the required works, provided that such investments are aligned
with PNDL priorities and eligibility rules.

52.     On the downside, the legal framework, including the PNDL implementation
norms, lacks clear references to potential synergies and coordination with other funds.
The program fails to draw lines that would avoid duplication and crowding out of EU-
funded instruments, which come at much lower cost for the Romanian government. As the
next sub-section shows, the PNDL is based on a relatively broad set of norms. On the one
hand, this allows for increased flexibility in financing projects. On the other hand, there
may be room for more specificity and rigor in the evaluation and selection of projects to
increase the transparency, objectivity, and potential impact of the program. These
arguments are further described in the following sections, which cover the key steps
involved in the PNDL’s implementation.

Allocation of PNDL Funds to Counties
53.     Based on the budget allocation among ministries, as agreed at the government
level and approved by Parliament, th e MRDPA establishes the PNDL’s total annual
budget. Next, the MRDPA allocates sums for each county, sub-program, and specific areas
of intervention, based on a Ministerial Order. The criteria for allocating sums across
counties are described in Annex 2 to the PNDL Methodological Norms. 16 In short, the three
main types of criteria that shape the allocation of PNDL funds from the national t o the
county level are based on ongoing (unfinished) projects (number and funding needs),
demographic data (county population and surface area), and financial capacity.

54.     While the PNDL norms include sensible indicators to decide on the funding
allocation for each county, the methodology shows room for improvement. For one, the
law is not clear which of the three main criteria are factored into the funding allocation,
merely noting that “at least one of [them] should be considered.” 17 Second, there are no

                                                                                              25
defined weights for individual criteria or for sub-criteria within the main categories (e.g.,
number of ongoing projects vs. their funding needs). Third, it is unclear how certain
indicators would be measured in practice, particularly the administrative-territorial units’
capacity to co-finance investment projects. One proxy that could be used would be non-
earmarked revenues as a share of total revenues, 18 in the absence of clear commitments
(e.g., local/county council decisions to co-finance particular investments). Finally, other
potentially relevant indicators are missing. For example, the PNDL does not seem to take
into account a county’s development level, measured as GDP per capita (as used for the
Regional Operational Programme in deciding the split across Romania’s eight planning
regions).

55.       It is worth highlighting that final decisions regarding the PNDL’s allocation of
funding belong entirely to the MRDPA. In this process, it is presumed that the Ministry
makes use of county-level data, provided either directly by county/local authorities or by
other central bodies (e.g., the Ministry of Finance). Once it makes a decision on the
anticipated funding allocation, the MRDPA communicates it to county councils. Based on
these expectations, county councils further interact with local authorities to begin making a
list of investments that may be financed through the PNDL. Based on data available at this
point, it is unclear whether at this stage the MRDPA decides only on the funding allocation
per county or goes beyond that. Article 8 of GEO 28/2013 implies the latter: specifically,
“the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration shall prepare and
approve by order of the Minister of Regional Development and Public Administration the
distribution of the amounts intended to the Program, per counties, per each sub-program,
and per specific areas of intervention.” 19 It is equally unclear if the MRDPA pre-selects
investment projects to be included in the PNDL, as implied by Article 9 (3), as opposed to
putting together the list of investments based on inputs from local and county authorities,
as implied by Article 9 (4) and by the Methodological Norms.

                             Box 1. Allocation criteria for the PNDL budget

         “For the balanced distribution of fu nds to counties, at least one of the following
         indicators should be considered:

         (1) Weight of number of ongoing investment projects for each county, based on:
              The number of ongoing investment projects for each county as a share of
                 total ongoing investments at the national level;
              The funding needs for completing the investment projects started and not
                 completed as a share of the total funding needs for completing the
                 investment projects started and not completed at national level.

         (2) Demographic and administrative-territorial data of counties, considering:
               The weight of the number of administrative-territorial units in the county as a
                share of the total number of administrative-territorial units at the national
                level;
               The weight of the county population as a percentage of the total population
                of the country;
               The weight of the county area as a percentage of the total area of the
                country.

         (3) Administrative-territorial units’ financial capacity, considering the share of units’
         capacity to participate with funds from the local budget for achieving investment
         objectives.”

                    Source: PNDL Methodological Norms (MRDPA Minister Order 1851/2013).


56.      In any case, at the beginning of 2014, the funding allocation was roughly
equivalent across counties – around EUR 5 to EUR 5.7 million. On the one hand, this
demonstrates the MRPDA’s commitment to making the PNDL funds available to authorities
in all parts of Romania. On the other hand, the outcome may suggest that there is no clear
prioritization of investments based on counties’ different characteristics. By contrast, the
ROP 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 (in draft form, as of August 2014), for example, made
specific commitments to less developed areas, allocating significantly larger shares of
funding particularly to the North-East, South-East, and South Regions.

Preparation of Project Proposals and County-Level Prioritization
57.     Once the MRDPA decides on the indicative PNDL funding allocation for each
county, county councils put together the list of projects proposed at the county and local
level – both new and ongoing/unfinished investments. 20 To this end, local authorities
submit their proposals to county councils or , “in justified circumstances,” directly to the
MRDPA, as recently mandated by Article 3 of GEO 30/2014 and MRDPA Minister Order



20
     See Article 9 (4).




                                                                                                     27
919/2014. It is unclear what situation would qualify as “justified.” The PNDL
Methodological Norms include a clear template for project proposals, which applies to
both new and ongoing investments. 21 This asks for: the name of the project; the name of
the applicant/local authority; the location of the project; main physical characteristics; total
value of the investment; total value of eligible costs to be financed from the PNDL; dat a
regarding the design contract (contract ID number, value, etc.); and, for ongoing
investments, the data regarding the construction works, the percentage of the project
completed to date, and the deadline for project completion.

58.      Next, county Ccouncils have 15 days to send to the MRDPA the list of proposed
investments, based on Annex 3 of the PNDL Methodological Norms. Essentially, this is a
table listing the projects proposed for financing through the program in a particular year,
divided up by new and ongoing investments, and further by sub-program (i.e., “the
modernization of the Romanian village,” “urban regeneration of municipalities and towns,”
and “county-level infrastructure”). The list of proposed investments has to be accompanied
by a justification note explaining how each county council decided to prioritize projects
submitted by local authorities.

59.    Under the current PNDL framework, county councils prioritize project proposals
from local authorities within their jurisdiction based on four possible criteria, out of
which “at least one should be used” :
          Signing date of the goods/work/service contract, as applicable;
          Physical status (% complete);
          Population benefitting from the investment; and
          Local budget’s percentage of co-financing.

60.      As with the PNDL’s criteria for allocating funds between counties, the current
prioritization criteria for selecting interventions within counties are broad and
ambiguous. This means that county councils have significant leverage to decide how to
prioritize investments in their jurisdiction. In their current form, the methodological norms
do not require county councils to use all four criteria, but merely to choose one out of the
four listed above. This may mean that a county could decide solely based on the number of
beneficiaries, while another could only look at the signing date of the contract. At the same
time, it is unclear how a particular criterion should be deployed: for example, would a
project with an older signing date take precedence over a newer one, or the other way
around? Also, how should a local authority measure the population benefitting from a
specific investment, say a local road that connects to a national road? It could be just the
population of a commune or the population of a much larger area (e.g., within 20, 40, or
even 60 minutes of the locality). Additionally, there are no defined weights among criteria.

                                                                                                   28
Project Selection, Prioritization, and Contracting by the MRDPA
61.      Based on the lists received from county councils across Romania, the MRDPA
makes the final selection of projects that receive PNDL funding in a given year. Once
again, the methodological norms do not define a clear, transparent selection process. The
final selection is to be based on the proposals received from county councils, as well as on
“[the Ministry’s] own data and specialized assessments.” 22 It is unclear what data are
deployed in such evaluations. The same document notes that the selection is done
exclusively by the MRDPA if county councils do not abide by the 15-day timeline or if they
fail to prioritize investments based on at least one of the four criteria specified in the law.
The finalized list of interventions is approved through the MRDPA’s Minister Order,
including an annex with the full set of projects (for each of them, the annex simply notes
the name of the administrative-territorial unit, the name of the project, and the sum
channeled from the state budget).

62.     There are slightly different requirements for applicants with ongoing vs. new
projects. For the former, local authorities need to send to the MRDPA the documents that
show the project’s current phase of completion, the updated value of remaining expenses
to be incurrent for the finalization of the intervention, and public procurement contracts
that have been signed previously, including addenda, if any. Upon verification of such
documents, the process can move forward to the contracting phase.

63.     For new investment projects, beneficiaries are required to submit to the MRDPA
the corresponding technical documentation. In most cases, this refers to feasibility studies
for new interventions or the documentation for approving intervention works (DALI 23 ) for
existing infrastructure. Feasibility studies and DALIs are not eligible for reimbursement
through the PNDL and have to have been developed through the applicant’s own
resources, in accordance with the regulations set by GD 28/2008. GEO 28/2013 also notes
that the documentation must prove that the proposed projects abide by the applicable
cost standards. However, cost standards are provided only for county roads, communal
roads, and for water projects. No cost standards are provided for wastewater projects, as
these are considered to require quite different technical solutions from case to case. 24

64.     It is worth noting that local authorities who seek to access PNDL funds do not
submit formal applications that are comparable to the complex documents required by
EU-funded programs. The bulk of an “application” is the technical documentation
corresponding to the proposed project – i.e., the feasibility study and/or the detailed
technical design. In field interviews, PNDL beneficiaries express satisfaction with the

23
   “Documentație de Avizare a Lucrărilor de Interventii ” (Documentation for the Approval of
Intervention Works).
24
   In practice, MRDPA technical staff use a simple rule of thumb for benchmarking sanitation
projects, namely that they should not exceed 1.5 times the cost of equivalent water projects.




                                                                                                  29
current system’s simplicity and relatively quick processing of applications. In effect, under
the current system, requiring a formal form with categories similar to those included in
applications for EU funds – e.g., “project relevance for strategic objectives,” “economic
impact,” “technical features,” “social/environmental impact,” etc. – would not add much
value. This is because the actual prioritization and, essentially, the “preselection” of
projects happen at the level of county councils. The MRDPA only verifies that submitted
proposals are in accordance with a set of criteria – it is more of an eligibility check than a
thorough technical and financial evaluation. This is not to say that the technical-economic
data related to the project is not assessed by MRDPA evaluators, but only that projects that
make it thus far generally go through contracting. Even if a proposal initially fails the check,
MRDPA staff recommends the necessary improvements to beneficiaries, enabling projects
to move to the next phases (pending the successful resolution of suggested changes).

65.     Recently, changes were introduced to the PNDL’s methodological norms to
increase the efficiency of assessing and approving new project proposals. Until June 2014,
the technical documentation would be first assessed by DG RDI within the MRDPA and then
sent to the Ministry’s Technical-Economic Council (TEC). Without the TEC’s formal
approval, projects would not be eligible for financing. Citing the low capacity of the TEC to
assess proposals and the long delays incurred in the process, the MRDPA eliminated this
step through Ministry Order 1851/2013. Currently, new projects pre-approved for financing
through the PNDL only go through an assessment by the technical unit of the DG RDI,
which primarily evaluates the following:
       whether the technical documentation is complete and in accordance with GD
        28/2008;
       whether the applicant’s folder includes the local/county council’s decision for
        approving the project’s technical-economic indicators and for ensuring the
        required co-financing; and
       whether the expenditures are properly presented and do not exceed current cost
        standards.

66.      This rather simplistic PNDL project evaluation minimizes the risk of low
absorption of funds by ensuring that the full budget envelope goes to pre-approved
projects that eventually end up getting financed and using up the allocated funds . A
potential upside of this system is that money that is not spent under the PNLD can be
relatively easily reallocated under the same annual budget (if not too late in the year),
either to another MRDPA activity or to another ministry. This is obviously not the case with
EU structural funds, which Romania and other member states stand to lose if they cannot
spend them in due time. Again, generally speaking, interview data reveal that PNDL
beneficiaries appreciate the current system for its speed and responsiveness in processing
applications.

67.    Even so, the PNDL should aspire to have a selection model that is as transparent
and legitimate as it is clear and efficient – if not for the fear of losing funds, at least as a
way to ensure a smooth, predictable project cycle for applicants and beneficiaries. In fact,




                                                                                                   30
two of the current selection criteria – the date of signing the contract and the physical
status of the project – appear to imply that a more advanced investment, which can easily
recommence and start absorbing money, could take priority over completely new
interventions. 25 Subsequent chapters focus in much greater depth on the PNDL project
selection model and prioritization criteria, suggestions options for improving the current
system.

Implementation
68.     Once the contract between the MRDPA and local authorities is signed, actual
implementation can commence. The exact stages will depend on whether the project is
new or ongoing. In the former case, the beneficiary of PNDL funds will have to organize
public procurement procedures, in line with the applicable legislation (OUG 34/2006). In
some cases, these procedures take a long time – due to challenges in court, lack of offers,
or other reasons specific to each project – which may aggravate the risk of not using up the
funds allocated for a particular year. This is because the PNDL is not a multi-annual
program like an EU-funded instrument, which creates inherent incentives for applicants to
submit for consideration smaller, easier projects that can be carried out in 1-2 years. If the
project is ongoing and construction work has already begun in a previous year (through the
PNDL or a different program), depending on a case-by-case basis, the beneficiary may
continue previous engagement with service providers and contractors.

69.     Payments and reimbursements are critical factors for a smooth, successful
implementation. Based on the methodological norms (Articles 16-17), beneficiaries submit
reimbursement requests first to county councils, which then submit a consolidated request
for each county to the MRDPA. This system was then changed to allow beneficiaries to
request funds directly from the MRDPA, essentially simplifying the process by eliminating a
step. Some county councils report, however, that local city halls sometimes fail to send
them a copy of reimbursement requests sent to the Ministry, thus requiring repeated
requests to keep them in the loop. According to county council staff interviewed, they want
to remain involved to be able to coordinate and monitor the implementation process in
their respective jurisdiction, as required by the PNDL implementation norms. Once it
approves the requests received, the Ministry channels the funds – within the set annual
limits and based on the proofs/documents received (“situații de lucrări”) – directly to
beneficiaries. Finally, beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of
service providers (i.e., showing that the funds received were used for the intended
purpose).




25The exact prioritization mechanisms is unknown, as explained earlier, because the
methodological norms leave it to county councils and the MRDPA to decide which criterion/criteria
apply.




                                                                                                    31
70.      In addition, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work progress and
reporting updates to county councils and the MRDPA. The flow of reports is similar to the
initial one presented above for financing requests: local beneficiaries send all documents
corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every quarter, county councils send
to the MRDPA a consolidated update on the progress of construction works. Upon request,
beneficiaries are required to send to the MRDPA any document related to the financed
project. For its part, the MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring and controlling the
program’s implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives who,
together with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the
accuracy of reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.

Post-Implementation
71.      The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post -
implementation phase – i.e., tracking the project’s evolution upon completion. At least
based on the methodological norms, once the actual works are finished, the beneficiary
sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the warranty period
expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula documentation (“procesul
verbal de recepție final” ) to the MRDPA. Beyond that, the two key post-implementation
functions for ay investment program – i.e., ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and
knowledge sharing – appear to be missing at this point in the PNDL’s evolution. Put
differently, there is no formal process for evaluating the impact of completed investments
and there are no institutionalized efforts for communicating good practices among past,
current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds. This is not surprising for a young program
like the PNDL; still, going forward, it would be important to set-up ex-post mechanisms to
ensure the continuous improvement of the instrument. Subsequent chapters provide more
in-depth suggestions for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, including through
performance and impact indicators.




                                                                                              32
Chapter III: Good Practices of Project Selection for EU-Funded Programs
in Comparison with the PNDL

72.     EU-funded programs in Romania offer plenty of good practice approaches that
can serve as inspiration for the improvement of the PNDL Project Selection Model. They
come embedded with years-long experience of other EU countries. The project selection
models they use have been tried, tested, and refined over years of implementing
investment projects. Moreover, drawing ideas from these types of instruments can also
ensure proper coordination across different investment programs in Romania at the
national, regional, and local level.

73.      EU-funded programs have, however, a level of complexity that may not be
feasible for the PNDL, and a processing capacity that may not be replicable, so caution is
needed to ensure that any proposed policy measures are feasible in practice. For one,
EU-funded instruments have the staff that enables them to operate at a higher, more
sophisticated level. For example, the Regional Operational Programme has a staff of over
500 working in the Managing Authority and the Regional Development Agencies, having
processed around 3,400 projects for the 2007-2013 programming period (Figure 5 provides
an idea of ROP’s complexity). By comparison, the PNDL has a staff of less than 40,
managing around 2,400 projects in 2014.

74.      In what follows, this report provides an overview of some of the key elements of
EU-funded programs and discusses which would be feasible for the current PNDL. We
also discuss the differences between EU-funded and state-budget-funded programs, which
can help explain why some of the elements of the former are hard to adopt by the latter.
The focus will primarily be on those Operational Programmes and specific Priority Axes
that have a direct relevance for the PNDL: the Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013
and its Priority Axis 2 on Road Infrastructure, Priority Axis 1 on Integrated Urban
Development Plans, and Priority Axis 3 – Educational, Health, and Social infrastructure; the
National Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 and its Measure 322 on Local
Infrastructure Development; and the Sectoral Operational Programme Environment 2007-
2013 and its Priority Axis 1 on the Extension of Water and Wastewater Infrastructure.
Given that the 2014-2020 operational programmes have not been finalized yet, they will
not be discussed in this report.

75.     An analysis of the project selection models employed by operational
programmes requires looking at all the four stages of the project selection cycle: pre-
application, application, implementation, post-implementation.


Pre-application and general overview of programmes
76.       A characteristic of all Operational Programmes is that they have a programmatic
document at their foundation. The programmatic document lays out key sector dynamics
and needs and details, and describes how these needs will be addressed by the program. It
is of critical importance, as it forms the basis for the entire project selection model. Among
other things, it provides potential applicants with key information related to the type of
investments that are eligible for financing under a particular program.

The Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013
77.      The stated objective of the ROP 2007-2013 is both comprehensive and complex.
Specifically, it is to “support the economic, social, territorially balanced and sustainable
development of the Romanian Regions, according to their specific needs and resources,
focusing on urban growth poles, improving the business environment and basic
infrastructure, in order to make the Romanian Regions, especially the ones lagging behind,
more attractive places to live, visit, invest in, and work. A characteristic of all Operational
Programmes is that they have a programmatic document at their foundation. ” To achieve
these objectives, the ROP 2007-2013 was organized around five priority axes, while at the
same time acknowledging that it would not be able to achieve these objectives alone, but
would require the complementary inputs of other investment programs, of key targeted
policies, and of the private sector. Of particular interest to this study is Axis 2:
Improvement of regional and local transport infrastructure and Axis 3: Educational, Health,
and Social infrastructure (DMI 3.1. Health infrastructure and DMI 3.4. Educational
infrastructure).




                                                                                                  34
78.     The ROP 2007-2013 Priority Axis 2 aims to “increase the accessibility of the
Regions and the mobility of population, goods and services, in order to foster sustainable
economic development.” Around 150 projects have been contracted under this axis, for a
total value of over EUR 1.4 billion, with much of this going to the rehabilitation of county
roads. One of the key stated aims of this priority axis is to improve connectivity to the TEN-
T Network and reduce the incidence of road accidents. These stated aims have in turn
informed the elaboration of the evaluation and selection grids for this priority axis.

79.      The ROP 2007-2013 Priority Axis 3 aims to ”create the premises for better access
of the population to essential services, contributing to the achievement of the European
objective of economic and social cohesion, by improving infrastructure for health,
education, social and public safety in emergency situations .” Four key areas of
intervention were identified under this priority, out of which the most relevant in this
context are 3.1. Rehabilitation, modernization, and equipping of the health services’
infrastructure and 3.4. Rehabilitation, modernization, development, and equipping of pre-
university, university education and continuous vocational training infrastructure. Around
600 projects have been contracted under this axis, for a total value of over EUR 1 billion,
out of which: over 90 projects were contracted on DMI 3.1., for a total value of over EUR
300 million and over 290 projects were contracted on DMI 3.4., for a total value of over
EUR 480 million.

80.     The Programmatic Document in turn becomes the blueprint for elaborating
Applicant Guides for individual axes. The Applicant Guides help potential applicant’s
determine whether the projects they want funded under the ROP are actually eligible for
financing. The Guides cover issues such as: who and what is eligible; conditions that
applicants and proposed projects have to fulfill; evaluation and selection criteria;
monitoring procedures and reporting; etc.

81.     At the pre-application stage, the beneficiary deals primarily with the
intermediate body (in the case of the ROP, the Regional Development Agencies).
Intermediate Bodies usually have Helpdesk units that are tasked to discuss with potential
applicants and provide guidance. In turn, interested applicants submit project proposals
and supporting documentation to the RDA in their region once a call for proposals has
been launched. The RDA checks the administrative documents and eligibility requirements
and ensures that the applicant’s file is complete. If everything is in order, the process
moves further to the technical and financial evaluation stage, which is completed with the
help of external experts (contracted either by the Managing Authority or directly by the
RDAs).

82.      In the case of the PNDL, the County Councils act as de facto intermediate bodies.
However, this set up has a number of short-comings. On the one hand, county councils
have a lot of leeway in selecting the projects to be sent to the PNDL for funding. Since the
prioritization criteria they have to use are basic, and since the use of these criteria is not
really monitored by the MRDPA, the county councils can in essence chose the projects
they want. This of course can lead to a situation where politics drive project selection. At




                                                                                                 35
the same time, the county councils are in an obvious conflict of interest, as they currently
act both as an “intermediate body” and as beneficiaries of PNDL funds. As such, they can
choose to fund their own projects over other projects. Ideally, the MRDPA should provide
a share of county projects and local projects to be financed at the county level and clear
eligibility and prioritization criteria. County councils could function as intermediate bodies
for projects proposed by local authorities, while the MRDPA could check eligibility and
prioritize project proposals that come from the county councils.

The Sectoral Operational Programme Environment 2007-2013
83.     The stated objective of the SOP Environment 2007-2013 programmatic
document is to “improve the living standards and the environment, focusing in particular
on meeting the environment acquis .” One of the strategic directions of the SOP
Environment 2007-2013 is to improve people’s accessibility to public utilities and
encourage local and regional development. To this end, Axis 1 of the SOP focuses on “The
extension and modernization of water and wastewater systems.”

84.     A number of sub-objectives are listed under Axis 1. These include: providing
adequate water and sewage systems at accessible tariffs; providing adequate drinking
water in all urban agglomerations; improving the purity of watercourses; improving sludge
management; and creating innovative and efficient water management structures. When
the programmatic document was elaborated, only 52% of the population in Romania had
access to basic water and wastewater infrastructure. Moreover, the existent infrastructure
was often underfunded, not well maintained, poorly managed, and atomized into several
small operators.

85.      Another key driver for the implementation of Axis 1 is the need to fulfill the
acquis communautaire. According to the Accession Treaty, Romania has to comply with
the acquis on wastewater collection, treatment and discharge. Thus, by 2015, a number of
263 agglomerations with more than 10,000 population equivalent (p.e.) have to be
connected to a wastewater system. By 2018, 2,346 agglomerations with a p.e. of 2,000-
10,000 have to be connected to a wastewater system. The Accession Treaty also indicates
that by 2015 compliance is required with Directive No. 98/83/EC on drinking water quality.
Moreover, since the entire territory of Romania has been declared a sensitive area, all
agglomerations of more than 10,000 people equivalent have to provide advanced
wastewater treatment (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus removal). This means that additional
costs are required even for the larger cities that have an operational wastewater
treatment system in place. In fact, priority was given to projects implemented in larger
cities, which have a higher number of beneficiaries, and where the environmental impact
is therefore larger. To top it all, the Water Framework Directive also states that by 2015,
59% of the water bodies in Romania should be in good ecological status, requiring
additional investments of around 6 billion Euro. This may require the proper coordination
of investments in wastewater infrastructure, ensuring that a higher share of water bodies
receive treated discharge from the human settlements located along them.




                                                                                                 36
86.      To achieve the stated objectives, Regional Operating Companies (ROC) have
been established. The Regional Operating Companies usually cover the area of their
respective counties, but not always. They were designed to bring together all operators in
the region under one umbrella, and to thus achieve economies of scale and higher
efficiency rates. Municipalities with drinking water and wastewater service have to join an
Intercommunity Development Association (IDA) to which they delegate the exercise of
their shareholder rights in the Regional Operating Company. Basically, local authorities are
the beneficiaries of the SOP Environment 2007-2013 through the ROC.

87.     All new investments to be made in the area covered by the Regional Operating
Companies are laid out in the Water Masterplan for that region. All regions had to
elaborate such masterplans, where they designate the agglomerations and clusters where
investments will be made through the SOP Environment 2007-2013 and other financing
sources. In essence, wastewater investments should only be done in localities with a
population equivalent of over 2,000, while investments in water infrastructure can be
made in all localities with more than 50 p.e.

88.      Most local authorities that want to develop drinking water and wastewater
infrastructure have to be part of the Water Masterplan, need to join the Inter-communal
Development Association with the Regional Operating Company, and , when the
investment is finished, have to cede operation of the new infrastructure to the ROC. The
masterplan includes a full list of agglomerations and clusters where funds have to be
prioritized in order to ensure compliance with the Acquis and the 2018 deadline. As such,
new investments should be concentrated in the areas designated by the masterplan. In
practice however, this often does not happen.

89.     Many PNDL investments in water and wastewater have been done outside the
provisions of the SOP Environment 2007-2013. Although at the political level the stated
objective of these investments is to help achieve the EU Acquis on Water, in many cases
these investments have been done in localities with less than 2,000 people equivalent,
with the water and wastewater infrastructure being operated independently. Moreover, in
some cases water and/or wastewater treatment plans have been created to service
individual localities, although it would have been more efficient and more sustainable in
the long run to have these systems service a cluster of localities.

90.       From an institutional point of view, the MA for the SOP Environment 2007-2013
is also aided by intermediate bodies in the country’s 8 regions. The intermediate bodies
are basically the first point of contact for applicants, and they perform the eligibility check.
The evaluation of the project is also done at the IB level. If the IB determines that an
application received requires more work, applicants have to redo the application until
eligibility criteria are fulfilled. The full implementation mechanism for the SOP
Environment is outlined above.




                                                                                                   37
The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
91.       PNDR, given its complexity, has set out objectives for each of its four major
priority axes. Among these, the stated objective of Axis 3 is to “encourag e the
diversification of the rural economy and through this and otherwise to improve the quality
of life in the rural environment.” The programmatic document indicates for example that
only half of the communes in Romania had access to the road network in 2004. Moreover,
25% of communes do not have all-season roads. In terms of the water and wastewater
infrastructure, when the programmatic document was drafted, only 33% of the rural
population had access to running water and only 10% had access to a public sewage
network. The existence of a poorly-developed basic infrastructure in most communes acts
as a limitation on the development of other basic services in the rural areas (cultural and
recreational facilities, childcare facilities etc.) In most communes and villages, these
services are very poorly-developed or in many cases, are almost non-existent. In 2006, only
7 percent of Romanian villages had kindergartens. Leisure centers and outdoor areas
(playgrounds for children, parks, bike tracks, sports grounds, etc.) are also poorly
represented. In regard to public sports related facilities in villages, in 2001 there were only
26 sport clubs. Most cultural centers, culture houses and other cultural establishments are
in a serious situation of degradation and can no longer provide cultural services to the
rural population, thus reducing their educational capability. Due to the lack of financial
resources, many cultural establishments in the rural areas are no longer able to carry out
their activities because of their advanced state of degradation. For example in 2002, of the
country’s total of 6147 community centers, only 1874 were capable to carry out cultural
activities. Moreover, despite the fact that 97 % of the community centers have their own
headquarters, their equipment level is generally in a very unsatisfactory condition for 80%
of them.

92.      Axis 3 of the PNDR targets three key objectives, each with a subset of specific
goals and measures. Of relevance to this task is the stated Strategic Objective to “Incr ease
the attractiveness of rural areas. ” The Specific Objectives listed under this Strategic
Objective include: “Creation and modernizing the basic physical infrastructure in rural
areas”; “Improvement of the quality of the social, natural , and economic environment in
the rural area”; “Protection and conservation of the rural cultural and natural patrimony”;
“Creation, improvement , and diversification of tourism facilities and attractions. ” The
following Specific Measures are listed under these Specific Objectives: Measure 322:
“Village renewal and development, improvement of basic services for the economy and
rural population, conservation and upgrading the rural heritage”; Measure 313:
“Encouraging tourism activities”. Of these, it is Measure 322 that is of particular interest to
this current work.

93.    Proper coordination and a harmonized approach with other investment
programmes is one of the stated objectives of the PNDR. This is something that was also
mentioned in the other operational programmes discussed here – the ROP and the SOP
Environment. Before these programmes are approved by the European Commission they
have to show that they are complementary in nature, and do not duplicate investments.
For example, the ROP undertakes works of rehabilitation for Category A historical



                                                                                                  38
monuments in both urban and rural areas, as well as rehabilitation works for Category B
historical monuments in urban areas. The PNDR undertakes works of rehabilitation for
Category B historical monuments in rural areas. The ROP undertakes the rehabilitation of
county roads and urban roads, while the PNDR undertakes the rehabilitation of communal
roads. At the same time it is acknowledged that not all existing needs can be covered with
available EU funds. For example, to achieve the EU Water Acquis objectives by 2018, there
is an investment need of around 19 billion Euro. Of this, the SOP Environment had an
allocation for 2007-2013 of only 3.2 billion Euro. It was therefore agreed that investments
from other sources, such as the PNDR and state-budget funded programmes, were
required. Investments regarding the rehabilitation of educational (schools) and health
infrastructure was supported through ROP, while PNDR supported new investments for
constructing kindergartens in rural area.

94.     For the 2007-2013 Programming Period, PNDR allocated 1.6 billion Euro for
Measure 322. Of this, only a fraction went to investments in water and wastewater. This
shortage of investment in the water and wastewater, coupled with delays in
implementation of the SOP Environment 2007-2013, indicates that Romania may face an
infringement procedure in 2015 and 2018, as it will still be some distance away from the
targets it has committed to reach. It may therefore pay off to consider focusing more
resources (both EU funds and state-budget funds) on achieving the EU Water Acquis
Objectives. It is also important to consider additional resources (e.g. private funds or PPP
arrangements) that could be tapped to help meet these objectives.

95.     The Applicant Guide for Measure 322 provides a number of critical eligibility
criteria for potential PNDR applicants. For example, eligible beneficiaries for the
development of communal roads are communes or intercommunity development
associations (i.e., associations of localities). For the development of drinking water and
wastewater infrastructure, eligible applicants are communes or the regional operating
company. Applicants have to prove that proposed water and wastewater projects are
included in the Regional Water Masterplan and, once the investment is finalized, they have
to cede operation of the system to the regional operating company. Moreover, these
projects have to include both investments in water and wastewater systems. If applicants
want to finance a project that is not included in the Regional Water Masterplan, they have
to take on the administration of the system, as well as operation and maintenance costs.
Investments that are not included in the Regional Water Masterplan have to focus on
areas where: water supply is insufficient; there is a high incidence of draught; raw water is
highly polluted; aquifer has a high concentration of nitrates. All investments done under
Measure 322 also have to conform to the local General Urban Plan.

96.      The Applicant Guide also provides funding caps for different types of
investments and different types of beneficiaries. For example, the funding limit for
infrastructure investments varies as such: EUR 1 million for individual investments done by
a commune; EUR 3 million for individual investments done by an intercommunity
development association; EUR 2.5 million for integrated projects done by a commune; EUR




                                                                                                39
6 million for integrated projects done by an intercommunity development association.
Beneficiaries can apply for a maximum of two PNDR projects per programming period.

97.     The institutional framework of PNDR also includes the use of intermediate
bodies. Thus, a beneficiary who wants to apply for a PNDR project has to take the
application to the County Payment Office for Rural Development and Fisheries (OJPDRP),
which checks the conformity of the application. The applicants are contacted directly if the
application requires improvements and they cannot move to the next stage until the
necessary adjustments are made. The eligibility check for infrastructure development
projects is done at the central level, by the Agency for Rural Investment Financing , on a
sample of projects. This looks at the eligibility of the applicant, the project eligibility and
selection criteria, the indicative budget, as well as the feasibility study and all annexed
documents.

Application
98.     All Operational Programmes have an evaluation and selection phase, which
serves as the key vehicle for prioritizing projects. The evaluation and selection system is in
many respects the heart of a project selection model. The way the evaluation itself is done
varies from program to program. In what follows we will discuss in more detail the
evaluation and selection systems for the ROP 2007-2013, the SOP Environment 2007-2013,
and the PNDR 2007-2013.
The Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013
99.      The ROP 2007-2013 has tailored evaluation and selection grids for each
individual priority axis. As with most evaluation and selection grids in use today, the
proposed ROP system is not perfect. It does provide a basis however for a sound
prioritization of investments. Annexes Ca and Cb include the detailed evaluation and
selection grid. We will discuss some of the key elements of this grid. A more in-depth
discussion and alternative proposals can be found in the World Bank report “Identification
of Project Selection Models for the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020. ”

100. The evaluation and selection grid for ROP Axis 2 is split into two major sections:
1) contribution of the project to the realization of the ROP; 2) quality, maturity, and
sustainability of the project. The criteria listed under the second section are quite
straightforward and may be applied as such to several types of projects. The criteria listed
under the first section normally follow the key objectives set out in the Programmatic
Document. In this case, connectivity to the TEN-T of a proposed county road would garner
a project the maximum score under criterion 1.1. Other criteria used include: potential to
improve road safety; potential to reduce travel time and improve traffic conditions; the
importance of the project to the region, as measured by the economic rate of return and
the cost-benefit analysis. Of these four criteria, the first one (on connectivity to the TEN-T)
was easiest to fulfil, so a significant number of projects contracted under the ROP now
connect to the TEN-T (see figure below). Although connection to the TEN-T was not a strict
requirement, and although the score for the TEN-T criterion was diluted by the other 3
criteria (the ROP 2007-2013 evaluation and selection grids apply no weights to different




                                                                                                  40
criteria), a significant number of applicants drafted projects for the rehabilitation of county
roads that connect to the TEN-T.

                    Figure 6. County road projects financed through the ROP 2007 -2013




Note: The roads in red represent the TEN-T Network. The lines in blue represent the county road links financed
through the ROP 2007-2013.

101. Given the limited resources, the county roads projects that were ultimately
funded under Priority Axis 2 of the ROP 2007-2013 were not always the ideal choice. As
discussed earlier in the report, investments in connective infrastructure, to be most
impactful, should ideally achieve two key desiderata: enable as many people as possible
easier access to opportunities (jobs, higher education, healthcare, culture, entertainment,
etc.); enable private companies an easier access to a larger labor pool. The key places of
opportunity in Romania are the larger cities. That is why the team has recommended that
improved connectivity to Romania’s 7 growth poles and to the other 33 county residences
should be one of the criteria to be used in evaluating and selecting county road projects.
As the map below highlights, the rehabilitation of roads (in blue) that connect to the TEN-T
does not always also improve access to a center of opportunity.

102. The resources required to rehabilitate the country’s county and communal road
network exceed what is made available through the ROP 2014-2020 and the PNDL. The
sum required to upgrade the county and communal roads that are made of stone or earth
is somewhere between EUR 6 and 12 billion. The draft ROP 2014-2020 programmatic
document has allocated around EUR 0.9 billion for Axis 6: Road Transport Infrastructure.
The PNDL has allocated around EUR 110 million for the rehabilitation of county and
communal roads, in 2014 – 50% of the total PNDL allocation for 2014. If we assume that




                                                                                                                 41
the same amount will be allocated every year from 2014 through 2022, than around EUR 1
billion will be available for this programmatic period. Thus, the ROP 2014-2020 and the
PNDL would provide a total of 1.9 billion Euro for county and local road investments – less
than a third of what is required in the sector.

103. Even assuming that county councils would allocate all their capital investments
for 2014-2022 for the rehabilitation of county and communal roads, there would still be
a shortfall. In the 2014 World Bank report on Project Selection Models for the Regional
Operational Programme 2014-2020, Victor Giosan and Graham Glenday have developed a
simple but elegant methodology for assessing the absorption capacity of sub-national
authorities. In short, they have postulated that over a longer period of time, sub-national
authorities should not allocate more than 30% of their non-earmarked revenues for new
capital investments, to avoid being in a situation where they cannot cover the operation
and maintenance costs for these investments. The team has done the calculations and, for
the 2014-2022 period, it is prudent for county councils to allocate only around EUR 5.9
billion for capital investments. Assuming that all these funds will be allocated for the
rehabilitation of county roads, there may still be a shortfall in funding.

104. Given the limited resources, investments from the PNDL should focus on
maximizing impact. Thus, priority should be given to county roads that improve
accessibility to the growth poles, within a 60 minute access area, and to the county
residences, within a 40 minute access area. The two maps below highlight those county
roads.
           Figure 7. County roads connecting to a growth pole within a 60 -minute access area




                                                                                                42
         Figure 8. County roads connecting to a county residence within a 40-minute access area




105. Ideally, the selection of PNDL road projects in the future would be done taking
such impact criteria into consideration. These prioritization criteria could also be used to
guide the investment portfolio of the county councils. Moreover, the different investment
programmes in Romania should coordinate their approaches and ensure that they
undertake work in a complementary fashion. Component 1 of the current work program,
on the “Alignment and coordination of strategies and processes for public investments, ”
discusses these issues of coordination in more detail.

106. Currently, there is no clear strategy for how PNDL finances road investment. As
the map below highlights, PNDL has financed both county roads and communal roads
throughout Romania, without following a discernable pattern. Moreover, the large
majority of financed projects are relatively small in scale.




                                                                                                  43
                Figure 9. County and communal roads financed through PNDL 2014




107. Moreover, it is does not seem that PNDL investments in county roads are
coordinated with similar investments done under the ROP 2007-2013. As the map below
highlights, with a few exceptions (such as County Road 682, connecting to Arad, and
spanning Arad and Timiș Counties), county road investments under the ROP and the PNDL
seem to be done independently of each other. Improved integrated planning in the future
may ensure that the funds channeled through these two programmes will achieve a higher
overall impact.




                                                                                          44
                      Figure 10. County Roads coordination btw. ROP and PNDL




108. The evaluation and selection grids for ROP Axis 3 (DMI 3.1 and DMI 3.4) are also
split into two major sections: 1) contribution of the project to the realization of the ROP;
2) quality, maturity, and sustainability of the project. The criteria listed under the first
section take into consideration the relevance of the project for the objectives of the
Priority Axis and of the intervention area, the extent to which there is a real need for
education infrastructure or a problem in this sector at the level of the territory where it is
implemented (only for DMI 3.4), and the importance of the project for the region. The
criteria listed under the second section take into consideration the degree of
preparedness/maturity of the project, the implementation methodology, documentation
coherence (Feasibility study), the technical solution, the necessity for co-financing, the
budget of the project, environmental protection and energy efficiency, equal opportunities
and non-discrimination, information society (only for DMI 3.4), the applicant’s capacity to
monitor the project implementation and project sustainability at the end of non-
reimbursable funding.


The Sectoral Operational Programme Environment 2007-2013
109. The selection of projects under the SOP Environment 2007-2013 is done in a
more normative way than ROP 2007-2013 investments. In essence, Regional Water
Masterplans have been developed for the areas covered by Regional Operating
Companies, and these masterplans include the key targeted areas. Since projects are pre-




                                                                                                 45
selected there is no formal prioritization. However, each submitted project, in order to
receive financing has t0 first be analyzed using a Project Checklist (see Annex 5).

110. The Regional Water Masterplans lay out the priority investment needs to ensure
that the EU Water Acquis is fulfilled by 2018 with the lowest possible costs. As such, all
water and wastewater investments should follow these masterplans, including
investments from the PNDL and from PNDR. Moreover, localities or Intercommunity
Development Associations (IDAs) that wish to invest in this sector should ideally enter the
IDA established around the Regional Operating Company (ROC) and should cede operation
of the new system to the ROC once the investment is completed. This ensures an
integrated approach, higher efficiency rates in operation, financial sustainability, and
economies of scale. Investments outside the designated agglomerations and clusters in the
masterplans should only be allowed when applicants can prove that they have enough
resources to operate and maintain the new investment, and only if the technologies and
solutions proposed conform to the Water Law No. 107/1996 (the transposed version of
the EC Water Framework Directive).

111. Given the large gap remaining to fulfill the EU Water Acquis, it is very important
for public authorities in Romania to prioritize investments in this sector. As discussed
earlier, the estimated cost to fulfill the EU Acquis by 2018 was placed at around EUR 19
billion. Of this sum, only 3.2 billion was covered by the SOP Environment 2007-2013. Large
Infrastructure OP 2014-2020 will likely have a substantial allocation for investments in
water and wastewater between 2014 and 2020, but most likely not more than the 2007-
2013 allocation. This means that the PNDL and the PNDR, as well as other potential
investment programs in Romania, will have to supplement these sums to ensure that
Romania will not be in a situation of facing infringement procedures in 2015 and 2018.
Among other things, this may require to have a larger PNDL and PNDR allocation to water
and wastewater projects, at least for 2015-2018, to the detriment of other type of
investment projects (e.g., roads). Ultimately, every Euro that Romania will have to pay as
penalty for not fulfilling the Water Acquis will represent money that cannot be used for
other infrastructure investment projects.

The National Rural Development Programme (PNDR) 2007-2013
112. The evaluation and selection of PNDR projects is done on a competitive basis. For
its part, the ROP 2007-2013 did project selection on a first-come first-serve (FIFO) basis.
Projects would be evaluated based on when they were received for analysis and would
move on to the next stage if the project scored at least a 3.5 points (out of 6 points) on the
technical and financial evaluation grid. For the PNDR, only the projects with the highest
score within a given call for proposals allocation would be financed. The projects would be
scored using an evaluation grid and could receive a total of 100 points. Annex 6 includes
the evaluation grid used by PNDR for Measure 322.

113. Interestingly, the evaluation criteria for all types of investments that can be done
under this measure are clustered together. Thus, the same evaluation sheet is used for




                                                                                                 46
road, water, wastewater, and social infrastructure projects. One of the reasons for this
clustering is a purposeful encouragement of integrated projects, which include more than
one type of project. Thus, locality or IDAs that submit an integrated project also are likely
to receive a higher score than applicants that only submit an individual project.

114. The criteria used to score projects are relatively simple and straightforward. For
example, 10 points can be obtained if the commune has not benefited from EU funds in
the past. 5 to 10 points can be obtained based on the poverty index registered in the
commune. 5 points are offered if the project is part of a local or county development
strategy. 5 points are offered for integrated projects. 15 points are offered for a
water/wastewater project if the project is part of the Regional Water Masterplan. 5 points
are offered for water/wastewater projects that are in an area with insufficient water or an
area with a high incidence of droughts. 5 points are offered for water/wastewater projects
that are in an area with high pollution or an area where the aquifer has a high
concentration of nitrates. 25 points are offered for road projects that enable connection to
main transport links (county or national roads, railways, and waterways). 5 to 10 points
can be obtained for social infrastructure projects. And 5 to 10 points can be obtained for
cultural heritage projects.

115. From the way these criteria are designed there is a definite bias toward road
projects. In fact, out of 802 projects contracted under Measure 322, 623 had a road
component. By comparison, only 372 of the projects had a water or wastewater
component. Given the need to fulfill the EU Water Acquis by 2018, it may pay off to think
about developing evaluation and selection criteria that encourage more water and
wastewater project. For example, water and wastewater projects that are part of the
Regional Water Masterplan can receive 25 points, while road projects may receive only a
maximum of 15 points.

116. Elements of the evaluation and selection criteria used by PNDR could also be
considered for the PNDL. These criteria are simple enough and using similar criteria could
help coordinate efforts under the two programs. It would be important, however, to lay
out rules for making the two programs complementary, and to ensure that there are no
overlaps. The three figures below provide quick snapshots of the overlaps (in red) for
investments in roads, water, and wastewater. Overlaps for roads are particularly
noteworthy.




                                                                                                47

Implementation
117. All Operational Programmes have a clear procedure for the monitoring of project
implementation. In the case of the ROP 2007-2013, the intermediate bodies (IBs) assign a
monitoring officer (MO) to each approved project. The MOs conduct regular monitoring
visits on site and serve as liaisons for any issues that may arise during the implementation
phase. The Managing Authority (MA) also conducts regular monitoring missions, but only
for a sample of projects. The arrangements for SOP Environment 2007-2013 are similar to
the ROP’s, with Intermediate Bodies acting as the main interface between the Ministry of
Environment (as the program’s Managing Authority) and beneficiaries. As under the ROP,
IBs also play the main role in verifying reimbursement requests against the physical
progress of financed projects. They also signal any potential issues or irregularities to the
MA. Finally, for the PNDR, the Agency for Financing Rural Investments (APDRP), a central-
level body that essentially acts as an IB for MA within the Ministry of Agriculture, carries
out field verifications. In addition to all this, the National Audit Authority performs its own
verifications of EU-funded interventions, also based on a risk-adjusted sampling
methodology.

118. In a similar vein, once reimbursement requests are verified, payments are made
to beneficiaries through a third-party, central-level agency. Per EU regulations, every MA
has the right to verify the implementation of the program and answers to the EU
authorities for any potential irregularities.




                                                                                                  49
Post-Implementation
119. All EU-funded programs rely on clear ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
systems, including program and project-level indicators. A good M&E system serves
several purposes. For one, it helps track the performance of a specific project and the
extent to which this project has reached its output indicators – this is a mandatory task
that the European Commission requires of all Operational Programmes. However, in
addition to what the EC asks for, a good M&E system can help evaluate if projects, and the
overall program that finances them, have achieved planned outcomes, and if they have
had an actual development impact. It is particularly important to have a set of SMART
indicators – specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. The general trend,
at the EU level and in the broader development arena, is to adopt outcome measures (i.e.,
actual impact) as opposed to simple output indicators (e.g., number of kilometers of roads,
etc.).

120. At the same time, the M&E system of EU-funded instruments relies on a complex
institutional set-up, centered on a Monitoring Committee (MC). The MC brings together a
variety of stakeholders involved (MA and IB staff, beneficiary representatives, etc.) and is
led by the ministry that oversees a particular program. For the 2007-2013 programming
period, the functions of MCs have been drawn in accordance to EC Regulation 1083/2006,
which mandates these bodies to ensure the effectiveness and quality of program
implementation.

Chapter IV: Assessment and Policy Measures for the Overall PNDL Project
Selection Model

121. This chapter reviews the overall PNDL project selection model and proposes
policy measures for improvement. All key phases of the program are covered, from
preparation through the application phase, selection and prioritization, implementation,
and post-implementation. Importantly, the sub-section on prioritization is just a preview
for the next chapter, which focuses specifically on the main topic of this final report –
namely, how to improve the prioritization of proposals submitted for PNDL financing for all
the main types of investments (roads, water and wastewater, and social infrastructure).

122. The policy measures proposed below are based on several sources. These include:
observations regarding the implementation of EU-funded programs, particularly the
Regional Operational Programme 2007-2013, which was evaluated by a World Bank team
in 2012-2014; multiple rounds of interviews with PNDL management; a limited number of
field interviews conducted between September 8 and 26, 2014 with county councils (Cluj,
Bistrița Năsăud, and Sălaj) and 6 communes in the three aforementioned counties; and
review of 159 projects (at the feasibility study/DALI phase), which took place between July
14 -November 18, 2014:

123. Before going into the assessment of actual steps involved in the PNDL’s project
cycle, it is important to consider the current program’s structure. Under the current
system, there are only two links in the PNDL chain: applicants/beneficiaries and the
MRDPA. This differs from the typical institutional structure of EU-funded instruments,
where there is an additional Intermediate Body (IB), which can shoulder some of the
operational burden, allowing the MA to focus on strategic tasks. One could say that county
councils are de facto intermediate bodies (e.g., they collect project proposals from local
authorities and propose a priority list), but there is no formal institutional set-up in this
direction.



26
  See Annex 7 for a detailed description of the proposed guidelines on the selection of projects’
technical documentation to be screened as part of the current project.



                                                                                                    51
124. Currently, the MRDPA faces strict capacity constraints given its limited staff and
long list of tasks that need to be completed. All evaluations of proposals are done
internally by the technical unit of the DG RDI, while the Technical Economic Council (TEC) is
no longer involved in the decision-making – precisely because, previously, TEC decisions
generated long delays before the contracting phase. At the same time, the technical unit
has only a small staff, with a multitude of responsibilities and typically no access to salary
bonus schemes as available for public servants involved in the management of EU-funded
projects. The low capacity may also explain why the PNDL has chosen a simple evaluation
and selection model, with as few hurdles as possible.

125. The MRDPA is, essentially, the Managing Authority (MA) of the PNDL, the key
actor in charge with the program’s management and implementation. In this capacity, it
should focus most of its efforts on strategic tasks related to vision-setting, high-level
planning and coordination, program-level monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and only
sample-based verifications at the project level. In other words, DG RDI – particularly given
its low operational capacity – should concentrate on the key elements of the program,
where it can add a lot of value, as opposed to the nitty-gritty, day-to-day implementation
work such as project-specific actions (evaluations, notifications, verifications, answering
questions, etc.).

126. The following sections make several proposals for relying more on County
Councils at the county level and, to the extent possible, on Regional Development
Agencies at the regional level. These actors need not necessarily become formal
“Intermediate Bodies” of the PNDL, but they can collaborate with the MRDPA to take on
some of the day-to-day tasks and free up capacity within DG RDI. In particular, by lacking
effective IBs in the current centralized structure, the MRDPA cannot always stay close to
the applicants and beneficiaries of the program. There is a need to delegate operational
and beneficiary support tasks to a lower administrative level – most likely, County Councils,
as the program is designed and implemented at the county level. Of course, this would run
somewhat contrary to the recent trend of centralizing program management and
implementation at the MRDPA level (as noted elsewhere, applicants can now submit
proposals directly to the ministry, without going through the respective County Council
first). But it is still advisable to separate strategic from operational tasks and allow the
MRDPA to focus on the former, reducing the administrative burden it currently faces and
relying more on County Councils for program implementation. To respond to the need for
strict oversight from the central level, the MRDPA should design clear procedures for
verifying that County Councils act according to the set PNDL priorities and abide by the
agreed selection and prioritization criteria in allocating funding. In any case, under the
framework proposed in this report, there should be very limited room for subjective
decisions on which projects receive funding in a given year; the algorithm, set at the central
level, needs to be rigorously followed at the County Council / IB level, and monitoring by
the MRDPA will simply focus on determining whether there are any deviations from the
agreed methodology.

1) The MRDPA Prepares the Program
127. The MRDPA established the PNDL in 2013 taking into account high -level
government priorities and the need to improve coordination of investments. Chapter II
has described in depth how the PNDL came about in the context of the challenges facing
PNDI, initiated under a previous administration. The PNDL’s foundations were laid through
the Governing Program 2013-2016, which set as a core priority the financing of a basic
package of services for rural areas, including roads, drinking water, sanitation, social
infrastructure, etc. for achieving “minimum standards of living [everywhere in Romania].” 27
In early 2013, the government also felt the need to unify in one program various previous
investment efforts funded at the central level, mostly by the MRDPA. It is thus safe to say
that the PNDL emerged as a top-down priority. This is not to say that the local level did not
seek funding for infrastructure projects, but extensive consultations on the structure, goals,
and implementation of the PNDL did not take place. This shortcoming should be addressed
in future efforts to improve the program.


1.1. Conduct consultations to inform program design
128. Indeed, effective investment programs should be based on a highly participatory
strategic planning process, with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. For one,
this ensures that the program is well targeted and actually able to address development
needs on the ground. If rural communities need roads, water, and sanitation systems, a

program centered on, say, research centers for villages would waste precious resources. To
be able to respond to actual needs, the central government should listen to local
communities and involve them actively in the planning process, in addition to drawing from
local development strategies. Importantly, in the case of the PNDL, programming may not
need to happen annually, though under the current system the budgets are set every year
(the sections below call for multi-year budgeting). That said, after a number of years of
implementation (e.g., seven years in the case of EU-funded programs), the original strategy
of the program should be revisited and updated to reflect evolving needs.

129. In addition to helping define eligible project types, early inputs from future
applicants and beneficiaries can help refine operational procedures , smoothing the
implementation process down the road. For example, draft application forms,
reimbursement requests, progress reports, and other key documents may be circulated
before a program’s official launch. Certain required data may not be available at the level
of local authorities or they may require special efforts to collect them, exceeding the
capacity of a local council. Consultation sessions, surveys, and focus groups with various
local actors (e.g., local governments, NGOs, etc.) should test different options of program
procedures, allowing the MRDPA to choose the design that best fits the needs of the PNDL
and the capacity of future beneficiaries. Again, bottom-up consultations need not take
place every year; in fact, PNDL procedures should stay as stable and as predictable as
possible from year to year. Every so often, however, the MRDPA can seek feedback from
beneficiaries to increase the efficiency of processes.

130. The implication for the current PNDL is to build into the program institutionalized
mechanisms for consultations and feedback loops. This can be done through County
Councils at the level of each county and through Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in
each of Romania’s eight development regions. These actors can collect ideas and
general/specific feedback from the local level, ensuring that the PNDL’s design and
programming is in line with actual needs. Consultations should be open, transparent, and
predictable in terms of scheduling, review of comments submitted, and final decisions on
program design. In addition, associative structures of local public administrations
(Association of Towns, Association of Communes, National Union of County Councils) could
be mobilized for consultation/feed-back on the PNDL. To enable such a communication
process, the Ministry may develop a simple standard template form, requesting input on
the design of the PNDL before the actual launch of the program.

1.2. Run awareness-raising and information campaigns
131. Simply put, an investment program cannot be successful if potential applicants
do not know about the opportunity to seek financing. For the PNDL in particular,
awareness-raising activities need not be very complex, particularly given that eligible
beneficiaries are only public authorities or associations of local governments (i.e.,
Intercommunity Development Associations). Mass campaigns are not required in this case,
but the MRDPA should still try to inform all local authorities about the possibility of
applying for PNDL funds. This can be done through targeted messages distributed through



                                                                                              54
official channels, which has been the main awareness-raising channel to date. Some EU-
funded programs also organize regional info sessions to present funding opportunities to
larger audiences. A similar format could also work for the PNDL, possibly organized in each
of the eight planning regions with the help of Regional Development Agencies (RDAs),
which already have experience with such events for the ROP 2007-2013. To date there
have been no similar info sessions for the PNDL.

132. On a related note, efforts aimed at increasing a program’s legitimacy can also
result in higher awareness and stronger commitment to follow through with an actual
application. While a potential applicant (local government) may be informed of the
opportunity, the mayor may decide not to submit an application if he/she does not trust
the validity and fairness of the evaluation and selection process. Particularly in the case of
state-funded programs, special efforts may be needed to establish and communicate clear
and transparent procedures, implemented against a set timetable. By boosting the
legitimacy and appeal of programs like the PNDL, the ministry can help ensure that the best
possible projects are put forth for consideration. Such a mechanism would also help
dismiss perceived concerns about funding allocations based on criteria other than the
formally agreed ones.


1.3. Design a pre-application filter for PNDL proposals
133. Pipeline development efforts go beyond awareness raising, involving active
engagement and one-on-one exchanges with potential beneficiaries. A recommended
practice is to never simply turn down a project proposal, but to have a basic filter in place
to sort through eligible and ineligible projects, early on in the process. Applicants,
particularly those from small communities with limited resources, should not go through
the trouble and expense of putting together a full application that will eventually be
deemed as ineligible by the county council or the MRDPA. This is not only inefficient and
discouraging for the applicant, it is also over-burdening the pipeline of projects, diverting
resources away from high-quality, eligible projects. In addition to explaining program
requirements clearly during information sessions and offering the option of an informal
opinion on an idea’s eligibility before the application is put together, an easy, automated
electronic validation could be made available to all interested applicants (for instance, on
the official MRDPA website). Other Member States have experimented with pre-
application filters, which would be particularly useful for improving the coordination and
leveraging synergies between EU and state-funded investments.

134. Specifically, PNDL applicants should first submit an Expression of Interest (or
Letter of Intent), with a few basic data on the proposed project. Based on this initial
document, the MRDPA – under the current structure – or the respective County Council (in
a decentralized framework) can advise the applicant on whether to pursue PNDL funding
further or seek alternative sources. This would reduce workloads at the level of both local
authorities and the program management: the former would only submit full applications
for projects that may actually be suitable for PNDL funds, while the pipeline of applications
would become more narrowly focused on viable proposals.



                                                                                                 55
1.4. Appoint Liaison Persons (LPs) to support potential beneficiaries
135. The PNDL should support County Councils to designate a specific liaison person
(LP) who can advise local authorities on the types of projects that may be eligible for
state budget and/or EU funding. Instead of trying to cover the needs of the entire country
through its own staff – currently facing capacity constraints already – the MRDPA can
delegate such tasks to County Councils, which can act as “intermediate bodies” and as the
interface of the program for local (town and commune) authorities. Of course, this would
also require tweaking the current system to prevent any conflicts of interest; specifically,
under the status quo County Councils also get financed from the same pool of PNDL funds.
A solution mentioned earlier is to allocate a specific pool of funds for county-level projects,
which should be evaluated and prioritized only at the MRDPA level; by contrast, the
prioritization of local-level projects within a particular county could be kept at the county
council level.

136. The LP would be able to act as an advisor to the potential applicant, providing
informal guidance on project feasibility, eligibility, and alignment with program and
regional-level goals. To be sure, the LP should not be involved in any way in the project’s
evaluation, upholding the principle of the so-called Chinese walls (or paper walls) to
preserve the process’ confidentiality and fairness. Such contact points exist in multiple
other Member States, including Scotland and Wales (United Kingdom), as well as Flanders
(Belgium). 28 There is also an opportunity to collaborate closely and rely more on business
groups, nonprofit coalitions, and associations of public authorities (e.g., the Association of
Romanian Municipalities and the Union of Romanian County Councils). Examples from
France and Austria demonstrate that networks of knowledgeable peers can be highly
successful in “mediating between different actors and offering support packages
comprising domestic and EU funds.” 29

137. RDAs at the regional level can also se rve as sounding boards for local authorities’
ideas and incipient infrastructure development projects. As noted earlier, this option
would enable the MRDPA to concentrate its limited staff on the truly strategic, high-level
tasks (e.g., programming, overall monitoring, etc.). RDAs, particularly for the urban
settlements – with which they collaborate under the ROP – are much closer to the ground
and can more easily fulfill the role of actively developing the pipeline of PNDL projects. For
example, in the case of the ROP, some RDA representatives have taken on the active role of
facilitator by trying to bring multiple local authorities together to define projects spanning
multiple jurisdictions and generating truly region-wide effects.

138. Having clear responsibilities assigned to an LP at the County Council and/or RDA
level can also help with a coordinated, integrated, and sustainable implementation
process. The issue of sustainability is of special concern, as project proposals are often
lacking high-quality assessments of costs and benefits, particularly when it comes to
estimating operations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Stronger support in the pre-
application phase could help ensure that potential beneficiaries consider all relevant
aspects of planned investments and prioritize them based on the full picture of expected
returns, ensuring that they can continue to maintain a particular investment.

1.5. Organize training sessions to help applicants prepare better projects
139. Finally, it is recommended to provide training to potential beneficiaries,
particularly around how to properly fill out the financing proposal and how to prevent
pitfalls during implementation. If more applicants prepare complete and correct forms in
the pre-application phase, less work will be generated downstream for MRDPA staff to
verify the documentation. More substantially, the MRDPA could also promote a set of good
practices with respect to the technical solutions and technologies to be deployed. These
are now often chosen by designers without further guidance from local authorities, which
have neither the capacity, nor the technical skills to know what to ask from designers and
other service providers. 30 By training potential applicants early on – which is feasible, given
that the “universe” of potential beneficiaries is known and limited, i.e., comprising all local
public authorities – the MRDPA could contribute to better project designs and a smoother
implementation.

2) Applicants Develop Initial Technical Documentation
140. In the pre-application phase, initial project preparation by local authorities
includes the feasibility studies for new investments or the DALI for modernizing existing
infrastructure. Why does this matter for project selection? And what could the MRDPA do
to improve a process that lies almost entirely in the hands of local authorities? The first
question is easier to tackle: a proposal with poor-quality, incomplete technical
documentation will not pass the evaluation phase, or may incur significant delays resulting
from repeated exchanges between the team of evaluators, local authorities, and designers.
Moreover, inadequate technical documentation can create significant problems during the
implementation phase – from delays to significant additional (non-eligible) costs. It is well
known that in Romania the poor quality of technical documentation for infrastructure
projects is a frequent issue experienced by local authorities.


2.1. Avoid contracting design of technical documentations centrally
141. First off, it is not recommended to revert to the solution deployed in the past,
which involved financing the development of technical documentation centrally, without

a direct link to local authorities. Specifically, Government Decision 811/2006 mandated
the then Ministry of European Integration (MEI) to finance the preparation of project
documentation to be financed from the ROP 2007-2013. These were actually “back-up
projects” inherited from the PHARE CES 2004 -2006 program. Several problems emerged
from this set-up: technical experts contracted by MEI elaborated the documentation
without paying much attention to why the projects had scored poorly in the initial
evaluation; also, in 2006, the list of eligible expenditures had not yet been issued for the
ROP, so the beneficiaries ended up incurring significant non-eligible expenses during the
implementation phase. Moreover, this documentation was generally of poor quality, but
beneficiaries had little opportunity to correct it, both because of lack of capacity and lack of
time: when they received the technical projects financed by the MEI, they rushed to apply
to the recently launched ROP. It is recommended that such situations be avoided in the
future.


2.2. Promote improved contracts to hold service providers accountable
142. Indeed, the PNDL explicitly notes that the costs of preparing feasibility studies
are not eligible for financing through the program, so local authorities remain in charge
of developing this documentation. Still, even when beneficiaries contract technical experts
directly, the overall quality of technical documentation tends to be unsatisfactory as a
result of lack of proper accountability mechanisms. Under current legislation, designers are
only liable in extreme circumstances (e.g., a building collapses as a result of a faulty
project). This should be amended to cover errors and poor-quality work, even if discovered
after the project is received by beneficiaries. 31 All beneficiaries would benefit from an
internal quality control system, but this often hard to achieve in practice.

143. While some designers are poorly trained and often lack time to develop solid
technical projects, public authorities also lack the capacity to draft strong contracts and
properly verify submitted documentation. This is particularly true in the case of small
communities with very limited budgets – the typical PNDL beneficiary has very few
employees and cannot afford to hire qualified civil engineers. There are also technical
project verifiers, who should be contracted directly by beneficiaries and look out for their
best interest, in accordance with currently applicable legislation (Law 10/1995 for quality of
construction works). In practice, numerous beneficiaries receive technical documentation
already stamped with the seal of approval of a verifier, paid by the designer of the same
project. Such situations can be avoided through more rigorous contracts that hold parties
accountable for errors at every step of the chain (beneficiaries for failing to abide by law 10
for quality in construction works; technical experts for any clear mistakes in the project;
verifiers for approving faulty documentation; engineers for not supervising work progress



31
   The World Bank Report on “ROP 2.0: Beneficiary Support Mechanisms for the Regional
Operational Programme 2014-2020” includes a full set of measures needed to hold designers
accountable. These largely depend on legislative amendments, so they exceed the MRDPA’s area of
direct of direct influence.



                                                                                                   58
properly, etc.). Also, it should be mandatory to have a separate contract for the
supervisors.

144. The MRDPA should seek to help beneficiaries of PNDL and of other investment
programs avoid discrepancies between the technical documentation and the situation on
the ground. The solution is to support the introduction of standard contracts. These would
be part of the public procurement documentation and help ensure that qualified,
professional bidders enter the competition. Good practices would include the following:
        A clear stipulation of the designer’s responsibility to deliver a high -quality output :
         This would include applicable fines and sanctions in the eventuality of clear
         mistakes that can be attributed to the design team. One requirement could be to
         have professional insurance for designers, which some beneficiaries are already
         beginning to request through the contract form. There are existing companies that
         will provide this type of professional insurance. Over the long-term, insurance
         schemes are particularly helpful for rewarding competent service providers and
         penalizing those who deliver inadequate technical documentation. In addition, an
         independent supervisor can ensure that work is done up to standard.
        A complete timeline for every deliverable, including payment terms : Some
         beneficiaries are already applying a system of payments in tranches, making sure
         that the designer only receives the last payment when the project is successfully
         completed. This ensures that technical designers stay close to beneficiaries
         throughout the implementation phase and collaborate with engineers and
         construction crews in order to find optimal solutions.
        Clear requirements that all property rights over the technical documentation belong
         to the beneficiary. In some cases where this was not explicit in the contract,
         designers have refused to allow any changes to the projects, invoking proprietary
         rights over the delivered content, despite the fact that they had been paid for a
         particular output.
Importantly, these principles apply not only for the pre-feasibility and feasibility stages, but
also for the detailed technical design, which is usually developed after the contract is
signed and the financing is secured.

2.3. Revise the policy on cost standards
145. Implementation of cost standards for infrastructure is imperfect has posed
challenges to beneficiaries. The intentions for deploying the cost standards are
praiseworthy as a solution for keeping project costs under control. The problem is that
current cost standards are not sufficiently developed and, in some cases (i.e., wastewater
systems), they do not exist at all. 32 They also do not reflect updated nominal values (i.e.



32
  The MRDPA currently uses instead a rule of thumb whereby cost standards for wastewater systems are
roughly 1.5 times the cost standards for water supply systems.



                                                                                                    59
values have not been adjusted for inflation since 2010), and it is also unclear if comparisons
between project values and cost standards should reflect RON or EUR values.

146. Although the technical solutions included in the legislation on standard costs
(particularly for the road infrastructure) are just a recommendation, they are adopted by
all applicants. Designers thus choose lower-quality, cheaper, less efficient technologies,
which may result in higher long-term costs. In this context, it is challenging to adopt
new/greener technologies that may come at a premium cost upfront, but which may be
cheaper over the long term (e.g., if one takes life-cycle costing into consideration).

147. Cost standards should be updated, made optional, or waived completely. In the
latter scenario, the authorities could use instead a list of reference prices denominated in
EUR to make sure that costs are kept under control. In any case, technical solutions
proposed should be only indicative and designers/beneficiaries should be properly
informed that they may adopt alternative options that are superior in terms of short/long-
term costs and quality. The intermediary reports focused on the MRDPA’s portfolio of
projects and the dissemination of efficient technical designs (both due on December 26,
2014) expand on these technical observations.

3) Local/County Councils Submit Applications to the MRDPA
148. The application package for the PNDL includes a basic form with simple
information about the local authority (i.e., the applicant) and the technical
documentation for the proposed project. There is room for improvement in terms of both
enhancing the conformity of submitted applications and increasing the clarity of the entire
process for applicants.

3.1. Improve conformity of PNDL applications submitted to the MRDPA
149. For the PNDL specifically, a Bank team of technical evaluators has performed a
screening of a sample of applications and has developed an inventory of common issues
and corresponding solutions. This screening exercise was designed to help the team
familiarize itself with the PNDL projects and corresponding technical documentation, and
to identify potential issues that may need to be addressed in a future improved project
selection model. The box below outlines a number of key issues that applicants to the PNDL
should take into consideration when preparing the technical documentation. The
recommendations are meant to be practical, allowing on the one hand applicants to
develop better technical documentations, and reducing the time required by the MRDPA
team to review these documentations (e.g., it may eliminate in some cases the need for
requesting clarifications from applicants).




                                                                                                 60
        Box 2. Recommendations for improving applicants’ technical documentation

 1. Type of documentation & annexes
       Roads: Choose carefully between the feasibility study (FS) and the DALI. For modernization works
         of existing infrastructure, always pick the DALI
       Water and wastewater: For new projects aimed at building new infrastructure, the FS is required.
         For existing/ongoing projects (with new investment components), the SF and the technical
         expertise shall be submitted. For modernization of current infrastructure the DALI shall be
         prepared
       Update specialty studies and technical expertise studies
       Include the geotechnical study with proper seal of approval (“verificat la cerința Af”)
       If the detailed technical design is available and is submitted, also include the FS/DALI. Also include
         the project verifiers’ notes, for each specialty
       Include all documents needed to prove/establish ownership of new/modernized infrastructure
       Include the “urbanism certificate” with all corresponding permits required *
 2. Content of documentation
      Make sure that the description of the need and opportunity for the investment fulfils the
         requirements of GD 28/2008 (Annex 2)
      Include information of how the project correlates/fits under local/regional/national strategies in
         the relevant sector
      Develop the cost-benefit analysis in accordance with the EU Guide (as part of FS and only for those
         applications that require FS)
      Make explicit the commitment to operate and maintain the project upon completion
 3. Local/County Council Decision
       Make sure the decision explicitly mentions the co-financing amount
       Make sure to include in the decision the key technical-economic indicators
 4. Budget
      Check that respective expenses are within the GD 363/2010 limits on cost standards
      Include sources of financing along wi th the overall budget (“deviz general”)
 *Note: The urbanism certificate should not be released by the relevant authority without the
 permits/approvals required for the construction permit (requires amendment to Law 50/1991).



150. To preempt the request for revision of technical documentation, the Checklist in
Annex 9 could be sent to PNDL applicants and published on MRDPA website. The
checklist includes a number of common issues and mistakes that were identified as part of
the evaluation of the 159 technical documentations with a funding decision for 2014. The
team will also organize site-visits to discuss directly with the applicants what kind of
problems they are facing with applications, their processing and how their technical
documentation can be improved. Ultimately, it is hoped that on one hand applicants will be
able to improve quality of their proposals, while the staff of the MRDPA dealing with NDPL
will enhance their capacity to carry on the task of evaluating and selecting projects for the
rest of the projects with completed and submitted technical documentation.




                                                                                                          61
3.2. Develop and publish a PNDL Applicant Guide
151. The key instrument for supporting potential beneficiaries in the process of
putting together and submitting a financing request is the “Applicant Guide.” Indeed, this
serves to orient the applicant throughout the process. In the case of the ROP 2007-2013,
the applicant guide includes the following: general overview of the ROP/priority
axis/intervention area; applicable rules for the financing application (eligibility and
selection criteria, filling out and submitting the documentation, evaluation and selection
processes); pre-contracting conditions (e.g., technical documentation, field visit);
beneficiary rights and obligations; and annexes (forms, verification checklists, etc.).
Additionally, the guide also includes templates of the typical documents that would be
required during the implementation phase for applicants who move forward in the
process: prefinancing request, reimbursement request, and progress report. For the PNDL,
a significant improvement would be to create a similar guide and then distribute it to all
local authorities that may become beneficiaries of the program. To reduce costs, the
document could be developed only in electronic form; many of the templates to be used
for the project (e.g., for reimbursement requests) would need to be filled out digitally, in
any case.

152. In addition to clarity and comprehensiveness, the PNDL applicant guide should
ensure a predictable framework for the program’s implementation. In this sense, the
PNDL should avoid the issues created in 2007-2013 by applicant guides for EU-funded
programs, which suffered multiple changes. Rules and standards should be relatively stable
across time, at least over the duration of a single application period. If this principle is not
followed, it risks creating confusion, delays, and inefficiencies, in addition to an uneven
playing field for different applicants.

3.3. Define a reasonable list of eligible expenditures
153. Another key element relevant for this phase refers to eligible and non -eligible
expenditures. It is a good idea for programs to adopt a flexible approach, refraining from
defining every single item that may or may not be eligible for financing, particularly if there
are no other superseding regulations (e.g., EU-level requirements on what can be
expensed).

154. In Romania, Government Decision 28/2008 already defines all the major
categories of expenses that can be incurred by an infrastructure project. EU structural
funds, particularly the ROP 2007-2013, have demonstrated the risk of “over-regulating”
through additional provisions (e.g., in the ROP’s case, a minister’s ord er) what counts as
eligible/non-eligible expenditures. For instance: chairs in classrooms upgraded under the
ROP are not eligible for ROP support, but tables, computers, maps, and other equipment
are covered; alleys and benches in front of health centers for elderly people are other
ineligible expenses, as are a range of permits and authorizations. These items, while clearly
related to the financed investment, have had be paid out of pocket by beneficiaries
because they were specifically included in the Order of Eligible Expenditures.




                                                                                                   62
155. Because the PNDL is in its entirety a state-budget-funded program, with money
coming essentially from the same source, there is no reason to over-regulate beyond GD
28/2008. Currently, the methodological norms specify a list of non-eligible expenditures
(article 8 (3)), including feasibility studies, specialty studies, technical assistance, taxes, etc.
The list, as it stands, is clearly a better option than what was deployed under the ROP 2007-
2013, which defined what can be financed, excluding by default anything that was not
specifically mentioned in the Order of Eligible Expenditures. In other words, it is better to
define what does not qualify for reimbursement, as currently under the PNDL. It may still
be worth however to look at the list of non-eligible expenditures and decide whether it
would warrant an extension.


3.4. Establish a permanent helpdesk
156. Establishing a helpdesk function is critical for ensuring a smooth application
process. Given the MRDPA’s limited capacity, it is important to not over-burden DG RDI
staff with questions and requests from applicants. Some EU-funded programs have chosen
to allocate a limited number of staff to a helpdesk unit, which is available at all times to
clarity any applicant concerns that may arise. The PNDL should consider adopting this good
practice particularly for the application phase, at least as a pilot initiative at first.

157. Relatively cost efficient solutions exist to communicate with applicants through
online tracking platforms. For instance, a simple portal could be developed for local
authorities to access for checking the status of their PNDL application. The same portal
used to track the application progress should provide information on how long each stage
is supposed to take, when its completion can be expected, potential causes for delays, and
what, if any, further clarifications are needed. It would also be useful to publish real-time
information to the general public on the list of projects that are waiting to be contracted
and on those that have been contracted.

3.5. Clarify conditions for submission of applications directly to MRDPA
158. The current PNDL framework notes that applicants may submit applications
directly to the MRDPA under “special circumstances.” The law leaves room for
interpretation regarding “special circumstances” in which a local authority may bypass the
corresponding county council and submit the documentation directly to the Ministry. This
alternative was presumably introduced to allow local authorities that have divergent
positions (politically) from a County Council to apply directly to the MRDPA. But this runs
the risk of introducing double standards. All applicants should go through the same
process: if the ministry does not think that county councils can treat all applications
equally, then it should centralize all submissions to ensure a level playing field, along with
measures to increase the transparency of the process. An appeal system may be
considered, to enable applicants to contest certain decisions.




                                                                                                       63
4) The MRDPA Evaluates, Selects, and Prioritizes Proposals
159. Strictly based on the current methodological norms in force, the PNDL leaves
room for improvement, particularly with respect to clarity and transparency. Because
each county council puts together its own list of proposals, in accordance with its
prioritization criterion/criteria of choice, it is unclear why some proposals get financed
instead of others. It is equally vague how the MRDPA puts together the final list of
approved projects based on the proposals received from county councils, as well as its
“own analyses.” Available data suggest that the MRDPA mainly caries out a basic
conformity and eligibility check to make sure that financing the projects proposed would
not violate any laws (e.g., on the standard costs, on the allocated budget for
implementation, etc.).

160. The actual triage of proposed projects can be done in a multiple-step process, as
detailed in the grid presented in Annex 7, which includes a mechanism for matching
investment projects with appropriate funding sources.

4.1. Exclude projects that are not recommended for any financing
161. First, the assessment process tries to determine the basic need for a project, i.e.,
whether a project should be financed at all. This does not propose to set overly restrictive
eligibility criteria. The purpose is rather to ensure that limited funds be directed to projects
that can indeed help achieve a number of set targets. In the case of water and wastewater
projects, the Regional Waster Masterplans indicate that the focus should be on
agglomerations or clusters of over 2,000 p.e. for wastewater projects, and localities of over
50 p.e. in the case of water projects. In the case of county and communal roads, given the
need for modernization and rehabilitation of existent road links, no new road links should
be funded, with the exception of bypasses. As explained above in the first section of this
chapter, this initial cut can be done on the basis of an initial Expression of Interest
submitted by an interested local authority before developing a full-fledged application.

4.2. Decide whether proposed projects are eligible for EU funding
162. Second, the selection model seeks to determine whether the proposed project
may be eligible for EU funding, which is typically preferable given the more favorable
financing conditions. Only the Managing Authority for the respective Operational
Programme can decide whether the project is ultimately eligible or not, but applicants
should be directed and encouraged to take this route before applying for PNDL support.

163. A number of basic criteria will be taken into consideration to assess the project fit
with Operational Programmes that are now in draft form for 2014-2020. In the case of
county roads, one major criteria of fit with the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020
is whether the county road actually connects to the TEN-T Network. In the case of
communal roads, a focus is on smaller projects (roads of less than 5km), with bigger
projects recommended for funding from the PNDR. In the case of water and wastewater
projects, a first check will be to determine whether the project is on the list of priority
projects for the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme 2014-2020. If so, it will be
recommended for funding under this operational program. If the project is included in the
Regional Water Masterplan, but is not on the list of priority projects for the Large
Infrastructure Operational Programme 2014-2020, it will be recommended for financing
under the PNDR.

4.3. Perform administrative check and technical & financial evaluation
164. The third step involves a more detailed assessment of the quality of the technical
documentation provided . Only projects that are assessed as generally financeable and at
the same time are considered to be non-eligible for EU funding will make it to this stage.
This includes two separate phases, as detailed below: (i) an administrative and conformity
check and (ii) a technical and financial evaluation of the submitted project.

165. Currently, the MRDPA only performs a basic conformity and eligibility check on
submitted proposals for PNDL financing, based on a form that is not available to
applicants. This checklist should be (i) improved to reflect all legal requirements and the
PNDL eligibility criteria and (ii) made publicly available so that applicants so that they start



                                                                                                   65
working on ensuring that their proposals are complete and in line with current legal
provisions. Annex 9 of this report contains an updated conformity checklist to help DG RDI
improve the verification process. The recommendations are not aimed at improving the
technical quality of documentation (e.g., choosing better/cheaper technical solutions, etc.),
but merely refer to good practices for ensuring the full administrative conformity of
proposals submitted.

166. In addition, the PNDL should include a technical and financial evaluation (TFE) of
proposed projects that are deemed to be eligible for funding. Projects that are not in full
conformity with program rules should not make it to the TFE phase. EU-funded programs
like the ROP and the PNDR provide good examples of what the TFE should consist of, as
detailed in Annexes C and D. Evaluation grids should be published along with Applicant
Guides to ensure that there is full transparency regarding how proposed projects are
reviewed. Importantly, this step in the process can be iterative: evaluators should ask for
clarifications and applicants – with the help of their consultants and designers – should be
allowed the opportunity to improve the submitted documentation. A maximum number of
clarification rounds can be set to two, as is typical for the EU-funded programs.

167. Given the timeline of the PNDL in a given year, it would make sense to explore
engaging external consultants to carry out the eligibility check and technical and financial
evaluation. Specifically, after the state budget law is passed each year, the PNDL gets a
total budget and can begin reaching out to county councils for project proposals. This
means that all proposals come in at the same time, from across the country, putting a
significant strain on the internal capacity of the MRDPA to process requests in a timely
fashion. For a few weeks at a time, the ministry could hire a set of external evaluators to
screen financing requests and work with pre-approved beneficiaries to improve submitted
proposals.


4.4. Prioritize projects based on clear, objective, and transparent criteria
168. The next chapter details a full model for the prioritization of projects within each
key sector financed by the PNDL – i.e., roads, water and wastewater systems, and social
infrastructure. At this point, it suffices to reemphasize that adopting a clear and
transparent prioritization system would be a marked improvement over the status quo. As
described in Chapter II, the current PNDL is very vague in this respect, indicating that
county councils prioritizing investments in their respective jurisdiction are to us e “at least
one” of the following criteria: signing date of the goods/work/service contract, as
applicable; physical status (% complete); population benefitting from the investment; and
the local budget’s percentage of co-financing. It is unclear which of the four criteria are
deployed and whether higher or smaller values are better (i.e., equivalent to a higher
priority). Additionally, there are no weights between the different criteria.

4.5. Set up a mechanism for field visits before contracting
169. Finally, projects that are eligible and deemed a priority for a particular funding
cycle should move forward to the contracting phase. For particularly large and/or complex



                                                                                                  66
projects, as evidenced by the documentation submitted as part of the application, the
MRDPA should conduct field visits to check the conditions on the ground for completing
proposed works. This can also be done on a random sampling basis. The idea is not only to
sanction applicants whose documents do not reflect the reality on the ground, but also to
assist them by drawing attention to particular technical and financial aspects. To maintain
the objectivity of the process and also keeping in mind the limited internal resources at the
MRDPA level, this phase could also be carried out with the help of external evaluators.

170. In case the application process moves to a fully electronic platform, as
recommended earlier, field visits would also be needed to verify the accuracy of
submitted data versus hard copy documents. This depends, of course, on the capacity of
the system to handle a fully electronic process. Some local authorities in rural areas – the
main targets of PNDL – may not have access to required resources, so at least at a basic
level the possibility of applying through the more traditional channels should be kept open.
By the end of 2016, Romania is required to ensure electronic submissions for EU-funded
projects; if the system functions properly, it should also be expanded to the PNDL.

5) The MRDPA and Beneficiaries Sign the Contracts
a




171. The contracting process between the Ministry and beneficiaries is unclear and
requires streamlining. There should be full transparency regarding the order in which
contracts are signed. Any unforeseen delays should be communicated to the future
beneficiaries to avoid situations whereby local authorities set aside funds or resources in
anticipation of an imminent approval.

172. Article 10 of GEO 28/2013 notes that contracts have to be signed within 30 days
of the publishing date of the Minister’s Order regarding the list of projects approved for
financing. Setting such a tight standard for signing may not only lead to a compromise of
technical and safety standards, but would normally require that other, subservient service
level agreement standards be set (e.g., standards for time to review and to process). Also,
data show that such deadlines do not hold in practice, particularly if several iterations must
take place between the MRDPA’s technical experts and local authorities before the
documentation is considered complete and acceptable.

5.1. Introduce multi-year budgeting and programming
173. The figure below makes the point that for new PNDL projects the timeline
construction can only begin in late fall, when the weather typically becomes too cold to
continue the works. This is because of multiple reasons. For one, the amount available for
PNDL projects is communicated late to the Local Councils / Counties Councils. In
consequence, only projects with technical documentation that is already complete are
usually financed, i.e., not necessary the most important investments for those respective
communities.




                                                                                                 67
                         Figure 17. Typical timeline for a new PNDL project




174. Multi-year budgeting has been a long-time desideratum in the Romanian context.
It would allow for carrying out strategic investments over several years, particularly given
the long delays typically incurred in public procurement processes. As the figure above
demonstrates, there is little that a new project proposal can accomplish in a single calendar
year. The relatively small average value of PNDL project compared to an EU-funded
investment also suggests that beneficiaries of state-budget-funded projects may be forced
to choose smaller, less impactful investments that they can expect to complete in a shorter
period of time.

175. In terms of contracting per se, multi-year contracts are needed for projects that
cannot be completed within a single year. Put differently, the beneficiary of an approved
project should not have to sign multiple contracts with the MRDPA, as currently implied by
the PNDL’s methodological norms, which mention “annual financing contracts” (Article 16).
This is important not only as a solution for reducing bureaucracy and duplication, but also
as a mechanism for ensuring predictable and stable year-to-year funding. In field
interviews, local authorities note that they have absolutely no visibility into whether they
will receive funding for the coming year and at what level.



                                                                                                68
176. The lack of multi-year budgeting and programming has been a key cause of the
current situation, whereby thousands of unfinished projects are located around the
country. With every change in government, some works were left incomplete, while new
ones were started, without an explicit objective reason for such decisions. A multi-year
PNDL may depend on broader legislative changes, which will be explored during the
subsequent phases of the current assignment and through the ongoing World Bank Public
Investment Management technical advisory with the Ministry of Finance.


5.2. Conduct post-contracting training with PNDL beneficiaries
177. A highly recommended practice at this stage in the process is to hold hands -on
training sessions with future beneficiaries. Compared to earlier in the project cycle (such
as during the pre-application period), the universe of participants to such workshops is
more limited and better defined – i.e., includes only the local authorities that are actual
beneficiaries of the PNDL in a given year. The experience of EU-funded programs in
Romania and elsewhere suggests that targeted trainings before the implementation phase
begins are very valuable. In local or regional sessions, MRDPA representatives or appointed
experts can provide hands-on guidance to program beneficiaries regarding key topics like:
public procurement; project management; good practices in contracting service providers
(including through FIDIC contracts, where feasible); PNDL-specific procedures, such as
progress reports, reimbursement requests, monitoring field visits, etc. This upfront
preparation can prevent many of the potential issues from arising during the
implementation phase and may also contribute to knowledge sharing among past and
future beneficiaries of the program.



6) Beneficiaries Begin Project Implementation
178. As noted earlier in Chapter II, the exact steps of the implementation process will
depend on whether the project is a new or ongoing investment. In the former case, the
progression is obviously more complicated and requires public procurement procedures for
the development of the detailed technical design and for the actual construction works. For
EU-funded programs, there are usually separate units within the Intermediate Bodies and
the Managing Authority that focus solely on the verification of public procurement
procedures. That system is considered to be too complicated for the PNDL, which involves
smaller sums of money. There are, in any case, multiple central-level institutions that verify
how public procurement procedures take place –the Unit for the Coordination and
Verification of Public Procurement (UCVPP), the National Authority for Regulating and
Monitoring Public Procurement (NARMPP), the National Council for Resolving Disputes
(NCRD), and the Court of Accounts, which verifies all public spending. This system is already
complex and introducing another layer of verifications at the County Council and/or the
MRDPA level should be avoided.




                                                                                                 69
6.1. Strengthen verifications of reimbursement requests
179. Proper monitoring is needed to verify the reimbursement requests submitted by
beneficiaries. Beneficiaries now request funds directly from the MRDPA, a simpler process
than before, when they had to first send the requests to county councils. County council
staff interviewed, however, reports that they would like to remain involved to be able to
coordinate and monitor the implementation process in their respective jurisdiction, as
required by the PNDL implementation norms. Once it approves the requests received, the
Ministry channels the funds – within the set annual limits and based on the
proofs/documents received (“situații de lucrări”) – directly to beneficiaries. Finally,
beneficiaries send back to the MRDPA the proof of payment of service providers (i.e.,
showing that the funds received were used for the intended purpose).

180. The main monitoring mechanism is currently based on the role of the
engineer/work supervisor (“diriginte de șantier”), who has the full legal responsibility to
verify work progress. For EU-funded programs, this monitoring function is also carried out
by Intermediate Bodies (e.g., Regional Development Agencies) and Managing Authorities
and the National Audit Authority, on a sampling basis. It is true, however, that PNDL
projects are typically much smaller, so caution is needed with respect to recommending a
much more complicated system than the current one. As for the PNDL, it is clear that the
monitoring function could not be accomplished solely by the MRDPA at the central level,
for the simple reason of lack of capacity and high costs of sending monitoring missions
throughout the country. At the most, the MRDPA can verify a carefully selected sample of
projects, focusing on the most complex and expensive investments. As noted in the law,
the Ministry can appoint representatives who, together with counterparts from the State
Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the accuracy of reported data and compare it to the
reality on the ground.

181. In addition, a solution for proper monitoring is to have specific units within
county councils that can carry out this function on a continuous basis. The advantage
would be that these authorities are close to the ground and can more easily supervise work
progress and also verify the accuracy of submitted expenses. This step would precede the
beneficiaries sending reimbursement requests to the MRDPA. In other words, the chain of
actions can be adjusted as follows: (i) a beneficiary submits to the respective county council
the report on the work performed, including reimbursement requests, based on a simple,
standard template (the one currently defined through the PNDL methodological norms is
sufficiently clear); (ii) the county council verifies the accuracy of the reports and of the
expenses, approves/amends it with the local beneficiary; (iii) the MRDPA receives the
report and, based on the sampling methodology, can decide whether to subject it to
further verification or clear it for reimbursement. Of course, this system would not apply in
the case of county council projects (for obvious reasons related to conflicts of interest); in
those situations, the monitoring would have to be done by the MRDPA.

182. An alternative, simpler solution is to hire independent auditors to assess the
expenses made and the accuracy of reimbursement requests. This has the advantage of
relying on neutral parties that are completely outside the decision-making chain related to


                                                                                                 70
PNDL projects. It would also not require expanding the government apparatus at the
county council level. Also, EU-funded projects employ such resources to help with
certifying expenses, so it would not be a new practice in Romania. As noted in the World
Bank report on the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020, the role and functions of
auditors require several improvements in the Romanian context: first, auditors should go
beyond a simple desk review of accounting documents, but thoroughly evaluate every
reimbursement request, including procurement procedures that have led to particular
expenses; equally important, in other countries, a best practice is to require these actors to
also perform technical audits, which would act as an additional filter verifying the quality of
the technical documentation and construction works performed.


6.2. Enhance overall monitoring systems
183. As noted earlier in Chapter II, PNDL beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring
work progress and reporting updates to county councils and the MRDPA. Local
beneficiaries are supposed to send reports to county councils, which further send to the
MRDPA a consolidated quarterly update on the progress of financed investments.
Currently, the system is based on simple desk reviews of submitted documents, as there
are no continuous mechanisms for verifying the works on the ground. This is critical in
terms of providing a constant flow of information regarding how projects are advancing,
how much funds they would require at different stages in their implementation, where
delays are accumulating and why, etc. A proper monitoring is the first step in enabling the
MRDPA to correct issues promptly as they develop during the project implementation
phase.

184. The challenges – and solutions – are similar to the ones described above. For its
part, the MRDPA should continue to have the overall program monitoring role, with
specific project monitoring visits scheduled based on a defined methodology (e.g., as
mentioned earlier, larger/more complex projects should be more carefully scrutinized). In
addition, the MRDPA could rely on a more active involvement by county council
representatives, as well as on independent auditors. It is highly recommended to
implement a standard electronic reporting system, easily accessible by all local authorities,
who should be incentivized to gradually move away from hard-copy report submissions.
This would enable faster processing and real-time monitoring of progress.



7) Projects Are Completed
185. The PNDL currently includes no institutionalized mechanisms for the post-
implementation phase, which would involve tracking the project upon completion. There
are no performance indicators and no clear procedures for following up with local
beneficiaries once investments are finished. The only formal exchange happens when the
warranty period expires, when the local authority again sends a copy of the documentation
(“procesul verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA. There are two major shortcomings
resulting from this: first, there is no rigorous ex-post monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of



                                                                                                  71
impact (did the financed investments pay off, i.e., reach their objectives?); second, lessons
learned in implementation are not passed on from one beneficiary to the other, as there is
no institutionalized knowledge sharing.

7.1. Establish an ex-post M&E system with clear performance indicators
186. The first step in establishing a proper M&E system for the post-implementation
phase is to define and agree on a set of performance indicators for each financed project.
Based on Romania’s experience with EU funds, PNDL applicants should be encouraged to
select from a pre-defined list, customized based on type of investment, which would be
easy to implement particularly through an e-application form. At a minimum, chosen
indicators should abide by the “SMART” set of criteria: specific, measurable, attainable,
relevant, and time-oriented. An electronic application system would not allow users to
submit a financing proposal with indicators beyond the pre-defined set. As an alternative,
applicants could be free to choose their own targets, but evaluators should be allowed and
instructed to correct these based on the principles enunciated above. These solutions
would avoid instances of beneficiaries over-promising on the impact of their projects and
would also save time when preparing the monitoring reports.

187. There is also a need to continue monitoring visits in the field for a number of
years after the completion of the investment. Again, this can be done with the support of
county councils or independent auditors. The purpose is to see how the project is
performing, if the indicators have been reached, and if there are any issues worth signaling
in the operations and maintenance procedures.

188. Last but not least, the reporting system applicable to the implementation phase
should be expanded to cover the post-implementation stage. The purpose is not to
generate excessive bureaucracy, but a yearly report for 3-5 years upon the investment’s
completion can add very relevant data regarding how the project is performing in the long
term. For instance, it can show whether the quality of the works was done at the agreed
standards based on how the infrastructure is holding up. It can also reveal if a sufficient
number of people connect to a new water/wastewater system, or if there is no basis to
guarantee the new infrastructure’s long-term sustainability.

7.2. Implement knowledge-sharing mechanisms
189. Beneficiaries (“program graduates”) who have completed PNDL investments
should be enabled to share lessons learned with other local/county authorities . Some of
them have many finalized investments in their portfolio, others are less experienced, but
they all could contribute to the PND L’s improvement by effectively closing the feedback
loop and feeding back their accumulated insights into how new projects in the pipeline are
implemented.

190. Currently, as noted above, once a project is complete, PNDL “graduates” have
very limited interactions with the MRDPA on the topic of their completed investments.
There is no institutionalized, effective way of collecting their suggestions for improving the



                                                                                                 72
program or for ensuring smoother project implementation. To be sure, knowledge sharing
among beneficiaries is still happening in the absence of formal mechanisms, but on an ad-
hoc basis only and with suboptimal results, as not all knowledge exchanged currently is
useful. As demonstrated by what happened with the drafting of public procurement
documentation in the past, beneficiaries copied mistakes from one another and, as a
consequence, incurred painful corrections under EU-funded projects. This goes to the point
that knowledge among peers can be a simple, but very powerful, valuable tool if
implemented correctly – i.e., properly collected, organized, verified, and distributed.

191. There are multiple possibilities for leveraging program graduates and facilitating
knowledge exchange. For instance, one simple option is to add to the ex-post monitoring
reports submitted by beneficiaries (per the previous recommendation) a number of
questions asking for suggestions for future beneficiaries. It should be easy to receive and
collect this feedback at the level of each county in electronic form, and then send it to the
MRDPA for further processing and analysis. Another option is to host in-person workshops
with successful graduates acting as trainers and mentors for new beneficiaries. In some
regions, successful EU-funded projects are featured in promotional materials and project
managers are sometimes asked to give talks to various audiences, but this practice is not
institutionalized. Specifically, graduates could lead parts of the sessions organized upon
contracting of new projects.

192. In addition, graduates could play a key role in developing a range of information
and communication technology (ICT) solutions for knowledge management and sharing.
The possibilities under this heading are nearly endless, but the guiding principles should be
ease of input and ease of access. Whether it is a simple online forum with postings for
problems encountered and approved solutions, or a more elaborate search catalogue
based on key topics (e.g., “public procurement,” “feasibility studies,” etc.), it will only be
successful if users do not spend a lot of time figuring out how to use the platform. To
borrow a well-known example from this field, Google devised the world’s most popular
search engine by simplifying everything, down to a single button. This is why it is important
to keep testing, piloting, and refining ICT solutions based on users’ feedback to reduce the
risk of developing a really complex tool used by only a few ROP graduates and
beneficiaries.

193. Finally, for it to be effective, knowledge sharing requires careful quality control to
avoid situations where the shared information is either wrong or would expose project
beneficiaries to additional risks. It is useful to caveat all knowledge exchange initiatives
with the note that advice from PNDL graduates should always be adapted to the specific
circumstances of a project and, naturally, what has worked for one beneficiary may not be
appropriate for another.




                                                                                                 73
Chapter V: Proposed Prioritization Criteria for Enhanced Selection of
PNDL Projects

194. The way PNDL projects are currently prioritized was described in more detail in
Chapter II, which noted that the method currently has a number of positive features.
Specifically, the status quo system is simple, involves relatively little bureaucracy, allows
access to funding for almost every local administration, and is quite fast. To the extent
possible, these strong points should be reinforced going forward.

195. At the same time, this method has a number of downsides. For one, the current
prioritization criteria do not properly quantify actual need. For example, for the 2014
financial exercise, every county in Romania initially got allocated about the same amount
of money (roughly RON 22-25 million) regardless of actual need, the availability of own
resources to carry on such investments, or capacity to absorb funds from the central
government. The prioritization itself is done by the county council, including for projects
undertaken by the county councils themselves (e.g., county roads), which can lead to a
situation where county authorities favor their own projects over the projects of localities in
their respective jurisdictions. Also, the current prioritization criteria do not take key
elements into consideration, such as: impact (the investments with the highest expected
impact should be preferred over those with lower impact); financial sustainability (i.e.,
capacity to cover operation and maintenance costs once the investment is finalized); or
national targets and priorities (e.g., focusing investments in wastewater only in localities
with more than 2,000 people equivalent).

196. Obviously, almost every investment program leaves room for improvement. The
trick in carrying out those improvements lies, however, in ensuring that the good elements
of the program are kept, while the bad ones are addressed. A fundamental precondition
for identifying those good and bad elements is the identification of the key elements
needed for an efficient prioritization mechanism.

197. At the very least, an efficient prioritization mechanism, or rather a function al
project selection model, should have the following elements at its core:
     A strategy that identifies the key issues that should be addressed.
     Individual operational programs that aim to target the identified needs.
     A clear implementation timeline for those operational programs.
     A clear budget for the implementation of the programs.
     A list of priorities and projects that help achieve program goals.
     Clear prioritization criteria for the selection of those projects that can have the
        highest impact.
     Performance indicators to measure the actual impact and performance of the
        selected and implemented projects.

In what follows, these key elements will be discussed in more detail.




                                                                                                 74
Core Elements of Optimal Prioritization
The Strategy
198. The key strategic document that can guide PNDL investments in the future is the
Territorial Development Strategy of Romania (SDTR). At the moment of the writing of this
report, the SDTR was still in draft form, but the document provides key strategic guidelines
for how PNDL investments could be done in the future. Thus:
      the development of connective infrastructure, such as county roads, should aim to
        enable as many people as possible easier access to opportunities (e.g. , jobs,
        education, healthcare, culture), and to enable firms easier access to a larger labor
        pool.
      people in all regions should have easy access to basic infrastructure such as water,
        wastewater, educational facilities, health facilities, etc. to ensure that everybody in
        the country is offered, to the extent possible, the same start in life.
These key strategic guidelines will be factored into the proposed prioritization criteria for
PNDL investments.

199. Going from the national to the next lower level, Regional Development Plans
(RDPs) guide development for seven-year cycles (e.g., 2007-2013, 2014-2020, etc.) for
each of Romania’s eight regions. Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) prepare RDPs as
a foundation for accessing EU funds under the Regional Operational Programme (ROP). The
RDPs are insular in their approach, as they are specifically designed for the accession of
structural funds. Even when the plans themselves go beyond the scope of what can be
funded through the ROP there is no administrative tier that could take such regional
projects on. The RDAs themselves function as NGOs of public utility and are intermediate
bodies between the Managing Authority of the ROP and beneficiaries. The RDAs also do
not assume, according to Law 151/1998 and Law 315/2004 on regional development,
which laid the basis of their existence, any spatial planning attributions.

200. While the RDPs are not normative in the absence of a formal regional
administrative tier for Romania, the PNDL should take into account regional priorities as
defined in these documents. This requires close coordination between the MRDPA and the
RDAs – which happens in any case as part of the ROP chain, where the RDAs act as the
interface with beneficiaries.

The Program
201. The PNDL is not a full-fledged Operational Program, but includes key objectives
and a list of intervention areas. Thus, one of the key objectives of the PNDL is to provide a
basic package of services for rural localities (such as communal roads, water, wastewater,
sanitation, educational facilities, health facilities, public markets) to help narrow the
development gap relative to urban areas. Also, public investments such as the
development of county roads should contribute to the sustainable and balanced
development of Romania. The PNDL is now structured around three sub-programs: (1) the
modernization of Romanian villages; (2) the urban regeneration of municipalities and




                                                                                                  75
towns; and (3) the development of county-level infrastructure. The largest shares of
investments carried out in 2014 focused on county and communal roads (around 50% of
allocated funds) and water and wastewater infrastructure (around 50% of allocated funds).

The Timeline
202. Currently, the PNDL is a year-to-year investment program. This means that the
PNDL budget is approved by the Ministry of Finance every year and, based on available
funds, money is provided to beneficiaries (primarily county councils and local authorities)
for the continuation of ongoing projects or for starting new projects. This approach has a
number of serious drawbacks. For one, since funding is only guaranteed on a year-to-year
basis, an investment project may receive funding in one year and receive no funding in the
next. Thus, Romania can end up in a situation where many projects throughout the country
are started and remain unfinished for long periods of time – leading to the deterioration
and depreciation of the ongoing investments. Obviously, this is a waste of public money.
Second, because funding is only guaranteed for one year, most beneficiaries focus on small
and usually less impactful projects (e.g., short links in a county road, small water systems,
etc.). As a point of comparison, the average length of a county road financed under the
Regional Operational Programme is 24 Km, while the average length of a PNDL financed
county road is 11 Km (see also Figure 10 for a visual comparison). Similarly, rural
infrastructure projects financed through the PNDR have an average value that is almost
three times as high as that of a similar PNDL project. Last but not least, year-to-year
financing prohibits proper long-term integrated planning and correlation of investments
within and across investment programs.

203. Ideally, the PNDL should be a multi-annual program that follows the EU
programming cycles. This will not only ensure a more rigorous approach and the possibility
to finance more impactful projects, but it will also allow better coordination and
harmonization of all operational and investment programs – i.e., operational programs
financing similar investments could draw on a joint strategy and will look to contribute
toward the same goals.


The Budget
204. A clear budget is the simplest and most effective tool for proper prioritization.
When a local/county/national authority knows how much money it has to spend, it is also
in a better position to decide the limited number of projects that it can actually finance
with the limited funds it has at its disposal. This also forces a more rigorous selection of
projects to ensure that what is funded will garner the highest possible impact. Obviously,
the budget should ideally be multi-annual to go hand-in-hand with the multi-annual
programming recommended above. A multi-annual budget also enables a better financial
planning and helps improve inter-annual linkages, as the budget execution in one year
affects the the plan for the next year. The experience with EU funded investment programs
indicates that the bulk of a multi-annual budget gets spent towards the end of a
programming period.




                                                                                                76
205. The PNDL budget for 2014 was RON 1.5 billion or around EUR 340 million. If the
PNDL would follow the EU programming cycle, then a multi-annual budget for the 2014-
2020 programming period could be somewhere around EUR 2.4 billion. Of course, the
actual size of such a multi-annual budget cannot be decided solely by the MRDPA itself, but
has to be part of a discussion at the government level around national priorities and
programs that can help achieve those priorities.

The Priorities
206. With a budget allocated, the next task is to determine what priorities and
projects should be financed. This is the task of the managing authority for the respective
operational program. For 2014, as noted earlier, around 50% of PNDL funds have been
allocated for county and communal roads, and around 50% for water and wastewater
projects. In the case of the PNDR 2007-2013, the estimated split between different types of
projects has been roughly: 40% for communal roads; 40% for water and wastewater
projects; and around 20% for social infrastructure projects. The split per priorities and the
types of projects eligible for financing should be decided at the start of an operational
program. This requires proper planning and it makes sense primarily for a multi-annual
program.


The First Step to Proper Prioritization: Setting a Multi-Annual Budget
207. The characteristic of most State funded investments programs in Romania is that
they never finish. Even when clear targets are set, these programs tend to drag on for
years, with spikes of funding provided in one year, and no or little funding provided in
other years. Consequently, whenever a spike of funding is available, lots of projects are
started, without a clear idea when the projects will actually be finished.

208. A clear budget is the best tool for proper prioritization. Knowing how much you
can afford to spend on needed public investments forces you to decide what are your key
priorities. Inevitably, a budget cannot be thought on a year-to-year basis, because an
investment program usually cannot be finalized in one year.

209.     Multi-annual budgeting thus becomes paramount. Especially for a program like
the PNDL, which has now taken on a roster of some 3,900 projects, it is important to decide
what budget can reasonably be counted on to finish (at least some of) the started projects
in a given timeline.

210. This requires of course that a clear implementation time-line be set. In the case of
Romania, as well as all the other EU Member Countries, this task comes relatively easy.
Ideally, all investment programs should be correlated and coordinated, and given that EU
programs (which have the most generous budget allocation in Romania) follow a clear
implementation time-line, the PNDL should be synchronized with the EU cycle. This
basically means that planning and budgeting for the PNDL should be thought around the
2014-2020 programming period.



                                                                                                77
211. Setting an actual value for the PNDL budget is not an easy. This usually involves a
complicated political process and requires consultations with multiple stakeholders
involved. It is ultimately the task of the Government what its key priorities are for a certain
period and to work with the Ministry of Public Finance to determine what funds can be
allocated for these priorities.

212. Assuming that Romania’s budget will continue to grow in coming years, the initial
value of the PNDL budget can be taken as a starting point. In 2014, the PNDL got an initial
allocation of around 1.5 billion RON. Assuming that a similar allocation can be provided in
the coming years, and adjusting for inflation and a modest economic growth (i.e. assuming
a 5% budget increase every year), a reasonable multi-annual budget could look as follows:

Table 4. Proposed PNDL Budget allocation for 2014-2020 (in mil. RON)

     2014            2015           2016           2017            2018   2019        2020
     1,591          1,671           1,754          1,842          1,934   2,031       2,132

213. The total multi-annual budget for the PNDL will thus amount to around 13 billion
RON, or around 2.9 billion Euro. Knowing this value alone can go a long way in helping
clean the current project portfolio. Right now, the PNDL has a list of 3,952 projects it plans
to finance. The total estimated value for these projects (not all projects have an assigned
value as of yet) is somewhere around 22 billion RON – 70% more than the 13 billion
proposed above. Consequently, one could assume that at least 70% of the projects
committed to through the PNDL right now could not be finalized within a reasonable time-
line. Moreover, if funding will not be focused on a number of clear priority projects, it is
likely that the majority of those projects will not be finalized by 2020.

The Second Step to Proper Prioritization: Setting Clear Priorities
214. Once a budget is allocated, it is important to identify the priorities this budget
will fund. In the case of the PNDL, the priorities are more or less know: 1) county roads; 2)
communal roads; 3) water and wastewater; 4) social infrastructure. What is less clear
however is a hierarchy of needs – i.e. which of the above priorities should receive more
funding. In what follows, we will discuss three scenarios for allocating funds according to
priorities.


The Local Priorities Scenario
215. Currently, the PNDL receives projects on an on-going basis, without a clear
hierarchy of needs. In essence, the PNDL sets the type of investments it will fund, but the
actual allocation by priority is done, de facto, based on the type of technical
documentation received from the local level. If more technical documentations are
received for a particular type of project, more funding will go for that project. As can be
seen in the table below, the project pool with the largest value is communal roads. This has
happened less as a result of program engineering and more out of inertia – communal road



                                                                                                  78
projects are relatively easy to design and implement, and many local authorities prepare
such projects.

Table 5. How priorities are currently split under the PNDL

Priority                            Share in PNDL Program
County Roads                        14%
Communal Roads                      45%
Water and Wastewater                35%
Social Infrastructure               6%

216. Thus, the level of funding allocated to individual priorities is decided by
stakeholders at the local level. In essence, this is not necessarily a bad way of doing things
– local/county authorities know best what their needs are. But, it is not an ideal scenario
either. Since national funds are allocated for local investments, the MRDPA should allocate
funds strategically based on actual needs. Local/county authorities have their own budgets
that they can use for local infrastructure investments, so the MRDPA can direct its funds
towards reaching a set of strategic national objectives.

217. The table below indicates how the PNDL budget could be split if the current
allocation would be taken into consideration:

Table 6. Proposed allocation of PNDL budget (in mil. Euro) - the Local Priorities Scenario (in mil. Euro)

                                 2014          2015          2016       2017         2018        2019       2020    TOTAL

The EU Priorities Scenario
218. An overwhelming share of public infrastructure investments in Romania is now
being done with EU funds. EU funded programs follow clear objectives and priorities, and
they can provide a clue to how State funded programs could be organized. In essence,
looking at how similar investments have received budget allocations from various EU
funded programs can provide a blueprint for how the PNDL could allocate its budget by
priorities – using thus the principle of additionality with EU-funded programs.

219. The draft programmatic document sent to the European Commission proposed
the following budget allocation as of December 2014:




                                                                                                                    79
Table 7. EU funds allocation (in Euro) by operational program priorities

220. These allocations can be split, to fit more the investment portfolio covered by the
PNDL. In some cases the split is known (e.g., for water and wastewater investments under
the Large Infrastructure Operational Programme (LI OP), in other cases certain assumptions
have to be taken. For example, under Measure 7, the PNDR will fund basic services in rural
areas, which can include investments in roads, investments in water and wastewater
infrastructure, as well as investments in social infrastructure. Looking at the experience of
PNDR 2007-2013 and its Measure 322, one could give the following rough allocation of
funds: 40% for communal roads; 40% for water and wastewater investments; 20% for
social infrastructure. At the same time, one needs to consider where such investments are
financed. For example, the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020 many financed
investments will target primarily urban areas. Thus, an assumption used here is that:
around 20% of health sector investments under the ROP will target rural areas (the bulk of
the funding will go to regional hospitals, county hospitals, and urban hospitals); around
40% of funds for the education sector will target rural areas; around 30% of funds for
cultural infrastructure will target rural areas. These are of course gross approximations –
the exact figures will be known when the respective programs will be finalized.

221. Nonetheless, this gross approximation allows an estimation of funds allocated
through EU funds to the type of investments financed by the PNDL. The table below
provides these estimates.

The Investment Need Priorities Scenario
223. The allocation of the PNDL budget can also be done according to the investment
needs in each particular priority sector covered. For county and communal roads this is a
relatively easy endeavor – these can be estimated using the MRDPA cost standards and
multiplying those by the number of gravel and dirt roads that require modernization. In the
case of water and wastewater investments, the team has used the investment needs
included in the regional water masterplans, subtracting the major investments already
completed or committed since 2007. In the case of social infrastructure, the team has
elaborated a methodology for estimating investment needs.

224. Social infrastructure needs are complex, and are best known by local authorities.
There are nonetheless ways to estimate investment needs. A first step in this direction was
the elaboration of social infrastructure needs by county, and by locality, using a number of
indicators (the methodology will be discussed in the following sections). Several scenarios
were considered. The first scenario only took into consideration the communes with the
highest infrastructure needs. A second scenario took into consideration all communes with
above-average social infrastructure needs, as measured using a number of indicators. For
the third scenario, a reallocation system has been considered, by setting a minimum
threshold of 5 and a maximum of 20 projects per county, for each type of social

infrastructure. This has helped avoid the polarization of funds in a limited number of areas,
and has ensured that each county gets allocated a minimum funding for each type of
investment (education, health, culture, sports).

225. The estimated financial allocation per county has been determined using as a
starting point the number of projects and the average cost standard for each type of
investment (Government Resolution no. 362/2010, Government Ordinances 7/2006, the
PNDR maximum project values, and average project costs for similar projects under the
PNDL). The following estimated project values were used:
     EDUCATION=330,000 Euro/project (the average cost standard between a
         Kindergarten for 4 groups – 256,455 Euro (Annex 2.11, GD 363/2010) and a school
         for 8 classes – 402,985 (Annex 2.10, GD 363/2010); the average cost for an
         education infrastructure project under PNDL is around 358,000 Euro).
     HEALTH=500,000 Euro/project (the maximum project value for medical centers in
         rural areas financed by the PNDR 2014-2020, Measure 7.2; the average cost for a
         health infrastructure project under PNDL is around 336,000 Euro).
     CULTURE=1,000,000 Euro/project (the average cost standard for a Cultural Center
         (Annex 2.2, GD 363/2010; the average cost for a cultural infrastructure project
         under PNDL is around 645,500 Euro).
     SPORTS=400,000 Euro/project (the average cost standard between a Sports Hall –
         665,720 Euro (Annex 2.1, GD 363/2010) and the maximum eligible value for a
         Rural Sports Base (GD 7/2006); the average cost for a sports infrastructure project
         under PNDL is around 250,000 Euro).

226. The estimated investment needs for each PNDL priority sector are included in the
table below:

Table 10. Estimated sector investment needs, by PNDL priority sector

227. It is clear that investment needs are heavily skewed towards water and
wastewater investments. Romania has a significant deficit in terms of water and
wastewater infrastructure (partly because of the high number of people living in small rural
localities). Also, the requirements set by the EU in this sector are quite high, putting double
pressure on Romania to allocate significant resources for such investments. An allocation of
the PNDL budget based on investment needs will look as follows:




                                                                                                  82

Proposal for PNDL Priorities Scenario
228. It is clear that none of the scenarios proposed above is perfect. All of the three
scenarios provide however useful insights into how the allocation per priority sector could
be done. It is obvious for example that water and wastewater is by far the sector with the
most significant needs. It is also clear that local authorities have a strong preference for
investment in communal roads, which are easy to design and implement. Also, the
investment needs for communal roads are higher than for county roads, and the available
funds from other programs are much smaller for communal roads (e.g. the ROP has
allocated almost 1 billion Euro for investments in county roads, as opposed to the 440
million Euro available for communal roads under the PNDR). The needs for social
infrastructure require relatively less investments than do water and wastewater, as well as
communal roads, and there a significantly more funds available for such investments under
EU funded programs.

229. Taking these into consideration, a proposal for the allocation of the PNDL 2014-
2020 budget by priorities could look as follows:

Table 12. Proposal for the allocation of the PNDL 2014-2020 budget by priorities

allocated by priorities and by years:

 County roads                       53.0        55.7        58.5         61.4        64.5         67.7         71.1    431.9
 Local/communal roads               88.4        92.8        97.5        102.3      107.5        112.8      118.5       719.8

231. This budget allocation differs from the way projects values are currently spread
for the PNDL 2014. What the table below shows is that the projects contracted and
considered for contracting right now under the PNDL 2014, are in excess of what is
proposed in this report. This in itself poses a conundrum. Namely, the task going forward
for the PNDL may not require the prioritization of new project proposals (with the
exception of social infrastructure projects), but rather will require the prioritization of an
already existent project list – i.e. decide which of these projects will receive financing in the
2014-2020 programming period. Inevitably, this will also require that some projects that
are now being considered for financing will not receive any in the next 7 years. It is critical
to identify and prioritize those projects that can be financed in a fixed timeline with a
known and ensured budget.

Proposed Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Investments
232. This section proposes prioritization criteria for the main types of investments
financed by the PNDL: county roads; communal roads; water; wastewater; education
facilities; health units; cultural facilities; sports facilities. For each sector, the prioritization
is envisaged to be done in two steps:
     (a) A prioritization to determine the optimal allocation of funds across counties, based
          on actual county needs for that respective sector;
     (b) A prioritization at the local and at the project level to determine which locality
         would benefit most from a particular type of investment, respectively which
         individual project would have the most significant impact.

                                                     greatest need was calculated by identifying the counties

234. Annex 12 indicates the compounded results of the application of the above
prioritization criteria.

235. In turn, the priority list in Annex 12 was used to propose an allocation of the
budget for county roads by counties, as shown in Annex 20. An allocation based on
investment needs was also considered, but the differences between different counties
were too high. For example, in Covasna the budget allocation for county road
rehabilitation was 1.8 million Euro, while for Hunedoara it was 28.6 million Euro. The
prioritization criteria used above smooth the results, and they factor in other criteria, such
as poverty level, for determining needs at the county level. It was decided to have no
budget allocation for Ilfov County given that the investment needs are relatively small.


How to prioritize county roads projects within a county
236. The criteria used to evaluate and select different projects have to be calibrated to
the system that will actually use those criteria. In the case of the PNDL, the system has a
reduced capacity – it currently lacks a pool of external evaluators that could take on such a
task and has only limited internal staff. As such, elaborated criteria, similar to those used by
the Regional Operational Programme, are hard to implement.

237. The choice was thus taken to propose a more normative approach and determine
the priority county road development projects for each county – i.e. the county road links
that PNDL funds should go to first. The prioritization criteria are included in the table
below.

                                                         capacity of public authorities to cover
                                                         operations and maintenance costs for

                                                         poorer public authorities have a weaker

240. Annex 13 indicates the compounded results of the application of the above
prioritization criteria.

241. In turn, the priority list in Annex 13 was used to propose an allocation of the
budget for communal roads by counties, as shown in Annex 21. An allocation based on
investment needs was also considered, but the differences between different counties
were too high. For example, in Ilfov the budget allocation for communal road rehabilitation
was 0.1 million Euro, while for Argeș it was 37.9 million Euro. The prioritization criteria
used above smooth the results, and they factor in other criteria, such as poverty level, for
determining needs at the county level. Nonetheless, it was decided to have no budget

allocation for Ilfov, as the investment need for Ilfov is around 3 million Euro – a relatively
small sum, which can be covered from the local budget.


How to prioritize communal roads projects within a county
242. The prioritization of investments in communal roads cannot realistically be done
on a road-by-road basis, as was proposed for county roads, because of the sheer number
of roads that need to be considered. The coordination can however be done at the locality
level and the following prioritization criteria can be used in this sense.

Table 18. Prioritization criteria for communal road projects, by territorial administrative units (TAUs)

Finance communal road projects only in PNDL funds should target initially larger communes,
communes with more than 1,000 people. where a minimum of economies of scale can be
                                              achieved.

Local Human Development Index          15% LHDI at the locality level should be taken into
                                              consideration to give more attention to poorer
                                              localities, which have a tougher time financing
                                              investments from their own budget.
Financial Sustainability Index         15% The FSI at the locality level will provide a
                                              counterweight to the LHDI, ensuring that priority is
                                              given to localities face development needs but that
                                              can also actually cover operation and maintena nce

communal roads, as determined using the prioritization criteria above. The allocation of
localities to priority criteria was done using the Natural Breaks Jenks method33 . A county-
by-county discussion of priorities for communal roads, as well as the way PNDL projects
(either contracted or with a standing commitment) fit within those priorities will be done
as part of the work under Component 1.

  The Naturak Breaks Jenks method is a data clustering approach that helps determine the best
arrangement of a a set of values (in this case the priority score) into different classes. The method
aims to minimize the average deviation from the class mean for each class, while at the same time
maximizing the each class’ deviation from the means of the other groups. Simply put, the method
heps generate classes that have a small variance within each other and a high variance between
each other.

water and wastewater sector is primarily administered by regional operators and,
whenever possible, it is important to encourage that new investments in water and
wastewater be done within the framework of the regional operators. This would continue
to encourage economies of scale and sustainable development of infrastructure. Among
other things, this means that localities that develop such projects should enter the
Intercommunity Development Association formed around the Regional Operator and, once
the project is complete, they should cede operation, maintenance, and management of the
new infrastructure to the Regional Operator. The proposed regional prioritization criteria
are included below.

decided to make no budget allocation from PNDL. These regions include: Aries, Gorj, Ilfov,
Sibiu, and Târnave. For Cluj-Sălaj and Constanța -Ialomița, an extra allocation of 30% and
50% respectively was included, given that these regions cover two counties. This extra
allocation also took actual investment needs into consideration – e.g., the estimated
investment need for Cluj-Sălaj is around 232 million Euro (one of the lowest funding gap of
all regions).

How to allocate funds for water and wastewater projects within a region
248. The prioritization of PNDL projects in water and wastewater should take into
consideration the water masterplans, as well as other investments done through other
major operational programs (SOP Environment, Large Infrastructure Operational
Programme, PNDR, the Environment Fund), to ensure proper coordination and
harmonization of investments.

249. Water and wastewater prioritization criteria should also take into consideration
the targets that Romania has committed to in the EU Accession Treaty. Three directives
have to be taken into consideration in this respect:
     The Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC)
     The Urban Wastewater Directive (91/271/EEC)
     The Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)
The importance of these directives is discussed below.

250. The Drinking Water Directive aims “to protect human health from adverse ef fects
of any contamination of water intended for human consumption by ensuring that it is
wholesome and clean.”34 For this purpose, member states are to monitor at least 48
parameters for all distribution systems that serve more than 50 people or supply more
than 10 cubic meters per day, as well as all for all water supplied as part of an economic
activity. 35 The directive further lays out provisions for proper planning, regulation,
monitoring, and reporting. The same directive notes that derogations from its provisions
are possible, as follows: the first two, each limited to a maximum of three years, are the
responsibility of member states; a third “exceptional” derogation can be granted by the EC.
In the case of Romania, as noted in the country’s EU Accessio n Treaty, the derogations for
achieving the Directive’s targ ets are as follows:
          Agglomerations with less than 10,000 inhabitants
              — Oxidisability: December 31, 2010
              — Ammonium, nitrates, turbidity, aluminums, iron, lead, cadmium, and
                 pesticides: December 31, 2015

          Agglomerations with 10,000-100,000 inhabitants

251. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive seeks to “protect the environment
from urban waste water discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors.” 36 In
short, the Directive mandates: the Collection and treatment of waste water in all
agglomerations of more than 2,000 population equivalents (p.e.); secondary treatment of
all discharges from agglomerations of over 2,000 p.e. and more advanced treatment for
agglomerations of over 10,000 population equivalents in sensitive areas and their
catchments; pre-authorization of all discharges of urban wastewater, of discharges from
the food-processing industry, and of industrial discharges into urban wastewater collection
systems; monitoring of the performance of treatment plants and receiving waters; and
controls of sewage sludge disposal and reuse, and treated waste water reuse when
possible. The text of the Directive was formally adopted in 1993, with an implementation
timeline of up to the end of 2005. For Romania and other new EU member states,
however, a different timetable was set at the time of accession. The implementation
schedule with intermediate and final targets is provided below:

integrated framework “for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters,
coastal waters, and groundwater.” 37 In short, the directive seeks to achieve good

ecological status for all water bodies in the EU. The specific aims of the Directive are
multifold: to prevent further deterioration; to promote sustainable water use; to
progressively reduce discharges as well as the pollution of ground water; and to mitigate
effects of floods and droughts. Romania has committed to reaching a good state for 60% of
the surface waters, groundwater, and protected areas by December 2015 (i.e., fifteen years
after the adoption of the directive), with potential derogations through December
2021/2027 under justified circumstances, based on Article 4 (4) and 4 (5). Annex V of the
WFD 2000/60/EC provides detailed indicators for assessing the status of a particular body
of water.

253. Accordingly, the prioritization of water and wastewater projects at the regional
level can be done following the steps below:

How to allocate funds for social infrastructure projects within a county
259. It is hard to keep track and monitor needs in social infrastructure at the local
level, given the sheer number of villages (around 13,000) that have such infrastructure in
need of rehabilitation, or require such infrastructure to be developed. The criteria below
are meant to chart the infrastructure need in the four sectors (health, education, cultural,
sports) at the locality level:

health infrastructure, as determined using the prioritization criteria above. The allocation
of localities to priority criteria was done using the Natural Breaks Jenks method. A county-

Focus only on sports infrastructure projects of less than €665,720. This is in accordance with the standard

263. The map below indicates the communes with the highest need for investment in
sports infrastructure, as determined using the prioritization criteria above. The allocation
of localities to priority criteria was done using the Natural Breaks Jenks method. A county-
by-county discussion of priorities for sports infrastructure, as well as the way PNDL projects
(either contracted or with a standing commitment) fit within those priorities will be done
as part of the work under Component 1.

Proposed PNDL 2014-2020 budget allocation by counties
264. The information from the previous sections was put together to compound the
allocation of the proposed PNDL 2014-2020 budget by counties (see table below). Since
proposed budget figures for water and wastewater were calculated by water region, a
simple split was done for the two water regions that are more or less made up of two
counties (Cluj-Sălaj and Constanța -Ialomița). The budget allocations for the water regions
that are part of a county (Arieș, Târnave, Valea Jiului) is 0, so there was no need to sum up
them up together with the counties they are part of (Cluj, Sibiu, and Hunedoara
respectively). The funding discrepancy in funding for some counties (e.g. Ilfov, Sibiu, or
Gorj), is due to the lack of funding allocated for water and wastewater projects in these
counties, as they are likely to cover most of their stringent needs if projects started in the
2007-2013 Programming Period will be finalized.

Chapter VI: Proposed Monitoring System for the PNDL

Process Indicators
265. It is important to view the PNDL in the context of a multitude of pub lic
investment programs, not in isolation. In essence, the PNDL is a tool that helps the
Government achieve a number of key objectives. As such, the Chancellery of the Prime
Minister should be able to monitor and assess the program. In this respect, the following
basic process indicators could be considered to ensure the Government keeps track of all
its investment programs:

266. These process indicators will provide the Government with a quick snapshot of
the PNDL and they can prompt a potential intervention if needed . In addition to these
basic indicators, other indicatoprs may be collected, which could show the extent to which
the PNDL helps achieve key Government objectives.

Performance Indicators
267. Simply having a prioritization system in place is not enough for the PNDL – it is
also critical to have a monitoring system that provides a regular assessment of how the
prioritization system is actually working. For one, the monitoring system should be able to
determine whether output objectives are achieved (e.g. km of roads constructed, number
of people benefiting from water and wastewater). Second, it is important to determine
whether these public investments have helped engender development at the local level –
i.e. to determine whether they have actually made a dent. Obviously, the first desiderate is
easier to achieve than the second. Development is a product of a multitude of factors, and
it is hard to determine how much of the development of a locality was made possible by a
specific public investment, and how much can be attributed to other factors. Nonetheless,



                                                                                               112
it is important to measure whether development is actually taking place in a locality where
public funds have been invested as this will inform the choice of public investments that
could be taken on in the future – it makes no sense to continue an investment that has no
obvious impact.

268. Performance indicators can be both general in nature and sector specific. Below
we include proposals both for general performance indicators and sector-specific
performance indicators.

General Impact Indicators
269. In terms of overall performance of the PNDL, there are two composite indexes
that can be used by MDRAP:
     The Territorial Development Index, which is now being developed by MDRAP;
     The Local Human Development Index, which was developed by Prof. Dumitru
        Sandu.
These composite indicators can be used to assess the effectiveness of all types of PNDL
investments, and they make more sense than sector specific impact indicators, such
“Increase in life expectancy”, “Decrease in early school leaving rate”, “Number of jobs
created”. Given the small size of PNDL projects, it makes more sense to focus primarily on
output indicators, and the Territorial Development Index and the Local Human
Development Index measure the overall performance of public investments done in a
particular locality.

270. The Territorial Development Index (TDI) is a composite measure that assesses the
general need for infrastructure investments at the locality level. The map below provides
a snapshot of the TDI for 2011.




                                                                                                 113
                      Figure 23. The Territorial Development Index for 2011




271. The Local Human Development Index (LHDI) assesses the overall development of
a locality and is discussed in more detail in Annex H. The map below provides a snapshot
of the LHDI for 2011. As can be seen from the two maps, there is a strong correlation
between the TDI and LHDI.

272. The computation of the TDI and LHDI requires Census data, which is only
collected every ten years. This unfortunately makes a year-to-year monitoring more
difficult. In Annex 24 of the Identification of Project Selection Models for the Regional
Operational Programme 2014-2020, the World Bank has proposed an adaptation of the
LHDI methodology to enable a yearly computation of the index, not just at the time of the
Census. This can allow the MRDPA to identify which localities have developed, where, and
to try to adjust the mix of public investments to put the poor performers on a development
path.

Road Performance Indicators
273. Road performance indicators should be kept simple and should be coordinated
with the performance indicators used by ROP 2014-2020 and PNDR 2014-2020. The easier
it is to collect these indicators, the easier they will be to monitor.

Water and Wastewater Performance Indicators
274. The Drinking Water Directive, the Urban Wastewater Directive, and the Water
Framework Directive, provide guidelines not only for identifying prioritization criteria,
but also for identifying performance indicators. The following performance indicators can
be considered in this sense:

Monitoring Committee
276. To enable the monitoring process to run smoothly a Monitoring Committee could
be established, including both staff of the MRDPA and representatives of the beneficiaries
(one representative per county).

277. Ideally, each county councils should establish a Monitoring Team that tracks the
implementation of PNDL projects, collects and reports performance indicators. In many
cases, such teams have already been formed to monitor the implementation of county
development strategies, and these teams could also take on the role of monitoring the
implementation of PNDL projects within the county.




                                                                                             118
                          Figure 25. Proposed PNDL Monitoring Framework




278. The PNDL Monitoring Committee should ensure the collection and analysis of
performance indicators from all counties, to ensure a complete image at the national level.
The Monitoring Committee should also prepare Monitoring Reports assessing the
performance of the program and making recommendations on how implementation could
be improved. Such a report should at the very minimum include the following information:
    - Time period covered by the monitoring activity;
    - Data sources (or, if required, problems regarding the collection of data);
    - Actions taken during the monitoring process;
    - Description of targets achieved and of problems encountered;
    - Recommendations for program improvement;
    - Final appreciation regarding the progress in the implementation of the program.

279. Since the PNDL focuses primarily on a large number of small projects spread all
over the country, it is critical to have a strong M&E system in place . It is also important to
enable community oversight and engagement, to ensure that the commitments made are
actually carried through. This requires that project related data is made public, and the full
process is carried on in a transparent manner, with the community being involved
throughout – from the start of the project to actual completion.

280. Basic operations and maintenance issues should also be a corner stone of a
proper monitoring system. A large majority of communes have relatively limited resources




                                                                                                  119
for covering operation and maintenance costs for completed infrastructure investments. It
is therefore important to continuously track their investment portfolio and ensure that
they don’t move to far above the FSI threshold. If they do, there is a risk of having the
completed infrastructure fall into a vicious cycle of repair, neglect, repair.


Monitoring the absorption capacity of PNDL beneficiaries
281. One issue that the proposed Monitoring Committee could continu ally monitor is
the financial sustainability of potential beneficiaries of PNDL funds. More specifically, it
should be ensured that funds are allocated to public authorities that can subsequently
cover the operation and maintenance costs of the new investments they will do with those
funds. For a new health care facility, or a new school, a local authority will need to pay
electricity, heating, salaries of personnel, and general maintenance of the building. If too
many infrastructure investments are taken on, there is a risk of not being able to cover
those costs.

282. The Financial Sustainability Index, presented earlier, and discussed in more detail
in Annex 11, is a tool developed to help central managing authorities allocate funds in
more financially sustainable manner, and to allow public authorities to more efficiently
identify priorities. Ideally, central authorities should track capital investments done by sub-
national authorities every year, to ensure that they do not over-stretch themselves. Thus, if
a local authority, for example, seeks funding for a particular investment project, but has
already spent more than the designated prudent capital expenditure margin for a
programming period, then consideration should be given to whether the new project can
or should be financed.

Each sub-criterion above will be scored from 0 to 6.
With respect to projects, two to four hypothetical situations are provided, each of them
corresponding to a score (0, 1, 3, or 6). These hypothses are reference points in the
process of technical and financial evaluation of the project examined. The effective
scoring process with respect to a given sub-criterion will consider whether the project
fits between these reference points. Thus, one decimal scores can be assigned.
The score for each specific criterion reresents the arithmetic mean of the scores obtained for the
sub-criteria under the respective criterion. The project’s final score represents the average of the
scores obtained for the main criteria. After the technical and financial evaluation, only the projects
that get a minimum score of 3.5 qualify.

If a project scores 0 points with respect to at least one of the sub-criteria, it will be automatically
rejected.

             applicable). 3 pts .

2.2. The implementation methodology of the project (max. 6 pts.)
Both     a. The objectives of the project are clear and can be achieved in view of the
            project’s implementation. Project activities are clearly identified, detailed
            and closely linked within the implementation timeline to the tasks of the
            project team members and to the procurement planning . Project
            outcomes and output indicators are linked to the activities, and targets are
            feasible. Risks and appropriate risk management mechanisms are
            identified. 6 pts.
         b. Objectives can be partially achieved in view of the project’s

             mechanisms are ineffective. 3 pts.
          c. The objectives of the project are not realistic in view of the project’s
             implementation. Project activities are identified, but are neither linked
             within the implementation timeline to the tasks of the project team
             members, nor to the procurement planning. Project outcomes and output
             indicators are weakly linked to the activities, and targets are not feasible.

           comply with the relevant written parts. 6 pts.
        b. The data are sufficient and justified to a large extent. The analysis of
           alternatives is minimal. The estimation of the operating costs is largely
           realistic and/or related to the assumptions made. Corrections (related to
           externalities, taxation etc.) were partially and/or wrongly applied in the
           economic analysis. Rough estimates (general and itemized) are not fully
           related to the parts of the design. The designs are not complete and do not
           fully correspond to the written parts. 3 pts .
        c. The data are insufficient and/or weakly justified. Alternatives are not
           analyzed. The estimation of the operating costs is unrealistic and/or
           uncorrelated with the assumptions made. Corrections (related to
           externalities, taxation etc.) were not applied in the economic analysis.
           Rough estimates (general and itemized) are not correlated with the design
           parts. The designs are not complete and do not correspond to the written
           parts. 1 pt.

            project’s implementation. 6 pts.
         b. Budget is complete and partially correlated with the referred activities, with
            the allocated/estimated resources and with the general and itemized rough
            estimates. Costs are partially realistic (there are under/overestimated
            budget lines). 3 pts.
         c. Budget is incomplete and uncorrelated with the referred activities, with the
            allocated/estimated resources and with the general and itemized rough
            estimates. Costs are largely unrealistic (the majority of the budget lines are
            under/overestimated). 1 pt.

1.       Rural localities that did not receive any previous community
         support for similar investment

         Points are given only if no other similar investment has been
         financed in the same locality (in case a commune applies in the
         name of one or several component villages for an investment
         similar to that for which it previously obtained European funding,
         but for another/other component village/s, the respective
         commune does not receive any points; in the case of IDA, the
                                                                                    10
         association receives points only if none of the communes in
         which the investment is made did not previously benefit from
         other similar investments).

         Explanatory note: This criterion will be scored notwithstanding
         the category of beneficiary. Notwithstanding the category of
         beneficiary, in the case of integrated projects, this criterion will
         be scored according to the main action of the project (road;
         water and sewage, electricity, gas, transfer stations).

2.       Rural localities from regions with high degree of poverty                Maximum
                                                                                    10

         59.9%)............
         - localities with small degree of poverty (poverty rate <40%).........      5
         The scoring of this criterion will be made according to the List of
         rural localities with high degrees of poverty. The List is annexed
         to the Applicant’s Guide.
         Points are given only if the locality is identified in the List of
         localities with high degree of poverty, the score being
         established according to the poverty degree that belongs to the
         respective locality (in the case of a newly established commune,
         the degree of poverty of the commune from which it was
         separated will be taken into account; in the case of a commune



                                                                                            143
     split from a city, it will not receive points; in the case of an IDA,
     the component commune with the highest degree of poverty if
     the respective commune is a beneficiary of the main component
     of the project).
     Explanatory note: This criterion will be scored notwithstanding
     the category of beneficiary.
3.   Projects that fit into a local or county development strategy

     Points will be given only if the applicant shows an address from
     the County Council / Regional Development Agency

     Or

     The investment can be found in the purpose and objectives of the
                                                                             5
     respective IDA establishment (if the case).

     Points are given only if an Address issued by the County Council /
     Regional Development Agency and confirming that the
     investment fits in a local, county or regional strategy is annexed.

     Explanatory note: This criterion will be scored notwithstanding
     the category of beneficiary.

4.   Integrated investment projects

     An integrated project with a commune as beneficiary is
     considered to be the investment that aims at combining within
     the same project at least 2 actions from the same component or
     from different components of the same measure, as well as if
     the cumulated value of the secondary components represent at
     least 10% from the total eligible value of the integrated project.

     An integrated project with an IDA as beneficiary is considered to
     be the investment that aims at combining within the same                5
     project at least 2 actions from the same component or from
     different components of the same measure, and the cumulated
     value of the secondary components represents 10% of the total
     eligible value of the integrated project, as well as if the action
     that has the greater value of the total eligible value of the
     integrated project serves totally or partially the population from
     at least two communes from the IDA.

     The scoring of this criterion will be done only if it is present and
     proved in the Feasibility Study.




                                                                                 144

     the category of beneficiary.

5.   Investment projects in the water / wastewater infrastructure in
     rural localities between 2,000 and 10,000 population equivalent
     (p.e.) identified through the Regional Master Plans, but which
     are not financed by SOP Environment

     In the case of an integrated project, this criterion will be scored
     only if the water/wastewater investment has the greater value
     within the infrastructure component of the project.

     Points are given only if the project complies simultaneously with
     4 conditions:

     - to be a project for water / wastewater (the proposed
     investment has to aim at implementing of a functional water /
     wastewater system)

     - to be implemented in localities with at least 2,000 inhabitants      15
     equivalent persons and up to 10,000 inhabitants equivalent
     persons (in the case of IDA, all the component communes have
     to fulfill this condition)

     - the commune / the group of communes must be identified in
     the Regional Master plan

     - the project should not be financed through SOP Environment
     (in the case of IDA, none of the component communes in which
     the investment is made should benefit from funding via SOP
     Environment)

     Explanatory note: In the case of newly established communes,
     these have to fulfill the four criteria mentioned above; the
     Intermediate Body of SOP Environment offers information related
     to the equivalent population of these communes.

6.   Investment projects in the road infrastructure that ensures the
     connection with the main road ways (county and national
     roads) and with other main transport ways (railway and fluvial)

     The scoring of this criterion will be done only if it is present and   25
     proved in the Feasibility Study.

     In the case of an integrated project, this criterion will be scored
     only if the road investment has the majority value within the




                                                                                 145
     infrastructure component of the project.

7.   Investment projects in water infrastructure in the areas where
     water in insufficient or in the areas with high incidence of
     drought hazard

     The scoring of this criterion will be done only if it is present and
     proved with statistical data in the Feasibility Study.

     In the case of an integrated project, this criterion will be scored
     only if the water / wastewater investment has the majority value
     within the infrastructure component of the project.

     Points will be given only if the project is for the water supply       5
     network, and the locality in which the project will be
     implemented is on the List of localities with high aridity index or
     the project includes in the annex a Notice issued by the National
     Administration Romanian Waters, certifying the water

Annex 10: The Methodology for the elaboration of the LHDI

The Index of Local Human Development (LHDI) measures the total capital of localities,
looking in particular at four dimensions: human capital, health capital, vital capital, and
material capital. Single indicators are used to measure each of the first three stocks.
Material capital is assessed as a factor score of three specific indicators that focus on living
standards: dwelling space, private cars to 1000 residents, and distribution of gas for
household consumption in the particular territorial unit. The aggregation of the four
measures of the dimensions of community capital is achieved by another factor score. One
of the key advantages of LHDI is that it allows for comparison of very different localities,
urban or rural, small or large.
The LHDI Methodology




The measure was proposed and tested in 2011 and worked in a slightly different form, with
seven input indicators. 43 The current form adopted three modifications compared to the
initial version of the index:

of Social Research, I (1), 1-30.



                                                                                                                     161
     a) the indicators on material capital are integrated in an index before computing the
     final index;
     b) the indicator on the demographic size of locality was not included into the
     computation for LHDI due to its very high variation (e.g., from over two million
     inhabitants for București to only a few hundred for very small localities);
     c) very small localities of less than one thousands inhabitants are not included in the
     database. All localities (rural communes, especially) of less than one thousand are
     excluded from estimations.
The LHDI is similar to the Human Development Index (HDI) used by UNDP. Both of them
include measures of education, economic performance, and health. Only health is
measured by life expectancy of birth in both indices. GDP that is specific for HDI is usually
computed only for countries or large regional units.
The factor score aggregating the four LHDI indicators for the four forms of community
capital is converted to take a variation from about zero to about 100 by the Hull score=
50+14*factor score.
The comparison between 2002 and 2011 data was assured by putting locality data for both
years in the same database to generate different indices. LHDI values for counties or
regions are generated as weighted averages of locality values, with population as a
weighting factor.
LHDI is limited in the Romanian statistical system to measuring community capital at each
Census. This is due do the fact that data for measuring education stocks for each locality
are available only at censuses.
All the primary data have been provided by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS). NIS
also computed life expectancy at birth for each locality (for periods of three consecutive
years) and the average age of adult population.
The new index is a measure of local human capital if one expands the concept of human
capital to include not only education, but also health. 44 Adding the indicators of material
capital and age structure makes the index a measure of community capital. Its validity was
tested on large data sets and using the index as predictor and as dependent variable in
different multivariate analyses. 45
Poverty as measured by LHDI is not to be confused with simple aggregations of individual
or household poverty (headcount) indices. LHDI is a measure of the key stocks of
community capital in its human, vital, health, and material forms.

Annex 11. The Financial Sustainability Index for County Councils
and Local Councils


Financial Sustainability refers to the capacity of public authorities to cover operation and
maintenance costs once an investment has been made. A prudent approach in this sense
is to not spend more than 30% of non-earmarked revenues for capital expenses.
Earmarked revenues are those revenues that have to be spent with a particular purpose.
EU funds for example, are earmarked funds, as they can only be spent on certain issues.
Capital expenses generally represent non-recurrent expenses, such as investments in
infrastructure. Non-earmarked revenues are revenues that can be spent by public
authorities at will, within the boundaries of the law. For our purposes, non-earmarked
revenues were calculated using the following formula:

      Non-Earmarked Revenues = (Own Revenues) + (Shared Personal Income Tax) +
                              (Non-Earmarked Grants) + (Other Revenues)

The following steps were taken in the elaboration of the FSI:
    1. Creating a comprehensive database on budget execution (simplified form
         provided by the Treasury, within the Ministry of Finance) for all territorial
         administrative units in Romania for the period 2008-2012.
    2. Determining the non-revenue of special administrative units (default by law) up to
         the local authorities for the period 2008 to 2012 (Non-Earmarked Revenues)
    3. The analysis of LGUs (Local Government Units) revenue in the last five years
         (2008-2012) and the determination of possible future trends for the period 2014-
         2022.
    4. Determining aggregate non-earmarked revenues for 2014-2020 and taking 30%
         out of it – i.e. the prudent capital expenditure margin for 2014-2022.

Several scenarios were considered to estimate aggregate non-earmarked revenues for
2014-2020: a pessimistic, an average, and an optimistic scenario. These scenarios took
into consideration past budget growth rates for different types of localities and territorial
administrative units.

The prudent capital expenditure margins for county councils and local councils are
included in the tables below.

Note: The allocation of fund by county was done by following the steps below:

1. Determining county weights based on the Total Real Ranking, as follows:
   County Weight for County i = 100 – Total Real Ranking for County i
2. Determining percentage share for each county:
   Percentage Share for County i = [(County weight for County i)/(County weight for County 1 + County weight for County 2 + … + County weight for
   County n)]*100
3. Determining PNDL allocation of funds by county and by sector:
   PNDL Funding Allocation for County Roads for County i = (Percentage Share for County i)*(PNDL Funding Allocation for County Roads for 2014 -
   2020)

Note: The allocation of fund by county was done by following the steps below:
1. Determining county weights based on the Total Real Ranking, as follows:
    County Weight for County i = 100 – Total Real Ranking for County i
2. Determining percentage share for each county:
    Percentage Share fo r County i = [(County weight for County i)/(County weight for County 1 + County weight for County 2 + … + County weight for
    County n)]*100
3. Determining PNDL allocation of funds by county and by sector:
    PNDL Funding Allocation for Communal Roads for County i = (Percentage Share for County i)*(PNDL Funding Allocation for Communal Roads for
    2014-2020)

Note: The allocation of fund by county was done by following the steps below:
1. Determining county weights based on the Total Real Ranking, as follows:
    County Weight for County i = 100 – Total Real Ranking for County i
2. Determining percentage share for each county:
    Percentage Share for County i = [(County weight for County i)/(County weight for County 1 + County weight for County 2 + … + County weight for
    County n)]*100
3. Determining PNDL allocation of funds by county and by sector:
    PNDL Funding Allocation for Water and Wastewater Infrastructure for County i = (Percentage Share for County i)*(PNDL Funding Allocation for
    Water and Wastewater Infrastructure for 2014-2020)
