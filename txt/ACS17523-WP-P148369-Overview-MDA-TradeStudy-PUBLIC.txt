        1. Introduction
1. Despite strong economic growth since 2000, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries
   in the region. Excessive reliance on remittances, export dependency on a few products, and
   insufficient domestic job creation make the Moldovan economy highly vulnerable to external
   conditions. Although the country grew at an annual average of 4.9 percent between 2000 and 2014
   (Figure 1) and managed to significantly reduce poverty (Figure 2), it remains the second poorest
   country in the region with a 46 percent poverty rate according to the regional poverty line of
   US$5/day.

2. As a small and open economy, Moldova’s development potential is linked to its trade and
   investment integration strategy. Moldova is situated between two large markets: the European
   Union (EU), which absorbs more than half of Moldova’s exports, and the Russian Federation. As
   the economy has become more open over the last 20 years, the value of trade has quadrupled.
   However, Moldova has not been able to fully benefit from foreign trade opportunities.
3. Reducing the economic distance to large regional markets and reaping the benefits of
   openness is key to overcoming Moldova's structural constraints and spurring export-led
   growth. Recognizing this challenge, Moldova’s national development strategy (“Moldova 2020”)
   aims to move from “a remittance- and consumption-driven model of growth to an export-driven
   model in order to reduce the economy’s vulnerabilities and spur job creation.” The expansion of
   exports of goods and services, at the center of the new development model, will require attracting
   foreign investment to facilitate participation in regional value chains, and encouraging productivity
   upgrading and innovation, so as to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. Signing and
   implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the EU
   opens new opportunities for local enterprises. More generally, a regulatory framework needs to be
   improved for Moldovan companies to increase the value they get from goods and services they
   export to both traditional and new markets.
4. The objective of the Moldova Trade Study is to contribute to a better understanding of the
   factors and challenges underlying Moldova’s foreign trade performance and to identify

                                                                                                         9
    policy interventions that can enhance the competitiveness of Moldova’s exporting firms and the
    value added of their exports.
5. The report is structured in two parts. The first part consists of two chapters (Notes 1 and 2),
   and provides an assessment of overall trade competitiveness and trade policy options.
6. Note 1 examines Moldova’s trade competitiveness. It assesses Moldova’s export performance
   over the last 15 years, looking at growth, diversification, sophistication and survival patterns, and
   benchmarking Moldova’s performance against that of comparator countries. It looks at
   productivity challenges that firms face, and in particular at how different dimensions of the
   business climate affect their productivity.
7. Note 2 looks carefully at Moldova’s different trade policy options. It examines, specifically,
   the impact of eight alternative trade policy scenarios (including the DCFTA with the EU, the
   Customs Union (CU) with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, and others) on GDP growth, trade
   growth, and inequality. It relies on a dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE) model for
   these purposes.
8. The second part of the study consists of two additional notes (Notes 3 and 4), which take
   sectoral lenses to examine trade competitiveness challenges.
9. Note 3 examines the challenges of the agricultural sector in Moldova. The sector plays a key
   role in Moldova’s export bundle, and it is also an important employer in the economy. The note
   draws on existing work on the matter for Moldova and proposes some policy recommendations to
   increase competitiveness and to comply with EU standards in the face of further integration with
   that bloc.
10. Note 4 looks at the role that free economic zones (FEZ) have had on the Moldovan economy
    as a tool to accelerate industrialization. The setup of free economic zones has been probably the
    most important pillar of the country’s investment policy. Most of the new manufacturing activity
    operates from such zones, and four-fifths of their output is actually exported. Yet, there is a lot of
    heterogeneity in how different economic zones in Moldova operate and perform. Some policy
    recommendations, drawing on international experience, are presented.
11. There are 10 main messages that emerge from this report:
       Since 2000, exports have been growing, but the growth has been relatively less dynamic
        than the growth of imports and the gross domestic product. Furthermore, and in particular
        until 2007, Moldova’s export performance has also lagged behind that of other comparable
        countries in the region in terms of their size, proximity to the EU, and status of their transition
        economies.

       Diversification of markets and products accounted for a sizable and increasing portion
        of export growth. Indeed, Moldova’s export product scope increased from 337 varieties in
        2003 to 393 in 2013, and the destination scope increased from 61 countries to 103 over the
        same period. Yet, the product and destination scope of Moldova’s export basket lags behind
        that of comparator countries.

       Foreign direct investment (FDI), crucial to boost export competitiveness, declined after
        2007, and remained low since then. At 3.11 percent of GDP in 2013, it is dwarfed by
        Albania’s 9.7 percent, or of Georgia’s 6.15 percent. FDI attraction has been crucial to

                                                                                                        10
    increasing the technological content and sophistication of exports, and has the potential to
    connect the Moldovan economy to dynamic regional and global production networks, and to
    increase productivity, economy-wide, through technology and knowledge spillovers.

   Some of Moldova’s free economic zones have been important in attracting FDI, through
    tax incentives and streamlined customs procedures. Industrial production (mostly export
    oriented) and employment have increased in the zones. However, performance has been
    heterogeneous across the zones and foreign firms operating within them maintain few linkages
    with domestic economies—crucial elements for productivity spillovers to materialize. Free
    economic zones can be powerful tools for productive development insofar as their experiences
    in terms of gains from streamlining customs procedures and other government regulations can
    be internalized and extrapolated to the rest of the economy.

   Structural business climate reforms are likely more effective to retain FDI and encourage
    investment and innovation than tax incentives. Our results reveal that lengthy customs and
    import licensing procedures have an adverse impact on firms’ productivity. Each day that
    companies have to wait to clear customs is associated with a productivity decline of 0.5
    percent. This is likely why streamlined customs procedures offered by Moldova’s free
    economic zones are seen by the private sector as one of their main advantages.

   Corruption has an adverse effect on firm performance and productivity, affecting the
    attractiveness of Moldova as an investment destination. Moldovan firms that allegedly used
    informal payments and gifts to deal with customs procedures and with the courts had lower
    productivity levels than their counterparts. Specifically, firms that relied on bribes were
    between 6 and 7 percent less productive than their counterparts.

   Deepening trade and investment integration is crucial for the country’s long-term
    development prospects. The DCFTA that Moldova and the EU signed and started
    implementing in 2014 offers Moldova a unique opportunity to reach a more sustainable
    economic growth path. This is revealed by our simulation results undertaken using the DCGE
    model. First, the DCFTA scenarios are associated with higher economic growth in Moldova
    over the next decade, compared with other options. Second, scenarios with higher FDI lead to
    better economic outcomes compared to scenarios without enhanced inflows.

   Trade facilitation appears to be the most promising vehicle for economic development,
    compared to all other factors under the DCFTA. According to the model, trade facilitation
    would explain almost two-thirds of the potential higher growth obtained under the full
    implementation of the DCFTA with the EU. Of course, if the country’s trade facilitation efforts
    fell short of modelled ambitious reduction in trading cost, only a fraction of this potential would
    materialize. It is also worth mentioning that while the pay offs for the trade facilitation efforts
    are somehow influenced by the increased market access that the DCFTA represents, unilateral
    reforms conducive to trade facilitation are likely to have substantial pay offs, independently of
    the decision of Moldova to join the DCFTA with the EU.

   Moldova’s growth could slow down if it joined the CU, but higher FDI inflows could
    compensate for this negative effect. According to the model, the most negative effect in case

                                                                                                    11
    Moldova joins the CU would be from the EU setting the MFN rate on all imports from
    Moldova. The net effect of the CU may become positive if Moldova processes the needed
    reforms to attract higher FDI flows.

   Key to maximizing gains from the DCFTA with the EU is to enhance Moldova’s
    agricultural competitiveness to ensure access of its agro-food products to the EU market.
    This includes:
     enhancing production processes by using fertilizers and pesticides appropriately;
     increasing quality through improving harvest and post-harvest processes and
       infrastructure;
     supporting producers’ learning and understanding of product characteristics demanded in
       end markets; and
     supporting organic farming as a way to differentiate products and compete in high-value-
       added market segments.
12. This overview combines the main messages of those four notes. The rest of the note is
    structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the analysis of Moldova’s export performance.
    Section 3 focuses on constraints on Moldova’s competitiveness. In Section 4, we consider
    alternative trade policy scenarios and their implications for the Moldovan economy. Section 5
    synthetizes existing analysis on constraints for agriculture competitiveness and exports, while
    Section 6 evaluates the performance of free economic zones in Moldova. In the final section,
    we present policy recommendations.



    2. Analysis of Export Performance
13. Moldova is highly integrated into the global marketplace. The country’s trade-to-GDP ratio
    of 125 percent is substantially higher than its regional comparators’ (Figure 3). In contrast to
    its peers, however, Moldova has failed to deepen its relative trade openness over the last
    decade. While trade expanded substantially, from US$1,250 million in 2000 to US$7,800
    million in 2013, income per capita grew even more at an average rate of 5.8 percent.
14. The recent expansion of merchandise trade in Moldova has been mainly driven by
    imports. Imports experienced a six-fold increase between 2000 and 2013, growing at an
    average annual rate of 16 percent. Exports have been less dynamic, growing at a slower average
    annual rate of 13 percent and experiencing a 20 percent decrease in 2009 (Figure 4a). Although
    export growth resumed in 2013, the trade balance remained negative during the 2000-13
    period. Moldova’s export performance compares poorly with regional peers. Re-exports, on
    the other hand, have been relatively more dynamic than exports, and while the domestic
    manufacturing value added embedded in them is zero, re-exports have been associated with
    increased exports of Moldovan transport services.
15. Trade in services has achieved greater dynamism than trade in goods. Indeed, during the
    last decade, exports of services have grown faster than imports (Figure 4b). While the services
    export growth averaged 16.5 percent per year, imports grew at an annual average 13.9 percent.

               16. FDI inflows to Moldova increased tenfold between 2002 and 2007, reaching 12 percent of
                   GDP in 2007, but decreased sharply after the global crisis and remained low since then.
                   The share of FDI in GDP in 2013, at 3.11 percent, is still higher than average for countries at
                   a similar level of development, but substantially lower than exhibited by other countries in the
                   region, particularly those with trade agreements with the EU.



                                                                                                                                        13
           17. The composition of Moldova’s main export basket has shifted in the past decade, with
               exports of machinery and fruits and vegetables increasing in importance at the expense
               of foodstuffs and textiles. Wine, the top export product in 2003, fell to the fourth place in
               2013, in part due to trade restrictions imposed by Russia, Moldova’s main wine importer, and
               also to the dynamism of other export products. Indeed, in 2013, the main export products were
               coaxial cables and other electric conductors, mainly produced by a handful of foreign firms
               (Table 1).

           18. The destination structure of the export basket has also changed recently, as Moldova has
               progressively decreased its traditional export dependence on the Russian market. The
               share of Moldovan exports going to Russia decreased from 39.5 percent in 2003 to 14 percent
               in 2013 (Table 2). Russia is now the second main destination after Romania, which in 2013
               received 19 percent of Moldovan exports. Indeed, exports to Romania tripled between 2010
               and 2013. In recent years, new markets, such as China, Egypt, and Turkey, have gained
               salience among top export destinations.

           19. A steady growth in product diversification underlies the change in composition of the
               export basket. Moldova has diversified its export product base, with the number of varieties
               exported growing from 274 in 2000 to 393 in 2013. Still, the export product scope remains low
               compared with that of other countries in the region (see Table 3).
           20. Moldova has also diversified its export destination structure. Export destinations grew
               from 63 to 103 from 2003-13, rising above the destination scope of countries such as Albania
               or Georgia (see Table 3). In addition, Moldova significantly decreased its reliance on markets
               in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), and shifted toward European countries.
               There is scope for further diversification and for expanding trade ties with more distant
               markets.

21. The observed diversification contributed substantially to export growth. As            Figure 5
    shows, in 2005-08, 86 percent of total export growth was explained by more sales of the same
    products to the same destinations, while a sizable 13 percent growth resulted from
    diversification along the market destination, that is, more exports of the same products to new
    markets. In 2010-13, the importance of diversification along the market dimension experienced
    a marked increase, accounting for over 60 percent of export growth. The new products
    introduced accounted for a sizeable 9 percent export growth in recent years. This suggests that
    the new markets reached, and the new products introduced are far from being negligible in
    export dynamics.

22. Moldova’s export basket has experienced a quality upgrade between 2003 and 2013. Most
    of the country’s traditional exports, including wine in bottles, apple juice, spirits, and walnuts,
    have experienced increases in their relative quality. Some of Moldova’s new top products, such

                                                                                                                   15
   as coaxial cables and parts of seats, rank high in terms of their relative quality. However, when
   compared with peers, the quality level of Moldova’s exports, as measured by the prices they
   fetch in international markets, is low.
23. The sophistication of Moldova’s exports has not changed substantially in the last 10
    years. The evolution of this indicator is important because as argued by Hausmann and Rodrik,
    the level of sophistication of exports is a predictor of a country’s future growth. Moldova’s
    EXPY increased between 2000 and 2008, more rapidly between 2003 and 2006, in part
    reflecting the increased significance of apples and wheat, as the wine sector declined. The
    EXPY fell after 2009 and, while experiencing a moderate increase in 2013, it remains below
    its 2000 level. Indeed, the country’s export sophistication has lagged behind the country’s
    growth during the last decade. It is also low when compared with other countries in the region
    (see Table 3).

24. Moldova’s export survival rates are significantly below those of comparators. The
    probability of a Moldovan export relationship surviving past the first year is slightly above 40
    percent (Figure 6a). The chance of surviving past the second year is significantly smaller (26
    percent). In comparison, benchmark countries exhibit a stronger performance in terms of
    export survival. Poland’s one-year survival rate, for example, is almost 20 percentage points
    above Moldova’s. Moldova only outperforms Georgia—another country with serious
    challenges to consolidate export flows in international markets.

25. The chances of survival of export relationships vary according to destination and export
    product. Exports to preferential trade partners Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus have the
    highest survival rates (Figure 6b). Exports of foodstuffs, vegetables, and other low-technology
    products have the highest survival rates.

         3. Constraints on Moldova’s Export Competitiveness
   26. Firm productivity is key to export competitiveness. In Moldova, the environment in which
       firms operate seems to affect their ability to upgrade and compete in the global marketplace.
       We focused on supply-side considerations, such as access to finance, the quality of backbone
       services, and the business environment (in particular, government regulations affecting trade
       and governance and institutional quality). We assessed Moldova’s performance in these areas
       and investigated their effect on a firm’s productivity.1

   27. Within Moldova, productivity levels vary across regions, sectors, and types of firms.
       Firms in the northern city of Balti, the third largest in the country after Chisinau and Tiraspol,
       exhibit the highest median levels of total factor productivity (TFP), followed by firms in other
       cities within the northern region. By contrast, firms in the South appear to be the least
       productive (Figure 7). In addition, firms that are export-oriented, foreign-owned, and that
       innovate show productivity premia when compared to other firms of similar size, age, and
       sector of operation (Figure 8). Productivity is also heterogeneous across sectors.
       Manufacturing firms appear to be less productive than firms in the services sectors. The median
       level of TFP for manufacturing is lower than the median productivity level for construction,
       retail, and other services but higher than in transport services. However, manufacturing firms
       exhibit higher levels of productivity than companies in the transport sector.

    For these purposes, we use firm-level data from the World Bank/EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise
   Performance Survey (BEEPS).

                                                                                                               18
3.1    Linking Productivity and Quality of Backbone Services
28. In Moldova, firms perceive access to finance as the main obstacle to their operations.
    Figure 9 shows the percentage of firms that perceive access to finance, and the quality of
    electricity, transport, and telecommunications, as at least a moderate obstacle. While more than
    40 percent of respondents said access to finance was at least a moderate obstacle, 30 percent
    said poor quality of electricity was a problem. A lower, but still considerable, proportion of
    firms identified transport and telecommunications as a problem.
29. Moldova’s competitiveness remains hindered by a series of supply-side obstacles,
    including poor factors conditions, weak infrastructure and backbone services, and an
    inefficient business environment. In line with responders’ perceptions, Moldovan firms
    confront significantly high cost and limited access to external funds. Indeed, almost 70 percent
    of all investments in fixed assets are financed with internal funds. High reliance on internal
    funds and high collateral requirements are associated with lower TFP levels. More precisely,
    a 1 percent increase in the required collateral decreases productivity by 0.5 percent.
30. Weak electricity and water services also undermine productivity. Power outages,
    irrespective of their duration, are associated with lower productivity levels. All else equal, the
    productivity of those firms that reportedly experienced power outages in the year of the survey
    was almost 3 percent lower than the productivity of those that did not suffer interruptions in
    their power supplies. In addition, the longer a firm has to wait to establish a water connection
    in a new facility, the greater its productivity loss. In fact, for each additional day that a firm
    has to wait to get water supply, productivity falls by 0.11 percent.

3.2    Governance and Institutional Quality
31. Moldova’s customs procedures and inadequate trade logistics are a constraint on
    productivity and competitiveness. Several recent surveys of importers and exporters
    (including potential exporters) yielded strong indications that logistics and customs are
    considered key obstacles and constraints to growth in Moldova’s foreign trade, especially for
    exports. Anecdotal evidence from discussions with firms in Chisinau confirmed that logistics

                                                                                                   19
   is a problem for their operations. Our findings confirm that lengthy customs and import
   licensing procedures have an adverse impact on firms’ productivity. Each day that companies
   have to wait to clear customs is associated with a productivity decline of 0.5 percent. This is
   likely why streamlined customs procedures offered by Moldova’s free economic zones are
   seen as one of their main advantages.
32. There is negative premium—or “bribe tax”—associated with corruption. Corruption has
    an adverse effect on firm performance and productivity. Moldovan firms that used informal
    payments and gifts to deal with customs procedures and with the courts had lower productivity
    levels than their counterparts. Specifically, firms that relied on bribes were between 6 and 7
    percent less productive than their counterparts.



4. Modeling of Trade Policy Options for Moldova
33. In the decade between 2005 and 2014, the EU became the main trading partner of
    Moldova. The total volume of trade in goods between Moldova and the EU expanded 160
    percent, from about US$1.5 billion in 2005 to US$3.8 billion in 2014, making the EU the most
    important trading partner of Moldova.
34. Moldova’s export basket to the EU has been changing over the last 10 years. Compared
    to 2005, the top 10 exports to the EU included five new product categories in 2013. The most
    important change has been the substitution of raw hides and skins (main export in 2005) by
    equipment for distributing electricity, which includes mainly coaxial electric cables. In 2013,
    this product category alone accounted for 19 percent of total Moldovan exports to the EU.
    Another noticeable change has been the emergence of alcoholic beverages (primarily, grapes
    wines) in the top 10 exports to the EU. Notwithstanding the growth in trade volumes, the trade
    deficit with the EU increased, indicating the still low competitiveness of Moldovan producers
    in the EU market. The trade deficit between Moldova and the EU more than doubled over a
    decade to US$1.3 billion in 2014, much higher compared with Moldova’s trade balances with
    Russia and other CIS countries (Figure 10).

35. The expansion of trade with the EU was in fact stimulated through a series of trade policy
    actions, most recently, by signing an Association Agreement (AA). In 2006, the EU granted
    preferential treatment for Moldovan exports through the Generalized System of Preferences
    (GSP), which was extended soon after to GSP “plus” (2007), and then replaced by the more
    comprehensive Autonomous Trade Preferences (2008). On June 27, 2014, Moldova and the
    EU signed the AA. The AA is of a “new generation” type, aiming to set up an all-encompassing
    framework for bilateral relations. As part of the AA, the two parties agreed to establish a
    DCFTA over a period of 10 years. The free trade area is “deep and comprehensive” since it
    encompasses a far-reaching regulatory approximation (on the Moldovan side) and
    liberalization of trade in services, in compliance with WTO rules.
36. The DCFTA will remove import duties for most goods traded between the EU and
    Moldova and will support regulatory harmonization between Moldova and the EU. The
    DCFTA will also provide for broad mutual access to trade in services. It includes provisions
    on commercial law, to allow the EU and Moldovan companies to set up subsidiaries on a non-
    discriminatory basis. An important part of the DCFTA is aligning Moldovan trade-related laws
    to selected EU legislative acts. Moldova shall take the necessary measures to gradually achieve
    conformity with the EU's technical regulations and standards.
37. There are some exceptions to the elimination of customs duties by the EU. Duty-free
    quotas apply to nine product positions. This may affect apples and grapes, in particular. Anti-
    circumvention mechanisms are introduced as a precautionary measure for 14 categories of
    agricultural and processed goods exported from Moldova to the EU. Fixed-rate import duties
    will remain in place on products subject to the EU’s Entry Price System (EPS). While,
    according to the AA, the ad valorem tariff for 20 positions will be cut, the fixed component of
    the import duty will remain in place, effectively raising the cost of Moldovan exports up to the
    level of the minimal entry price established for the products falling under the EPS.
38. Moldova agreed to eliminate all its customs duties. However, a number of transition
    periods and protectionist measures apply in its case. Elimination of some duties will take
    place gradually, while others are subject to duty-free quotas. As of the AA’s entry into force,
    many of the EU products imported by Moldova were already duty-free. Almost 46 percent of
    the goods imported from the EU were already covered by zero percent MFN import duty. For
    another 47 percent of the traded goods, there was an immediate reduction of tariffs as of the
    date of entry into force of the AA. Aside from the goods covered by tariff–free quotas, Jan.1,
    2024, is the latest date when full liberalization of EU products imported by Moldova needs to
    be achieved.

    Box 1: Assessing the Impact of Different Trade Policy Options Using a DCGE Model

    The impact assessment of the DCFTA and of other trade policy options that Moldova faces was conducted
    using a DCGE Model. The model is an extended and adjusted version of the standard model described by Lofgren
    et al (2002). 2 The model assumes that economic agents have only adaptive expectations, i.e., no inter-temporal
    optimization decisions are made, which allows the model to be solved as a sequence of equilibriums in time.
    Changes in the factors endowment (capital as endogenous variable, labor as exogenous one), total population and
    in a number of trade related parameters (customs duties, and regional export and import prices) are determining the

    model’s time-dynamics. Capital endowment updates based on a function that considers the sector-specific returns
    on capital investments and the previous shares of the sector in the total distributed investment capital.
    This model is calibrated on the basis of Moldova’s Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for 2011. The Moldova’s
    SAM has a high level of disaggregation, including 14 types of economic activities, 35 produced goods and services,
    three types of transaction costs, six types of factors of production, households disaggregated by quintiles and areas
    of residence, government, five types of taxes, including the custom duties disaggregated by geographical region
    and by goods, and six geographical regions with which Moldova conducts its international trade.3
    To allow for simulation of all scenarios of interest, the model includes six trading regions. The trade regions
    that SAM operates with are the following: 1) Russia; 2) Belarus and Kazakhstan; 3) Other CIS countries; 4) EU28;
    5) Turkey and 6) Rest of the World. Isolating Russia from the other two members of the CU—Belarus and
    Kazakhstan—is necessary to simulate the impact of its trade restrictions on imports from Moldova. The trade
    restrictions has not been embraced by Belarus and Kazakhstan. Inclusion of Turkey as a distinct trade region has
    been determined by the fact that Moldova and Turkey negotiated and signed a FTA, which was the EU’s
    precondition for the DCFTA with Moldova (Turkey is in the CU with the EU).
    Eight alternative trade policy scenarios are considered. While trade parameters vary across all these scenarios,
    a number of core parameters are identical. The same changes in labor and in population have been imposed
    exogenously in all scenarios, based on the observed dynamics over the recent decade. To reflect the high share of
    informal activity in the Moldovan economy, self-employment in the agricultural sector and self-employment in
    other sectors have been introduced in the model as distinct factors of production. Due to migration and a decline in
    fertility rates, the labor endowment is assumed to continue its decade-long trend and will decline over the next
    decade by 0.5 percent annually, while self-employment will decline by 1.8 percent annually in all sectors. The
    rural population will decline by 0.2 percent, while the urban one will decline by 0.1 percent on an annual basis. The
    productive capital depreciates at a rate of 5.0 percent, which corresponds to the observed statistical data in the
    recent five years. The TFP is projected to stay unchanged throughout the period.

39. What is the expected impact of this DCFTA with the EU? How does it fare against
    alternative options that Moldovan authorities currently have? A DCGE model was used
    to assess the impact of different trade policy option (see Box 1 for details, and Note 2 for a
    more in-depth discussion).
40. Six scenarios have been simulated using the DCGE to reflect the variety of hypothetical
    trade policy options for Moldova.
          2013 Policy Baseline. This scenario assumes that there is no DCFTA, FTA with Turkey,
           accession of Moldova to a CU with Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan (RBK) nor Russian
           trade restrictions. The EU maintains the unilateral trade preferences it offered to Moldova
           (Autonomous Trade Preferences). Under this scenario, real GDP is expected to grow 59
           percent cumulatively over the period 2014-23. This corresponds to an average annual GDP
           growth rate of 4.8 percent, which reflects the average growth rate of the Moldovan GDP in
           the period 2004-13.


3
  Moldova’s data available for the calibration of the CGE model are of decent quality and reliab le. One important
feature is that the data do not cover production and consumption in the Transnistrian region and only partially cover
the trade of that region. Because of this, the System of National Accounts includes some sectors (such as metallurgy,
footwear and others) for which the reported domestic production (that does not include Transnistria) is smaller than
the reported volume of exports (that includes Transnistria). Another data limitation is the lack of sufficient
disaggregation of the agricultural sector in the SNA. Because of this, and considering the EU –Moldova agreed
schedule of tariff concessions, additional research and estimates were necessary to disaggregate the sector into a more
detailed structure.

                                                                                                                       22
          DCFTA with the EU (DCFTA). This scenario assumes the following: Moldova reduces
           tariffs on goods imported from the EU and Turkey, removes barriers on services imports
           from the EU, and implements trade facilitation reforms; Moldovan food manufacturing
           companies adopt sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) standards and benefit from higher price
           margins by moving up along the value chain in international markets; the EU removes
           import tariffs on goods and reduces barriers on service imports from Moldova; Turkey
           implements its part of the free trade agreement with Moldova; Russia introduces trade
           sanctions against Moldovan imports that dissipate in three years. Within this scenario,
           separate effects of the parameters mentioned above have been modeled.
          DCFTA with higher FDI inflows (DCFTA+FDI). The third scenario is identical to the
           previous one for all trade parameters. An additional feature is that, following improvements
           in the business climate triggered by the DCFTA, inflows of FDI into the Moldovan
           economy start growing in 2017 (improvements need time to materialize and get observed
           by investors) at a rate of 10 percent annually.4

    Box 2: Association Agreements with the EU and FDI Inflows

    The “EU-factor” played the key role in this growth of FDI, as suggested by existing literature. This figure is a
    conservative one, as the historical evidence from the EU association of the Central European countries shows much
    higher rates of growth of FDI following association with the EU. The simple annual average growth rate of FDI in
    the CEECs between 1991 (when the first Association Agreements between the EU and CEECs were signed) and
    2004 exceeds 50 percent. The literature argues that the accession process had first the largest impact on capital
    flows and subsequently on the flow of goods. The biggest beneficiaries were those CEECs countries that
    implemented more radical liberal reforms. Combined with preferential access to EU markets, these reforms have
    attracted FDI. The EU provided an outlet first for CEECs’ unskilled labor-intensive products and then for skilled
    labor-intensive and technology-based products. The EU has also been the source of knowledge-intensive imports
    contributing to industrial realignment in CEECs. The prospect of accession and an unfettered access to EU markets
    since 1998 has encouraged more multinational corporations to relocate their production to the CEECs.

          Moldova joins the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. In this scenario,
           Moldova joins the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan5. On the Moldovan
           side, this implies denouncing the DCFTA, raising its customs duties for the non-CU
           countries to the MFN level of the CU countries and reducing them almost to zero for the
           CU members (“almost” reflects the fact that some goods traded among the current CU
           members are nonetheless subject to duties). Under this scenario, Russia does not impose
           trade restrictions and offers Moldova a 30 percent bonus in natural gas prices. This scenario
           also assumes that the EU would abolish its unilateral trade preferences offered to Moldova
           and raise duties on imports from Moldova up to the EU MFN rate. The impact is modeled
           through changes in exporters’ prices. The scenario assumes no changes in the trade policy
           of other CIS members as long as Moldova respects the multilateral FTA in the CIS area.
           However, because the CU’s applied MFN rate is higher than the bound rate Moldova
           committed to as a member of the World Trade Organization, Turkey and the rest of the

  The growth of FDI has been modeled through corresponding changes in the volume of capital transfers of the rest of
the world to Moldovan enterprises, which are included as separate institutions in the Moldova DCGE model.

  The Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan was a basis for establishment of the Eurasian Economic
Union (EEU) that came into force on January 1, 2015. During 2015, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan also joined the EEU.

                                                                                                                   23
      world would be entitled to increase their tariffs on imports from Moldova by a rate equal to
      the difference between Moldova’s final bound rate and the CU RBK applied MFN rate.
      Similar to the DCFTA scenario, separate effects of the parameters mentioned above have
      been modeled within this scenario.
     Moldova joins CU with higher FDI inflows. This scenario assumes that Moldova is able to
      improve the business climate without the DCFTA in place and this improvement is followed
      by an annual 10 percent growth of the FDI starting with 2017. This scenario has been
      introduced to compare with the other two scenarios involving FDI. All other changes in
      trade parameters for Moldova and its trade partners are those from the previous scenario.
     Abolishing FTAs and imposing MFN rate to all trading partners. In the final scenario,
      Moldova takes no sides, abolishes all its FTAs and imposes MFN duty rates against all
      trading partners. As an important note, the MFN duty rate has been calculated within the
      model as the maximum regional rate imposed for the given aggregated group of products.
      It is assumed that while imposing the MFN for all partners, Moldova respects its WTO
      commitments regarding the final bound rates. Therefore, neither Turkey nor the rest of the
      world have grounds for retaliation. Russia does not impose trade restrictions on any
      Moldovan goods (because Moldova does not integrate with the EU), but it imposes the MFN
      rate and so do Belarus, Kazakhstan, and all other members of the CIS because Moldova
      effectively denounces the multilateral free trade agreement in the CIS area. Under this
      scenario, the EU would withdraw the Autonomous Trade Preferences it offers to Moldova.
41. Increased free trade with the EU and higher FDI inflows improve economic outcomes the
    most. Figure 11 shows the impact of each of the scenarios on GDP relative to the baseline and
    leads to two conclusions. First, the DCFTA scenarios are associated with higher economic
    growth in Moldova over the next decade, compared with the CU, MFN and the 2013 policy
    baseline. Second, scenarios with higher FDI—both the DCFTA and the CU—lead to better
    economic outcomes compared to scenarios without enhanced inflows.

42. DCFTA and DCFTA plus FDI seem to be the best development scenarios for Moldova.
    A fully implemented DCFTA coupled with improvements in Moldova’s attractiveness for
    foreign capital, will result in a total GDP gain amounting to 10 percentage points annually
    compared to the baseline. Without higher FDI, the annual growth benefit will be still a high
    7.9 percentage points, if the DCFTA is fully implemented. Of course, if reforms that are part
    of the DCFTA are only partially implemented, gains are expected to be lower.
43. Trade facilitation is the most promising vehicle for economic development, compared to
    all other factors under the DCFTA. In total, according to the model, trade facilitation would
    explain almost two-thirds (or 4.9 percentage points of the total 7.9 percentage points) of
    potential higher growth. The simulated one-third reduction in trade-related transaction costs
    would provide 2.7 percentage point gains to the GDP in the case of export facilitation and 2.2
    percentage points in case of imports facilitation (see Figure 12). Notice that trade facilitation
    reforms could well be implemented unilaterally by Moldova, independently of the decision of
    Moldova to join the DCFTA. While this was not formally modelled, these reforms are likely
    to positively affect growth.

44. Moldova risks losing almost 2 percentage points of growth if it joins the CU, but higher
    FDI inflows could compensate this negative effect. As shown in Figure 13, joining the CU
    would involve many changes in Moldova’s trade conditions. The results show that the EU
    abolishing its ATP and setting the MFN rate on imports from Moldova would have the most
    negative effect. The amount of the gas price bonus (30 percent discount) would be too small
    to compensate for the associated economic losses. The effect of the CU may become positive—
    2.2 percentage points on average—if Moldova attracts higher FDI.

45. The least favorable scenario for Moldova would be adoption of the MFN against all
    partners. In this scenario, the GDP would decline in real terms (i.e. not only against the
    baseline path) in the first three years after imposing this policy, and then it would start growing
    very slowly. Despite the initial shock deviating the economy (significantly) from the optimal
    trajectory, capital would continue to accumulate, while foreign trade would continue, even
    with smaller profit margins for exporters and lower utility for consumers. Nonetheless, under
    this scenario, there is a remarkable divergence of the growth path even from the baseline,
    meaning that in time the conditions would get only worse.



5. Enhancing Moldova’s Agriculture Competitiveness
46. The agriculture and agri-food sector has been a substantial component of Moldova’s
    export basket. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts comprised 33 percent of Moldova’s exports from
    2011-13. Exports have grown significantly over the past 10 years, and food products represent
    the second-largest category of Moldovan exports, with a 26 percent share and average value
    of US$370 million during 2011-13, up from US$238 million in 2000-01. Agriculture and agri-
    food products are also among the priorities for Moldovan exports and for Moldovan authorities
    to further support the development of small and medium enterprises.
47. Enhancing Moldova’s agricultural competitiveness is a key element in improving its
    access for Moldovan agro-food products to the EU market and capitalizing on the
    potential benefits from the AA (including the DCFTA). The challenge of strengthening
    competitiveness and reorienting a substantial portion of Moldova’s agro-food exports towards
    the EU appears today more pressing than ever in view of increasing uncertainties in its
    traditional CIS markets. At the same time, it is realistic to expect that many farmers will

    continue to produce for non-EU markets and that agriculture will retain its role as a source of
    income for less prosperous households.6

48. The competitiveness and productivity of the sector remains low when compared with
    other producers around the world. Moldovan apples, table grapes, and plums fetch among
    the lowest unit prices of exporters in the world, and have done so in both 2003 and 2012. Most
    of Moldova’s produce is exported to lower-value markets (e.g. with lower unit values) and
    competes at the lower end of these markets. A small proportion of produce is exported to
    higher-value markets, and mostly competes at the lower end in these markets as well. Yields
    for fruits and vegetables in the 2007-12 period show mixed performance: yields of apples,
    apricots, walnuts, and vegetables are well below new EU member state comparators, and yields
    of wine and table grapes are comparable to some new EU member states but lower than CIS
    neighbors.
49. However, there are some signs of opportunity. There are approximately 115 larger farms
    that have the scale and ability to compete in high value markets, and commercial agriculture
    enterprises have yields nearly 1.5 times the yields of small farmer/peasant households.
    Moldova has been successfully competing in some niche markets: it is the second-largest
    supplier of walnuts to the EU (after the United States) and has been able to compete in the
    middle range of some markets for apples (United Kingdom and Bulgaria). Its exports of
    organic produce are growing.
50. In order for significant exports to the EU to become reality, Moldova’s farmers and
    exporters will need to adhere to high product quality standards and traceability, improve
    the quality of packaging, and in some cases, adjust the grading specifications. Achieving

    this requires actions to improve practices during growing and harvest; improve post-harvest
    handling and infrastructure; and improve the flow of market information and requirements to
    producers. These improvements will not only better position Moldova to compete in the EU,
    but also in more demanding markets (such as supermarket chains) in the CIS and in other
    regions (for instance, some agri-food producers have begun to explore markets in the Middle
    East). This will allow Moldovan producers to diversify markets in order to mitigate market and
    price vulnerabilities that have affected them to date—including bans on exports to Russia and
    depressed prices due to over-supply. The quality demanded of Moldovan produce will only
    increase as retail channels (supermarkets) grow in importance in Moldova and the CIS region,
    and as Moldovan producers enter European markets.



6. Performance of Free Economic Zones in Moldova
51. In 1995, Moldova introduced free economic zone legislation with the aim of accelerating
    socioeconomic development by attracting domestic and foreign investment, promoting
    exports, and creating employment. Since then, seven such zones have been established:
    Expo-Business-Chisinau, Ungheni-Business, Tvardita FEZ, Otaci-Business, Vulcanesti FEZ,
    Taraclia FEZ, and Balti FEZ. 7 Companies operating in the zones enjoy special tax and customs
    regimes, which are specifically aimed at supporting export promotion and investment
    attraction.
52. Over the last 10 years free economic zones have had a strong performance in attracting
    investments, and increasing industrial output and employment. A handful of large export-
    oriented firms changed Moldova's export pattern. However, it is not clear whether there will
    be long-term spillovers, since these large firms are not highly linked to the rest of Moldovan
    firms.
53. Free economic zones have been successful in attracting investment from both domestic
    and foreign sources. Since 2002, the volume of foreign and domestic investments in the zones
    increased five-fold, reaching US$212 million in 2014. While not all investments in the zones
    have foreign origin, investments in the zones amount to 80 percent of total FDI stock in
    Moldova for the period 2009-2014 (Figure 15).
54. Free economic zones have become true export platforms, generating a fivefold increase
    in exports of industrial production from the zones between 2004 and 2014. The majority
    of industrial production (75 percent) in the zones is exported rather than sold domestically. The
    share of exported products from the zone reached 9.2 percent of total Moldovan exports in
    2014, from 4.2 percent in 2006. Exports of the FEZs are in general more dynamic and are
    mainly concentrated on manufactured goods. Indeed, exports in FEZs grew from 50 million
    USD in 2005 to 210 million USD in 2014 (Figure 16).

 There are two other locations that are deemed to be free economic zones: Aeroportul Liber Internaţional
Mărculeşti; and International Free Port Giurgiulești.

       55. On average FEZs employment had a robust growth in the last seven years and almost
           doubled since 2008. However, this increase in employment is driven by outcomes in only two
           zones: FEZ Balti and FEZ Ungheni, where the main production facilities of companies
           activating in the automotive and textile industries are located. In the rest of the zones, in fact,
           employment and production levels have declined since the 2008 crisis (Figure 17).

       6.1 Dynamic Gains
       56. Evidence suggests that FEZs have significantly contributed to the diversification of
           exports and to the changing structure of the Moldovan economy. The latest expansion of
           investments in FEZs was driven by big international companies in automotive and textile
           sectors, which have significantly transformed the structure of production, from beverages to
           electrical machinery and equipment and textiles. The share of industrial goods in FEZ
           production increased from 4.2 percent in 2006 to almost 10 percent in 2014. This
           diversification pattern in production at FEZs can be observed in the structure of Moldovan
           exports.
       57. The spillovers of FEZs on domestic firms appear to be modest, however, and unlikely to
           contribute to the technological upgrading and sophistication of the Moldovan economy.
           Because the largest companies in Moldovan FEZs are part of global value chains and import
           most of their inputs, they have limited linkages to domestic firms. While domestic companies
           provide non-industry related services to FEZs residents such as transportation and food, these
           spillovers are unlikely to add much in terms of diversification and sophistication.
       58. FEZs tend to attract industrial activities requiring intensive use of human resources for
           certain operations (e.g. fitting parts and subassemblies). These do not always contribute to
           strengthening sectorial links and diversification of the economy. In this sense, FEZs in
           Moldova, cannot be a valuable element of industrial and trade policy.

59. The extent to which Moldova can gain from FEZs depends on whether reforms that
    proved successful within the zones can be implemented in the rest of the economy. Some
    of the benefits that firms identify in FEZs have to do with streamlined customs procedures and
    less exposure to arbitrary government inspections. In this respect, FEZs act as a testing
    platform for certain policy reforms to be implemented. Part of the success of FEZs as an
    investment policy tool relies on the capacity of the Government of Moldova to learn from these
    reform experiences and implement those that proved successful in the rest of the economy.
