GFDRR’s structure positions it well to achieve its goals in 2016-2018.

     ■■   GFDRR’s Country Operations leverage large-scale programs and pillar-specific
          results to meet the demands of disaster-prone countries to scale-up resilience.
     ■■   Through its Thematic Programs, the Secretariat hosts cross-regional teams deliv-
          ering technical support, capacity development, and knowledge management in spe-
          cialized areas: Innovation Lab, Hydromet, Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance
          (DRFI), Resilient Recovery, Inclusive Community Resilience, Resilience to Climate
          Change, Resilient Cities, and Safer Schools Programs.
     ■■   GFDRR’s Special Programs – with support and partnership from Japan and the
          European Union (EU) – provide the Secretariat key financial support and unique
          knowledge and expertise to advance resilience.
     ■■   Finally, partnerships promote a collaborative approach and support implementers
          on-the-ground and internationally to deliver planned activities, disseminate lessons
          learned, and mobilize and coordinate resources.
Harnessing this structure, this Work Plan sets out two scenarios of resources required,
prioritization, and results expected: a Base Case and an Investment Case.

     ■■   The Base Case proposes steady allocations to GFDRR’s Country Operations for
          the whole of the 2016-2018 period using available resources. Thematic Programs
          would continue with allocations in 2016, but would foresee minimal resources in
          2017-2018. (Proposed total allocations, 2016-2018: $161 million)
     ■■   The Investment Case reflects the increasing demand for DRM activities in both
          Country and Thematic Programs. It would expand the Country Operations with
          more stable funding streams, while allowing GFDRR’s Thematic Programs to scale-
          up and provide critical technical support to implementing partners throughout the
          2016-2018 period. (Proposed total allocations, 2016-2018: $286 million)
To reach the Investment Case, GFDRR requires an additional $25.5 million in funding in 2016.
For 2017-2018, an additional $100 million is envisioned.

Table 1 shows the resources committed, prioritization pursued, and results achieved across
GFDRR’s Five Pillars of Action in 2014 and 2015, along with projections for the 2016-2018
Base and Investment Case scenarios.

                               how does GFDRR work?

                             The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a global partnership
                             program for disaster risk management and climate change adaptation managed by the World
                             Bank on behalf of its members.

                             Created in 2006 in support of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005-2015, GFDRR
                             supports implementation of HFA’s successor, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
                             2015-2030, adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, which
                             was held on March 14-18, 2015 in Sendai, Japan.

                             The mission of GFDRR is well aligned with the goal of the Sendai Framework, which is to
                             “Prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the implementation of integrated and
                             inclusive economic, structural, legal, social, health, cultural, educational, environmental,
                             technological, political and institutional measures that prevent and reduce hazard exposure and
                             vulnerability to disaster, increase preparedness for response and recovery, and thus strengthen
2
    The Sendai Framework     resilience”.2 GFDRR’s Work Plan, organized around its Five Pillars of Action, will support
    for Disaster Risk
                             countries to implement the four priorities for action and achieve the seven targets that the
    Reduction 2015-2030,
    A/CONF.224/CRP.1         Sendai Framework lays out.
    (March 18, 2015),

                             reduction management and climate change adaptation in development strategies and
                             investment programs. It also coordinates and scales up technical and financial assistance, and
                             strengthens global, regional, and country partnerships.

    Integrating the Sendai Framework in GFDRR’s Program

    The Sendai Framework 2015-2030 marks the progress in practice, cooperation, and support that
    disaster risk management and climate change adaptation have made since the Hyogo Framework
    2005-2015. The new Framework articulates four priorities for action:
    1. 	 Understanding disaster risk;
    2. 	 Strengthening disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk;
    3. 	 Investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience; and
    4. 	 Enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response, and to “Build Back Better” in recovery,
         rehabilitation and reconstruction)

    The Framework also sets seven global targets:

    At the CG Meeting held in Washington in May 2015, the Secretariat recognized the importance of
    integrating key aspects of the Framework into GFDRR’s structure, while noting that the Framework’s
    specific indicators are still to be formulated by the open-ended intergovernmental Working Group,
    supported by UNISDR. At the CG meeting to be held in May 2016, GFDRR will present the Work Plan
    2017-19, which will outline GFDRR’s path to align its objectives with the Framework, indicate the
    areas where the Work Plan will contribute to the expected outcomes and goals of the Framework,
    and identify gaps that require additional knowledge and potential modifications to GFDRR’s work
    program. This will give the Secretariat an opportunity to fully engage implementing partners on the
    Framework and its implications.

                                  The GFDRR Secretariat is hosted in the World Bank, which acts as trustee of resources
                                  contributed by donors. The Secretariat is responsible for awarding and managing grants,
                                  reporting on results, and outreach and partnership development. GFDRR also acts as the
                                  support hub for a decentralized network of disaster risk management expert focal points in the
                                  World Bank. These specialists play a leading role in locally managing the GFDRR program and
                                  in developing relationships with governments and other in-country partners.

                                  GFDRR is a grant-making facility – not a direct implementer – and delivers its Work Plan through
                                  the results and leveraging achieved by its implementing partners with GFDRR’s financial and
                                  technical support. Annual grant making across all GFDRR’s trust funds has increased from $6.4
                                  million in 2007 to $63.6 million in 2014, and demand for support from GFDRR continues to grow.
                                  These financial resources are administered as grants to government agencies, development
                                  partners, and civil society organizations (CSOs), with projects that are typically one to three

    	 GFDRR on Leveraging:
                                  geographically and thematically. Since its creation in 2006, GFDRR has allocated resources
      https://www.gfdrr.org/      through a demand-driven approach based on strategic objectives and the application of grant
      gfdrr-thematic-notes-       allocation criteria as defined by the Consultative Group (CG), GFDRR’s decision-making,
      leveraging
                                  oversight, and advisory body.

                                  Throughout its activities, GFDRR strives for concentration, coherence, and complementarity. In
                                  any given country, GFDRR adopts a number of criteria to help in allocating resources, including:
                                  established vulnerability indicators, past evaluations of impact, political context (including
                                  existing relations with governments), and donor priorities. Across the program, GFDRR also
                                  commits to ensuring that its projects are gender-informed, in terms of analysis, actions,
                                  monitoring and evaluation, and results assessments. This includes addressing differential
                                  vulnerabilities to hazard risks, in addition to identifying and utilizing opportunities to
                                  promote gender equality and empowering women and marginalized communities as key agents
                                  of resilience. GFDRR’s projects include special considerations of vulnerable populations,
                                  including the elderly, children, and the disabled. Starting in 2014, GFDRR began applying a
                                  climate change filter to its projects to verify that country operations also contribute to building
                                  resilience to long-term climate change risks.

  Thematic Programs
  GFDRR, its implementing partners, and donors have also identiﬁed particular needs for focused
  technical support. GFDRR’s thematic programs allow the Secretariat to provide tailored support
  to implementing partners through hosted cross-regional teams.

  Special Programs
  GFDRR manages two donor-supported special programs: the Japan-World Bank Program
  for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in Developing Countries – financed by the
  Government of Japan – and the Initiative of the Africa, Caribbean, and Paciﬁc (ACP) Group of
  States – ﬁnanced by the EU.


  Partnerships
  GFDRR supports activities that complement the country, thematic, and special programs through
  coordination and collaboration with partners to build technical and operational exchange, and
  share lessons learned from country-level work. Close cooperation with the UN system is a
  cornerstone of this work.

                                        how does GFDRR prioritize its resources?
                                 In the Work Plan 2015-2017, GFDRR set forth three criteria by which it prioritizes its grant
                                 selection to maximize the impact of donor contributions, and support activities that address
                                 countries’:

                                 (i)	    underlying risk to natural hazards;

                                 (ii)	 potential to enable large-scale investment programs for resilience; and

                                 (iii)	 opportunities to coordinate activities that enable investments and programs supported
                                        by other development partners on the ground.

                                 The Work Plan 2016-18 builds on this approach.


                                 Underlying Risk
                                 GFDRR supports countries facing significant disaster and climate risk. The Index for Risk

                                 GFDRR benchmarks its prioritization against INFORM and its component sub-indicators. The
                                 results of this analysis indicate that GFDRR’s support is strongly aligned with countries facing
                                 the greatest natural hazards and overall risks of crisis.

Figure 1 shows the average risk rating of countries considered in GFDRR’s Work Plan 2015-
2017 – both under the Base and Investment Cases. They have a higher overall INFORM risk
rating (4.7 and 4.6, respectively, compared to 3.1 for all other countries, on a scale of 0-10),
but also show particularly significant risk ratings on lack of coping capacity and vulnerability,
as well as hazard and exposure.

Enabling Partners
GFDRR reaches out and develops partnerships to mobilize resources, increase opportunities
for technical and operational collaboration, and to share lessons learned from country-level
work at the regional and global level. Close cooperation with UN agencies is a cornerstone of
this agenda, as GFDRR promotes and supports the goals of the Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015-2030.

      how does GFDRR build its work plan?

  GFDRR develops its Work Plan with its implementing partners to determine country demand.
  This process consists of two main phases: strategic planning and resource allocation, as
  summarized in Figure 3.

  The Work Plan presents three aspects of GFDRR’s proposed activities over the three-year
  planning period: resources required, geographic prioritization, and results expected.

       ■■   Resource requirements are based on indicative annual allocations to implementing
            partners and are dependent on the activities planned, geographic prioritization,
            and level of results expected.
       ■■   Geographic prioritization is considered in the context of growing and deepening
            demand for disaster and climate risk management support.
       ■■   Expected results are presented through large-scale programs enabled in disaster
            risk management and climate change adaptation enabled and pillar-based outputs.

                                                   submits the Work Plan
                                                        to the CG

The Work Plan proposes resource requirements, prioritization, and expected results under two
scenarios: a Base Case and an Investment Case.

       ■■   The Base Case proposes steady allocations to GFDRR’s Country Operations for
            the whole of the 2016-2018 period using available resources. Thematic Programs
            would continue with allocations in 2016, but would foresee minimal resources in
            2017-2018.
       ■■   The Investment Case reflects the increasing demand for DRM activities in both
            Country and Thematic Programs. It would expand the Country Operations with more
            stable funding streams, while allowing GFDRR’s Thematic Programs to scale-up and
            provide critical technical support to implementing partners throughout the 2016-
            2018 period.

                                   what is GFDRR’s proposed program?
                               This section outlines GFDRR’s planned resource allocations under Base and Investment Cases,
                               resource requirements, and work planned and results expected under each pillar. The section
                               under each pillar highlights a number of planned activities to illustrate the geographic scope
                               and technical breadth of what will be delivered on the ground under this plan. Each highlighted
                               activity is ready to launch in 2016-18, either as a standalone project or as part of a larger

  Resource Requirements
  This section presents GFDRR’s indicative resource requirements to carry out the implementation
  of the Work Plan 2016-18. It also provides an overview of resources expected to be available
  over the period.

  Under the Base Case 2016-18, GFDRR will fully utilize the approximately $161 million in
  expected available resources over the period. Under the Investment Case, planned allocations
  would total to $286 million.

  To fund the Investment Case, an additional $25.5 million will be required for 2016. Closing the
  funding gap in 2017 and 2018 would require an annual increase in new contributions of $40.5
  million and $59 million, respectively. The 2016-18 resource requirement under the Investment
  Case totals to $125 million.

New resources raised over the 2016-18 period are required for the program areas indicated
in table 5. As noted in the section, “How does GFDRR build its Work Plan?”, these additional
resource will allow GFDRR to meet the increasing demand for disaster risk management and
climate change adaptation activities in both country and thematic programs. It would expand
the access of the six regional areas to more stable funding streams, and it would allow GFDRR’s
thematic programs to continue to provide critical technical support to implementing partners
throughout the 2016-18 period.

                         Action Pillar One: Risk Identification
                         People in vulnerable countries will have improved access to information about disaster
                         and climate risks, and greater capacity to create, manage, and use this information.

                         GFDRR delivered risk identification products and services in 37 countries in 2014. For example,
                         GFDRR worked with 19 countries, including Malawi, Mozambique, Vietnam, and Nepal, to
                         produce hazard information. Twenty-one countries, including Bangladesh, Djibouti, and Timor-
                         Leste, conducted risk assessments, and 21 countries, such as Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Sri
                         Lanka, implemented or improved their data sharing and communication platforms.

                         Over the next three years, the Secretariat will continue to support the development of risk
                         identification tools and methodologies to support policymakers, communities and other
                         stakeholders to collaborate, analyze, communicate, and use risk information effectively. The

      Partners: Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Central Region Provinces,
      JICA
      In the afermath of Typhoon Haiyan in 2014, the Prime Minister of Vietnam issued a
      directive to focus on “super typhoon” scenarios to better understand their impacts
      particularly of coastal storm surges. The Central Region Provinces are likely to be
      the most vulnerable to such events. Investing in the technical capacity to develop
      such scenarios requires new risk assessment tools to accurately model typhoon
      related wind, precipitation, and storm surges. This project would fund the adoption
      of these tools in relevant agencies. Indicative Cost: $1.0 million (Investment Case)

           A lack of geo-referenced building specific data hinders the ability of governments
           to identify structural vulnerability and use proper data for urban planning. The
           GFDRR Open Cities Initiatives facilitates innovative, data-driven urban planning
           and disaster risk management in high-risk South Asian cities, such as Batticaloa,
           Sri Lanka; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Kathmandu, Nepal. Open Cities has supported
           the creation of new data while also attending to the cities’ broader ecosystems of
           open data production and use. This scale-up would intend to add two or more cities
           to this network in order to increase access to open data solutions for resilience,

Action Pillar Two: Risk Reduction
People in vulnerable countries will be better protected through improved planning, better
building practices, and increased investments in vulnerability reduction.

Technical advice and financing to GFDRR-supported countries focuses on developing and
institutionalizing policies that lead to risk reduction. GFDRR provided product development
and advisory services to make disaster risk reduction a central part of national and subnational
governmental efforts in 30 countries in 2014. These results strengthened, for example,
community building codes and enforcement, land-use planning, and the implementation of
investments in resilient infrastructure. GFDRR continues to focus its efforts on investing in
activities that will inﬂuence and leverage large-scale investments leading to risk reduction in
all sectors, as recent investment programs in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka have shown.

            Madagascar
            Partners: National Disaster Management Agency
            Emergency response is centralized in Madagascar, but there is a need to decentralize
            some responsibilities and mainstream DRM into economic development. Activities
            support the Government of Madagascar in mainstreaming disaster risk management
            and climate change adaptation into economic development, and facilitate the
            support of decentralization of emergency response and resilient recovery. This
            technical assistance would build on the achievements of a previous GFDRR funded
            DRM project and the Emergency Infrastructure Preservation & Vulnerability
            Reduction Project. The activity will include: (i) financing a needs assessment and
            feasibility study for geographic expansion and harmonization of the country’s
            EWS network, including a sustainable plan for a financing mechanism; and (ii)

      The aging public school building stock in Ulaanbaatar (UB) City is vulnerable to
      disasters. Vulnerabilities also exist in modern school seismic design, in particular
      the performance of non-structural heavy weight walls as well as how they affect the
      seismic resilience of the structural frames. Schools built until the 1970s (approx.
      30% of UB City schools) are thought to have minimal or no seismic design features
      and are most vulnerable. Schools built between the 1970s and 1990s (approx.
      50% of schools) generally have some limited seismic detailing, and are slightly
      less vulnerable. Schools built after 1990 to the present (approx. 25% of schools)
      are built to varied designs, some of which are likely to be vulnerable, including
      current ‘model’ school designs. In order to address this risk, further technical
      assistance activities will be implemented to prioritize the most vulnerable public
      school buildings for seismic retrofitting and develop credible cost estimates for
      such an investment. Indicative Cost: $0.3 million (Investment Case)

          Partners: National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), UN, EU
          Gambian authorities require institutional capacity to respond more effectively to
          disasters. The purpose of this activity is to support the government to enhance its DRM
          capacity by strengthening Gambia’s NDMA. The project is composed of the following
          two components: (i) National Risk Assessment and Mapping: Under this component a
          comprehensive hazard and risk mapping and profiling exercise will be undertaken; (ii)
          capacity Assessment of NDMA and Partners in Disaster Risk Reduction. The main task
          under this component includes carrying out a comprehensive study to assess capacities
          of key partners at the central, regional, and local levels including public, private and
          NGOs/Community Based Organizations. Indicative Cost: $0.6 million (Base Case)

          Infrastructure, Utilities, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, SPC, UNESCO-IOC, UNOCHA,
          and WMO
          Despite recent progress, the Pacific Island Countries still have limited technical and
          institutional capacity. Early warning and disaster response systems are constrained
          by geographical isolation and dispersed populations, limitations of ‘last-mile’
          communication systems to remote outer island communities, and a lack of properly
          trained and equipped warning and emergency centers. The project will strengthen ‘end-
          to-end’ early warning and preparedness systems through (i) detection, forecasting, and
          warning of natural hazards; (ii) dissemination of timely warnings to the population;
          (iii) strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms at national
          and local/community levels, including strengthening of national and provincial DRM
          offices and emergency operating centers, installation of emergency communication
          equipment, preparation and simulation of contingency plans and community emergency
          plans. Indicative Cost: $2.9 million (Investment Case)

           Partners: Governments of Nicaragua and Honduras
           Adverse hydro-meteorological events are the most frequent disasters generated by
           natural hazards in Honduras and Nicaragua. From 1990 to 2012, it is estimated that
           annual economic losses due to weather-related disasters (e.g. hurricanes, tropical
           storms, floods, and landslides) were equivalent to 2.84% and 1.89% of GDP, for
           Honduras and Nicaragua respectively. This project would strengthen institutional
           capacities at the national level to support risk assessment and EWS for meteorological,
           hydrological, and climate-related hazards in Honduras and Nicaragua. Indicative Cost:

      Bangladesh Hydromet
      Partners: Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), Bangladesh Water
      Development Board (BWDB)
      Bangladesh is part of one of the most dynamic climatic and hydrological systems in
      the world. Owing to its unique low-lying topography, dense river network, climate, and
      location, it is exposed to some of the most devastating water and climate-related hazards.
      While Bangladesh is in the process of modernizing some aspects of its meteorological
      service, there remains a need to expand its meteorological monitoring network and
      upgrade its hydrological observation network in order to, for example, improve the
      quality of flood forecasting. The project will support technical assessments of existing
      hydromet and climate services in Bangladesh, potentially allowing a larger-scale
      investment. The project would assess the hydrological and meteorological observation
      networks, including monitoring mechanisms, early warning systems, climate services,
      and capacity. Additionally, it will develop the scope for assessment of flood risks and
      institutional capacity to manage these risks in the northeastern region of Bangladesh.

  Action Pillar Four: Financial Protection
  Vulnerable countries will have improved financial resilience to the impact of natural
  disasters, with improved post-disaster financial response capacity and stronger domestic
  catastrophe insurance markets.

  Since its creation, GFDRR has been instrumental in building countries’ financial resilience to disaster
  risk. To date, the Secretariat has helped leverage $1.4 billion in contingent financing to protect eight
  countries with immediate liquidity in case of a disaster. GFDRR will continue to partner with countries
  to increase financial resilience of governments, businesses, agricultural producers, and households
  against the economic burden of disasters. Activities will support developing and implementing tailor-
  made sovereign risk financing strategies that increase governments’ ability to respond quickly and
  sufficiently to a disaster while protecting their long-term fiscal balance. The Secretariat will also
  support activities to promote the development of competitive catastrophic risk insurance markets,
  including general catastrophe insurance for homeowners and small and medium-sized enterprises, as
  well as agricultural insurance programs for farmers. The Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance (DRFI)
  thematic initiative provides substantial support to projects focused on Financial Protection.

  The Africa Disaster Risk Financing initiative will support improvements in financial resilience in
  African countries. Through this program, multi-risk financing strategies are developed at regional,
  national, and local levels to help African countries make informed decisions, to improve their post-
  disaster financial response capacity and to mitigate the socio-economic, fiscal, and financial impacts
  of disasters.

          fundamental risk data available, as well as exposure models and country-specific
          catastrophe risk loss assessments/profiles for each country. It will also provide
          systematic reviews of existing budgetary arrangements to assess fiscal risk
          financing gaps in each country. National and regional catastrophe risk financing
          options will be assessed and recommendations made on preliminary national
          disaster risk financing strategies. Institutional capacity building would form an
          essential part of the project. Indicative Cost: $0.9 million (Investment Case)

          develop multi-risk financing strategies at regional, national, and local levels
          to help African countries make informed decisions, to improve their financial
          response capacity post disaster and to mitigate the socio-economic, fiscal, and
          financial impacts of disasters. The DRFI program will be leading large aspects
          of this engagement to enable the spread of better management of the financial
          impact from disasters in Africa by supporting vulnerable countries to develop and

           Partners: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
           This project would enhance transparency and discipline in post-disaster budget
           execution. Currently recovery and reconstruction budget is allocated on a
           subjective basis with requests from provinces and line ministries sent to MOF
           without means for verification. Under the new law, MARD is tasked to develop a
           template to improve the funding request process. However, a complete process
           should be developed that enhances transparency in each stage: (i) assessment of
           damages, (ii) proposal of reconstruction need, (iii) assignment of funds, and (iv)

ECA   Bosnia and Herzegovina
      Partners: Ministry of Finance, Europa Re
      Since 2010, catastrophe insurance and weather insurance is growing in Southeast
      Europe. Similar to Albania, Serbia, and Macedonia, the Government of Bosnia
      recognizes the importance of providing affordable catastrophe coverage for
      homeowners and businesses. Building on GFDRR’s existing work with countries
      in the region, this proposed project will help the government join the Southeast
      Europe and Caucasus Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (SEEC CRIF). This activity
      will provide technical assistance focused on the pricing of the insurance products
      that will be offered to the government through this multi-country insurance pool.
      Indicative Cost: $0.4 million (Base Case)


      Georgia
      Partners: Ministry of Finance
      The proposed activity will finance a stocktaking of existing DRF policies and
      financing mechanisms. In addition, it will conduct a fiscal impact diagnostic. The
      ECA DRM team will use this analytical work to initiate discussions with the Ministry
      of Finance and other stakeholders on the impacts of disasters, the necessity to
      invest in DRM to ensure sustained economic growth; and discuss financial
      protection options such as a CAT-DDO. Indicative Cost: $0.5 million (Base Case)


LCR   Bolivia

      governments, private insurance providers involved in exposure data collection,
      purchase of insurance coverage, and risk modelling, as well as the banking sector
      Bolivia’s decentralization law, which came into effect in 2009, requires
      departmental and municipal governments to put in place financial protection
      norms and mechanisms to ensure appropriate preparation to natural disasters, as
      well as recovery and reconstruction measures. As these policies have not yet been
      developed and previous experiences include agricultural insurance in small-scale
      production, the country would greatly benefit from technical assistance in the area
      of risk financing. GFDRR support would include an assessment of the economic
      and fiscal impact of disasters with a sectoral and territorial approach, given
      the decentralized legal framework. Additional activities would include work to
      conduct disaster risk assessments for financial uses, design appropriate financial
      protection and insurance strategies, and implement a pilot program. Indicative
      Cost: $0.8 million (Investment Case)

           In Central America, financial protections against disasters have received significant
           political support, with the 2010 Council of Presidents of the Central America
           Integration System (SICA) approving the ambitious Comprehensive Central
           American Disaster Risk Management Policy. The program calls for the integration
           of disaster risk management and climate adaptation into economic, social, and
           environmental regional policy frameworks. GFDRR’s implementing partners will
           provide technical and policy support for Central America and the Dominican
           Republic (COSEFIN countries) to join the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance
           Facility (CCRIF) and purchase tropical cyclone and earthquake coverage from
           it, as well as strengthening the technical capacity of CCRIF members Ministries
           of Finance to better manage their fiscal vulnerability to disaster events. GFDRR

SAR   Regional Disaster-Linked Social Protection in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan
      Partners: Ministries of Social Welfare, Disaster Management, and Finance
      Governments in South Asia, as well as in other areas, find it difficult to provide
      effective assistance during the post-disaster recovery phase, generally 2-8 months
      after a disaster event, when initial relief efforts slow and reconstruction planning
      begins, but major works have not commenced. Vulnerable populations that are
      dependent on government support are usually most impacted by this slowdown.
      Social protection that incorporates disaster triggers and links to DRM systems can
      help fill this need. This project will draw on expertise in Disaster Risk Financing
      and Insurance and the World Bank’s Social Protection practice to help countries
      improve their targeting of vulnerable populations, their transfer mechanisms and
      their monitoring and evaluation, as well as analytical work for policy design. It
      will help build the evidence of the impacts of disasters on the poor and vulnerable
      and improve the resilience of social protection systems to provide services and
      resources before, during and after hazard events. It also assesses the ability of
      existing social safety-nets to reduce natural disasters impacts and identifies
      policies and measures to prevent famines and food insecurity, protect houses,
      speed up recovery of assets and livelihoods, and protect schools, clinics, and
      hospitals before and after a disaster. Indicative Cost: $0.5 million (Investment Case)

  Action Pillar Five: Resilient Recovery
  Disaster-hit countries seeking GFDRR support will improve the quality and timeliness
  of recovery and reconstruction.

  GFDRR-supported post-disaster assessments are a critical way for countries to access large-scale
  recovery support. GFDRR has also gradually expanded and broadened its post-disaster efforts, with
  a special focus on rapid needs assessments, detailed recovery planning, and pre-disaster activities
  that allow for quicker and more effective disaster recovery. The partnership with the UN and the EU to
  develop the Disaster Recovery Framework Guide continues to help countries develop comprehensive,
  integrated recovery plans that prioritize and sequence recovery interventions, and helps governments
  improve their readiness for future disasters.

  Over the next three years, GFDRR aims to continue to deepen and widen its engagement in disaster-
  affected countries in order to support and catalyze sustainable recovery that leverages longer-term
  risk reduction and leads to resilient development. It is worth noting that specific Resilient Recovery
  activities are dependent on event-specific circumstances and, therefore, implementing partners have
  generally not been able to highlight the activities planned under this pillar.

     thematic programs
  GFDRR has identiﬁed a particular need for focused technical support in a series of core areas. In
  order to assure the quality of GFDRR grants in these ﬁelds, the Secretariat hosts and supports a
  number of cross-regional teams that provide technical support to implementing partners, and
  lead capacity development and knowledge management.

  Some of GFDRR’s thematic programs are primarily involved with a specific pillar of action, such
  as the Innovation Lab with Pillar 1 – Risk Identification. Others, such as Inclusive Community
  Resilience, cut across the pillars.

Innovation Lab Program
www.gfdrr.org/innovation-lab

The GFDRR Innovation Lab guides GFDRR’s Risk Identification work and supports the use of
science, technology, and open data in promoting new ideas and the development of original
tools to empower decision-makers in vulnerable countries to strengthen their resilience. The
Program is organized under the following initiatives:

     ■■   Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) helps apply the concepts of the
          global open data movement to DRM, often using its suite of complementary tools,
          including free and open-source risk data sharing platform GeoNode, OpenStreet-
          Map community mapping, and realistic disaster scenarios tool InaSAFE.
     ■■   Understanding Risk (UR) is an open and global community of 3,300 experts and
          practitioners interested and active in disaster risk assessment.
     ■■   Code for Resilience partners local technologists with disaster risk management
          experts to create digital and hardware solutions for DRM and other civic-minded
          activities.
     ■■   The Spatial Impact Assessment team uses satellite imagery and local spatial data
          sets to efficiently evaluate the entire extent of damage from a disaster and facilitate
          the development of a financial estimate for a country’s recovery, supporting GFDRR’s
          Resilient Recovery efforts.

Highlights of Planned Inclusive Community Resilience Program Activities

Protecting Households in Times of Natural Disasters
The proposed activity will provide technical assistance to the Governments of Tonga and Fiji
aimed at introducing and implementing elements of the disaster preparedness/response into
their social protection systems. Indicative Cost: $0.7 million (Investment Case)


Training on Social Impact Assessment (SIA)
This project aims to ensure that the social impacts of disasters and recovery efforts are
consistently monitored across post-disaster engagements by strengthening the SIA
methodology through technical assistance and the provision of training. Indicative Cost: $0.3
million (Investment Case)


Capacity Building on Gender and Citizen Engagement in the GFDRR Portfolio
The primary objective of this activity is to mainstream gender and citizen engagement
approaches in the GFDRR portfolio. In 2014, a preliminary review of the GFDRR portfolio
indicated that only 19% of the grants under implementation considered gender aspects
either in their design or during implementation. As a result, GFDRR, through the Inclusive
Community Resilience Program, will seek to integrate these key considerations of gender and
citizen engagement during the design of projects through targeted trainings and workshops
to task teams in GPSURR and GFDRR. The team will also provide on demand, just-in-time
support to task teams requiring support in the integration of these elements during project
design or implementation. Indicative Cost: $0.2 million (Base Case)


Empowering Women as Resilience Champions through National Community Driven
Development
This activity will support the government of Philippines in undertaking a community-
led multi-hazard mapping initiative to define areas at risk for the construction of public
infrastructure and housing. The project will also leverage the ongoing World Bank-financed
National Community Driven Development Program (NCDDP) platform that is aiming to
improve community access to basic services and participation in local government planning
by targeting approximately 800 municipalities (of which 545 are rural Haiyan affected
municipalities). This technical assistance will seek to develop risk maps at the community
level during the next NCDDP sub-project cycle (2016- 2019) and empower women as resilience
champions playing a leading role in the mapping process, and investment decision making
process. Indicative Cost: $0.5 million (Base Case)

  Link Community Early Warning and Early Action for Better Social Protection
  This activity will develop a mechanism to enable forecast-based financing for preparedness,
  so that funds are disbursed when thresholds of unusual rainfall conditions are reached. It
  will help create triggers for early actions that can help reduce losses, such helping move
  people and assets out of harm’s way or distributing high-yield seeds to chronically food
  insecure farmers in anticipation of expected favorable rains. Additionally, a participatory
  game will be adapted to engage youth in real-time monitoring of river levels and establishing
  relationships between rainfall, river flow, and flood risk – supporting both the improvement
  of hydrological models and the credibility of flood warnings to trigger early action. Indicative
  cost: $0.4 million (Base Case)


  Community-Led Partnerships for Resilience
  Building on ongoing activities initiated during the pilot phase of GFDRR’s CSO engagement
  strategy, this activity will scale up support towards documenting and capturing case studies
  that showcase community-led resilience. Currently, eight case studies are being developed
  where women-led community-based organizations are working in partnership with their local
  and/ or national authorities to better manage disaster risk. These case studies demonstrate
  good practice on how women innovate and lead the way, building partnerships with
  governments to build broader community resilience. In partnership with other organizations
  such as National Geographic, the proposed activity will build on these ongoing initiatives
  and expand to include researching the impacts of climate change on women through film and
  photographic documentation, for example. Indicative Cost: $0.1 million (Base Case)


  Community-led DRM in Afghanistan
  This project will provide technical assistance focused on hazard mapping, community
  based risk assessment, early warning systems, and DRM activities identified as priorities
  by communities to support the implementation of the Ministry for Rural Rehabilitation
  and Development’s (MRRD’s) Disaster Management Strategy. Indicative Cost: $1.0 million
  (Investment Case)


  Promotion and Training on Disability Inclusive Disaster Risk Reduction
  Fifteen percent of the world population is comprised of persons with disabilities and when
  compared to the general population, they face a higher risk in emergency situations. Working
  with UNIDSR, WCDRR Disability Caucus, National Governments, and NGOs, this activity will
  facilitate the strategic dissemination of advancements in Disability Inclusive Disaster Risk
  Reduction made at the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR) and the Sendai
  framework. A DIDRR guide will be developed – showcasing good practices. In addition, a
  series of regional training will be organized. Indicative Cost: $0.2 million (Investment Case)

Resilience to Climate Change Program
http://www.gfdrr.org/areas/ClimateChange

Building on the Hydromet Program, GFDRR has established the Resilience to Climate Change
thematic initiative to respond to increasing demand from countries for technical assistance to
help them formulate enabling policies and investment programs for integrating climate and
disaster risk into their development strategies. The program focuses specifically on resilience
to hydro-meteorological disaster risks, adaptation to climate change, and management of the
residual risk of climate-related disasters.

The funded activities help strengthen institutional and capacity building of partner stakehold-
ers, to ensure that they are ready and capable of implementing long-term investment programs.

Activities are positioned to inﬂuence policymaking and investment in measures at the required
scale, by leveraging both World Bank resources and those of national governments and other
partners. It will also develop and test innovative approaches to disaster risk reduction to
provide proven and potentially transformative solutions to the challenge of climate and
disaster risk management.

Just-in-time technical assistance under this program supports highly-specialized capacity
building and advice in response to country demand. Activities address specific issues related
to climate resilience or weather-related disaster risk management. This rapid assistance is
requested in response to a window of opportunity for critical policy reforms, or where waiting
for normal processing of technical assistance grants would not be feasible. The program is
already supporting Morocco in its design of a resilience fund and is expected to build capacity
with Central Asian national meteorological and hydrological services.

The Secretariat will develop a draft proposal on the scope and approach of the Resilience to
Climate Change Initiative to be shared prior to and discussed during the first Climate Advisory
Group meeting, during the Fall CG meeting in October 2015.

                                 Launched in 2014, the Resilient Cities Program helps cities understand, prepare for, and adapt
                                 to the effects of changing conditions, such as climate change and rapid urbanization, and to
                                 withstand and recover rapidly from natural disasters and other shocks.

                                 In its first year, the program created the methodology for the CityStrength Diagnostic,
                                 following consultations with a number of international organizations including UN-Habitat,
                                 UNISDR, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the World Bank. Experts guide city leaders through an
                                 investigative process to identify gaps in resilience in city systems and services, as well as risks
                                 to critical infrastructure, neighborhoods, and vulnerable groups of people. The process aims
                                 to inform policy decisions and build understanding of, demand for, and access to resilience
                                 strengthening investment options.

                                 Using the results of the diagnostic, Can Tho, Vietnam is expected to access financing to
                                 advance its flood prevention infrastructure, improve important services such as sanitation and
                                 transport, and upgrade living conditions, particularly in flood-prone areas.

                                 Across GFDRR’s portfolio, there is a wide variety of work on urban resilience, including risk
                                 mapping, contingency planning and preparedness, and early warning. In 2014, more than
                                 30 percent of grants supported urban resilience, including projects in Bangladesh, Burundi,
                                 Guyana, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.

Highlights of Planned Resilient Cities Program Activities

CityStrength Diagnostic Roll-Out in Sri Lanka
Building on the program’s work in Can Tho, Vietnam and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Resilient
Cities will work with Colombo, Sri Lanka to assess and prioritize actions and investment to
enhance resilience using the new CityStrength Diagnostic Methodology. Indicative Cost: $0.3
million (Base Case)


Resilience Finance Symposium and Lessons Learned
To help explore how different resilience initiatives have been financed, the Program will
host the Resilience Finance Symposium with a range of private sector actors, development
aid organizations, academic researchers, and civil society group representatives. The event
will examine current challenges impeding the flow of resilience finance to cities, how the
changing notion of resilience (to include a broader array of shocks and stresses facing a
city) may influence the finance picture, and what innovations may help overcome current
impediments, and will include case studies on resilience challenges facing Addis Ababa and
New Orleans. Indicative Cost: $0.1 million (Base Case)


Scaling Up the Medellin Collaboration on Urban Resilience
GFDRR joined UN-Habitat, UNISDR, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank,
C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities
initiative, and local government association ICLEI to form the Medellin Collaboration on
Urban Resilience, announced at the 7th World Urban Forum in Colombia in April 2014.
Additional activities under this initiative are planned to enhance collaboration with partners
to harmonize metrics for understanding urban shocks and stresses, as well as help cities
access sources of international support and finance to better manage these risks. Indicative
Cost: $0.2 million (Investment Case)

                                   Safer Schools Program
                                   http://www.gfdrr.org/areas/SafeSchools

                                   In 2014, GFDRR established the Safer Schools Program to leverage the World Bank’s long-
                                   established relationships with ministries of finance, ministries of works, and ministries of
                                   education to integrate risk considerations into existing sizeable education sector investments.
                                   The program:

                                        ■■   Builds an enabling institutional, policy, and regulatory environment for risk
                                             reduction
                                        ■■   Improves school construction practices, and
                                        ■■   Monitors global progress on school safety
                                   At the global level, the program is helping quantify the global problem and measure progress
                                   towards its solution, as well as enabling global sharing and transfer of knowledge and
                                   experiences on school safety. The program is aligned with the global Comprehensive School
                                   Safety (CSS) Framework and will support the implementation of the Worldwide Initiative for
                                   Safe Schools (WISS), launched in March 2015 at its Third WCDRR in Sendai, Japan. The Program
                                   has also formed partnerships with Arup and Save the Children to help ensure that building
                                   safer schools is included in the post-2015 Hyogo Framework for Action.

                                   Building on its global work, the Safer Schools Program has country-level projects in Malawi,
                                   Mozambique, and Peru.

      special programs

  GFDRR manages special programs designated by members providing large-scale financial
  support. They are aligned with this Work Plan, use GFDRR’s results framework, and operate
  under GFDRR’s common administrative arrangements.

  GFDRR manages two special programs: (1) the Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming
  DRM in Developing Countries, and (2) the Africa Caribbean Pacific (ACP) – European Union
  (EU) Program. Through their complementarity of geographic and technical approaches, these
  two programs make GFDRR an effective structure to support DRM and CCA.

  In turn, these programs help GFDRR reach the required scale to maintain specialized expertise
  and reduce the relative administrative costs on the overall partnership.

Japan-World Bank Program for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk
Management in Developing Countries
The Government of Japan and the World Bank launched the $100 million Japan-World Bank
Program for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in Developing Countries, building on
the recommendations of the 2012 Sendai Report. With more than $15 million in grants so
far, the program funds technical assistance, pilot projects, knowledge and capacity building,
and thematic initiatives mainstreaming disaster risk management in national development
planning and investment programs in 63 countries.33                                                  33

developing knowledge and outreach, fostering partnerships, and providing project support.

A number of indicative priority areas provide a broad framework to guide the activities of
the DRM Hub Program, namely hydromet and early warning, community-level resilience and
social protection, infrastructure planning and investment, risk financing, flood risk mitigation,
seismic resilience, risk assessment and decision support, and safer schools.


ACP–EU Program
Starting in 2011, GFDRR formed a partnership with the EU through the greater than $100
million million ACP-EU Program to support Disaster Risk Management and Climate Change
Adaptation activities in ACP countries through technical assistance, capacity building, and
advisory/analytical work. The program also supports ACP countries in the aftermath of a
disaster with post-disaster needs assessments (PDNA), rapid-response technical assistance,
capacity building, and the development of sustainable recovery frameworks.

The ACP-EU Program supports GFDRR’s work across the five pillars in the over 80 ACP group
countries. Through its staff presence in Brussels, the program has helped ensure coordination
and harmonization with the EU and other donors to enhance development impact. The program
has also expanded its impact with its “Building Disaster Resilience to Natural hazards in Sub-
Saharan Africa” initiative. This aims to strengthen disaster resilience, particularly with African
Regional Economic Communities and Regional Climate Centers, and to support disaster risk
assessments and financial protection.

      how does GFDRR partner with others?

  Building on the work and expertise of its country, thematic, and special programs, GFDRR
  promotes coordination and collaboration with partners – at local, regional, and international
  levels – to build technical and operational exchange, and share lessons learned from country-
  level work. In all these efforts, a broad array of cooperating and implementing partners at
  different levels are involved.

  GFDRR works with a wide range of partners to implement its program. This includes work
  with UN agencies, bilateral, and multilateral development partners, and programs increasingly,
  collaboration with civil society, foundations, research institutions, and the private sector.
  GFDRR responds to requests by partners to draw from experience in disaster prone countries
  to inform international policy processes and facilitate knowledge exchange between countries.
  These activities are largely organized around GFDRR’s thematic programs and relate to issues
  such as the understanding of risk, resilient reconstruction, climate change resilience and
  more broadly promoting disaster risk management as a core development priority throughout
  international frameworks and systems.

  By 2018, GFDRR will publish at least nine ﬂagship reports drawing on GFDRR experiences in
  country and supporting analytical work, for example on measuring the impact of disasters on
  the poor.

Highlights of Planned Partnerships Activities

Evidence-based reports on socio-economic beneﬁts of DRM
Partners: Overseas Development Institute, London School of Economics, World Bank, and
academia
These reports will explore the broader socio-economic beneﬁts of DRM, beyond just avoided
disaster loss, to also consider that even before a disaster strikes, investing in DRM yields
dividends in the short and long term, firstly by reducing ‘background risk’ and enabling
forward-looking planning, long-term capital investments, and entrepreneurship. Secondly,
irrespective of disasters, DRM investments generate other social, economic, and environmental
co-benefits from the DRM investments themselves. Consultations on an interim policy note
took place at the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in March 2015 and the final
report and briefing notes will be launched in July 2015, at the International Conference on
Financing for Development. Indicative Cost: $0.6 million (Base Case)


Harmonize approaches to reporting of DRM mainstreaming in development financing
Partners: UNISDR, OECD-DAC, DAC members
This activity will support GFDRR’s work with the OECD and several donor governments under
a Technical Advisory Group to institute a policy marker for DRM in OECD CRS, in partnership
with UNISDR. GFDRR presented a proposal at the informal meeting of the Working Party on
Development Finance Statistics (WPSTAT) at OECD on April 25, 2014. GFDRR will continue to
prepare the ground for approval of the proposal, including through the update of the Disaster
Aid Tracking online database and the publication of a report on tracking DRM financing in
DRM. The proposal may be reconsidered in 2016, following the agreement on the new post-2015
international DRM and development frameworks. Indicative Cost: $0.2 million (Base Case)


Enhancing GFDRR’s Capacity Building and Training Strategy
Partners: World Bank, the UN, and the donor community
This activity supports the development of GFDRR’s new capacity building and training
strategy through stock taking of existing activities, external partner consultations, and an
assessment of needed capacity for managing emergencies in operations. A specific e-learning
course on Management of Emergency in Operation will be designed as well. Indicative Cost:
$0.3 million (Base Case)


GFDRR Country Evaluation 2015
Partners: Implementing partners
This activity aims to provide an evidence base for policy and investment decisions amongst
GFDRR donors and partner countries. An independent firm will be contracted to conduct an
evaluation in selected countries that will seek to analyze and evaluate the overall impact
of GFDRR activities, specifically in terms of leveraging new investments and influencing
ongoing programs. Indicative Cost: $0.4 million (Base Case)
A WORK PLAN FOR THE GLOBAL FACILITY FOR DISASTER REDUCTION AND RECOVERY 2016 – 2018               75




  Stories of Impact: Highlighting stories of operational results and lessons
  Partners: Implementing and external partners
  The activity will enable a scale-up in the production of the Stories of Impact series to
  showcase to a broad internal and external audience the results and lessons from GFDRR’s
  grant and technical assistant activities. These stories have been disseminated widely through
  the GFDRR and World Bank websites, social media, and in hard copy at many GFDRR and
  regional events. Indicative Cost: $0.1 million (Base Case)


  Crowdsourcing Data to Accelerate Building Resilience
  Partners: Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, GFDRR Innovation Lab, and the Red Cross
  A key challenge in managing risks is the lack of reliable digital maps featuring hazards,
  vulnerabilities and capacities. This activity aims to strengthen MissingMaps.org (a global
  initiative that engages remote volunteers to trace satellite imagery into the OpenStreetMap
  platform and add local detail). Pilot initiatives will include urban settings (e.g., Dhaka in
  Bangladesh and Leyte in the Philippines), as well as densely populated floodplains in riverine
  and coastal areas such as the Zambezi river basin. Indicative Cost: $0.6 million (Investment Case)


  Understanding Risk Community & Global Forum
  Members: Governments, Multilateral Organizations, Academia, NGOs, CSOs, and the private
  sector
  Refer to Innovation Lab Program in Thematic Programs.

 Partnership with UN agencies and the engagement in the post-2015 agenda

 Close cooperation with the UN Ofﬁce for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) is at the core of GFDRR’s
 partnership. In March 2015, the UN held the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai,
 Japan. GFDRR co-organized Ministerial Roundtables on Reducing Disaster Risk in Urban Settings and
 Resilient Recovery and numerous technical and advocacy events, including the Resilience Dialogue to
 scale up and sustain funding and implementation of disaster and climate risk programs.
 Following the adoption of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, GFDRR will
 work closely with UNISDR and international partners to support the development of actionable, mea-
 surable and clear indicators to measure progress towards the newly agreed priorities. Additionally, in
 order to better measure resilience efforts within the World Bank, a new resilience indicator is being
 developed, which will have a strong focus on building resilience of the poor and most vulnerable seg-
 ments of the population. In this light it will draw strong ties with both the new post-2015 framework
 on Disaster Risk Reduction as well as the new Sustainable Development Goal on ending poverty.
 GFDRR is working with multiple partners around the Financing for Development Framework and the
 Sustainable Development Goals. GFDRR provides technical inputs, participates in discussions on
 indicators, and co-authors papers to highlight the importance of integrating disaster and climate
 resilience considerations, with a strong focus on poverty reduction. The objective is to promote con-
 sistency and coherence between the new Sendai Framework and the new international development
 frameworks, and highlight the importance of integrating disaster and climate resilience in develop-
 ment planning and financing.
 GFDRR will also continue its collaboration with UNISDR and UN-HABITAT, among many other part-
 ners, through the Medellin Collaboration to put urban resilience at the center of both sustainable
 development and the urban agenda.
 WMO will continue to be a critical partner in advancing climate and hydrometeorological services
 for resilience. In particular, there will be further collaboration on practical knowledge development,
 such as on socioeconomic benefits of hydromet services and impact-based forecasting. GFDRR will
 also continue to engage closely with GFCS in its efforts to promote climate resilience in development.

      how does GFDRR measure results?
  GFDRR reports regularly on results to its donors, partner countries, and other stakeholders.
  GFDRR monitors, evaluates, and reports results at the output, outcome, and impact levels.

  GFDRR monitors activities and outputs using the following tools:

       ■■   GFDRR uses its grant proposal and progress reporting templates to assess activity
            proposals, collect data for analysis, and report results across countries;
       ■■   The Monitoring Database collects data from the templates and makes real-time in-

              Veriﬁcation through evaluative activities and long-term
              monitoring of disaster loss trends




GFDRR will continue to evaluate the contribution of the outputs the program generates to the
achievement of outcomes sought according to the indicators set out in the M&E Framework.
It will continue to commission independent experts in the M&E and disaster and climate
resilience fields to evaluate sample countries where GFDRR works. Research and analysis will
continue to be undertaken by conducting studies in countries that possess a range of country
contexts and risk profiles for analysis on different geographic, political, and hazard scopes.

These evaluations, including the Country Evaluation 2015, will also continue to develop new
findings, recommendations and way forward to build capacity and know-how in order to
improve and support resilience-building methodologies, interventions and systems. Wherever
possible these evaluations will build upon existing efforts to evaluate and test theories of
change in GFDRR assisted projects.

  At the global level, GFDRR will continue to contribute to global efforts to measure and
  understand longer term trends in disaster losses and increased resilience, in support of the
  Sendai Framework. GFDRR participated in the development of the INFORM index, and will
  continue to work with a wide variety of partners, including the World Bank, to ensure that
  effective indicators are available and adopted.

  As set out in the Figure 10, GFDRR reports results under an annual M&E cycle:

       ■■   This Work Plan sets targets for results to be achieved in the three-year period, in-
            cluding enabling large-scale programs and outputs along the Five Pillars of Action;
            and
       ■■   The Annual Report reports on the implementation of the Work Plan against these
            targets in the M&E framework.
