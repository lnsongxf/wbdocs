                                  Box 2: Eight Clusters: A Muti-Sectoral Approach to Knowledge Work
  1. Poverty and Shared Prosperity aims to better understand the multiple dimensions of poverty and shared prosperity in India, and
  identify ways the Bank Group can support the Government of India to meet its goal of inclusive growth.
  2. Water consolidates and sharpens the Bank Group’s engagement in water in India to promote water security, to show the necessary trade-
  offs with respect to the use of a finite resource that is over allocated, and to show the links between water and the economy.
  3. Urban is designed to provide a platform to address challenges and opportunities posed by India’s spatial transformation and the CPS’
  strategic shift toward urbanization.
  4. Service Delivery seeks to assist in improving the access, quality, and accountability of core government services with an emphasis on LIS.

  5. Human Development Outcomes community of practice undertakes strategic analytic and advisory activities to help identify, assess and
  improve the determinants of key human development outcomes in India.

  6. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) supports Government of India PPP programs to increase access to basic services, achieve incremental
  efficiencies in service delivery, and improve governance in target sectors.

  7. Social Inclusion and Gender helps to establish links between social inclusion, gender, Scheduled Tribes, and the twin goals through
  analytical work, piloting and learning, and direct operational support.

  8. Economic Integration explores opportunities to maximize the economic potential of ongoing and planned infrastructure investments
  along India’s Eastern Corridor by focusing on diagnostics and interventions that could better connect producers to markets, strengthen
  competitiveness, and support integration domestically, regionally and globally.

Weak urban planning, ineffective regulations gov-

across all states and cities, and urban service de-

less responsiveness to its citizens.

than 70 percent of the urban population has access
to tap water and more than 80 percent to basic san-

per day and raw sewage often overflows into open
drains. The economic impact of inadequate sanita-

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Tuberculosis (TB), long associated with poverty, crowding and poor living conditions, remains a significant source of suffering in India with an estimated 2.2 million
     new cases and 270,000 deaths annually. At the same time, multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), which is difficult and expensive to diagnose and treat, is a threat with
     estimates as high as 64,000 new cases a year. The nation’s Revised National TB Control Program has successfully ensured coverage of first-line TB services across the
     country and provides diagnosis and treatment to about 1.5 million TB patients annually. India’s National Strategic Plan for TB Control seeks to further expand access
     to effective diagnosis and treatment, expand collaboration with the private sector, and scale up services for MDR-TB. This is the third World Bank operation to support
     India’s TB program since 1998.
     The project development objective is to support India’s National Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Control in expanding quality diagnosis and treatment services for TB
     sufferers.
     Components include:
     ■■     New strategies to reach more tuberculosis patients with earlier and more effective treatment in the public sector: Supporting existing strategies for treatment of
            drug sensitive and drug resistant TB in the public sector. This will be primarily through the financing of first and second line TB drugs and; b) Rolling out daily
            regimen therapy for drug sensitive TB in five states of India.
     ■■     Scale up and improve diagnosis of tuberculosis: Improve diagnosis of drug sensitive TB. This will be primarily through financing of enhanced microscopes to
            revamp equipment across Designated Microscopy Centers and; b) Expansion of access to Drug Sensitivity Testing (DST).
     ■■     Improve RNTCP management capacity with Implementation of Drugs and logistical module of e-Nikshay and establishing drug resistance surveillance in 30
            laboratories using e-Niskay.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■     Increase the number of people receiving TB treatment in accordance with the World Health Organization-recommended “Directly Observed Treatment Strategy”
            from the current 2.4 million to a target of more than 6.2 million, including more than 2.3 million women and girls.
     ■■     Increase in the number of TB cases receiving care within public sector through daily regimen fixed drug combination to 300,000 by end of project.
     ■■     Increase in the number of drug resistant TB patients initiated on treatment from extant 12,805 to 50,000 by end of project.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Andhra Pradesh is one of the most natural hazard prone states in India owing to its long coastline and location. About 44 percent of the state is vulnerable to tropical
storms and cyclones. On October 12, 2014, a very severe cyclonic storm ‘Hudhud’ made landfall in Andhra Pradesh near the city of Visakhapatnam. Following a request
from the Government of India, a mission of the World Bank conducted a rapid multi-sectoral assessment of the damages and needs. The Rapid Damage and Needs
Assessment estimated the total damages and loss at about INR 132,631.30 million (equivalent US$2.16 billion). The livelihoods sector was the most severely hit with
recovery needs estimated to be around US$ 443 million, followed by housing sector (US$439 million) and the roads sector (US$ 375 million).
The ‘Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project’ (APDRP), takes into account the lessons from the ongoing National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project phase I (NCRMP –I)
that has been supporting the Government of Andhra Pradesh since 2010 by improving their capacity to manage hydro-meteorological hazards. While restoring the
damages caused by cyclone Hudhud, the project’s aim is to improve the resilience of public services, environmental facilities and livelihood in targeted communities
and to enhance the capacity of the state to respond effectively to a similar crisis.
Given the region’s vulnerability to cyclones and floods, the infrastructure will be designed with resilient features and shore protection and will include contingency
planning for future disasters. The Project has seven components: (i) Resilient electrical network (US$81 million); (ii) Restoration of connectivity and shelter infrastructure
(US$71 million); (iii) Restoration and protection of beach front (US$44 million); (iv) Restoration of environmental services and facilities and livelihood support (US$13.3
million); (v) Capacity Building and technical support for disaster risk management (US$23.7 million); (vi) Implementation Support (US$17 million) and vii) Contingent
Emergency Response (US$0 million).

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     300,000 people covered by resilient underground electrical network
■■     1.75 million persons with access to restored and improved roads, shelters and access to improved beach front.
■■     1.73 million persons with access to restored and improved environmental services/ facilities.
■■     Updated design guidelines for buildings and public infrastructure with inputs from the urban vulnerability assessment and design standards study.
■■     The project will provide direct benefit to about 13.3 million residents of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakapatnam and East Godavari districts through improved
       road network.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Andhra Pradesh is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, the prosperity is unevenly
     distributed: the poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes (STs), Schedules Castes (SCs), and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. A more
     equitable distribution of the growth (or higher shared prosperity is a key challenge.

     There are two main issues: There is an income deficit since the small and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted from
     the potential growth in agriculture. This is primarily because they have not been able to take advantage of the potential benefits from sub-sectors like horticulture,
     livestock, and fisheries. The other deficit is the human development deficit, as most health and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. The income deficit and
     the human development deficit needed to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a greater pace of poverty reduction. The project has five components:
     ■■   Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and
          improved market access. This component will also invigorate local markets by connecting rural producers and enterprises with the rural consumers.
     ■■   Human development: The focus here is to enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the human development (HD)
          sector, as well as to improve HD service delivery by strengthening the existing public systems to deliver quality services. The interventions will target health,
          nutrition, sanitation, and education.
     ■■   Access to social protection services and entitlements: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the
          poorest households.
     ■■   Mission support, ICT and partnerships: ICT use especially open data systems and data analytics will be critical for the project. This component will support the
          missions recently launched by the government to ensure real-time analytics, open data systems and feedback-based policy development at the state level. It will
          also create an enabling ecosystem for innovation and transformation in delivering high quality last-mile services planned under the other components.
     ■■   Project implementation support: The objective of this component is to strengthen the project implementation by establishing monitoring, evaluation and learn-
          ing (MEL) systems, financial management systems, procurement management, governance and accountability systems, and knowledge management and com-
          munication.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Enhanced incomes for 250,000 producers in selected project mandals.
     ■■   Improved human development outcomes for 250,000 poor households though the adoption of appropriate health, nutrition, and sanitation behaviors.
     ■■   Enhanced access to social protection and entitlement programs for 500,000 poor households through systems that deliver improved information, enrollment, and
          payments.
     ■■   The beneficiaries under the project would constitute more than 50 percent of the small and marginal farmers and the SC/STs living in the target 150 mandals.
     ■■   Achievements include:
     ■■   60,943 farmers have been organized into producer groups.
     ■■   13 Mandal-level Nodal retail stores have been set-up with 522 Kirana Stores as members.
     ■■   15 one-stop shops have been setup across 3 districts, which provide Business Correspondent services and delivery of Social Entitlements (Pensions) through Village-
          Level Entrepreneurs.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES:
     Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty, Department of Rural Development, and Government of Andhra Pradesh.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Government of Andhra Pradesh created a Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Department (RWSSD) in 2007 to focus and expand RWSS coverage across the state.
At project start, about 46 percent of the rural habitations in Andhra Pradesh (rural population 55 million) were fully covered, with access to 40 litres per capita per day
of water, and about 54 percent of rural households had individual toilets. The state is keen to gradually decentralize service delivery, while building the capacity of the
local governments, or Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs). The project was designed to: (i) assist the state in building capacity to pursue its goal of increasing decentralized
service delivery systems in the water and sanitation sectors; and (ii) scale up a demand-responsive approach with policy principles consistent with national policies. The
project builds on the accumulated experience and lessons learned from Bank projects in India and across the world.
The project supports RWSS programs in six districts of Andhra Pradesh, and helps them adopt a common RWSS program and policies. The project, through
improvements in RWSS service delivery and sustainability of assets, will contribute to achieving goal seven of the MDGs on sustainable access to safe drinking water
and basic sanitation.

The project objective is to assist the state government to improve rural water supply and sanitation services through progressive decentralization, community
participation, and enhanced accountability. The project components are:
■■   Capacity and sector development: Supports building institutional capacity for implementing, managing, and sustaining project activities, along with sector-
     development studies to inform policy decisions.
■■   Infrastructure development: Supports improvements in water supply and sanitation services in the project habitations through new infrastructure or rehabilitat-
     ing and augmenting existing schemes, integrated with source-strengthening measures and sanitation programs. The project aims to cover 2,600 habitations
     across 6 districts.
■■   Project implementation support: Supports setting up a project support unit for implementing the project, including establishing the monitoring and evaluation
     (M&E) and sector information systems.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:
■■   1.6 million people are benefiting from access to improved water service.
■■   About 122,000 household connections were given providing piped water supply to rural community.
■■   About 9,400 toilets were built in project habitations, benefitting about 47,000 people..

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     For India, leveraging urbanization is central to its efforts in alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as India’s rapid economic growth is accompanied
     by an unprecedented spatial transformation. Andhra Pradesh (AP) and Telangana are among the more urbanized states in India and meeting the development
     challenges of and leveraging urbanization are important priorities for them. As per Census 2011, AP has a population of about 49.4 million and an urbanization rate
     of 30% while Telangana has a population of 35.3 million with an urbanization rate of 39%. Like many states across the country, they face fundamental challenges in
     managing urbanization and providing for adequate services to a growing urban population: housing, water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid waste management,
     and transportation. In the 1980s, the Bank funded projects with the Hyderabad Water Board in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and this project, APTMDP is the Bank’s
     first recent re-engagement in the urban sector with the states of AP and Telangana.
     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of APPMDP is to help improve urban services in the state, and build the capacity of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) to sustain and
     expand urban services in the two states. Urban service improvements are chosen in a demand-driven manner and implemented by ULBs, subject to several access
     and performance criteria, and with necessary technical support. The project supports improvements in the financial, technical, and management capacities of all ULBs
     through technical assistance. The project will also support improvements in the state-level framework that defines ULBs’ autonomy, accountability, and incentives for
     performance, as well as the government of AP’s capacity to monitor ULBs’ performances and to provide policy and technical support for their development.
     APTMDP has four main components:
     ■■     State-level policy and institutional development support: To improve the state’s policy and institutional framework to support service delivery and capacity build-
            ing by ULBs.
     ■■     Municipal capacity enhancement: To enhance the financial and technical capacity, and operating systems of ULBs.
     ■■     Urban infrastructure investment: To finance sustainable, high-priority investments identified by ULBs to improve urban services or operational efficiency.
     ■■     Project management technical assistance: To ensure the quality of subproject preparation, implementation, and monitoring.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     About $340 million of urban sub-projects have been prepared and are being taken up for implementation across 14 participating ULBs in AP and Telangana.
     ■■     Over 1.2 million urban residents are expected to receive improved urban services as a result of interventions under the project.
     ■■     Over 100 participating ULBs with new municipal e-governance systems for improved citizen interface and transparency expected by close of project across AP
            and Telangana.
     ■■     Over 50 participating ULBs with new GIS Maps for improved urban planning expected by close of project across AP and Telangana.
     ■■     Training of urban sector staff has started, and over 2,000 staff has already received training against a project target of 500 across AP and Telangana.

Andhra Pradesh is one of India’s most progressive states. Its economic, social, health, and education indicators are better than the national average, and on par
with neighboring states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Road transport accounts for more than 80 percent of the state’s freight and passenger traffic. The
government’s Vision 2020 strategy recognizes that an efficient transport system is a necessary foundation for agricultural and industrial growth, and consequently for
achieving its economic growth and poverty reduction goals. The capacity and quality of the state’s core road network has improved considerably in recent years, and
although maintenance spending has increased, it is still not adequate. In 2004-05, the government spent about Rs.3.7 billion on maintaining existing road assets,
significantly short of the Finance Commission’s standard of Rs.5.68 billion for road maintenance. During the course of implementation of the project, the state was
bifurcated (in 2014) into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and accordingly, the project has been restructured to divide the activities and loan expenditure and balance
amount across these two states.

The project development objective is to provide better quality, capacity, and safe roads to users in a sustainable manner by enhancing the institutional capacity of the
Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments in the road sector. The project consists of three components:
■■    Road improvement includes two activities to upgrade and maintain the state’s Core Road Network (CRN).
■■    PPP facilitation support will strengthen the capacity of the government of Andhra Pradesh to develop selected high-density traffic corridors under Public-Private
      Partnership arrangement, via toll revenues and viability gap support from the central and state governments.
■■    Institutional strengthening will provide technical assistance, training, and advisory services for: (1) operationalization of Andhra Pradesh Road Development
      Corporation (APRDC); and (ii) project implementation including asset management, the Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP), and the Institutional
      Strengthening Action Plan (ISAP).
Road safety will help the government of Andhra Pradesh develop safer road corridors by initiating measures to reduce road accidents. The Bank will help agencies
undertake demonstration projects on selected core road network corridors; carry out an extended black-spot improvement program (geometric improvement of
stretches with high incidence of accidents); and implement institutional and policy action plans for improving the state’s road safety responsibility framework and
capacities.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
Expected results are that 427 km of roads will be upgraded and 6,018 km of roads will be maintained under long-term performance-based maintenance contracts.
Achievements include:
■■    The share of the CRN in good condition increased from the baseline of 40 percent (2009) to 74 percent (2016) as a result of the use of long-term performance
      based contracts for maintenance covering a total length of 6,000+ km.
■■    Two roads with a total length of 420 km and an estimated project cost of about $450 million, have been awarded as PPP concessions in 2010. Both these roads
      have been upgraded and are currently under the O&M phase.
■■    As of May 2016, 239 km out of 427km have been upgraded and the travel time on these has reduced by more than 25 percent.
■■    In one of the demo corridors located in Andhra Pradesh, notable reductions observed in accidents and fatalities in ~140km road stretch over the past three years
      since the start of implementation of the civil works oriented interventions.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Assam is one of the lower income states of India, and the gateway to the landlocked northeast region of the country. Its road network therefore has significant strategic
importance for the economic integration of the lagging northeast with the rest of the country. About 60 percent Assam’s 38,000-km state road network, managed
by its Public Works Roads Department (PWRD), is in poor condition due to years of low investment and lack of maintenance. Overall weak sector management has
further aggravated the impact of sector underfunding. The PWRD needs substantial enhancements and revisions in its traditional way of doing business to improve its
relatively low performance and institutional effectiveness. The Assam State Roads Project will carry forward and build on many sector reforms already introduced in the
PWRD since 2000 through Bank-funded Rural Development Projects.

The project’s development objective is to enhance the road connectivity of Assam by assisting the PWRD in improving and effectively managing its road network. The
project has three components:

Road improvement: Improves 500 km of priority sections of the secondary roads to enhance state connectivity and facilitate regional integration. This includes
demonstration of new technologies to promote cost-effective, modern, climate-resilient, and environmentally friendly road construction, including pilots on innovative
design and construction of bridges.
Road-sector modernization and performance enhancement: Supports the implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan covering: (i) modernization of policies,
engineering practices, and business procedures; (ii) asset management and maintenance; (iii) institutional and human resource development including development
of local construction industry; and (iv) streamlining, standardizing, and computerizing PWRD key business processes.

Road safety management: Supports building the road safety management capacity of related agencies through the development and implementation of a multi-
sector road safety strategy.

The project seeks to complement traditional road investments with technical assistance and knowledge to improve overall road sector management in Assam. This will
help transform the PWRD into a modern road agency that adopts good practices in sector policies, strategic planning, and project and asset management. Bank support
will leverage more than 10 ongoing road development programs; by addressing key sector issues such as maintenance, it will increase the impact of investments
made under other road programs.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The project will help the Government of Assam bring better roads to 4.5 million rural people, mostly marginal and small farmers. It will also bring direct local
employment for about 20 million “person days.” Key expected results include:
■■   Improve 40% of secondary road network in good or fair condition through upgrading and rehabilitation work.
■■   Improved Asset Management through development of a Road Asset Management System, and maintaining the road network through performance-based main-
     tenance or other system of maintenance contracting to be introduced in 50 percent of districts.
■■   An increase in the percentage of secondary road network in good and fair condition from 25 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.
■■   A 20 percent reduction in travel time on the project corridors.
■■   An increase in the safety rating of the project corridors from 10 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2018.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Bihar is India’s third largest state with a population of 103 million people, of which approximately 54 million live below the poverty line. While significant resources
     are provided for social protection programs, the programs fall short of their poverty reduction potential. Program coverage is low and insufficient to address deprivation
     and poverty in Bihar due to large human resource and technical capacity gaps. Delivery mechanisms for awareness generation, enrollment, beneficiary management
     and benefit payments are inefficient, and certain groups (i.e., older people, widows, and people with disabilities) are underserved as social care service provision is
     practically absent. Existing monitoring and evaluation systems do not provide adequate support for planning and decision making and there is poor accountability in
     service delivery.

     The project development objective is to strengthen institutional capacity of the Department of Social Welfare and the Rural Development Department to deliver social
     protection programs and services and expand outreach of social care services for poor and vulnerable households, people with disabilities, the elderly, and widows.
     The project has two components:
     Strengthening social protection systems and capacity: Setting up core systems and building capacity of the Bihar Rural Development Society (BRDS) and the State
     Society for Ultra-Poor and Social Welfare (SSUPSW), which are the program implementation arms of the Rural Development Department and the Department of Social
     Welfare, respectively, to deliver key social-protection programs.

     Strengthening outreach and social protection service delivery: Financing construction, equipment, and staff for 101 social care service centers across all sub-divisions
     of the state to provide high-quality care, support, and rehabilitation services for older people, widows and the disabled. The component also supports pilots to improve
     outreach through mobile therapy services and tests models of community-based rehabilitation as well as innovative proposals to further improve social services.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   40 percent increase in Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme coverage by March 2016.
     ■■   25 percent increase in share of vulnerable groups in total beneficiaries of social protection programs and services
     ■■   39 percent increase in resources available for these social protection programs.
     ■■   40% improvement in quality and satisfaction with social protection service delivery.

 **US$ million, as of August 2016.** Community contribution agreed for Component 2: Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and competiveness


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
On August 18, 2008, the Kosi river burst through its eastern embankment 11 km upstream of the Kosi Barrage in Nepal, 8 km north of the Indian border. This created
major flooding in Nepal and Bihar (India) with about 3.3 million people affected in the State of Bihar alone. Approximately 600,000 acres of crops were ruined,
impacting close to 500,000 farmers. The Kosi floods were declared a national calamity by the Indian Government..

Following the Flood, the Government of Bihar requested assistance from the Bank in two phases: i) to address the short-term needs of the flood-affected population,
and ii) to tackle the longer term challenges of enhancing capacity to manage floods and investing in economic development. As a result, the Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery
Project (BKFRP, P122096, US$220 million) was designed and became effective in March 2011 and subsequently the Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project (BKBDP)
was initiated in consultation with the Government of Bihar.

The BKBDP comprises five components: (i) Improving Flood Risk Management (US$100 million); (ii) Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and Competitiveness (US$75
million); (iii) Augmenting Connectivity (US$177.5 million); Contingent Emergency Response (US$0 million); and Implementation Support (US$22.5 million).

KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
■■         31,000 farmers to adopt improved Agriculture Technology
■■         34,000 hectares provided with improved irrigation and drainage services
■■         400 kilometers of rural roads constructed
■■         220 Water Resource Department staff trained to use flood management technologies
■■         58 new bridges constructed
■■         45 kilometers of embankment strengthened
■■         35 Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) formed with representation of women, SC/ST and marginalized and landless farmers
■■         The project is expected to benefit approximately 10 million individuals in rural areas who are mostly small and marginal farmers. Approximately 48 percent of
           the beneficiaries will be women.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND KEY PARTNERS:
The project supports the Government of Bihar that created the Bihar Aapada Punarwas Evam Purarnirman Society (BAPEPS) for implementing the project and works
with other state agencies such as Rural Works, Road Construction and Departments of Agriculture, The Animal Husbandry and Fisheries Resource Department.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     On August 18, 2008, the Kosi river burst through its eastern embankment 11 km upstream of the Kosi Barrage in Nepal, 8 km north of the Indian border. This created
     major flooding in Nepal and Bihar (India) with about 3.3 million people affected in the State of Bihar alone. The Kosi floods were subsequently declared a national
     calamity by the Government of India (GoI). Over 330,000 housing units were damaged and significant structural impairments to roads, culverts, and bridges were
     reported in 412 panchayats. Approximately 284,000 hectars of agricultural land in the five affected districts were exposed to the deposition of coarse sediment.

     The Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery Project (BKFRP) aims to support flood recovery and risk reduction efforts in the affected regions through; (i) reconstruction of damaged
     houses and road infrastructures (ii) strengthening the flood management capacity in Kosi Basin, (iii) improving connectivity through reconstruction of roads and
     bridges; (iv) enhancing livelihood opportunities of the affected people, and (v) improving the emergency response capacity for future disasters. In June 2013, the
     project was restructured in consultation with the Government of Bihar, with an aim to reprioritize investments in the State of Bihar and strengthen the capacity of state
     institutions in implementing the project.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Out of the revised target beneficiary list of 62,800, about 52,600 (83%) houses are completed. About 25,190 toilets (40%) have been completed. All houses and
          toilet constructions are targeted to be completed by December 2016.
     ■■   All 69 bridges have been completed and out of 37 roads (260 km) to be rehabilitated 6 roads (41 km) are complete and 13 roads (71 km) are in final stages of
          completion; the remainder will be completed by the end of the project.
     ■■   Strengthening of Roads on the Western Kosi embankment and Restoration of 3 flood channels has been completed.
     ■■   Mobilization of community institutions and their capitalization. It has enabled community institutions to leverage considerable credit from commercial banks.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND KEY PARTNERS:
     The project supports the Government of Bihar that created the Bihar Aapada Punarwas Evam Purarnirman Society (BAPEPS) for implementing the project and is
     supported by the Rural Works, Road Construction and Water Resources Departments.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Bihar is one of the poorest states in India. Per capita income is about one-third of the national average. 90 percent of Bihar’s population of 103 million live in rural
areas. Agriculture and related activities employ 80 percent of Bihar’s labor force but contribute only about 20 percent to the state GDP. Bihar’s human development
indicators are among the lowest in India.
The project seeks to strengthen Bihar’s Panchayati Raj institutions as units of self-governance capable of planning and implementing development schemes, promoting
community life, and generating employment opportunities. The project supports the Government of Bihar’s plans for strengthening the institutional framework for the
functioning of Gram Panchayats, or village councils, and bringing about visible changes in village sanitation, quality of drinking water, nutritional status of children,
and generating employment opportunities through better management of natural resources.

The project was recently restructured to facilitate achievement of results on the ground and align project activities with current government priorities.

The revised project components are:
Component 1. Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan: Construction and operationalization of 330 Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans (local self-government offices) in 12 districts
of Bihar.
Component 2. Capacity building for Panchayati Raj Institutions: i) institutional strengthening of GPs (to strengthen the core institutional capacity of
panchayats including basic administrative, planning and financial management capacity and mass media communication and community mobilization); ii) local
initiatives in the areas of water, and sanitation, nutrition and natural resource management and iii) institutional strengthening activities at the State level.

Component 3. Strengthening the state government’s capacity to manage decentralization: strengthening the regulatory framework for Panchayats, by
supporting the issuance of the Rules supporting the Bihar Panchayat Act 2006 and the necessary Financial Management and Accounting manuals. The component will
also support the development and implementation of a panchayat-based accounts software, the preparation of financial accounts and completion of financial audits
in the selected project GPs.

Component 4. Project management and coordination.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Increased number of Gram Sabhas in Project GPs meet regularly to consider issues of importance to the GP.
■■   Increased number of women participate in regular Gram Sabha meetings in Project GPs.
■■   Project GPs disclose annual plans, annual budget, statement of accounts and progress reports.
■■   Increased number of “functional” Project GPs with newly constructed Panchayat Bhawans (that is, GPs with full time availability of key public officials; and Gram
     Sabhas and Standing Committees operational as per PRI rules).
■■   Increased number of Gram Panchayat Standing Committees that meet regularly to discharge their statutory functions.
■■   Financial management capacity of Project GPs strengthened, Project GPs producing consolidated annual financial statements and increased coverage of Project
     GP annual audit

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
 In Bihar, India’s second poorest state, per capita income was just a quarter of the national average. Almost 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas with limited
 opportunities for self-employment, and little access to basic services. Although agriculture was the mainstay of the economy and employed over 80 percent of the population,
 the vast majority of farmers survived at or near subsistence levels. Without an adequate banking network, most poor people had to borrow from extortionist moneylenders,
 or from relatives and friends to meet family expenses, often pawning tiny plots of land to repay old debts. Growing landlessness and the lack of livelihood opportunities led
 to large out-migration from the state. Earlier efforts by the Bihar government to promote the social and economic mobilization of the poor had been thwarted by entrenched
 caste identities and the absence of sensitive support and facilitation. The additional financing supports the geographical expansion of the project to cover all the state’s blocks
 in the existing six districts of the project and support consolidating and scaling up pilot activities undertaken in the parent project. It will also scale up activities to promote
 greater social accountability and increase the impact of last-mile service delivery approaches using the institutional platform of community-based organizations already
 formed. The project’s development objective is to enhance social and economic empowerment of the rural poor in Bihar. It has four components:
 ■■ Community institution development: Builds/strengthens primary and federated social and economic community institutions.
 ■■ Community Investment Fund: Involves transferring financial and technical resources to the community-based organizations on a demand-driven basis as a catalyst to
       improve livelihoods.
 ■■ Technical Assistance Fund: Improves quantity and quality of service provision by public, cooperative, community, and private service providers. The fund will also be
       used to improve the supply of key support services for the community organizations and federations in the areas of institution building, finance, and livelihoods en-
       hancement.
 ■■ Project management: Facilitates overall co-ordination, implementation, financial management, and monitoring and learning of the project at state and district levels.

 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
 ■■        Mobilized 1.84 million poor women into 155,636 self-help groups (SHGs) and 10,445 village organizations (VOs) and 225 Cluster Level Federations (CLFs). SHGs have
           saved over $22 million, and made over $33 million in loans to each other, to help create credit histories with commercial banks, and the project has facilitated SHGs’
           access to $98 million in bank credit.
 ■■        More than 50 percent of community funds have been used for productive purposes including agriculture, livestock and housing. Also, more than 50 percent of SHG
           members have reduced their outstanding high cost debts after joining the groups.
 ■■        309,000 farmers have accessed agriculture productivity enhancement interventions, nearly 33,000 households have increased their price realization through the
           project’s dairy intervention, and 20,900 youth have been linked to formal sector jobs.
 ■■        102 village organizations are managing a public distribution system (PDS) intervention to ensure access to food entitlements.
 ■■        More than 400,000 households have accessed entitlements, such as pensions, health insurance, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGN-
           REGA - a national work guarantee scheme) and Aam Aaadmi Bima Yojana (AABY- a subsidized life insurance scheme).
 ■■        More than 148,000 women farmers have been mobilized into farmer producer organizations centered around key commodities and activities like Maize, Vegetable,
           Litchi, Potato, Dairy and Poultry. A number of higher federations called Producer Companies have been formed that are undertaking large scale aggregation and market-
           ing of farmer’s produce, providing better price realization combined with quality inputs and extension services.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
In Bihar, India’s most densely populated state, per capita income is less than half of the national average. Almost 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas with
limited opportunities for self-employment, and little access to basic services. Although the state has witnessed high economic growth in recent years, absolute number of
people living below the poverty line is still a massive 35.8 million. Without an adequate banking network, most rural poor have to borrow from extortionist moneylenders,
or from relatives and friends to meet family expenses, often pawning tiny plots of land to repay old debts. Nearly 60 percent of the rural population is directly dependent on
agriculture and allied activities where lack of organization hinders the mostly small and marginal farmers from accessing better inputs and higher price for their produce.
There is a high prevalence of malnutrition and low sanitation levels. The Government of Bihar’s emerging priorities include women’s socio-economic empowerment,
improved access to health, nutrition and sanitation services, and skill development and job placement for youth. The organization of poor rural women into strong and
sustainable community institutions is a central strategy. Under the Bank-supported Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project (BRLP) and National Rural Livelihoods Project (NRLP),
nearly 3 million rural households have been mobilized into more than 240,000 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and higher federations. These institutions have leveraged more
than $120 million in credit from banks and delivered significant impact on human development outcomes. However, the extent of mobilization is still low and only 35 %
of rural population is part of the institutions as compared to near saturation in many southern states of India. Building on the experience of the BRLP and the NRLP, the GoB
plans to expand rural livelihood development activities to 300 blocks in Bihar through the Bihar Transformative Development Project. The project’s development objective
is to diversify and enhance household level incomes and improve access to and use of nutrition and sanitation services among targeted households. The project has four
program components:
■■   Community Institutional Development: Building or strengthening primary and higher level community institutions and producer organizations.
■■   Community Investment Funds: Transferring financial and technical resources to the community-based organizations and producer organizations.
■■   Access to Nutrition and Sanitation Services: Improving SHG women and SHG households’ nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation practices.
■■   Innovations, Partnerships and Technical Assistance: Supporting innovative pilots and partnerships with private sector organizations, govt. partners and development
     organization to leverage high quality technical assistance and deliver synergistic impacts

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   5 million households will be mobilized into 450,000 SHGs and higher federations while 500,000 farmers will be organized into Producer Groups and Producer Com-
     panies.
■■   One woman each from at least 70 percent of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe households will be mobilized into the SHG fold.
■■   These institutions will mobilize USD 800 million in credit from banks and will cover 1.7 million households under various insurance schemes.
■■   500,000 farmers will be reached out by value chain interventions and at least 20 large Producer Companies will be promoted.
■■   Minimum dietary diversity for children aged 6 months-3 years, pregnant and lactating mothers will be promoted with a target to increase number of such children and
     women by 20% over baseline.
■■   The project will promote adoption of better hygiene and sanitation practices by reaching out to 1.2 million SHG members through comprehensive behavior change
     communication and will reduce the number of women practicing open defecation by 500,000
■■   400,000 SHG households will be facilitated to access services under the Swachch Bharat Program of the Government of India
■■   At least 20% of SHG households will have one additional source of income and at least 30% of households will increase their income by 30% over baseline.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports India’s Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) in piloting new conservation models that look beyond protected areas, and
     recognize the need for innovative solutions to biodiversity loss through improved coordination, capacity building, awareness generation, reskilling, and convergence
     of actions. Given the pace of land use changes and growing population pressure on protected areas, there is a real danger that the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem
     services could reach a tipping point, at which there will be a failure to supply key inputs for sustaining economic growth. Coupled with this is the fact that over 100
     million people are directly dependent on biodiversity resources for subsistence.

     The project development objective is to develop and promote new models of conservation at the landscape scale through enhanced capacity and institution-building
     for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation outcomes. The project has four components:
     ■■   Demonstration of landscape conservation approaches in two pilot sites: Investments in planning, coordination, and convergence through innovative microplans
          at the village level and landscape mapping; includes limited investments in improving habitat quality.
     ■■   Strengthening knowledge management and national capacity for landscape conservation: Development of a curriculum for a national-level landscape manage-
          ment course—strengthening three field learning centers for translating best practices in conservation management into training modules, and carrying out
          national-level training sessions.
     ■■   Scaling up and replicating successful models of conservation in additional landscape sites: Two new sites will be added this year to further scale up the landscape
          approach model.
     ■■   National coordination for landscape conservation: Supports a project management unit at the MoEF for coordinating among all six implementing agencies.

     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
     The project is expected to lead to an increased natural resource base, reduced dependence on protected areas, and improvement in community livelihoods through
     the sustainable use of biodiversity resources, as well as converging with other programs. It will support the preparation and implementation of village microplans and
     track benefits accrued to beneficiaries, including women.

     Achievements to date:
     ■■   Over 300 microplans have been prepared covering over 15,000 households through substantial social mobilization.
     ■■   Over 300,000 Ha of Protected Area has been brought under improved management.
     ■■   About 14,000 officers from various parts of the country have been given training in different aspects of conservation and landscape planning.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India generates 7.6 million tons of hazardous waste per year, with a large percentage of it illegally dumped outside industrial estates, on abandoned public lands,
and within privately owned lands. Despite amendment of national legislation, compliance is low and the data is deficient on illegal dumps and hazardous-waste
generation and characterization. Demand for land due to rapidly increasing urbanization is resulting in use and redevelopment of former industrial land or dump
sites, which are at the margins of fast expanding cities. Since most of these “brownfield lands” are potentially contaminated with industrial waste, resulting in chemical
pollution of soil, surface, and ground waste, such contaminated waste sites have the potential to pose significant health risk to communities and exposed individuals,
especially poor and marginalized communities located on the fringes of urban areas. India needed the support to develop the tools and methodologies for human
health risk assessments and the capacity to evaluate the technical, economic, legal, social, and environmental feasibility of remediation of contaminated sites.
The project development objective is to ‘strengthen the capacity of selected state pollution control agencies in the remediation of polluted sites and support
development of a framework to establish national program for the remediation of polluted sites. The project is targeting sites in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West
Bengal. Project components cover:
■■   Strengthening of environmental institutions: Building capacity for addressing pollution remediation.
■■   Investments in priority remediation and environmental improvements: Rehabilitation of orphan hazardous waste sites and municipal dumpsites. Three pilot
     projects (one each in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and West Bengal) will demonstrate sound remediation technologies for Orphan Hazardous Waste and Municipal
     Solid Waste Disposal sites.
■■   Project management

KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
■■   Framework for the establishment of National Program for the Remediation of Polluted Sites (NPRPS) comprising inventory of polluted sites, remediation meth-
     odologies and policy and regulatory reviews has been developed and is waiting the approval of the Ministry.
■■   Remediation plans for 9 polluted sites have been developed and are being implemented in three pilot project sites.
■■   Capacity of implementing agencies in the laboratory analysis of hazardous chemicals is increased from 26 to 70 parameters
■■   National Waste Management Information System (NWMIS), that helps issuance of authorizations under Hazardous Waste Management and Electronic Waste
     Management Rules has been developed and is operational.
■■   The project is also carrying out activities to establish (i) soil standards for India; and (ii) a network of academic institutions to provide technical advice and training
     and carry out research on remediation technologies.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is undergoing a massive rural-urban transformation. The share of the Indian population living in urban areas is expected to increase from one-third to half the
     population in the next 20 years. Already, the number of towns in India has jumped from about 5,000 in 2001 to 8,000 in 2011. India is also undergoing an institutional
     transformation with local governments playing a greater role in service delivery and urban management. Although the process of decentralization was initiated two
     decades ago with the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, the transfer of resources and responsibilities to the local governments is still a work in progress.
     The launch of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) in December 2005 by the Government of India signaled the increased importance of
     the urban sector in the political agenda. The total budgeted amount was Rs. 50,000 Cr. (more than $11 billion in 2005) for the 2005-2012 period to finance city-level
     investments in infrastructure and housing. Thereafter, the Smart Cities Mission (SCM) and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) were
     launched in 2015 (both with central outlays of around US$7.5 billion). There is consensus that lack of capacity at the local level is a major constraint affecting not only
     the day-to-day management of urban areas but also the ability of cities to absorb technical and financial assistance from the central and state governments.
     The project development objective is to assist the recipient improve planning for urban management in select urban local bodies (ULBs) and in the roll-out of the
     national urban missions, especially focusing on cities participating in SCM. The project has two components:
     ■■   Capacity building for strengthened urban management: This component is implemented by the MoUD, and supports technical assistance to ULBs to improve
          systems for: (i) financial management including credit rating and revenue enhancements; (ii) urban planning including preparation of proposals for SCM compe-
          tition; (iii) service delivery; and (iv) governance. ULBs select the desired package of assistance based on an assessment of needs which is undertaken with support
          from the project management unit. This demand-driven menu approach is in response to the variable capacity building needs faced by ULBs. The component also
          supports strengthening the MoUD’s capacity for policy analysis and monitoring and evaluation of ongoing national schemes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Madhya Pradesh (MP) is a low income state in India with more than one-third of its population living below the poverty line and a strong presence of scheduled
castes and tribes. Access to public services in MP remains highly unequal. On average, 49 percent of MP citizens do not have access to basic services compared to a
national average of 46 percent. Moreover, MP has the widest disparities in access to basic services across districts. Critical barriers exist for ensuring universal access
to government services such as limited access to information, cumbersome procedures and weak accountability systems. Challenges in accessing information about
government services, increase transaction costs, especially for those in remote areas and for those from under-represented groups.

The Madhya Pradesh Citizen Access to Responsive Service Project supports the state’s efforts to improve service delivery based on the commitments adopted under
its Public Service Guarantee Act (PSGA) of 2010. The PSGA is the first of its kind in India. It sets timelines for the delivery of selected public services, creates an appeal
structure in the event that government officials fail to meet these deadlines, and allows for imposition of penalties for delay. Services are provided by Lok Sewa Kendras
(LSKs) or “kiosks” that allow citizens to apply for multiple government services at a “one stop shop”. The PSGA has contributed to reducing citizens’ transaction costs,
speeding up service delivery and improving accountability of public officials. However, not all citizens are benefitting equally from these improvements and traditional
barriers to access remain.

The development objective of the project is to improve access to PSGA services by citizens of Madhya Pradesh, and in particular by under-represented groups.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Improved access to public services by citizens and by under-represented groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
■■   Expansion of the LSK network to remote and underserved areas, increased coverage of services, improved facilitation services at the kiosks and more extensive
     citizen outreach and awareness campaigns.
■■   Better integration of Government services.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
Department of Public Service Management through the State Agency for Public Services, which will serve as the Project Directorate.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India’s current installed power generation capacity stands at more than 305 GW. Sixty-one percent (186 GW) of this capacity is coal-fired, and contributes to over 70
     percent of the total electricity generation. In the 12th Five-Year Plan of the Government of India, over 80 percent of the generation addition is planned to come under
     coal-based power plants. According to the Planning Commission’s Integrated Energy Policy, coal will remain India’s primary energy source, accounting for nearly 42
     percent of total energy consumption and 65 percent of electricity generation in the next 25 years. Many coal-fired power plants, however, do not operate efficiently, and
     India’s renovation and modernization investments have not kept pace with targets; plants that account for almost 27 GW of capacity urgently need to be renovated and
     modernized. Focusing on existing plants rather than building new ones is a good opportunity to add low-cost power to India’s starving grid, while improving operational
     efficiencies relatively quickly. The approach also means dealing with fewer challenges such as availability of land, existence of transmission lines, and availability of fuel
     and water linkages.

     The Bank-supported Coal Fired Generation Rehabilitation Project is helping the Government of India design and implement an appropriately sequenced program of pilot
     projects to scale up the Energy-Efficient Renovation and Modernization (EE R&M) of its old, inefficient, and polluting coal-fired power generation capacity. This would
     help put the sector on a lower carbon path than continuing to operate these plants at their present low efficiency levels, while also bridging the power demand-supply
     gap. Recognizing the large carbon emission reduction potential of this project, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) has provided a $45.4 million grant.
     The project’s development objective is to improve the energy efficiency of selected coal-fired power generation units through renovation and modernization and
     improved operations and maintenance. The project’s two components focus on:
     ■■   Energy efficiency renovation and modernization pilots to renovate and modernize 420 MW of old coal-fired power generation capacity to demonstrate energy-
          efficient rehabilitation approaches.
     ■■   Technical assistance to support the implementation of pilots, develop a pipeline of pilot interventions, address barriers to energy efficient renovation and modern-
          ization projects, and strengthen institutional capacities of implementing agencies.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     This project is targeting 420 MW for EE R&M pilots, the success of which could result in the Government of India and various states rehabilitating similar plants. The EE
     R&M work at one of the two pilot Units (Bandel Thermal Power Station, Unit-5 of 210 MW) has been completed and it was synchronized with the electricity grid in October
     2015. The project is expected to have several outcomes:
     ■■   Have an impact on the barriers to wider replication of rehabilitation projects: This addresses barriers to rehabilitation in the selected pilot states through studies
          backed with international experiences, policy/regulatory dialogue, and strengthening of institutional capacity. In addition, the project has also helped mobilize
          qualified contractors to bid on India’s EE R&M opportunities and will demonstrate effective R&M approaches which can be replicated across the country (and pos-
          sibly elsewhere) once completed successfully.
     ■■   Quick and low-cost option for augmentation of power supply: Given the significant gap between demand and supply of power in India, these pilots will demon-
          strate whether and how the rehabilitation of old coal-fired power plants can augment availability of power on competitive terms.
     ■■   Strengthening institutional capacity of utilities: The engagement with selected state utilities is helping them build institutional capacity, especially in the areas of
          design and execution of R&M projects, and efficient operation and management (O&M) of plants.
     ■■   Improving environmental performance of the plants: In addition to reducing carbon emissions from power plants, the project would support improving the overall
          environmental performance of these plants, including particulates emission, water treatment, ash disposal, and overall safeguards practices and policies in the
          plant – areas that sometimes do not attract adequate attention from the utility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India has over 5000 large dams that are essential for water storage to cater to India’s increasingly competitive use of scarce water resources. There is limited scope for
building new dams, however, since all easy dam sites are already in use, acquiring land is difficult, and construction costs are very high. Many existing dams are under
distress, and the Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP) is designed to implement innovative solutions to again allow for the optimal use of the existing
223 dams covered by the project.
The project’s development objective is to improve the safety and operational performance of selected existing dams in the states of Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa,
and Tamil Nadu. The project has two major components:
■■    Rehabilitation and improvement of dams and associated appurtenances: Comprehensive rehabilitation and improvement of 223 dam and appurtenant struc-
      tures in the project states. In addition, hydrological assessments, preparation of asset management plans and emergency preparedness plans, development of
      emergency warning systems, public awareness campaigns, and floodplain mapping will be carried out.
■■    Dam safety institutional strengthening: To support and strengthen the Dam Safety Organization (DSO) at the national level in the Central Water Commission and
      DSOs and Water Resources Departments in each of the four participating states, as well as the State Electricity Boards in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. DSOs will become
      effective organizations that can take the lead in overseeing that dams remain safe from a structural and operational point of view. Dam managers will be assisted
      with the development of appropriate skills and modern tools to adequately operate and maintain dams.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
The main results expected at the end of the project include:
■■    223 project dams with the ability to safely deal with recurrent floods, and with acceptable stability and seepage; 223 fully operational dams, with reduced risk
      of failure.
■■    150 project dams with need-based operation and maintenance (O&M) plans implemented, and with at least 80 percent of the required annual budget for O&M
      allocated.
■■    60 dams where emergency response plans have been prepared and disseminated to the population.
Achievements to date include:
■■    269 contracts totaling $95 million have been awarded;
■■    Emergency Action Plans for all 224 project dams are being finalized

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Indian Railways (IR) operates a national rail network of about 64,600 route-kilometers. In 2013-14, it carried 8.4 billion passengers and more than 1 billion tonnes
     of freight. Despite strong growth in its freight business, IR has been losing market share to road haulage, due partly to insufficient physical capacity and poor service
     quality exacerbated by the need to fit freight train movements into a busy passenger service schedule. Without additional rail network capacity, much of the traffic for
     which rail should have competitive advantage would be forced to use road haulage or be suppressed, in both cases at a cost to the economy and in the former case at an
     environmental cost as well. Over the last decade, IR has successfully adopted many management measures to squeeze more capacity from its existing assets; average
     trainload, equipment utilization, and railway labor productivity have all been greatly improved. Physical capacity on key corridors is now the most pressing constraint.

     The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) project is a strategic response to network constraints on critical freight routes in India that form a quadrilateral, connecting Delhi,
     Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. The rail network between these cities accounts for just 16 percent of IR’s route network by length, but carries more than 60 percent of
     its freight traffic. With India’s freight traffic projected to grow at more than 7 percent annually, the DFC program will add dedicated freight-only lines, mostly parallel
     to the existing routes, built at higher loading standards to permit the operation of larger and heavier axle-load trains. This will not only double the overall rail capacity
     in the corridors, but also significantly reduce train operating costs per unit of freight. The current DFC program includes the Western Corridor (Delhi-Mumbai) and the
     Eastern Corridor (Ludhiana-Delhi-Kolkata). The Ministry of Railways (MoR) is the designated responsible ministry and the shareholder of the Dedicated Freight Corridor
     Corporation of India Limited (DFCCIL).

     The World Bank is supporting implementation of a substantial portion of the Eastern DFC under a three phased program. The EDFC-1 is for a 343 km section from
     Khurja to Kanpur, entirely in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Another section of 47 Km from Khurja to Dadri was added by restructuring the project. EDFC-2, covers about
     400 km from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai, again entirely in Uttar Pradesh. The development objectives of the EDFC-1 are to: (i) provide additional rail transport capacity,
     improved service quality, and higher freight throughput on the Khurja to Kanpur section and the Khurja-Dadri section of the Eastern rail corridor; and (ii) develop the
     institutional capacity of DFCCIL to build and operate the DFC network. It consists of two components:

     Design, construction, and commissioning of the Khurja-Kanpur and Khurja-Dadri sections.

     Institutional development: Supports (i) institutional strengthening of DFCCIL; and (ii) heavy-haul freight systems development.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Additional freight train paths on the DFC will increase by 100 pairs per day.
     ■■   Average speed of freight trains on the DFC will increase from a baseline of 25 km/hour in 2011 to 60 km/hour by the end of the project.
     ■■   Rail transport capacity on the DFC will increase from 18 to 32.5 Net Tonne Kilometer (NTKM).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. World Bank support for the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor
(EDFC) was conceived as a series of projects in which the three sections (total length 1,193 km) would be delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in
their construction schedules. The first loan (as first phase of an Adaptable Program Loan called EDFC 1) was approved by the Board in May 2011 and is now under
implementation. EDFC 2 supports the Government of India’s effort to construct 393 km of the EDFC from Kanpur to Mughal Sarai in Uttar Pradesh. The project includes
the most heavily congested sections of the corridor, and connects ports and mining areas in the East to consumption centers in the Northwest of the country. It is a top
development priority of the government, as rail traffic levels in the main transport corridors are already at or exceed their nominal capacity.

The project’s development objectives are to provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality and higher freight throughout on the 393-km Kanpur-
Mughal Sarai section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor; and develop institutional capacity of the DFCCIL to build, maintain, and operate the entire rail freight
network. It has two components:
■■   Design, construction and commissioning of the Kanpur-Mughal Sarai section of the EDFC consisting of 393 km of double-track electrified railway designed for
     freight-only train operations with 25-ton axle-loads (upgradable to 32.5 ton axle loads) at 100 km/hour.
■■   Continue providing institutional support to assist DFCCIL to develop its capability to best utilize heavy-haul freight rail systems.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective will be measured by three indicators:
■■   Number of additional train paths produced on the EDFC.
■■   Volume of freight carried.
■■   Improved institutional capacity of DFCCIL.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Eastern Corridor is 1,839 km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. World Bank support for the EDFC was conceived as a series of projects
     in which the three sections (total length 1,193 km) would be delivered sequentially, but with considerable overlap in their construction schedules. The first loan (as first
     phase of an Adaptable Program Loan called EDFC 1) was approved by the Board in May 2011 and is now under implementation. EDFC2 was approved by the Board on
     April 22, 2014, and is also under implementation. EDFC 3 supports the Government of India’s effort to construct 401 km of the EDFC from Ludhiana - Khurja in Uttar
     Pradesh and Punjab.
     The EDFC projects includes the most heavily congested sections of the corridor, and connects ports and mining areas in the East to consumption centers in the
     Northwest of the country. It is a top development priority of the government, as rail traffic levels in the main transport corridors are already at or exceed their nominal
     capacity.

     The project’s development objectives are to provide additional rail transport capacity, improved service quality and higher freight throughput on the 401 km Ludhiana-
     Khurja section of the EDFC; and develop the institutional capacity of DFCCIL to build, maintain and manage the DFC infrastructure network. It has two components:
     ■■   Design, construction and commissioning of the Ludhiana-Khurja section of the Eastern DFC, consisting of 401 km of single-track electrified railway with 1500-me-
          ter crossing loops at approximate 10-km intervals, designed for freight-only train operations with 25-ton axle-load (upgradable to 32.5 ton axle loads) at maxi-
          mum speed of 100 km/hour. The DFC lines are being built to carry bulk freight trains of 6,000 or 12,000 gross tons.
     ■■   Continuing development of DFCCIL’s/IR’s institutional capacity to build, maintain, and manage DFC lines, including both technical assistance and ancillary works
          and equipment focusing on supporting three priority areas: operational management, commercial management (including private participation), and environ-
          mental management.
     ■■   Operational: Design of system to optimize interfaces at the interchange of trains between IR and EDFC lines at connection points, including train holding yard
          requirements.
     ■■   Commercial: A freight logistics centers market-testing program to promote private investment in freight logistics centers/terminals (along either or both of)
          Eastern and Western Corridors, plus development of a contractual model and seed capital for implementation of a pilot project.
     ■■   Environmental: Design and implementation of a pilot project to attain energy savings in IR train operations through a driver advisory system with potential for
          scaling up across DFC with associated reduction in GHG emissions.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Progress toward achieving the project’s development objective will be measured by four indicators:
     ■■   Number of additional train paths produced on the EDFC3 as 23.
     ■■   Volume of freight carried on EDFC3 as 22 billion net ton kilometer.
     ■■   Average speed of freight trains increased from 25 to 45 kilometer per hour.
     ■■   DFCCIL Memorandum of Understanding rating (with MoR) remain good or higher

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
There are about 300 million people in India today that still lack access to electricity, impeding their ability to fully benefit from a growing economy. Rural consumers
and the urban poor constitute the majority of this unconnected population. Even those who do have a connection to the electricity grid face intermittent power
supply, particularly in rural areas. Industry and commercial enterprises also suffer due to unreliable supply, and are forced to invest in expensive diesel-fueled back-up
generation. India’s power sector relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily coal), and the country is currently the world’s fourth largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. To
address these issues, the Government of India plans to: (i) install 175GW of renewable energy by 2022; (ii) strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate
smoother energy exchange across regions; (iii) improve energy efficiency and performance of institutions in the power sector; and (iv) expand access for rural and
peri-urban populations.
The Fifth Power System Project builds on a successful partnership with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), the national electricity transmission
company that is vital to the development of India’s power sector. Not only has the WBG financed POWERGRID’s investment programs (through five direct loans), but
it has also supported its ongoing efforts to achieve world class operations and management, and to leverage private participation (including with IFC financing of
the Bhutan-India Tala transmission system). WBG’s support to this project came in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, when both international and domestic
credit markets became severely constrained. In India, the cost of debt for domestic investors increased by at least 20 to 30 percent, and the availability of both debt
and risk capital for infrastructure projects decreased. Additional financing to POWERGRID was also part of broader efforts to scale-up IBRD financing in response to the
financial crisis.
The project’s development objective is to strengthen India’s electricity transmission system in the Western, Northern, and Southern regions to increase reliable power
exchange between regions and states. Investments under the project will help improve POWERGRID’s service delivery by facilitating more economic use of generation
resources; providing greater grid stability; and facilitating development of a power trading regime within the country and with India’s neighbors.

KEY ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Annual inter-regional power exchange has gone up from a baseline of 46,027 MU to 94,366 million units (MU), surpassing the target of 72,000 MU.
■■   Transmission capacity of the Central Transmission Utility of India has increased from a baseline of 71,447 circuit km to more than 129,000-circuit km, outperform-
     ing original end-of-project targets (125,000 circuit km).
■■   Transformation capacity increased significantly from a baseline of 79,500 megavolt amperes (MVA) to more than 254,000 MVA, outperforming end-of-project
     targets (222,000 MVA).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector is facing high and rising energy costs, unlike other sectors of the economy such as agriculture that
     benefit from subsidized energy prices. Many Indian MSMEs are energy-intensive, employing inefficient and outmoded technologies. Investments in cost-effective
     energy-efficiency measures would improve their productivity and bottom-line profits. The barriers to adopting energy efficiency measures typically include access to
     finance, a gap in understanding between energy auditors and energy-efficiency practitioners and local banks, higher transaction costs for preparing energy-efficiency
     proposals, and imperfect information. MSMEs are also generally unfamiliar with the performance of readily available efficient equipment. The project development
     objective is to increase demand for energy efficiency investments in target MSME clusters, and to build their capacity to access commercial finance. The project has
     four components, focusing on five MSME industrial clusters:
     1.	 Increasing awareness of energy efficiency through outreach efforts, and dissemination of information about successful projects. Increase capacity of energy audi-
         tors, financial intermediaries, vendors, and MSMEs.
     2.	 Preparation and implementation of 500 energy-efficiency proposals through technical assistance for preparing Investment Grade Detailed Project Reports. That
         involves detailed energy audits and preparing financing plans, facilitating loans from banks and financial intermediaries, and providing implementation support.
     3.	 Broad programmatic knowledge management for monitoring and evaluation, collection of best practice examples, dissemination, and policy development func-
         tions, with the goal of ensuring effective implementation and replication of energy efficiency improvement efforts at MSMEs.
     4.	 Implementation support for the two project management units

     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
     ■■   1.5 million Lifetime emission reductions by direct investments of INR 970 Million in EE improvements, and estimated replicable investments of INR 2,520 Mil-
          lion with potential ERs of 3.6 million.
     ■■   Direct Emission reductions are about 0.9 million are achieved through EE investments of about INR 1000 million. All the estimated potential and replicable ERs

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
■■   The proposed programmatic operation would support the Government of Rajasthan (GoR)’s program for the turnaround of the distribution sector in Rajasthan
     under the 24x7 Power for All program. This first operation lays the foundation for legislative changes and institutional reforms to improve the sector’s governance,
     supports the financial restructuring of the sector, and backs actions necessary to improve operational performance.
■■   The distribution companies (DISCOMs) in Rajasthan provide electricity to about 9.5 million customers. However, a combination of high generation costs, inef-
     ficiencies in the distribution sector and an accumulation of long-delayed tariff adjustments has resulted in several years of continuing losses for the DISCOMs
     leading to a total outstanding debt of Rs 780 billion as on July 2015. In late 2015, the Government of India (GoI) announced the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojna
     (UDAY) program to find a sustainable solution to the financial troubles facing almost all DISCOMs across states. This operation will align with the UDAY program
     of GoI as well as that of the Rajasthan government’s plans to improve the financial, operational and technical performance of its DISCOMs.
■■   The key areas that the operation will support include: (a) strengthening governance in the distribution sector in the state by giving more operational autonomy to
     the utilities, establishing targets for reducing the gap between the cost of supply and revenue recovery, providing incentives to employees for improving perfor-
     mance; (b) financial restructuring and recovery in the sector through transferring a considerable amount of the debt of the DISCOMs to the state, bringing in more
     discipline in DISCOMs submissions to regulatory commission towards revenue requirements and initiatives towards reducing the costs of energy procurement;
     and (c) improving the operational performance of the DISCOMs.

KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective will be measured by following indicators:
■■   Appointment of Independent Directors in accordance with the clause No. 8 of the Electricity Distribution Management Responsibility Ordinance/Act in each
     DISCOM;
■■   Implementation of Employee Performance Incentive (EPI) scheme in each DISCOM;
■■   Date of availability of audited annual accounts for each DISCOM;
■■   Percentage of outstanding debt (as of September 30, 2015) of DISCOMs taken over by GoR;
■■   Monthly Distribution Energy Audit reports generated and disclosed (expressed as percentage of feeders);
■■   Gap between Average Revenue Realized (ARR) and Average Cost of Supply (ACS);
■■   Power Purchases for DISCOMs routed through Rajasthan Energy Development Corporation Ltd.;
■■   Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses;
■■   Number of consumers put on pre-paid/ AMI/ AMR meters;
■■   Number of LED lamps distributed;
■■   Number of IT staff appointed;
■■   Number of consumers put on unified billing system;
■■   Number of villages remaining to be electrified.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Program supports the implementation of Ministry of New & Renewable Energy’s (MNRE) Grid-connected Rooftop and Small Solar Power Plant program, with
     a focus on mobilizing private sector equity investments and commercial lending, increasing deployment and uptake of Grid-connected Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic
     (GRPV) through a variety of business models, and thereby contributing to the achievement of Government of India’s (GoI) GRPV installation targets of 40GW by 2022.
     The Program will finance activities in three results areas on a countrywide eligibility basis, as outlined in State Bank of India’s (SBI) Program Operations Manual (POM):
     (i) strengthening institutional capacity for GRPV; (ii) market development of GRPV; (iii) expanding GRPV generation. The Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Committee has
     approved US$125 million to co-finance this GRPV Program. The GoI has also applied for a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, specifically to (i) support an innovative
     risk mitigation mechanism to enable lending to small and medium enterprise (SME) commercial and industrial customers for GRPV, and (ii) to support strengthening
     of the investment climate and capacity building of the main stakeholders involved in the expansion of GRPV. CTF and International Bank for Reconstruction and
     Development (IBRD) funds will enable the participating commercial bank (SBI) to extend loans for GRPV at or near the Base Rate .
     The Program Development Objective is to increase installed capacity of GRPV and strengthen the capacity of relevant institutions for GRPV. The Program Environment
     Objective is to achieve reductions in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions through the displacement of thermal energy with solar energy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Gujarat has one of the most extensive and traffic-intensive road networks in the country. The state’s has about 145,000 km of roads, including 3,170 km of national
highways, 18,450 km of state highways, and 20,560 km of major district roads. The Roads and Buildings Department (R&BD) has the primary responsibility for
managing about 80,000 km of primary road network and 30,000 km of non-plan roads, with higher-level strategic guidance/oversight from the Gujarat Infrastructure
Development Board. Despite rapid expansion in the network capacity and quality, owing mainly to the government’s sustained emphasis on road development, the
road sector faces a new set of challenges to keep up with rapidly increasing demand, improve connectivity to the relatively underdeveloped eastern tribal region of the
state, and associated financing and safety considerations.

The main goal of the Gujarat State Highways Project II (GSHP II) is to extend Bank assistance to address these challenges. Because this is a follow-up project in an
advanced state, it will place relatively less emphasis on financing civil works—reflected in smaller loan-size with a higher ratio of counterpart and private funding—and
increase focus on finance-plus aspects. For example: (i) new contracting approach to improve investment and operational efficiency by transferring design risks to the
contractors, and clubbing maintenance responsibilities for a longer period; (ii) pilot transactions to leverage innovative private sector investment (modified annuity);
and (iii) various steps to increase the sector’s institutional and financial capacity to improve road service and safety in an environmentally sustainable and cost-effective
manner.

The project development objective is to improve capacity and enhance the quality and safety of road services for the users of the Core Road Network (CRN) of state
highways in Gujarat, through institutional strengthening and efficient contracting and financing strategies. The project is structured around three components:
1.	 Highway improvement includes upgrading about 350 km and rehabilitating 275 km of state highways through a mix of nine performance-based maintenance
    contracts, one PPP annuity-based Design, Building, Finance, Operate, Maintain and Transfer (DBFOMT) contract and one output and performance-based road
    contract (OPRC).
2.	 Sector policy and institutional development seeks to deepen the GSHP I efforts towards improving R&BD’s operational capacity, and also augment the state’s
    capacity in two more critical areas: policy and planning; and knowledge-building.
3.	 Road safety management strengthens the road safety management system and improves capacity to undertake multi-sectoral road safety interventions in the
    state through a safe corridor demonstration project on two high-volume, high-safety risk corridors, enhancing asset management with safety attributes, and
    strengthening the Gujarat Road Safety Management System.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project will directly improve the condition, capacity and safety of about 625 km of the 6,444-km core state road network. It is expected that this will directly benefit
about 38 million local businesses and inhabitants served by the project roads, as well as road users, of whom about half are women. The improved roads will have
significantly better capacity and robustness. Travel time should fall by about 30 percent, while the average volume/capacity ratio, a key measure of highway congestion,
should decline significantly. The emphasis on road safety ought to help reduce fatalities by 20 percent on the safe demonstration corridor.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Mid Himalayan Watershed Development Project became operative in 10 districts of Himachal Pradesh. The overall objective of the project is to reverse the process
     of degradation of the natural resource base and improve the productive potential of natural resources and incomes of the rural households in the project area in H.P..
     A secondary objective is to support policy and institutional development in the State to harmonize watershed development projects and programs across the State in
     accordance with best practices. In particular the project seeks to support watershed management through:
     ■■   Adopting an integrated watershed development framework as a strategy for combining technical information on productive capacity and conservation planning
          while using water as nucleus for a community based program of rural development.
     ■■   Supporting decentralization by strengthening the role of PRIs as a agent of planning and implementation and increasing their potential to become sustainable
          instruments of natural resource management.
     ■■   Empowering communities through capacity building and transfer of decision-making powers and resources to them.
     ■■   Insisting on cost sharing to ensure demand, promote ownership and encourage sustainable operations and maintenance of community assets.
     ■■   Targeting vulnerable groups such as women, landless nomads through formation of common activity group and special programs.
     ■■   Adding value to agriculture production through increasing productivity promotion of high value crops and developing commercial agriculture and horticulture
          through post-harvest and marketing development.
     ■■   Improving accessibility, in recognition that this is often the binding constraint to development in remote villages.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   7499 User groups formed for managing natural resources in a sustainable manner.
     ■■   Treated 70% of available non–arable areas by Forestry plantations and drainage line treatment.
     ■■   36.51% increase in Bio mass production in plantation areas.
     ■■   12517 Water Harvesting Structures with pondage capacity of 182.30 Ham.developed.
     ■■   427 Km of irrigation channel constructed.
     ■■   40% increase in water discharge rate in sampled water springs/Boaries in project area.
     ■■   38.12% increase in land under irrigation in target areas.
     ■■   33000 MT vermi-compost produced.
     ■■   More than 60% irrigated area diversified to High Value vegetable crops.
     ■■   Cropping intensity increase from 195.69% to 224.29%.
     ■■   Intervention on arable lands resulted in increase in wheat production by 14%, Maize by 13% and Milk yield by 11.55%.
     ■■   16.37% increase in fodder availability over baseline.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Himachal Pradesh is a relatively small state in India both in terms of area and population. Being land locked and dominated by a mountainous geography, the state
is confronted by development challenges. With hardly any rail, no waterways, and only three small domestic airports, the state relies almost exclusively on its road
network for transport. The total road network in the state is about 28,000 km, comprising 2,000 km of national highways border roads financed by the Government of
India, 2,160 km of state highways, 2,240 km of major district roads, and the balance being rural roads. Yet the quality and extent of this road network is inadequate to
meet the social and economic needs of the state: only half of all roads are surfaced, 90 percent of the highway network is single lane, and fewer than half of all villages
are deemed connected. The road sector suffers as a result of a history of low level of investment. Funding for maintenance has historically been a problem.

The development objective of the Project is to reduce transport costs and improve traffic flows on priority segments of the core road network of Himachal Pradesh for
the road users in the state. It has two components:
■■   Upgrading of roads in the Core Road Network, including widening of formation, realignment, new structures, and pavement strengthening of about 450 km of
     roads.
■■   Periodic maintenance and minor rehabilitation of about 2,000 km of the Core Road Network, in accordance with the agreed environmental measures set forth in
     the Component 2 EMP; (b) piloting performance-based maintenance contracts; (c) accident black spot improvements; (d) pre-investment studies for road network
     improvement and maintenance; and (e) capacity enhancement in road maintenance, financing, and management.

KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED:
■■   80% of the total physical works have been achieved, paving 403 km out of planned 435 km roads with asphalt;
■■   The entire original loan of $220 m has been disbursed; and the project will start withdrawing the additional loan - $61.7 m.
■■   About 1400 km of state highways received periodic renewals
■■   Decrease in the percentage of the core network of roads in poor condition from the baseline of 40 percent in 2007 to less than 10 percent by the end of the
     project. At the end June 2016, the level is 21%.
■■   Increase the speeds on the World Bank-financed roads by 25 percent. At end June 2016, average traffic speed has increased by a more than 25 percent on 403
     km of already upgraded roads sections.
■■   Reduce the fatal accident rate on the core network, which in 2007 was two deaths involved in traffic accidents per 1,000 vehicles. As of June 2016, the rate was
     0.25 per 1,000 vehicles.
■■   Level of road user satisfaction on the core network more than doubled (from 1.5 in 2007 to 3.9 in 2013), surpassing the end of project target of 3.3 (Note: using
     a 1-5 index)

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
 India has one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world. One-fifth of India’s children are born with low birth weight; 29.4 percent of those under 5 are underweight; 38.7
 percent are stunted; 15.1 percent wasted; 70 percent anemic; and 57 percent vitamin A deficient. Undernourished children: have higher rates of mortality; lower cognitive
 and school performance; are more likely to drop out of school; and are less productive later in life, with an estimated 10 percent potential reduction in individual lifetime
 earnings and a 2-3 percent loss in GDP. Much of undernourishment occurs during pregnancy and in the first two years of life, when, without appropriate interventions, the
 damage to brain development, future economic productivity, and consequently human development, is largely irreversible. The Government of India’s flagship program,
 the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), is designed to facilitate the holistic development of children by providing supplementary nutrition, and health and
 child care services to pregnant and lactating women and children less than 6 years of age. As implemented, however, it does not preferentially target children under 2 and
 pregnant-nursing mothers, and has not focused enough on effective nutrition interventions such as promoting appropriate feeding and caring practices. That has limited its
 impact on malnutrition. The Government of India restructured the ICDS in 2012 to strengthen its focus on 0-3 year olds and on behavior change for nutrition, transforming
 the anganwadi center into a vibrant center for early childhood development. The World Bank-supported ISSNIP, was designed to help the government build the necessary
 capacity and systems to implement this reformed approach, as well as test innovations and pilots to improve implementation.
 The project was unable to demonstrate implementation progress and in September 2015 was restructured to narrow the project scope to a few, evidence-based, interventions
 that aim to achieve behavior change for improved nutrition amongst women and young children using a disbursement linked milestones approach . The overarching goal
 of the project is to strengthen the demand and supply side systems and interventions to improve behaviors for infant and young child feeding and caring amongst pregnant
 and lactating women. The development objective is to support the Government of India and participating states to: (i) strengthen the ICDS policy framework, systems, and
 capacities, and facilitate community engagement, to ensure greater focus on children under 3; and (ii) strengthen convergent actions for improved nutrition outcomes.
 The project has four components:
 1.	 ICDS institutional and systems strengthening to develop and implement an ICT-enabled real time monitoring and service improvement system and capacity building
     of ICDS program staff and anganwadi workers.
 2.	 Community mobilization and behavior change communication to promote and strengthen processes for community engagement and action, empowerment of
     beneficiaries, and increased social accountability of the ICDS program through outreach interventions to priority households and community-based counselling and
     public education events.
 3.	 Convergent nutrition action to provide support at the central and state levels to develop and implement pilots and innovations to improve nutrition outcomes.
 4.	 Project management, monitoring, and evaluation. Strengthening the capacity of the directorates of ICDS to comply with their project management and implementa-
     tion responsibilities
 The project also established a challenge fund to incentivize project states for faster pace of achievement of results, and a programmatic multi-donor trust fund was set up
 to provide technical assistance.

 KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
 ■■      Increase in the number of pregnant/lactating women, adolescent girls and/or children under age 5 reached by basic nutrition services.
 ■■      Increase the number of children under 24 months benefiting from improved infant and young child feeding practices.
 ■■      60 percent of targeted anganwadi centers reporting key nutrition and service delivery indicators using ICT systems every month for last three months.
 ■■      80 percent of project districts having implemented the “incremental capacity building” system.
 ■■      Six project states having developed “convergent nutrition action plans” in at least one district.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India has 63 million people living in low-elevation coastal areas, endowed with significant ecological and economic resources. These coastal areas are unable to
ensure balanced development due to the increasing threat of hazards on economic and livelihood security; fragmented and weak institutional frameworks; and lack
of appropriate knowledge-based decision-making. As a result, coastal and marine resources are depleted and degraded. Unless these resources are conserved as part
of overall economic development plans, there will be further impacts on the livelihood, health, and well-being of the coastal population. In 2006, the Government
of India adopted the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) approach (a shift from a purely regulatory to a management approach) that would, with people’s
participation, promote livelihood security of the coastal communities, protect the ecosystems, and promote sustainable development. In 2007, the government of
India requested the Bank’s financing to create the initial institutional and knowledge bases to support its long-term reform agenda, and to pilot activities that would
inform larger future projects and programs. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project is the largest ever Bank financing in coastal zone projects, and one of
the largest ever for knowledge outputs.

Project components cover:

National ICZM capacity building aims to establish and support an appropriate national institutional structure for guiding and coordinating coastal zone management.
It includes: (i) hazard line and coastal sediment cell mapping; (ii) mapping and management of ecologically sensitive areas; (iii) establishing a new national institute
for sustainable coastal zone management; and (iv) national-level capacity building.

KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS:
The ICZMP had a significant impact on India’s outlook on coastal space, with GOI’s recognition of ICZM approaches as one of the key adaptation strategies in India’s
INDCa. ICZMP has in the interim achieved valuable results under 3 key categories:
■■ Setting up institutions at the national and state level for managing coastal zone complexities, including: National and State Level Coastal Zone Management
     Authorities (NCZMA, and SCZMAs).	
■■ Knowledge and Planning Base for ICZM: The NCSCM is functioning as an autonomous center supporting research and knowledge management for sustainable
     coastal management. The planning and knowledge base established by NCSCM include: (i) databases for coastal, marine biodiversity network; (ii) National GHG
     emission database for coastal ecosystems; (iii) baseline for coastal sediment cell delineation as benchmark with coastal maps; and (iv) futuristic research on
     marine and coastal areas.
■■ Implementation of Demonstrable ICZM Pilot Activities, including: Infrastructure for Coastal Conservation and Protection covering 400 km coastline of Odisha;
     Completion of one of the largest mangrove restoration/plantation in the world covering more than 12,000 hectares involving village communities; 40,000 new
     non-culturable microbes discovered and meta-gene mapping complete (West Bengal); Completion of Pollution Abatement pilots relating to sewerage with
     treatment plants for about 1 million population as well as other village-level micro projects providing renewalbe power and livelihoods; Built 14 multipurpose
     cyclone shelters

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In September 2014, the northern region of India experienced torrential monsoon rains causing major flooding and landslides. The continuous spell of rains from
     September 2 - 6, 2014, caused Jhelum and Chenab Rivers as well as many other streams/tributaries to flow above the danger mark. The Jhelum River also breached
     its banks flooding many low-lying areas in Anantnag, Srinagar and adjoining districts. The flood affected region, consists of 22 districts. A Rapid Disaster Needs
     Assessment (RDNA) was conducted in Fenruary 2015. The RDNA estimates the total damages and loss caused by floods at about INR211,975 million (equivalent
     US$3,550.45), most of comprised of housing, livelihoods, and roads and bridges. Public service infrastructure and equipment of hospitals and education centers were
     also severely damaged and are still not fully operational.
     The Jhelum and Tawi Disaster Recovery Project (JTFRP)t aims to support the recovery and increase disaster resilience in Project Areas and increase the capacity of the
     Project Implementing Entity to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project will focus on restoring critical infrastructure using
     international best practice on resilient infrastructure. Given the region’s vulnerability to both floods and earthquakes, the infrastructure will be designed with upgraded
     resilient features, and will include contingency planning for future disaster events. Therefore, the project aims at both restoring essential services disrupted by the
     floods and improving the design standard and practices to increase resilience.

     The project is comprised of the following seven components: Reconstruction and strengthening of critical infrastructure (US$60 million); Reconstruction of roads
     and bridges (US$80 million); Restoration of urban flood management infrastructure (US$50 million); Restoration and strengthening of livelihoods (US$15 million);
     Strengthening disaster risk management capacity (US$25 million); Contingent Emergency Response (US$0 million; Implementation Support (US$20 million).

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   15 critical infrastructure reconstructed (buildings) will be strengthened comprised of hospitals, higher and technical education buildings, fire stations, and
          selected block and district offices, and other important public buildings.
     ■■   300 Km of roads and bridges will be reconstructed and 56 pumping stations restored for flood management in Srinagar
     ■■   10,000 artisans will benefit from restored non-farm livelihood and infrastructure
     ■■   Hydrometeorological Resilient Action Plan developed with an early warning system in the region

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Karnataka, a state in the south of India, has a population of 61 million with higher per capita income and better health indicators than all-India averages, although
there are significant socio-economic disparities within the state. As government health spending has substantially increased in recent years, basic investments and
operations of health services have largely been assured from domestic funds. Nevertheless, system-level challenges persist, the quality and responsiveness of health
services continue to require improvement, significant gaps remain in access to services, and the state is confronting new health challenges, notably the growing
burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD). In this context, the Karnataka Health System Development and Reform Project has focused on supporting policy change,
institutional development, new strategies and innovations, and filling gaps.
■■    The project development objective is to improve health service delivery, public-private collaboration, and financing, particularly for underserved and vulnerable
      groups in Karnataka. The project has three components:
■■    Strengthening existing government health programs: Supports policy change, institutional capacity development at the state and district levels, and health
      service quality improvement.
■■    Innovations in service delivery and health financing: Supports investments in health service delivery capacity (i.e. round-the-clock health centers to improve ma-
      ternal care); service-delivery contracts with non-governmental organizations (NGOs); environmental health and regulation; a pilot for the prevention and control
      of non-communicable disease; and a pilot road safety program (coordinated with an IDA-financed transport project). This component also supports institutional
      development of a government health insurance scheme financing hospital services for the poor.
■■    Project management and monitoring and evaluation: Supports overall project oversight and implementation.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
The project has directly benefited over 400 million people, 52% of whom are women.
■■    The proportion of people receiving care in government facilities in the 7 least-developed districts has gone from 46 per cent in 2005-06 to over 98 percent in
      2015-2016.The project has financed construction and renovation of 352 health facilities, 13 drug warehouses, and 27 training centers,
■■    The proportion of births delivered in a health facility has risen from 65 percent in 2005-06 to 94 percent in 2015 (with an end-project target of 90 percent)
■■    The number of claims paid by the health insurance pilot program benefiting poor households exceeds 146,000 (against an end-project target of 150,000)
■■    An assessment of organizational development needs has been done and training implemented, district health administration and planning has been strength-
      ened, management and clinical guidelines have been developed, procurement reform has been implemented, and monitoring and evaluation have been
      strengthened. Over 91,000 health personnel received training, surpassing the end-project target.
■■    The Project is piloting prevention and control of non-communicable diseases at the primary level. So far, over 20,000 women have been screened for cervical
      cancer in two pilot districts.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Karnataka, located in the southwest of India, is the eighth largest state in the country, with a population of about 61 million. With 34 percent of the people living in
     urban centers, Karnataka is the fifth most urbanized state in India. Although considered to be a middle-income state and growing at or above the all-India economic
     rate of growth, Karnataka has wide regional development disparities, posing risks for sustaining high growth and making it more inclusive. Improving infrastructure,
     including road transport, is a key component of the Government of Karnataka’s development strategy to sustain growth and bridge regional disparities. Within the
     state’s relatively extensive road network of 208,262 km, the Department of Public Works, Ports, and Inland Water Transport is responsible for managing 22,078 km of
     state highways and 50,037 km of major district roads. The department faces two notable challenges: a significant paucity of resources for improving the quality and
     standards of transport infrastructure, and worsening road safety (in 2009, the state accounted for 10 percent of road accidents and 7 percent of road fatalities in all of
     India). The Bank-supported Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project aims to support the government of Karnataka in two areas of highway development: (i)
     achieving more diversified sector financing, building upon India’s experience in extensive use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) for the development of national
     highways; and (ii) improving road safety design, management, and enforcement to reduce road fatalities and major injuries.

     The project development objective is to accelerate the development of the Core Road Network by leveraging public-sector outlays with private-sector financing and
     improving the institutional effectiveness of the road-sector agencies to deliver effective and safe roads to users. The project has four components:
     ■■   Road improvement works support capital improvement and maintenance works of core road network through a combination of traditional contracts and PPP
          concessions.
     ■■   Highway financing modernization assists the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited in implementing the concept of co-financing with private finan-
          cial institutions through technical assistance and pilot transactions.
     ■■   Road safety improvement helps the Government of Karnataka respond to the growing road safety problems in the state with comprehensive strategic and
          institutional measures, consistent with the main thrusts of the 2007 Sundar Committee report and the findings of the road safety management capacity review.
     ■■   Road-sector policy and institutional development support implementation of a new medium-term Institutional Development and Strengthening Action Plan for
          2010-2016.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   The Government of Karnataka is expected to generate at least $400 million in new private-sector capital for Core Road Network improvement and management
          by 2018; as of August 2016, $295 million has been generated.
     ■■   1198 km to be upgraded and widened; As of August 2016, 480 km was upgraded and widened.
     ■■   Share of Core Road Network in good condition increases from 50 to 65 percent by 2018;
     ■■   Vehicle operating costs are targeted to decrease by 15 percent, and travel time cost on project corridors is targeted to decrease by 25 percent by 2018.
     ■■   Road accident-related fatalities on safe corridor pilots should decrease by 30 percent by 2018.

 project?lang=en


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The project builds on the success of the earlier Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project (closed March 2011), implemented in Hubballi-Dharwad, Kalaburagi
and Belagavi covering approximately 10% of the total population which demonstrated that continuous and reliable piped water supply was technically feasible. The
Karnataka Urban Water Supply Modernization Project (KUWSMP) aims to help provide city-wide access to a continuous piped water supply and also strengthen service
delivery arrangements at the city level in Hubballi-Dharwad. The Project will finance physical investments in the water supply system to facilitate continuous water
supplies along with the systems, procedures, and equipment required to sustainably deliver the improved services.
KUWSMP strengthens local level ownership of the project in two ways. First, by supporting the establishment of an Urban Local Body (ULB)-owned water utility as a
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which will be responsible for water services in the city and answerable to the ULB. Second, approximately 26 percent of the capital works
to be financed by the ULB drawing on its own resources to mobilize funds from the domestic capital markets. The project components are:
■■   Capital Investment Program – Includes capital works, service improvement plan and construction management
■■   Institutional Building - This will finance costs associated with operationalizing the SPVs and related matters
■■   Technical Assistance for Sector Development – To include project impact evaluation, improving social accountability and improving dam management
■■   Project Management - This component finances activities to ensure efficient and effective project implementation like equipment to establish PMU/PIU offices,
     consultants to support technical evaluations, third party monitoring, expert reviewer, safeguards and fiduciary auditing, construction quality assurance, com-
     munications and others.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   1.1 million project beneficiaries of continuous water supply
■■   Establishment of an operational Urban Local Body owned special purpose vehicle responsible for water services
■■   Building project ownership for the urban local body by making them co-financers of the project.
■■   60,000 new piped connections
■■   96,000 connections rehabilitated for improved services

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
 Approximately 60 percent of India’s population depends on rain-fed agriculture for their primary livelihood. Thirteen states, including Karnataka, account for about 75
 percent of the total rain-fed area in India, and have low agricultural productivity and are susceptible to drought, deepening environmental stress, and degradation. The
 Government of India is helping states address these issues through the National Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) supplemented by the National
 Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS). Yet IWMP, which finances soil and water conservation activities in arid, rain-fed areas, has not achieved desired results.
 The Karnataka Watershed Development Project-II (KWDP-II) is a new approach for watershed management in India. The design builds on the earlier Bank-supported
 Karnataka Watershed Development Project-I (KWDP-I), which is seen as one of the World Bank’s most successful watershed projects, winning five prestigious national and
 three major international awards. KWDP-I generated a substantial number of positive lessons and best practices around integrated watershed management, agricultural
 intensification, rural livelihoods, monitoring and evaluation, and building resilience to climate change. The Bank is providing mainly technical support to help the IWMP
 achieve better results and improve convergence with NREGS.

 The project development objective is to demonstrate more effective watershed management through greater integration of programs related to rain-fed agriculture,
 innovative and science-based approaches, and strengthened institutions and capacities.
 ■■        Improved program integration in rain-fed areas will demonstrate the successful integration of programs in watershed development, using a science-based approach
           in project areas.
 ■■        Research, development and innovation will establish a coordinated research approach to provide practical knowledge and tools to support integrated watershed
           management.
 ■■        Institutional strengthening will improve delivery of services for integrated watershed management.
 ■■        Strengthening horticulture in will strengthen knowledge regarding horticulture potential in rain-fed areas, and demonstrate the capacity of institutions and com-
           munities to improve production and value addition of horticulture in project areas.
 ■■        Project management and coordination will ensure effective and efficient project management

 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
 Under the project, new science-based approaches and tools will be adopted into wider IWMP watershed operations, such as improved hydrological inputs as part of
 landscape scale watershed assessments, and models used for site selection. Up to 70 percent of micro-watersheds will have improved convergence and integration with
 other programs such as NREGS. Agricultural and horticultural productivity in IWMP project areas for selected crops is expected to increase. Key results to date include:
 ■■        The Land Resource Inventory (LRI) work has been completed in 318 micro watersheds (MWSs) out of 698 from the initial IWMP batches and work is continuing in the
           remaining 380 sites.
 ■■        Guidelines for using LRI data while preparing watershed development plans have been prepared and supplied to the field staff of WDD and DoH, and training plans
           have been delivered.
 ■■        Research is under way on improved cultivars in sorghum, chickpea and pigeon pea, on new approaches for disease management and on simple hydro-economic
           modules for optimum utilization of water.
 ■■        Hydrological monitoring is now taking place in 14 micro-watersheds and 179 weather/telemetric weather stations have been established.
 ■■        Training was organized for master trainers in each project district. The training centers at Mysore and Vijayapura have been upgraded with additional space, furniture
           and ICT tools.
 ■■        Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs)/Self-Help Groups (SHGs) formed in the micro-watersheds under the project have been federated to Farmer Producer Organizations
           (FPOs) in seven districts.
 ■■        Five departmental farms are being developed as models with appropriate watershed development interventions besides improved production approaches

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Kerala is considered a front runner in India’s decentralization reforms. Local governments in Kerala are in a unique situation—taking on more devolved responsibilities
and with a greater degree of local autonomy. Kerala is undertaking a second generation of decentralization reforms, which focus, in a practical and incremental manner,
on expanding local expenditure autonomy, strengthening local government institutional capacity, and enhancing the state government’s ability to manage and
oversee the intergovernmental fiscal system. The Kerala Local Government and Service Delivery Project contributes to the Government of Kerala’s second generation
decentralization reforms through support to enhance governance and improve service delivery. At the national level, the project supports the overall process of
decentralization as mandated under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments of the Government of India. The project development objective is to enhance and
strengthen the institutional capacity of the local government system in Kerala to deliver services and undertake basic administrative and governance functions more
effectively and sustainably. The project supports 978 Gram Panchayats (GPs) and 60 municipalities across the state. The project has four components:
■■   Performance grants: Provides GPs and municipalities with additional discretionary funds, based on a formula, to expand local investment in the creation, main-
     tenance, and operation of capital assets, to help strengthen institutional capacity.
■■   Capacity building: Provides inputs to strengthen and supplement the existing systems and human resources of GPs and municipalities, to enhance their institu-
     tional performance.
■■   Performance monitoring: Strengthening the system of performance monitoring GPs and municipalities across the state.
■■   Support the project management unit: within the Local Self Government (LSG) Department in overall coordination, implementation, and monitoring and evalu-
     ation of the project.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   90 percent of 1,038 LSGs qualified for performance grants by fulfilling the two minimum mandatory conditions: clean external audits and passing the annual
     budget.
■■   87 percent of LSGs qualified for enhanced performance grants for boosting service delivery. Through the project, the state government has completed three an-
     nual performance evaluations of LSGs, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving systems and processes of local public administration.
■■   Support to Information Kerala Mission to roll out various e-governance systems in all LSGs enabled enhanced service delivery, transparency, and accountability.
     LSGs have migrated from maintenance of manual bookkeeping and accounting to computerized double entry accounting, as well as online planning and budget-
     ing systems.
■■   Sub-projects include e-governance enhancements (e.g. enabling citizens to get birth, death, and marriage certificates on time), connective infrastructure (e.g.
     roads), social services (e.g. education, health and anganwadi centers), income generation (street lights, bus stands, bus parks, markets), water supply and sanita-
     tion, solid and liquid waste management, energy projects, and LSGs’ front office modernization and computerization.
■■   21 million people have benefited from the project, against an end-of-project target of 29.5 million.
■■   Provided training to LSGs’ elected representatives and functionaries, and contributed to modernization of the state government’s focal institutes for local govern-
     ment capacity building, namely Kerala Institute of Local Administration and the State Institute for Rural Development.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Kerala has the highest human development outcomes in India, with 99 percent literacy, the highest life expectancy, and the lowest rates of infant mortality. Despite
     India’s recent economic slowdown as a result of the global downturn, Kerala’s economy preformed much better than expected (gross state domestic product (GSDP)
     $59.4 billion: FY2011-2012). Nonetheless, Kerala has not been spared from the global slowdown; low capital investment in economic infrastructure has been an
     unfortunate consequence of fiscal constraints and high revenue expenditures. Kerala’s draft Road Development Policy estimates that improving existing roads to match
     the economic aspirations of the state will require an annual investment of $885 million over the next 10 years.
     The main goal of the Kerala State Transport Project II (KSTP II), which follows the first KSTP that ended in 2010, is to support the state in upgrading the most critical
     and strategically important state highways and building sustainable institutions. On a pilot basis, a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the State’s Public Works
     Department and a private concessionaire—one of the first of its kind in India—will be established to deliver a specific road section. The Bank’s technical assistance is
     aimed at helping the state attract much needed private-sector investment and innovation to the road sector. The project also seeks to support efforts by the government
     to reverse the trend in road accidents and deaths. While the number of road crashes in Kerala declined by 17 percent between 2005 and 2011, the number of traffic
     fatalities has increased by 27 percent during the same period, from 3,200 to 4,100. The project will pilot the concept of road safety demonstration corridors and
     increase local participation through a “road safety challenge fund”.
     The project’s development objective is to improve conditions, traffic flow, and road safety, with a focus on vulnerable road users, on selected roads in Kerala. The Project
     has three components:
     ■■   Road network upgrading and safety improvement includes upgrading (widening to full two-lane standard) 363 km of strategically important state highways to
          complete network connectivity in the state.
     ■■   Road safety management supports the strengthening of the road safety management systems in Kerala with the objective of arresting the increase of crash fatali-
          ties in the state, with a particular focus on vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists).
     ■■   Institutional strengthening improves the sustainability of Kerala’s state road network with respect to its functional adequacy, financial viability, and capacity of key
          state road sector institutions to deliver road infrastructure and services that are responsive to road user needs.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   The project will enhance connectivity between key socio-economic centers and reduce travel times between the main engines of economic activity in the state.
     ■■   It is expected that the project will reach 13.4 million direct beneficiaries, more than half of whom are women.
     ■■   Travel time on the improved roads should decrease by 20 percent. Approximately 350 km of improved roads will have significantly improved capacity and
          smoothness.
     ■■   The road safety emphasis of the projects should help reduce the number of fatalities by 20 percent on the safe road demonstration corridors

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Housing shortages in India, with a growing urban population, are the result of complex supply and demand factors. Inappropriate land-use policies and building
norms artificially restrict the supply of housing. There is a lack of land serviced by utilities with appropriate zoning and formal property rights. Demand is constrained
by lack of formal housing finance, especially for lower-income households (incomes below Rs 16,666 per month). More than 90 percent of the housing shortage
is faced by these lower-income households, which have traditionally not been a commercial target for mainstream financial institutions. Only 31 percent of these
households with housing loans obtained their mortgages from the two cheapest sources of credit (banks and government programs). Microfinance, if available, is
restricted to small loan sizes with high interest rates. Lower-income households face high borrowing costs due to, among other things, the informality of their income
(no documentation of income) and the informality of their dwelling (no clear title to the property that can be mortgaged).

The main objective of the Low-Income Housing Finance Project for India is to provide access to sustainable housing finance for low-income households to purchase,
build, or upgrade their dwellings. The project aims to address market failures by giving the necessary capacity building and implementation support and incentives
to the National Housing Bank (NHB)—the apex level financial institution for housing finance in India—intermediary institutions, and primary lending institutions to
expand lending to lower-income groups. The project also provides finance for NHB to refinance low-income housing loans made by primary lenders.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Increase in the number of primary lenders active in the low-income segments.
■■   Increase in the volume of lending to lower-income borrowers.
■■   Increase in the number of borrowers in these segments.
■■   The project also expects to: develop prudent lending standards to serve the more vulnerable, lower-income households; expand the coverage of credit bureaus
     to include informal-income borrowers; develop consumer information and disclosure norms for the project’s target groups; enhance the appraisal capacity of the
     lenders; and pilot new policies and products to overcome the challenges of dwelling informality.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Madhya Pradesh (MP), with a State GDP of US$728, is a low-income state, with a population of 73 million, of which 75% live in rural areas. While average human
     development indicators in MP resemble the national average, rural areas, women, and Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) groups face significant disadvantages.
     Nearly 10% of all students in higher education in India are enrolled in a higher education institute in MP. These 1.6 million students attend 36 universities and 1316
     colleges in the state. In 2012-13, MP’s Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education was 19.5%, close to the national average of 21.1%. However, in the age group
     18 to 23 years, only 13.1% of SC students and 7.5% of ST students were enrolled in higher education. Enrollment rates for women students in MP are especially low,
     with only 36% of enrollments comprising women students, relative to a national average of 45%. In 2012, the Bank carried out a major review of the higher education
     sector in MP, resulting in the report ‘Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Reforms: Policy Options’. In addition to the two core challenges discussed above — access and
     equity — the report identifies low quality as a fundamental concern. Only about half of an incoming cohort of students graduate at the end of three years, and an even
     smaller percent finding employment.
     Following the launch of the report, the Government of Madhya Pradesh sought assistance from the World Bank for quality improvement and reforms in the higher
     education sector. The development objective of the Madhya Pradesh Higher Education Quality Improvement Project is to improve student outcomes in selected higher
     education institutions and to increase the effectiveness of the higher education system in Madhya Pradesh

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   Number of project beneficiaries increasing by 13149 over the baseline (42% of which are female)
     ■■   On-time graduation rate of UG students at supported institutions increasing by 2 percentage points
     ■■   Number of government Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) accredited by NAAC increasing from 37 to 55
     ■■   30 Government HEIs publishing an annual report in prescribed format
     ■■   The satisfaction scores of beneficiaries in supported HEIs is at least 60

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Farmers in the state of Maharashtra have severely limited choices in accessing markets. They continue to rely on regulated wholesale markets—known as mandi, or
Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets—which are mandatory for the wholesale trading of many agricultural products. The relatively small number
of licensed traders and commission agents in these markets has not only limited farmers’ choices, but also resulted in strong political economy interests to preserve
the system, and to under-investment in physical infrastructure. The challenge for Maharashtra is to create an environment that enables the farming community
to acquire the technical capacity necessary to access market opportunities that result in higher returns and better incomes. The Government of Maharashtra’s
long-term development plan for improving agriculture productivity and competitiveness includes working through the Bank-supported Maharashtra Agricultural
Competitiveness Project (MACP) to implement a three-pronged approach that promotes the development of alternative marketing options, supports the top tier of
regulated wholesale markets in the state to reform, invest, and provide better services; and gradually undertakes regulatory reforms. Regulatory change, investments
in physical infrastructure, strengthened capacity, and improved governance, as well as the participation of all stakeholders (farmers, traders, commission agents,
processors, and consumers) is expected to improve competitiveness.

Project activities are grouped into three components:
■■     Intensification and diversification of market-led production: It supports agriculture technology transfer, facilitates networking among farmers and agribusinesses
       on emerging marketing opportunities, provides market intelligence using information and communications technology-based applications and other means,
       and strengthens livestock support services in the state.
■■     Improving farmer access to markets: Promotes alternative market opportunities by establishing farmer groups and a warehouse receipts system, upgrading local
       rural markets, piloting e-trading platforms, and modernizing existing wholesale markets and livestock yards.
■■     Project management, learning, and adjusting: Undertakes project coordination and management, and monitoring and evaluation
■■

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
Progress under agriculture marketing reforms are leading to the emergence of alternative market arrangements outside the regulated markets.
■■     The Project has reached and benefitted about 0.4 million direct beneficiaries. Socioeconomic screening, targeting and beneficiary mobilization process have
       allowed significant participation of small and marginal farmers in the project activities.
■■     Social mobilization and capacity building has resulted in the formation of about 13,000 community level institutions (i.e. CIGs in crop and livestock sectors).
■■     331 farmer producer companies have been registered for the purposes of backward and forward linkages.
■■     The project, in partnership with eight commercial banks, facilitated about INR 7950 million of Negotiable Warehouse Receipting (NWR) funding since FY 2010-
       11; significantly the share of the NWRs issued to farmers increased from 34% to 55% and NWRs credit increased from 19 % to 39 %.
■■     The Agribusiness Promotion Facility (ABPF), established under the project, through the business development services has supported 364 agribusiness entrepre-
       neurs (essentially micro and small enterprises), who have made an investment of about INR 720.00 million.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     TThe Government of Maharashtra seeks to significantly expand the frontiers of its Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector, under its 10 year vision (2012-22), with
     a focus on increasing house connection coverage, ensuring continuous water supply with adequate pressure and minimum quality standards, and ensuring that
     100 percent of the rural population has access to safe water and basic sanitation. However, delivering this vision requires building capacities of institutions through
     appropriate implementation and management models. Maharashtra is also a rapidly urbanizing state with many large villages (each with a population of more than
     10,000 people) and a growing number of peri-urban areas that are demanding higher levels of service. Finally, the state also faces challenges in addressing the needs
     of water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas, managing drinking water quality, and ensuring drinking water security in the face of increasing droughts and
     climate change impacts on rainfall patterns and the yield of existing sources.
     The Bank supports a portion of the broader Government of Maharashtra program over a six-year period (2014-20), focusing on two primary set of activities which
     address the underlying challenges of the sector in Maharashtra: (i) institutional capacity building for planning, implementation, and monitoring of the RWSS sector
     across Maharashtra; and (ii) in select districts, implementation of: (a) water supply and sullage management service improvement in peri-urban villages; and (b) water
     supply service improvement and improved groundwater management practices in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.
     The Program Development Objective of the World Bank’s Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program is to improve the performance of Maharashtra’s
     sector institutions in planning, implementation and monitoring of its Rural Water Supply and Sanitation program and to improve access to quality and sustainable
     services in peri-urban villages, and in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.

     The operation uses the “Program-for-Results” (PforR) financing instrument, in which funds are disbursed from the Bank only after achieving specified results. It is one
     of the first such operations in India.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     This program for results operation is in the early stages of implementation. By the 2020 closing date, the following results are expected to be achieved:
     ■■   Strengthened sector planning and monitoring.
     ■■   Improved capacity for program implementation.
     ■■   Improved access to quality and sustainable water and sanitation services in peri-urban villages.
     ■■   Improved access to safe drinking water in water-stressed and water-quality-affected areas.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The high cost of limited regional integration and trade in the northeastern part of South Asia is clearly illustrated by the case of Mizoram state in India. Despite its
potentially advantageous geographic location between Myanmar and Bangladesh, Mizoram in India’s Northeastern region is one of the poorest in the country, ranking
26th out of 28 states in terms of per capita income. Mizoram’s lagging economic development is in large part due to its landlocked location, poor infrastructure and
limited linkages with the markets and ports of neighboring countries including Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Myanmar.

Mizoram’s road network is poor in quality and under-developed, and has among the lowest density in all of India. Key issues and challenges in the road sector include:
inadequate sector funding, inadequate maintenance, weak planning for investments, not the most up-to-date road engineering practices and business procedures,
limited capacity of road agency staff, low capacity of the local construction industry, and poor road safety management.
The development objective for Mizoram Roads II Regional Connectivity Project is to increase transport connectivity along regional trade corridors in Mizoram. With
road transport being the only mode of transport within the state, improvements to the network should enhance the environment for development and growth by
reducing freight and passenger transport costs while providing quicker and safer access to all parts of the state and to neighboring states and countries. The project
has two components:
■■   Improvement of priority cross-border roads and trade-related infrastructure: Widening and strengthening 81 km of road and preparation studies for approxi-
     mately 330 km of road, along with construction or improvement of trade-related infrastructure along project roads.
■■   Road sector modernization and performance enhancement through institutional strengthening: Supports gradual transformation of the Public Works Depart-
     ment into a modern road agency through implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan that will carry forward and deepen various institutional develop-
     ment initiatives introduced under the first Mizoram State Roads Project.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
Expected results are a 40 percent increase in traffic along project corridors and a 30 percent reduction in travel time on project corridors.
■■   27.5-km Champhai-Zokhawthar Road upgrading works in progress with 21% physical progress;
■■   41.7-km Chhumkhum-Chawngte Road upgrading works in progress with 8% physical progress;
■■   12-km section of Tlabung – Kawrpuichhuah Road upgrading works contract awarded in August 2016;
■■   Feasibility and Draft Design report for i) Chawngte- Diltlang- Bungtlang South- Multi Modal Road Junction (76 km); ii) Junction NH44A (Origination) – Chungt-
     lang – Darlung – Buarpui(83km); iii) Buarpui – Thenlum – Zawlpui (95km); and iv) Zawlpui – Phairuangkai (30 km) is in final stage.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In India, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) account for more than 80 percent of total industrial enterprises, produce over 8,000 value-added products, and
     employ an estimated 60 million people. MSMEs contribute around 45 percent to manufacturing output and about 40 percent to exports, both directly and indirectly. In
     addition, over 50 percent of MSMEs are rural enterprises and widely distributed across low-income states, making them an important sector for promoting economic
     growth and poverty reduction. With eight million people entering the labor force every year, MSMEs have the potential to be an important source of employment and
     entrepreneurship, foster innovation and are the cradle for the government’s “Make in India” vision. Addressing the key constraints that inhibit MSMEs from accessing
     finance is of utmost importance.
     Financial institutions have limited their exposure to the sector due to a higher risk perception, information asymmetry, high transaction costs and the lack of collateral.
     The MSME census of 2006-07 estimated that about 87 percent of MSMEs did not have any access to finance and were self-financed. Credit towards micro and small
     enterprises represents only around 13-15 percent of formal financial institutions’ portfolio.

     This project will work with the government in developing innovative products that address the constraints of MSMEs, respond to the changing needs of the Indian
     economy and also catalyze private-sector financing. The project will support MSMEs through direct financing by the Small Industries Development Bank of India
     (SIDBI), an apex financial institution for promotion, financing and development of MSMEs, and through participating financial institutions across three components.
     These include support to startup debt financing and risk capital as well as support to service and manufacturing sector financing models.

     The project will support SIDBI in developing, innovating, and scaling up its startup debt-financing program. It will also support entry of potential participating financing
     institutions in the development of this missing financial market. It will support service-sector firms’ financing. This sector continues to face challenges in accessing
     formal finance due to lack of physical assets to provide as collateral, even though the structure of the Indian economy is markedly shifting towards services (65
     percent of the Indian GDP). The project will also support manufacturing MSMEs through innovative financial products including loan extension services and cluster
     financing—including women-led clusters. Particular focus will be to expand manufacturing activity in financially underserved areas, including low-income states
     especially through refinancing.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Outstanding MSME loan portfolios in risk capital financing including startups, in the service sector and in the manufacturing sector.
     ■■   Turnover of startups supported through the project
     ■■   Innovation and development of new financing products (including new approaches to startup loans, franchising finance).
     ■■   Greater number of entrants as participating financing institutions under the credit line.
     ■■   Loan extension services and energy efficiency audits to facilitate adoption of environmentally sound production.
     ■■   Improved internal processing time, efficiency and strengthened credit appraisal methods for loans along these segments within SIDBI.
     ■■   Improved collaboration for information sharing with external partners.
     ■■   Increase in the number of women-owned/managed MSME beneficiaries under the credit line.
     ■■   Increase in the number of MSMEs in low-income states benefitting from the line of credit

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Like other fast-growing urban centers in India, the Mumbai region faces enormous challenges, including an acute inadequacy of transport infrastructure. The suburban
rail system is the lifeline of Mumbai, carrying more than 7.5 million passengers daily. In the early 2000s, the Bank supported the Government of Maharashtra and
Indian Railways’ efforts to ease transport constraints in the megalopolis through the first Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP). TranSforM, a comprehensive
transport study for the Mumbai region, carried out under the MUTP, recommended further investment in the suburban rail system as a priority, in recognition of
suburban rail’s dominant role in the region’s transport network. MUTP-2A is the follow-up investment in the rail sector, aimed at helping the government respond to
continued growing demand for suburban rail transport in the Mumbai metropolitan area.

The project development objective is to improve the passenger-carrying capacity, passenger-comfort level, operational efficiency, and the institutional capacity of
entities involved in the suburban rail system of Mumbai metropolitan area. The project’s main compnents are:
■■   EMU rolling stock fleet increase: 864 additional EMU (electric multiple unit) cars will be procured, increasing the fleet to 3,124.
■■   Conversion of power supply from direct current to alternating current: Includes improvements to signals and telecommunications in three sections of the Mum-
     bai railway network.
■■   EMU maintenance facilities and stabling lines: New stabling lines will be built to accommodate the fleet increase.
■■   Capacity strengthening and technical assistance: Strategic and tactical studies will be carried out, as well as capacity building and training.
■■   The project will also address safety-related issues and increase safety awareness

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   The project will increase the number of train services in peak hour (presently varying from 14.4 to 17 trains per hour) to 18 trains per hour on all lines.
■■   Trains currently comprise nine or 12 cars each, and these will be converted to 12 cars each, resulting in increased carrying capacity.
■■   Improved system efficiency will result in reduced journey time, varying from about 2.5 percent to 8 percent on different lines.
■■   The new trains being procured are more energy efficient, with a regenerative braking system, resulting in reduction of energy consumption by about 30 percent
     from conventional trains.
■■   Technical assistance studies under the project are helping the implementing agency to build capacity and plan a more efficient suburban rail system.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India launched the first National AIDS Control Program (NACP I) in 1992, focusing on blood safety, prevention among high risk groups (HRGs), raising awareness
in general population and improving surveillance. In the second phase, (NACP II, 1999-2006), India continued to expand the program at state level, with greater
emphasis on targeted interventions (TIs) and involvement of NGOs. In the third phase, (NACP III, 2007-2012), India scaled up targeted HIV prevention interventions
for most at risk groups and further expanded the surveillance system.
The goals of the fourth phase are to accelerate reversal of the HIV epidemic and integrate the response over the next five-year phase. The National AIDS Control support
Project (NACSP) will support the Strategic Plan of the fourth phase of NACP 2012 – 2017, with a focus on the prevention of HIV and targeted interventions.
The Project will contribute to three of the five strategies of the National AIDS control program IV: (i) the prevention component, (ii) the behavior change component, and
(iii) the institutional strengthening component. The main support of the Project will go towards the scale up of HIV prevention interventions, with a focus on the high
impact and cost-effective targeted prevention interventions for population groups at high risk, and IEC including behavior change and demand generation. The Project
will also support DAC/NACO to further strengthening its project management including human resource support and technical support for TIs.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase safe behaviors among high risk groups to contribute to the national goal of reversal of the HIV epidemic by
2017. The project will support the following three components:
■■ Scaling Up Targeted Prevention Interventions to address hard-to-reach population groups who do not yet access and use the prevention services of the program,
     and saturate coverage among the HRGs.
■■ Behavior Change Communications (for risk reduction and safe behavior including advocacy, social mobilization and BCC to integrate high risk groups into society
     and encourage changes aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination in society; research and evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness and program impact of
     behavior change communications activities; and establish and evaluate a helpline at the national and state level.
■■ Institutional strengthening to support innovations to enhance performance management including fiduciary management; strengthen procurement and supply
     chain management and provide technical support.

KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
HIV estimates published on December 1, 2015 showed continued overall reduction in adult HIV prevalence from 0.34% in 2007, to 0.26% in 2015, a reduction of 24%
■■   The estimated annual new HIV infections (among all population) fell from 127,576 in 2007 to 86,309 in 2015, a reduction of 32% from baseline of 2007.
■■   Significant improvement of condom usage among High risk groups (HRGs) which are also the PDO indicators for the project.
■■   The coverage of TIs is 89% for Female Sex Workers (FSW) (above the target of 85% for 2016), 78% for men who have sex with men (MSM) (above the target of
     75% for 2016), and 80.6% for injection drug users (IDU) (slightly below the target of 83% for 2016).
■■   Based on the semi-annual evaluation of NGOs implementing the TIs, 94% had a performance of Good or Very Good.
■■   Under Behavior Change Communications, contracting of media planning agency is completed and all the media activities implemented by NACO are not closely
     monitored. The helpline services on HIV AIDS are implemented across all the states.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. Approximately 5,700 km of the total 7,500 km of coastline is
     exposed to severe cyclones, and an estimated 40 percent of India’s 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of the coast. Between 1980 and 2000, on average 370 million
     people were exposed to cyclones. Up to half of all tropical cyclones affecting South Asia hit the Indian coastline, which is particularly susceptible to storm surges due
     to a shallow coastal shelf and tidal characteristics. The economic impact is also considerable; studies indicate natural disaster losses of as much as 2 percent of India’s
     GDP and as much as 12 percent of federal government revenues. As the effects of climate change become more pronounced, threats are likely to increase. The National
     Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project supports the Government of India in its efforts to mitigate cyclone-related risk and integrate disaster mitigation into the long-term
     national development process.

     The project aim is to reduce vulnerability of communities in the coastal areas. The project is the first phase of a proposed three-phased adaptable program loan. The
     first phase of the project covers the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The project has four components:
     ■■   Early warning system and capacity building for coastal communities aims to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities by addressing the existing gaps in
          disseminating warnings to communities, and in piloting and using new technology.
     ■■   Cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure aims to improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation, and other forms of protection.
     ■■   Technical assistance for national and state level capacity building and knowledge creation to help understand risk and vulnerabilities better, and prepare key
          institutions to address them effectively.
     ■■   Project management and implementation support provides support for project management by financing incremental operating costs for the project manage-
          ment unit and implementation units, nodal units in line departments and the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), office equipment, training and
          exposure visits, and consulting services for specialist activities.


     KEY RESULTS ACHIEVE AND EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Out of 538 Multi-Purpose Cyclone Shelters –MPCS (292 NCRMP –I and 246 NCRMP-AF), 232 MPCS (216 NCRMP –I and 16 NCRMP –AF) have been completed,
     ■■   226 Cyclone Shelter Management and Maintenance Committees (CSMMCs) have been formed at the community level, 144 Village Task forces and 144 Joint
          accounts have been opened, 130 CSMMCs have been registered as societies, 80 cyclone shelter have corpus funds.
     ■■   20 bridges, 2 saline embankments and 724 kilometres (km) of evacuation roads (70448km NCRMP-I AND 20km NCRMP –AF) have been completed.
     ■■   By the year 2017, 538 shelters, 1,050 km of roads, and 160 km of embankment strengthening work will be completed.
     ■■   45 percent of the coastal population now have access to cyclone shelters, up from 30 percent at the start of the project and against a 60 percent end-of-project
          target.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND KEY PARTNERS:
     The project is supported by Ministry of Home Affairs and implemented by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), National Institute of Disaster
     Management (NIDM), Department of Revenue and Disaster Management, Government of Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha State Disaster Management Authority,

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India is highly vulnerable to natural hazards, particularly cyclones, floods, earthquakes, and landslides. Approximately 5,700 km of the total 7,500 km of coastline is
exposed to severe cyclones, and an estimated 40 percent of India’s 1.2 billion people live within 100 km of the coast. The Global Climate Change and Vulnerability
Index 2011, ranked India second in ‘extreme risk’ countries in the world vulnerable to natural and climate change hazards. As storm surges and climate change
induced sea level rise become more pronounced, hazard events are set to grow in frequency and intensity.

The NCRMP is a flagship program, the first Bank funded project in India exclusively focusing on ex-ante disaster risk mitigation. The project is part of a broader national
multi-hazard mitigation program taken up by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) that includes understanding hazards like seismic risk, floods,
landslides and establishment of a National Disaster Management communication network. This project, along with NCRMP-I and Additional Financing, Tamil Nadu
and Puducherry Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project, and the Odisha Disaster Reconstruction Project, will provide support in reducing coastal vulnerability for India’s
entire mainland coast.
The NCRMP is structured in phases, based on the risk levels of the states and their implementation readiness. NCRMP Phase- I, under implementation since 2010,
includes the states of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, and in NCRMP Phase-II the states of Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and West Bengal are being
included. The project has four components:
■■   Early Warning Dissemination System and capacity building for coastal communities aims to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities by addressing the
     existing gaps in disseminating warnings to communities.
■■   Cyclone risk mitigation infrastructure aims to improve access to emergency shelters, evacuation routes, up-grading roads, bridges, embankments and bunds and
     underground electrical cabling.
■■   Technical assistance for Multi-Hazard Risk management at the national and state level capacity building and knowledge creation aims to help improve quality of
     information of multi-hazard risk for decision making. Activities include Multi-hazard risk modeling, strengthening emergency response and recovery capacity in
     coastal and non-coastal states, Hydro-meteorological resilience action plans, and design of national seismic risk mitigation program.
■■   Project management and implementation support by financing incremental operating costs for the project management unit and implementation units, nodal
     units in line departments and the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), office equipment, training and exposure visits, and consulting services for
     specialist activities.


KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   Over 6 million people have access to 353 Multi-purpose cyclone shelters planned and access to 290 kilometers of roads and bridges
■■   300 kilometers of electrical cabling made resilient by transferring underground
■■   90 kilometers of embankments rehabilitated that will protect 20,000 hectares of coastal land
■■   By the end of the project the targeted coastal states will have a Hydro-meteorological Action Plan and coastal population covered by early warning dissemination
     system that reach down to the “last-mile” community.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Milk is the single largest agricultural commodity in the country in terms of value of output. Almost half of rural households depend on dairy for their livelihood.
     About 80 percent of dairy farmers are small-scale and marginal, typically owning one to three milk-producing animals (cow and buffalo). But average milk yield is low
     compared to international benchmarks, and the growth rate of domestic milk production has slowed in recent years while domestic demand continues to grow. The
     gap between supply and demand has meant rising milk prices.

     This project supports the National Dairy Plan (NDP) implemented by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB). The NDP is a multi-state initiative to increase per-
     animal milk productivity, strengthen and expand village-level infrastructure for milk procurement, and enhance milk processing capacity and marketing over a 15-year
     horizon. With this project, the Bank is re-engaging in India’s dairy development by supporting the first phase of the NDP through investments designed to enhance
     animal productivity and improve farmer access to organized milk marketing channels. Increasing productivity in the Indian dairy sector can potentially contribute to
     improved food security and stability of national—and global—milk prices, as well as to improved incomes of millions of smallholder milk producers. In parallel, NDP
     investments are reducing the carbon footprint of dairy – for example, through ration balancing – while increasing per animal milk productivity. The project finances
     three components:
     ■■   Productivity enhancement: Increases per-animal productivity through support for improved animal breeding and nutrition.
     ■■   Milk collection and bulking: Increases market access of milk producers by investing in village-level organization and infrastructure.
     ■■   Project management and learning: Supports project management, coordination, monitoring, learning, and evaluation.

     KEY RESULTS:
     ■■   Milk production per animal reached 5.61 liters/day, equal to an 11 percent increase relative to the baseline (target is 10 percent).
     ■■   Under breed improvement activities, initial breed comparisons for performance on milk production and fat percentage are encouraging, with relatively high
          yields for indigenous breeds under the Progeny Testing program. Conception rates under the AI program (up to 60%) are excellent.
     ■■   The Ration Balancing Program (RBP) has reduced both feed cost and methane emissions by 12% for some 1.13 million farmers.
     ■■   Fodder demonstrations – using new seed varieties, harvesting technologies and storage methods – are fundamental to increasing dairy productivity and improv-
          ing adaptation to climate variability. The Project has met its targets.
     ■■   Under milk collection and bulking activities, with 26,580 villages covered (Cooperatives and Producer Companies) and 0.75 million additional producers en-
          rolled, the Project is already exceeding targets.
     ■■   NDSP is empowering women and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST): 20% of Local Resource Persons under RBP are women and 15% are from SC/ST. Of
          total farmers enrolled in RBP, 32% are women and 61% are SC/ST.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Ganga River, despite being highly revered and the primary water resource for the heartland of India, is seriously polluted and under extreme environmental stress.
The river suffers from high levels of organic and bacterial pollution, resulting in a wide range of negative impacts, including on human health, agriculture, urban
services, and the environment. The pollution in the Ganga is primarily a result of inadequate infrastructure, the weak capacity of local water and wastewater utilities in
the basin, and the poor state of environmental monitoring and regulation. In 2009, the Government of India developed a new vision for clean-up and conservation of
the Ganga, leading to the establishment of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) with the mandate to develop and implement a multi-sector program.
The World Bank’s National Ganga River Basin Project provides upstream support to the NGRBA for institutional development, program design, and early investments.
This is a flagship project of the World Bank and the Government of India, and has high priority in India due to the scale of the challenge, and the religious, historical,
and cultural importance of the Ganga River in India.

The project development objectives are to support the NGRBA in: (i) building the capacity of its nascent operational-level institutions so they can manage the long-
term Ganga clean-up and conservation program; and (ii) implementing a diverse set of demonstrative investments for reducing point-source pollution loads in a
sustainable manner at priority locations on the Ganga. Project components cover:
■■   Institutional development: Including operationalization of the new NGRBA, communications campaigns for river cleaning, and technical assistance for city service
     providers and environmental regulators.
■■   Infrastructure investments in four sectors: Wastewater collection and treatment; industrial pollution control; solid waste management; and riverfront develop-
     ment, with investments to be selected according to a framework approach.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
Key expected results are
■■   to lessen the volume of untreated wastewater entering the Ganga, benefitting over 3 million persons
■■   to increase wastewater treatment capacity
■■   Increase the number of water quality monitoring stations generating real time data.
Achievements to date are
■■   Award of 14 contracts with the total contract cost of US$ 334 million for works, with all works packages expected to be awarded by the end of 2016.
■■   Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has commenced installation of real-time water quality data collection.
■■   Preparation of Ganga Knowledge Center (GKC) is underway in cooperation with the on-going Ganga River Basin modelling works under the Ministry.

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
At the center: the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.

KEY PARTNERS:
Central Pollution Control Board under Ministry of Forestry and Environment. In the states: State Program Management Groups (SPMGs) in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh,
Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal. Below the SPMGs are multiple-executing agencies, mostly large parastatals such as the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam in Uttar Pradesh,
and the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation in Bihar.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Government of India is keen to sustain its achievements in economic growth, which has been at 8 percent per annum in recent years. Improving the level and
     quality of infrastructure services will be critical for this goal. National highways (82,755 km) account for only 1.9 percent of the total road length in the country, but
     carry over 40 percent of the total road traffic. While the government invested significantly in the core national highways under the NHDP, the remaining 43 percent
     of the national highway network have not received adequate funding until recently. Considerable stretches of the non-NHDP network require strengthening and
     upgrading, and suffer from major connectivity gaps. In recent years, there has been an increasing recognition of the importance of the non-NHDP network. It holds the
     key to ease poverty and share prosperity, and for achieving the government’s objective of equitable and inclusive growth, as it often serves as the primary or sole link
     with remote, economically lagging, or otherwise challenged regions. The government has identified a portion of non-NHDP roads for priority development through
     external financing and budgetary allocations.

     The project development objective is to improve national highway network connectivity to less-developed areas and low-income states, and enhance the institutional
     capacity of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) to better manage the highway network. The project consists of three components:
     ■■   A road improvement and maintenance component to upgrade and maintain national highways in three low-income states (Bihar, Orissa and Rajasthan) and less-
          developed regions in two middle-income states (Karnataka and West Bengal).
     ■■   An institutional development component to enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage its highway network through supporting specific
          interventions in the areas of: process improvements; network monitoring and management; financing; governance and accountability; and training.
     ■■   A road safety component working on updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; improving road accident data collection and analysis at
          the central level and in project states; strengthening road safety capacity at the central level; and promoting social marketing and awareness campaigns along
          project roads.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     About 1,120 km of existing single/intermediate lane roads will be upgraded to two-lane standard, and maintained for five years after construction. More specific
     expected results include:

     Increase in the length of non-NHDP national highways in good and fair condition from 65 percent to 68.25 percent.

     On project roads, percent reduction in average travel time and average vehicle operating cost; no increase in fatalities in road crashes.

     Improved accident data management system and asset management system developed and implemented in at least three states.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Despite high GDP growth rate over the past decade, over 250 million rural people in India (45 million households) remain locked in poverty, living on less than $1 per
day. Rural livelihoods programs are designed to help tackle this immense development challenge.
The Bank’s engagement on rural livelihood programs dates back to a series of projects in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan started in
2000. Since then, the Bank has invested more than a $1 billion in 11 livelihood projects at the state level. Thirty million rural poor have been mobilized to form their
own institutions, enabling them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. The rural poor have been empowered socially and
economically, enabling them to build linkages with state and market institutions. They have higher savings, more access to credit, livelihoods and public services, and
households and communities benefit from increased public and private investment. The National Rural Livelihoods Project supports the Government of India’s efforts to
scale up these state-level interventions to the national level through support to the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM)—Aajeevika. Bank financing supports the
program in 13 high poverty (also mostly low-income) states.
The project’s development objective is to establish efficient and effective institutional platforms for the rural poor that enable them to increase household income
through sustainable livelihood enhancements and improved access to financial and selected public services. Project components cover:
■■ Institutional and human capacity development: to transform the role of the Ministry of Rural Development into that of providing high-quality technical assistance
     in the field of rural livelihoods promotion.
■■ State livelihood support to help state governments in establishing necessary institutional structures and mechanisms to implement NRLM activities from the state-
     to the block-level, including support to forming institutions for the rural poor.
■■ Innovation and partnership support: to create an institutional mechanism to identify, nurture, and support innovative ideas from across the country to address the
     livelihood needs of the rural poor.
Project implementation support to strengthen the national mission management unit for effective project management at the national level to develop key systems and
processes to coordinate and manage the project and the NRLM.
The project has been restructured twice. As part of the first restructuring the credit amount was reduced to US $ 500 million Subsequently, after the mid-term review the
project was restructured on second occasion to create dedicated funds for livelihoods; Financial Inclusion; Convergence and Skills. Results framework was also suitably
modified to incorporate the changes.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■    About 6 million identified rural poor households will be mobilized into community institutions, $100 million in cumulative savings would be made by rural poor
      households through thrift, $500 million in bank credit would be leveraged by rural poor households from the formal financial sector, one million rural poor house-
      holds would have improved farm productivity, livestock productivity, and market access, and 500,000 new jobs would be created for the poor.
■■    As of mid 2016, all 13 participating states have set up the institutional architecture of the state missions.
■■    The program is intensively working with nearly 5.6 million households and 4.87 Lakh Self Help Groups (SHGs). These SHGs have saved $120 million and nearly
      $300 million worth of credit has been leveraged cumulatively from the commercial banks.

KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
The project recognizes partnerships as key implementation arrangements and encourages the states to directly access technical and knowledge support from reputed
resource organizations, especially in the following areas:
Partnerships with home-grown models like International Fund for Agriculture Development/DFID/East Asia and Pacific, sharing the same ethos. Some of the ongoing
partners include MAVIM, OTELP, JTELP, WDC, and NGOs with track records.
Knowledge partners for programmatic verticals like BIRD (Financial Services), NABARD, PRADAN (Agriculture and Ecological Services), BAIF (Livestock), Landesa (Land
Access), and FAO (Agriculture and Livestock).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project would enhance the impacts of the Government of India’s Integrated Watershed Management Program (IWMP) operations in targeted watersheds, chiefly
     through intensive technical assistance. Support would: (i) introduce landscape-level assessment and planning as a window for better program convergence; (ii)
     strengthen participatory, evidence-based micro-watershed planning; (iii) improve program monitoring and evaluation; (iv) expand knowledge sharing and transfer of
     new science-based innovations into watershed management; (v) support a stronger focus on improving agricultural productivity and market linkages; (vi) strengthen
     watershed institutions at the national, state, and community level; and (vii) improve program equity and sustainability. The project would cover 400 sub-watersheds
     and two million hectares across the eight states, and reach approximately 482,000 farmer households and 2 million people.

     The development objective is to support IWMP through technical assistance to improve incremental conservation outcomes and agricultural yields for communities in
     selected sites, and adoption of more effective processes and technologies. Its four components are:
     ■■   Central institutional and capacity building: Strengthens institutions and human resources of key national stakeholders, particularly the Department of Land
          Resources, for more effective planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of watershed management programs.
     ■■   National innovation support: Supports the application of innovative, science-based knowledge, tools and approaches to underpin improvements to IWMP around
          watershed planning and implementation, agricultural intensification, climate change, rural livelihoods and hydrology, based on identified needs of the states,
          communities, and farmers.
     ■■   IWMP implementation support in participating states: Provides intensive, science-based technical assistance to improve IWMP operational effectiveness, conver-
          gence/integration with other government programs, and measurable impacts on the ground in selected sites in participating states.
     ■■   Project management and coordination: Finances management and implementation costs, including specialized incremental staff costs (both full and part-time),
          incremental operating costs for travel (per World Bank norms), meetings, financial management, internal/external audit and procurement, equipment, and
          project management consultancies

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   Conservation outcomes in selected micro-watersheds as measured by 50 percent reduction in soil loss over baseline of 3.3 tons/ha/year and incremental changes
          in overall watershed biomass to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index value of 1.01.
     ■■   Average 25 percent gain in incremental productivity of arable lands across five crop types.
     ■■   Three new approaches integrated into national watershed guidelines.
     ■■   An estimated 2.4 million direct project beneficiaries, of which 30 percent are women.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
■■   Background: The road sector has been identified by GoI to be one of the key economic sectors needed to sustain India’s current growth rate. The proposed project
     is a strategic, policy-driven engagement between the Bank and MoRTH/NHAI, meant to facilitate the broadening of the Bank’s involvement with NHAI in particular
     and the road sector in general, in a fundamental way. This engagement is a direct involvement in the systemic issues of the organization and the sector with strong
     institutional reform agenda.
■■   Objectives: Assist NHAI to adopt appropriate practices that would enhance its program management and operational efficiency.
■■

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The implementation pace and disbursement outlook of the project has considerably improved subsequent to the restructuring, which was approved by the
     Board in December 2015. The restructuring was helpful in Ministry taking project monitoring and implementation agency role (in addition to NHAI). As a result,
     procurement of activities has been substantially completed and many activities are nearing completion. Please refer to the current status of the project activities
     in Annex 1.
■■   Senior management of both MoRTH and NHAI is getting involved in key strategic studies being undertaken on a day to day basis and dialog has now shifted from
     resolving procurement issues to implementing recommendations emerging from the studies undertaken under this project (For example introducing indepen-
     dent quality audit system in NHAI, implementing performance rating regime for consultants/contractors/developers). Accordingly, a recent mission in January
     2016 has upgraded the implementation progress rating to Moderately Satisfactory.
■■   The loan extension for 12 months has been approved in April, enhancing likelihood of achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO).
■■   The project is likely to result in new investment project in the areas of Road Safety, logistics, climate change and PPP

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The project supports six states in the north eastern region of India to augment their transmission and distribution (T&D) networks and strengthen the capacity of
     the state-level institutions in extending last mile electricity connections to households. The project will help improve power supply to a region whose economic
     development has been constrained by power shortages, and where electricity consumption is less than a third of the national average. The existing power network
     infrastructure in these states is old and has not been adequately maintained. This makes it prone to high technical and non-technical losses, and leads to frequent
     interruptions and outages in power supply. In addition, most of the utilities incur commercial losses due to inadequate cost structures and tariffs.

     The project will strengthen and augment the intrastate transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution networks by upgrading old and constructing new lines and
     associated substations in the six participating states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura. These investments will allow the transmission
     network to transfer electricity more efficiently and with minimum wastage, and help the utilities supply reliable electricity at a stable voltage to consumers.
     The project will be implemented through POWERGRID, which has been appointed as the implementing agency by the Government of India and it will provide technical
     and managerial support for improving intra-state transmission and distribution systems in these states. After commissioning, the assets created under the project will
     be owned, operated and maintained by the respective state power utilities and departments. POWERGRID will also help build the capacity of the state departments
     and utilities to continue managing the refurbished networks in an optimum and efficient manner.

     The development objective is to increase the delivery of electricity at the boundaries of the power distribution network in the participating states in the North Eastern
     Region. The project has two components:
     ■■   Priority Investments for Strengthening Intrastate Transmission, Sub-transmission, and Distribution Systems.
     ■■   Technical Assistance for Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening (CBIS) of Power Utilities and Departments of Participating States

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     Progress toward the achievement of the project’s development objective will be measured by following indicators:
     ■■   Increase in the amount of electricity delivered at the boundaries of the power distribution network in each state;
     ■■   Increase in transformation capacity of the power T&D network in each state.
     In addition, the following intermediate indicators will be used to monitor progress:
     ■■   Transmission or distribution lines constructed or rehabilitated;
     ■■   number of grid or distribution substations constructed or upgraded;
     ■■   number of practice/process manuals updated or developed;
     ■■   person-days of utility staff participating in trainings;

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
More than 44 million people live in the North East region of India, 85 percent of whom live in rural areas, and 35 percent of whom are below the poverty line. Despite its
rich natural resources and relatively good human development indicators, the region lags behind the rest of India in economic growth. The development challenge in the
North East is compounded by geo-political isolation, protracted insurgency in some areas, and recurring natural disasters. Agriculture remains the backbone of the economy,
contributing close to 30 percent of regional GDP and providing employment to over 75 percent of the people. The traditional jhum (shifting) cultivation—the predominant
agriculture production method in the region—is no longer economically and environmentally viable due to increasing population pressure and shorter fallow periods, which
have led to reduced soil fertility and lower productivity. Despite the relatively high literacy rate, the region also suffers from an alarmingly high youth unemployment rate of
14 percent, mainly as a result of high drop-out rates and a lack of skills.
Since 2000, the World Bank in India has supported empowerment and livelihood enhancement through seven state level projects, which have mobilized over 30 million rural
poor to enable them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and economic capital. The programs have resulted in increased savings, improved access
to credit, livelihoods, and public services, and have contributed to the social empowerment of the excluded castes and indigenous people. Experience from these projects,
and from IFAD- financed projects in three north east states (Assam, Meghalaya, and Manipur), identified the need for: (i) effective skill development for youth; (ii) linking
community-based organizations with wider markets; (iii) improving communities’ access to credit and other financial services by forming sustainable institutions for the poor;
and iv) convergence with other government programs. The North East Rural Livelihoods Project aims to empower the rural poor and improve their livelihoods in the states of
Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura.
The development objective is to improve rural livelihoods, especially for women, unemployed youths, and the most disadvantaged, in the participating north eastern states.
The project has five components:
■■   To empower the rural communities and create sustainable institutions so that they manage common activities around microfinance, livelihoods and natural resource
     management.
■■   To develop the capacity of rural communities to plan and manage funds for economic initiatives.
■■   With various service providers, resource institutions and public and private sector organizations to bring resources such as finance, technology, and marketing so that the
     community groups are able to improve their livelihoods.
■■   To achieve a more focused approach towards planning and implementation of key livelihood sectors in the region
■■   To facilitate implementation, coordination, learning and quality enhancement.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
Expected results:
■■ 60 percent of female SHG members will increase their incomes by 30 percent.
■■ 30 percent of project-benefited unemployed youths will be employed
■■ 70 percent of the project supported households have diversified or scaled up their income generating activities.
■■ 50 percent of the institutions supported by the project are sustainable.
Results to date:
■■ Mobilization of over 200,000 women, forming nearly 20766 self-help groups, 722 village organizations and over 1500 village level community development groups;
■■ 220 million rupees ($4 million) in community savings
■■ 880 million rupees ($16 million) in financing provided for rural livelihoods
■■ Development plans being implemented in 110 communities.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     On October 12, 2013, Cyclone Phailin hit a densely populated area of the state of Odisha, with 4.5 million people in the path of wind gusts up to 220 kilometers per
     hour. It was the strongest cyclone to hit the Indian coast in 14 years: a category 4 storm similar to the Super Cyclone 05B of 1999 that hit Odisha and killed more than
     10,000 people, destroyed 275,000 homes and left 1.67 million homeless. Due to a highly successful and unprecedented government response, only about 44 people
     died in Cyclone Phailin, but the impact on coastal residents was extreme, particularly in the districts of Ganjam (where the cyclone made landfall), Puri, and Khordha.
     Damage was estimated at about US$1.45 billion, including US$480 million needed for housing reconstruction.
     The Odisha Disaster Recovery Project aims to restore and improve housing and public services in targeted communities of Odisha, and increase the government’s
     capacity to respond promptly and effectively to future emergencies. This project is part of a broader package to support the Government of Odisha’s reconstruction and
     recovery efforts and to strengthen their capacity to manage future events. The project has five components:
     ■■   Resilient housing reconstruction and community infrastructure: Focuses on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing, restoration of public buildings
          and public service networks using resilient construction standards, and development of village development plans.
     ■■   Urban infrastructure in Berhampur: Focuses on Berhampur, the largest city in Ganjam district, to improve public services while at the same time reducing their
          vulnerability. It includes the upgrading of affected slums and technical assistance for the Berhampur Municipal Corporation to improve resilience of public
          services and urban planning.
     ■■   Capacity building in disaster risk management: Strengthens the state’s capacity in risk mitigation, preparedness, and disaster response.
     ■■   Implementation: Supports the incremental operating costs of the project, including training, exposure visits, and knowledge exchange programs for the Odisha
          State Disaster Management Agency (OSDMA) and Berhampur Municipal Corporation.
     ■■   Contingency emergency response: Can be triggered at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural disaster to
          re-allocate project funds to support response and reconstruction.
     ■■

     KEY RESULTS EXPECTED:
     ■■   16,200 houses are planned for reconstruction in the districts of Ganjam and Khurda. Out of which 5,267 houses have been completed
     ■■   11,815 houses have been insured against multiple hazards including during construction
     ■■   2,300 families have had skills developing through training in masonry.
     ■■   By the end of the project, the Berhampur Municipal Corporation will have a raw water transmission main, about 8 km of improved roads, and about 15 km of
          improved drains.
     ■■   OSDMA will have an established Emergency Operations Center with trained staff and systems in place to plan for and respond to disasters.

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND KEY PARTNERS:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Energy efficiency is one of the most cost-effective options for India, to reduce energy costs, deliver increased economic productivity and competitiveness, increase
energy security, and mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that if India improves energy efficiency by 15% over the next decade, it could save $32
billion per annum and 15 GW by 2023. Under the Government of India’s National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency (NMEEE), the energy efficiency market is
estimated to be US$10 billion across demand side sectors (industries, MSMEs, public buildings, municipalities) but that remains largely untapped as most of the
end users are unable to implement projects on a large scale, because of the lack technical capacity or financial credibility to borrow for energy efficiency investments.
Domestic banks do not lend to smaller/mid-tier end users or to energy service companies (ESCOs) due to perceived risks. PRSF project was specifically designed to
address these and create a market where it did not exist, by guaranteeing loans to ESCO-implemented projects.
The project’s development objective is to assist India in achieving energy savings with mobilization of commercial finance and participation of ESCOs. As a pilot-
scale engagement co-financed by CTF and GEF, a $ 37m partial risk sharing facility and associated $6m TA are designed to address barriers that impede large scale
deployment of energy efficiency technologies that are not being financed by the domestic financial institutions due to perceived risks. It is aimed at mobilizing over
$100m of private sector investments and catalyzing the scaling up of energy savings performance contracting market through ESCOs.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   860 GWh of annual energy savings achieved by projects that receive PRSF risk coverage
■■   630,000 tons of CO2 emissions mitigated annually by projects that receive PRSF risk coverage
■■   A Total number of 460 ESCO-implemented energy efficiency investments whose loans receive credit guarantee from PRSF
■■   US$100 million total private capital mobilized

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is a flagship programme of the Government of India (GOI) for empowering rural India (about 70 percent of country’s
     population still live in villages) through the provision of all-weather road access to all habitations in the country above 500 population (250 in special areas). The
     programme is being implemented by a dedicated agency at the centre level i.e. National Rural Roads Development Agency (NRRDA) under the Ministry of Rural
     Development (MoRD). Since its inception in the year 2000, an investment of about Rs.1400 billion has been made resulting in providing connectivity to about
     116,310 habitations (out of 178,000 eligible habitations). About 472,685 km of rural roads have been constructed / upgraded under this programme. The program’s
     implementation capacity has been enhanced over time, with about 52,400 km being completed annually, compared to just 15,500 at the beginning of the program.
     However, even after 15 years of the programme, PMGSY has only achieved 79 percent of its initial targets and more than 20 per cent of the population still lack access
     to all-weather roads. The Bank’s $1.4 billion PMGSY Rural Roads Project covers a mixture of low-income states (Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), small
     special category upland states (Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Uttarakhand), and the middle-income state of Punjab.
     The project development objective is to support strengthening the systems and processes of the national PMGSY rural roads program to expand and maintain all-
     season rural access roads, resulting in enhanced road connectivity to economic opportunities and social services for beneficiary communities in the participating
     states. The project is structured around two components: (a) to cover civil works expenditures in the seven participating states associated with providing new all-
     season access to unconnected habitations, and upgrading important link routes in rural areas (b) providing technical assistance support to strengthen the capacity of
     relevant agencies to implement the program, including support for further enhancements to the On-line Management, Monitoring, and Accounting System to produce
     customized performance reporting at the national, state, and district levels. The reports will incorporate improved safeguards monitoring information and vulnerability-
     disaggregated data (including by gender), as well as data derived from third-party monitoring.

     KEY RESULTS:
     ■■    About 90 per cent of the target habitations under PMGSY have been connected in the participating states against a target of 72 per cent.
     ■■    The condition of PMGSY roads has improved. Road condition is measured through a Pavement Condition Index (PCI), which is a five-point scale where a number
           of two or lower is considered a satisfactory condition. Currently, about 64 per cent of rural roads are having a PCI of more than 2 against a target of 55 per cent.
     ■■    All 25,000 km roads under the project involving an expenditure of INR 89,000 million have been completed and opened to traffic.
     ■■    About 14 states have established road maintenance policies. MORD has also adopted a national training framework to build capacity of rural road agencies as
           well as the construction industry to introduce best practice examples in the rural roads.
     ■■    The project has been extended by one year at the request of MORD mainly to accomplish the institutional development initiatives on road maintenance, road
           safety, GIS, outcome monitoring, and capacity building.
     ■■    The Bank has undertaken a detailed assessment of PMGSY, supported development of environmentally optimized road designs, a national training framework
           for PMGSY, and an asset management strategy for rural roads using the Aus-Aid TF.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Punjab state had implemented a $154 million Rural Water Project during 2007-14 that demonstrated good service levels through community management while
achieving close to 100 percent coverage of water supply. However, the state faces challenges of poor access: less than 30 percent households have water connections
and 600,000 households do not have access to sanitation facilities. This is mainly impacting women, children and marginalized communities. The state government
intends to scale up and consolidate the gains of the first project by adopting a demand responsive and decentralized service delivery approach to progressively raise
the water and sanitation service standards and coverage, and also reform the service delivery institutions.
The present Rural Water Sector Improvement Project has a development objective to improve water and sanitation service levels, reduce open defecation, and
strengthen service delivery arrangements in targeted villages in Punjab. The project has six components:
■■   Augmentation and operational improvement of existing water supply schemes to deliver better service levels through community management in 970 villages;
■■   Sewerage schemes in 315 villages;

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Punjab, located in the northwest, is one of India’s most prosperous states. The agricultural revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and resulting high economic growth
     substantially improved Punjab’s poverty and social indicators. Punjab is rural and landlocked. Two-thirds of its 25 million people live in villages, and agriculture, directly
     or indirectly, accounts for 40 percent of the economy, substantially above the Indian average of 24 percent. Better roads, lower transport costs, and higher transport
     service standards have been identified in the government of Punjab’s 10th Five-Year Plan as core elements of an enabling investment climate and a prerequisite
     for economic diversification and accelerated economic growth. While maintenance funding for national highways by the Government of India and for village roads
     through crop tax is sufficient, funding for the state highways has been grossly inadequate. (Until recently, funding for maintenance for Plans Roads was only 25 percent
     of that required). While funding for maintenance appears assured in the short term, the consequences from the previous inadequate maintenance funding and lack of
     capacity expansion can be only partially remediated. The Bank is supporting the road sector in Punjab because of the need to address the increasingly serious capacity
     constraints and to assist the Government of Punjab in strengthening its road maintenance management of the state highways.

     The project development objective is to improve operating conditions of state roads for road users, in a sustainable way, thus helping to provide the business enabling
     environment necessary to support Punjab’s economic development strategy. The original project had two components:
     ■■   Road upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance: Finances civil works along plan roads comprising upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance of about 1,000
          km of roads; technical assistance; land acquisition; and the required pre-construction activities.
     ■■   Institutional strengthening: Funds measures for sector modernization and for improving sector efficiency, as well as for road safety.
     In 2012, as part of project restructuring, the loan closing date was extended by five years from the original closing date of June 5, 2012 to support Government of
     Punjab (GOP) in their endeavor to undertake a 10 year network based Output and Performance Based Road Contract (OPRC) to improve, rehabilitate and maintain
     about 200 km of state road network.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■   In the Phase I of the project about 640 kms of roads have been rehabilitated, resurfaced and maintained;
     ■■   91 km of the OPRC network have been improved, 40 km rehabilitated and 29 km resurfaced. The cumulative physical progress of improvement/rehabilitation
          and resurfacing works is about 78.76%. For the fourth year of implementation, 56% of the work plan has been achieved and is expected that all works for the
          fourth year will be completed in December 2016.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The desert state of Rajasthan faces acute water quantity and quality issues. Covering 10 percent of India’s land area and accounting for 5 percent of the population,
Rajasthan has less than 2 percent of the country’s water resources. Erratic rainfall and recurring droughts have exacerbated the situation. A large part of the state relies
on groundwater for agriculture, and for industrial and domestic consumption, which has negative impacts on the quality and quantity of groundwater. Sustainable and
efficient use of the state’s scarce water resources is a major challenge. Given the size of the agriculture sector and its water footprint, improved water and agriculture
productivity coupled with market linkages are key elements for sustainable and inclusive growth. While there are many challenges to making the semi-arid dessert
bloom, there are also significant opportunities: (i) a promising potential for diversification into higher-value, less water-consuming horticulture, floriculture, spice
and medicinal plant production; (ii) scope for livestock development focusing on improved breeding, animal health, nutrition, and access to markets; (iii) availability
of a range of tested on-farm water management technologies and agronomic practices; (iv) a policy framework that is increasingly conducive to private sector-led,
sustainable agriculture, including recently revised state policies on agriculture, livestock, and agribusiness development, as well as water resources management; and
(v) the possibility of scaling up experience in PPPs in agriculture.

The development objective of the project is to establish the feasibility of sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and farmer incomes through a distinct
agricultural development approach that integrates agriculture water management and agricultural technology, farmer organizations, and market innovations in
selected locations across the 10 agro-ecological zones of Rajasthan. The project has four components:
■■   Climate resilient agriculture: Supports climate-resilient approaches for sustainable use of the natural resource base, through agricultural and livestock production
     systems aiming to increase long-term productivity and farm incomes in an environment marked by increased climate and rainfall variability. Activities include: (i)
     harvest, capture, collection, delivery, and distribution of water for agriculture and livestock purposes in surface water-irrigated canal command areas, groundwater
     sources, and rain-fed areas; (ii) on-farm water use efficiency; (iii) soil moisture and fertility improvements; (iv) sustainable intensification and diversification of
     farm production; and (v) integrated crop and livestock farming systems.
■■   Markets and value chains: Will enable farmers to engage in profitable and sustainable market-oriented production, and promote partnerships and market link-
     ages with other value chain participants and agribusinesses.
■■   Farmer’s organizations and capacity building: Supports: (i) establishment of farmer groups and organizations; (ii) capacity building for participatory planning and
     plan implementation of collective actions; and (iii) strengthening institutions and human resources associated with the project implementation.
■■   Monitoring and evaluation, and learning: Aims to implement robust monitoring and evaluation systems, which will support potentially scaling up successful
     approaches across the state. Work will also focus on strengthening synergies, and convergence with ongoing schemes of the government of Rajasthan and the
     Government of India.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
By the end of the project in 2019, it is expected that:
■■   Water used in agriculture will be reduced by 15 percent (from 3,000 cum to 2,550 cum per gross irrigated area).
■■   Water use efficiency will increase by 65 percent over the baseline.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     Rajasthan is one of the largest states of India, accounting for 10% of total area and 5% of the population. The state has good potential for growth in agriculture and agro-
     based industries, mining and minerals processing, tourism, handicrafts and cottage industries, but this potential is unrealized due to inadequate road infrastructure
     and market linkages. Rajasthan has a road network of 193,017 km, including 7,260 km of National Highways (NH), 10,953 km of State Highways (SH), 9,900 km
     of Major District Roads (MDR), 25,033 km of Other District Roads (ODR) and 139,871 km of Village/Rural Roads. Due to years of under-investment and inadequate
     maintenance, many of the State Highways and MDRs are in poor condition in terms of quality, shape, pavement strength, drainage, and safety. They are disjointed due
     to missing links and dilapidated bridges. Only about 11 percent of SHs and MDRs are double lane. The road safety situation in Rajasthan is serious and deteriorating.
     It ranks fifth in the total number of fatalities in 2011, making up 6.5% of all fatalities in India. The Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) PMGSY provided all
     weather road connectivity to about 81% of eligible habitations having above 500 people and to habitations having 250 people in desert and tribal areas of the state.

     The project development objective is to improve rural connectivity, enhance road safety and strengthen road sector management capacity of the state of Rajasthan.
     The project’s components are :
     ■■   Support construction of about 2500 km rural roads to provide connectivity to about 1,300 revenue villages with population between 250 and 499 people in the
          areas of the state not covered by PMGSY and introduce good practices of cost effective low volume technologies.
     ■■   Support implementation of a Road Sector Modernization Plan (RSMP) in the areas of: (i)Improved policy framework; (ii) Modernization of Engineering Practices
          and Business Procedures; (iii) Sustainable Asset Management; (iv) Institutional and Human Resource Development; (v) Preparing a pipeline of feasible projects
          for implementation and; (vi) Enhancing Governance & Accountability in Public Works Department.
     ■■

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     ■■   An increased share of rural population with access to an all-season road.
     ■■   Increased percentage of Core Road Network in good/fair condition.
     ■■   A reduction in annual fatality count on model road safety corridors.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Rajasthan is India’s largest state in terms of area and 8th of 28 states in terms of both population and state GDP. More than three-quarters of its population lives in rural
areas. Despite a rapid decline in poverty from 50% in 1970 to 24% in 2005, to about 15% in 2011-12, the absolute number of the poor still stands at ten million as per
the 2011 census. The RRLP focuses on 17 districts in Southern and Eastern Rajasthan with relatively higher incidence of poverty. The Project Development Objective
is to enhance economic opportunities and empowerment of the rural poor, with a focus on women and marginalized groups, in the 17 targeted districts of Rajasthan.
The project has four components:
■■   The Institution Building and Social Empowerment component helps the poor mobilize themselves into Self Help Groups (SHGs) and develop their capacity to
     initiate and expand sustainable livelihoods activities.
■■   The Community Investment Support component supports asset creation of self-help groups and their federations; and identifies and supports innovative ap-
     proaches to improve livelihoods of the rural poor.
■■   The Skill Development and Employment Promotion component supports beneficiaries to connect to new employment opportunities through the creation of a
     structured mechanism for skill development and job creation.
■■   The Project Implementation Support component facilitates various implementation, coordination, learning and quality enhancement efforts.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   30,458 self-help groups (SHGs) mobilized, representing 93% of the project end goal of 33,000 SHGs.
■■   21,941 SHGs have received the first tranche of Community Investment Funds (CIF) and 15,367 SHGs have received both the first and second tranche of project
     financing respectively; and 9,836 SHGs linked to bank credit.
■■   SHGs have cumulatively saved $5 million and an additional $10.57 million has been mobilized through bank credit linkages.
■■   1,394 Village Organizations (VOs) and 52 Cluster Level Federations (CLFs), federated community organizations of SHGs at the village and block level respectively,
     have been formed

IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
The RRLP is implemented by an independent umbrella society – Rajasthan Ajeevika Vikas Parishad (RGAVP) - established by the Government of Rajasthan to implement
various anti-poverty initiatives.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     India’s Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation has prioritized four states (Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh) as a Phase I special focus program for rural
     water and sanitation in low-income states. The piped water and sanitation coverage in these four states is extremely low. Access to household piped water in Assam is
     6.8 percent; Bihar 3.7 percent; Jharkhand 2.6 percent; and Uttar Pradesh 20.5 percent. Access to household toilets is just 18 percent in Bihar; 8 percent in Jharkhand;
     and 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh. Although Assam has higher coverage, with 60 percent of households having access to toilets, about half of these are insanitary.

     The project development objective is to improve piped water supply and sanitation services for selected rural communities in the target states through decentralized
     delivery systems and to increase the capacity of the participating states to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible crisis or emergency. The project has four
     components:
     ■■   Capacity building and sector development will support the building of institutional capacity for implementing project activities, along with sector development
          studies to inform policy decisions.
     ■■   Infrastructure development will support investments for improving water supply and sanitation coverage, including construction of new infrastructure and reha-
          bilitation and augmentation of existing schemes.
     ■■   Project management support includes project management support to the various entities at the national, state, district, and village levels for implementing the
          project.
     ■■   Contingency emergency response

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The government of Kerala has significantly improved rural water supply coverage, from 58.6 percent in 2003 to 67.7 percent by 2010. Kerala has also achieved
impressive coverage of household sanitation: 95 percent of rural households have access to a toilet facility, and 87 percent of Gram Panchayats (GPs) have received
the Government of India’s “Clean Village Award” for 100 percent ODF status. Nevertheless, rural households disproportionally remain without adequate water supply,
and the access gap between rural and urban areas needs to be bridged. The gap is particularly acute in remote villages and areas with low quantity and poor quality
of water. Challenges include: increasing presence of fluoride, iron, and salinity; contamination of private drinking wells due to poor sanitation; emergence of water-
stressed areas where demand outstrips local supply; increasing numbers of “slipped back” habitations; continued dependence of large number of households on
private open wells that dry up in the summer; and low coverage of household connections from piped water systems.
The development objective of the Second Kerala Rural Water and Sanitation Project (also known as Jalanidhi II) is to increase the access of rural communities to
improved and sustainable water supply and sanitation services in Kerala, using a decentralized, demand-responsive approach. The project has three components:
■■   Institution building, which supports the capacity building of sector institutions and support organizations, assists the Government of Kerala in implementing a
     statewide sector-development program, and supports project management costs.
■■   Technical assistance, which provides technical assistance to implementing agencies to ensure that infrastructure investments under the third component are
     properly implemented and resulting services efficiently provided.
■■   Infrastructure development, which finances investments for: (i) new and rehabilitated intra-GP rural water supply schemes; (ii) pilot rehabilitation and modern-
     ization of multi-GP water supply schemes and transfer of internal distribution to GPs; and (iii) sanitation schemes, mainly covering community-centric solid and
     liquid waste management and household sanitation solutions in difficult terrain.

KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.
Water supply interventions under the project will benefit some 288,000 households, or 1.15 million people, and some 690,000 people will benefit from improved
sanitation services.
Achievements include
■■   367,300 direct project beneficiaries (of which 51 percent are women, 45 percent are below the poverty line, 9.5 percent are members of Scheduled Castes, and
     7.5 percent are members of Scheduled Tribes.) through improved water supply. This includes
■■   1228 water supply schemes have been completed and commissioned, of which 293 are rehabilitated schemes and the rest are small water supply schemes. One
     large multi-GP scheme covering twelve GPs in Trichur and Malapuram districts are in the advanced stage of completion. Additional large water supply schemes
     have been initiated by the Kerala Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (KRWSA) and Kerala Water Authority (KWA).
■■   An estimated 40.870 households have been covered with clean water supply and sanitation through 20 Batch I GPs. Water supply and sanitation activities are in
     implementation in 60 Batch II GPs, 12 multi GP and 23 Batch III; estimated to cover 125,908 households and 47,219 households..
■■   210,781 persons have benefited from access to improved sanitation facilities.
■■   Preparation of water security plans for all GPs have been completed.
■■   Some GPs are undertaking ground water recharge activities through convergence of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA)
     and project resources.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The outstanding success of the Government of India’s elementary education program, which increased enrollment rates to almost 100 percent, is putting pressure on
     secondary education (grades 9 and 10). Secondary education needs to expand rapidly in response, while at the same time improving the quality of education: two
     Indian states which participated in the OECD PISA assessment of 15-year-olds in mathematics, science, and reading, ranked at the very bottom of 70+ participating
     countries/regions. The Government of India asked the Bank to support expansion and quality improvement in secondary education through the Bank’s flagship
     program, given our long history of support to elementary education. The Secondary Education Program, like SSA, is also funded by DFID and the European Union (EU),
     though total Development Partner contributions are about 10 percent of costs over five years. However, the Bank’s financial contribution enables it to support and
     influence the shape of the whole multi-billion dollar program.
     The project development objective is to help India achieve increased and more equitable access to good quality secondary education through support of the
     Government’s ongoing program for secondary education as delineated in the Rashtriya Madhyamki Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) Framework. The Framework is designed
     to expand access, enhance equity, and improve the quality of secondary education; and in particular, support new innovations and expansion of promising pilot
     programs. Quality improvement activities include teacher professional development, recruitment of additional teachers, and capacity building of local institutions
     to support change. Access will be expanded through new and upgraded schools, especially in underserved areas, outreach to communities, more relevant learning
     materials, and better teachers. Innovations will be supported through new activities of the RMSA program, with clear guidelines for application and appraisal of
     proposals.
     The RMSA program will contribute to the improvement of access, equity, and quality in secondary schools across India, preparing students for higher education and
     eventually the job market.

     KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
     ■■     Enrolment increased by 10 million (from 28 million in 2009-10 to 38 million in 2014-15, against a target of 40 million in 2017);
     ■■     Gross enrolment ratio increased significantly from 58% in 2009-10 to 78% in 2014-15 (against a target of 90% in 2017);
     ■■     Gender parity was achieved in 2014-15 (met the 2017 target).
     ■■     National system for student learning assessment was established with first round of grade 10 National achievement Survey conducted in 2015-16

     IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
     Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy. New Delhi. State Governments are responsible for implementation with a
     Centre-State funding ratio of 60:40 (for North eastern and hilly states and Union Territories contribute it is 90:10).

     KEY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS:
     DFID (direct to program) and EU (through education sector budget support).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India’s continuing urbanization and high economic growth over the last decade have led to an inevitable rise in ownership and use of motorized vehicles across
the country’s cities and towns. Two-wheeler (e.g. mopeds, motorcycles) and car ownership in cities has grown by double digits. This growing motorization may be
exacerbated by rising incomesAs more cars and two-wheelers hit the streets, city centers become congested, road safety deteriorates, and the environment suffers
as GHG emissions increase. While the urban transport sector accounts for less than 10 percent of India’s total emissions, it is one of the fastest growing sectors in
terms of fossil fuel consumption. Interventions to develop attractive alternatives to personal modes of transport are urgently needed. With support from the Global
Environment Fund, the Bank, in partnership with United Nations Development Program (UNDP), has been supporting the Ministry of Urban Development since 2006
to develop and implement a Sustainable Urban Transport Program, which aims to strengthen national and local government capacity in urban transport planning and
management in a more integrated and comprehensive manner. The project supports the implementation of the India National Urban Transport Policy.

The project development objective and global environment objective is to promote environmentally sustainable urban transport in India, including through
demonstration projects in selected cities. The project has two components:
■■   Capacity development assistance for urban transport: Provides technical assistance to the Ministry of Urban Development to improve national, state and local
     capacity to implement the National Urban Transport Policy.
■■   City demonstration projects. These demonstration projects focus on: public transport, non-motorized transport, and a pilot Intelligent Transport System (ITS). City
     pilot projects include rapid bus corridors and bicycle lanes.


KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The Leaders in Urban Transport Planning training program has been successfully running in India with CEPT University; roughly 270 Indian officials have under-
     gone training at CEPT and various international locations.
■■   Guidance Documents covering seven topics (Unified Metropolitan Transit Authorities, Urban Transport Fund, Transit oriented Development, Non Motorised Trans-
     port Masterplan, Traffic Management & Information Control Centre, National Urban Transport Helpline, contracting Private Bus Operations) are nearly finalized.
■■   Among the City Demonstration projects are an ITS System for Mysore city bus which is beginning to realize significant operational improvements, in Pimpri
     Chinchwad, the two BRTS corridors are in operation (one of which is Bank supported) with strong ridership and positive feedback and an interim bus service is
     being operated by Naya Raipur Development Authority (NRDA) between Raipur and Naya Raipur in advance of launch of the BRT Lite.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     There is a growing concern that climate change could slow the progress in poverty reduction in India. India’s poverty rate is estimated to increase 3–4 percentage points
     by 2040 compared to the counterfactual of zero warming, resulting in around 50 million more people being poor. Agriculture provides employment to 72.3 percent
     of the rural workforce including 64 percent of poor households – 94.19 million of whom are women cultivators and women farm labor. The dominant agricultural
     livelihoods of the poor (crop cultivation, livestock, fisheries, etc.) are hugely dependent on natural resources. Climatic hazards that affect the availability of these natural
     resources, adversely affect the livelihoods of the poor by impacting production, affecting incomes and preventing building up of assets. Thus, conventional poverty
     alleviation approaches alone would not suffice for the rural poor to exit poverty and stay above the poverty line. Risk management strategies to contend with climate
     change impacts are required.
     The Sustainable Livelihoods and Adaptation to Climate Change (SLACC) Project is financed from the Special Climate Change Fund administered by the GEF. SCCF is
     among the limited windows available to India to access climate adaptation-related grants. The SLACC project builds on World Bank’s long standing partnership with
     the Government of India and will establish a large scale proof-of-concept on integrating community-based climate adaptation planning and implementation into GoI’s
     National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM). SLACC will strengthen collaboration and partnerships with other GoI initiatives, such as wage employment, agriculture. It
     will specifically focus on facilitating access of small farmers to enabling services through strategic agricultural investments in agro-advisories, weather-based insurance,
     participatory research and extension on drought and flood tolerant crop varieties, etc. At the national and state levels, SLACC will reach out to agriculture and other
     allied agencies to raise the policy dialogue on climate change issues.
     SLACC has three components:
     ■■   Planning, Service Provision and Implementation of Climate Change Adaptation to support risk assessment, planning, service provision and implementation of
          climate adaptation interventions.
     ■■   Scaling and Mainstreaming Community-Based Climate Adaptation to enable support and build capacity for the implementation of climate adaptation interven-
          tions, and to develop the strategy for scaling up.
     ■■   Project Management and Impact Evaluation to augment the management units within the NRLM and SRLM institutional structure to enable coordinated func-
          tioning and efficient implementation of SLACC.

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
     ■■   50% of the targeted households adopt livelihoods with enhanced resilience
     ■■   8,000 farmers demonstrate climate resilient agriculture practices
     ■■   50% of the targeted households demonstrate strengthened awareness and ownership of adaptation and climate risk reduction processes.
     ■■   800 Self Help Group members, community resource professionals and Village Organization representatives are trained in adaptation-related technologies
     ■■   About 300 staff of state and district offices and extension and rural service providers are trained in technical adaptation themes
     ■■   Climate change adaptation guidelines developed for NRLM implementation framework

More than 750 million people in India lack access to improved sanitation, with 80 percent of them located in rural India. Only 15 percent of the bottom quintile and 25
per cent of the second poorest quintile have access to improved sanitation. Open defecation and poor sanitation practices constitute one of the greatest development
challenges facing India. In 2014 the Government of India, led by Prime Minister Modi, launched the iconic Swachh Bharat Mission -Gramin (SBM-G), the largest
rural sanitation program, which aims at behavior change to end open defecation by 2019, targeted symbolically to coincide with the 150th anniversary of Mahatma
Gandhi’s birth. The SBM-G focuses on changing people’s behavior in order to trigger and sustain the usage of toilets, to achieve and sustain open defecation free
status in villages and overall cleanliness in villages with improved solid and liquid waste management. World Bank Support uses two lending instruments: Program
for Results and Investment Project Financing. The Operation leverages the other IDA/ IBRD financed rural water and sanitation projects and a large Bank-executed
Technical Assistance program. The operation provides results-based fiscal transfers to reward states for outcomes achieved and for scaling up the implementation of
the program across India. The program is setting up an independent third party verification mechanism as well as a citizens’ engagement systems of social audits and
grievance redress mechanisms. It includes capacity support to different tiers of government – states, districts, sub-districts and rural local bodies, including knowledge
sharing among implementing tiers.

The development objective of the SBM-G Support Operation is to reduce open defecation in rural areas and strengthen the national government’s capacity in program
management, advocacy, capacity development and behavior change communications.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
■■   The project is expected to increase the percentage of the rural population with access to safe and functional sanitation facilities from 30 percent to 60 percent, with
     special focus on women and poor and vulnerable segments of the rural population.
■■   It will also reduce open defecation in rural areas and sustain open defecation free status in villages where this has been achieved.
■■   It will increase the percentage of the rural population with solid and liquid waste management systems.
■■   It will seek to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation on program management, advocacy, behavior change communications,
     and improved monitoring and evaluation system to measure results.

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     In agreement with the Government of India, Government of Tamil Nadu, and the Government of the Union Territory of Puducherry, the Bank initiated the Tamil Nadu
     and Puducherry Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project (CDRRP) in June 2013 to follow up on earlier projects to revive livelihoods and promote recovery in areas
     affected by the 2004 Tsunami as well as supporting housing reconstruction, evacuation shelters, and early warning systems in communities regularly exposed to
     cyclones, storm surges, coastal flooding. The CDRRP focuses on new initiatives in risk reduction and mitigation.
     The CDRRP aims to increase the resilience of coastal communities in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry to a range of hydro-meteorological and geophysical hazards along
     with improving the capacity to respond promptly and effectively to a crisis. The project has five components.
     ■■   Vulnerability reduction of coastal communities through infrastructure such as permanent houses, evacuation shelters and routes, and resilient electrical network;
     ■■   Sustainable fisheries which aims at upgrading infrastructure, and addressing safety at sea;
     ■■   Capacity building in disaster risk management of government institutions, civil society, the school education system and coastal communities;
     ■■   Implementation support that includes incremental operating costs, that of operating the Project Management Unit (PMU) and respective Project Implementation
          Units (PIUs) in the line departments and
     ■■   Contingent emergency financing which will be drawn by the Government of Tamil Nadu and/ or Puducherry to cover emergency response and recovery costs.

     KEY EXPECTED AND ACHIEVED RESULTS.
     ■■   Reconstruction of over 16,000 vulnerable houses from earlier ETRP is now completed. Several fisheries infrastructure works including harbors, fish landing cen-
          ters and stability control measures for navigation channels are completed.
     ■■   Out of the 121 Multipurpose Evacuation Shelters (MPES), 70 are completed. 143 evacuation routes are completed.
     ■■   453 Early warning dissemination systems are currently being installed – 118 sites completed.
     ■■   Disaster Risk Management curriculum have been introduced in the school curriculum from class 7 to 10, will be soon introduced in class 11 and 12.
     ■■   Through Community Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM), 561 coastal habitations are participating in risk mapping and formation of Village Disaster Risk
          Management Teams – 477 village disaster management plans are formed and total of 2500 task forces have been trained (5 in each habitation).
     ■■   By 2018 the coastal communities of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will be covered by 453 early warning systems, access to 121 MPES, and 1834 (934 km in Tamil
          Nadu and 900 km in Puducherry) kilometers of electrical cables will be underground.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Tamil Nadu is India’s 11th largest state by area and the seventh most populous state. It is also one of the most industrialized states and had the country’s second
largest economy in 2012. However, over 20 percent of the population continues to live in poverty, a situation which is particularly pronounced in rural areas with
high inequality and a large disabled population. A large portion of the population depends on agricultural for their livelihoods, due to low skill levels and weak
access to credit and markets with which to engage the growing non-farm sector. The World Bank has financed empowerment and livelihood projects in India since
2000, mobilizing over 30 million rural poor to form their own institutions and enabling them to access livelihood opportunities and build social, financial, and
economic capital. There have also been a number of state-level livelihood projects. The development objective of this project is to empower the poor and enhance their
livelihoods through the development of community-level institutions; to enhance skills and capacities of the poor (especially women, youth, the differently abled, and
the vulnerable); and to finance demand-driven investments related to livelihoods for the target poor. The project has three components: Building institutional capacity,
and funding productive livelihood-related investments at the village level; Strengthening project teams at the state and district levels to extend support to the village
level and support monitoring, evaluation, and learning; and project management, including staffing and human resource development.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     The project has mobilized almost a million households into 94,170 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and 13,300 special groups. 98% of the identified vulnerable house-
       holds. have accessed project funds and support services.
■■     The SHGs created under the project are supporting income generation, skills development and employment creation; they now have internal savings to the tune
       of US$140 million equivalent and have leveraged an additional US$700 million as credit from the formal banking sector.
■■     4,465 Village Poverty Reduction Committees (VPRCs) and 4,464 Panchayat Level Federations (PLFs) that were promoted by the project are delivering financial
       and entitlement services to targeted households.
■■     Almost 5,800 Common Livelihood Groups (CLGs) were formed to support livelihood activities in terms of technical approach, input prices and product markets.
■■     Over 436,700 youth have completed skills training with almost 372,700 now in employment.
■■     The project has been successful in reducing high cost debt burden (29.3% fewer households take high cost loans) and has shifted the livelihoods portfolio more
       towards skilled employment (53.4% household loans for non-farm livelihoods and percentage of skilled workers in households is now 31.6% higher).

     BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
     The Highways Department (HD) of Tamil Nadu is responsible for managing about 62,000 km of the state’s road network, which comprises National Highways (4,974
     km, 8 percent), State Highways (11,594 km, 18 percent), Major District Roads (11,289 km, 19 percent) and Other District Roads & Sugarcane Roads (34,160 km, 55
     percent). Over the last decade, the Government of Tamil Nadu and its HD has made progress in enhancing the quality of roads, the road network and safety. But it still
     faces three notable challenges: inadequate investments, insufficient implementation capacity and poor road safety. These issues persist because of the rapid economic
     growth of the state and the consequent increase in the number of vehicles and the demand for road transport.

     During the last decade, while the length of the NH, SH and MDR in Tamil Nadu increased by about 50 percent, the number of registered vehicles in the state increased
     by 160 percent. According to the state’s Vision 2023 document, the road sector investment requirements over the next 10 years are estimated at INR 900 billion ($15
     billion). As against these estimates, the annual capital expenditure for the entire sector currently stands at INR 24 billion ($400 million).

     In recent years, a sizeable portion of the capital expenditure is being channeled toward the ‘lower-traffic’ rungs of the network. Such emphasis on capacity expansion
     of ‘lower’ rungs of the network contributed to improved road access but it also resulted in underinvestment in capacity expansion of the ‘upper’ rungs of the network
     with high-traffic. Also, most capital expenditures are small-size, traditional item-rate contracts. Using this highly fragmented approach leaves a negligible impact and
     involves tackling a needy corridor through small stretches over several years. Problems include
     ■■   Low implementation capacity: In recent years, the capacity of HD for managing upgradation activity has increased but only up to about 800 km/year whereas to
          be able to achieve the state’s Vision 2023 of upgrading about 20,000 km of roads over the next 10 years, HD would need to more than double its implementation
          capacity.
     ■■   Road safety: Tamil Nadu currently ranks in the top five states in terms of road accidents, fatalities and injuries, accounting for about 13.8 percent of total accidents
          and 12 percent of people killed in road accidents in India. The state’s capacity to respond to the road safety challenge requires substantial augmentation across
          and through more coordinated involvement of multiple stakeholder departments such as transport, police, highways, health and education, not only at the state
          level but also at lower operational levels such as districts and corridors.
     The project development objective is to increase road capacity, enhance the quality of maintenance, improve safety and support institutional development of Tamil
     Nadu’s Core Road Network..

     KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
     The expected results are:
     ■■   Upgrading and maintenance of about 575 km of highways through EPC and PPP contracts and long-term performance-based maintenance of another 600 km
          of highways;
     ■■   A reduced average travel time on project roads; (
     ■■   A reduced average vehicle operating cost on project roads;
     ■■   No increase in number of annual fatalities from road accidents on project roads.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
For India, leveraging urbanization is central to its efforts in alleviating poverty and promoting shared prosperity, as India’s rapid economic growth is accompanied by an
unprecedented spatial transformation. From amongst the larger states, Tamil Nadu is most urbanized and also has the second largest state economy in India and hence
urbanization is of particular importance to Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu is a pioneer in many aspects of urban development, there remains a huge unfinished reform
and investment agenda. The critical importance of urban development for the state is clearly spelt out in the Government of Tamil Nadu’s (GoTN) latest Twelfth Five-Year
Plan and its Vision 2023 that sets out the vision for the sector as to “promote and facilitate the development of inclusive and sustainable cities”. The Bank has had a long
engagement with the state government in the urban sector, including through the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) type urban projects that began with the setting up
of the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) in the late 1990s under TNUDP II, followed by the TNUDP III that closed in 2014. TNUDF has played an important role
in fostering urban development in the state as well as greater access to financial markets for TN Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), while maintaining an outstanding track record
of 100% loan repayments from ULBs over the last decade. With the success of TNUDF, GoTN has decided to address the next generation of urban development challenges
in the state through TNSUDP. The current TNSUDP is also consistent with the Bank Group’s India Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2013-2017, and contributes to
the development goals set out under Engagement Area 2 of the CPS on “Spatial Transformation” by seeking to leverage the rural-urban transformation as an opportunity to
reduce poverty and increase competitiveness and supporting India and the state of Tamil Nadu in achieving the following Engagement Area 2 outcomes: (i) strengthened
institutional capacity of urban governments; (ii) improved urban services; and (iii) improved environmental protection.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of TNSUDP is to improve urban services in participating ULBs in a financially sustainable manner and to pilot improved urban
management practices in selected cities. The project comprises three components:
■■   Results based grants for urban governance will provide results-based grants to selected eligible ULBs to implement new urban-management models that strengthen
     governance and financial sustainability.
■■   Investments in urban services will comprise three sub-components:
     Urban investments sub-component will provide investment support to participating ULBs for improvements in a range of urban services, including water, sewerage,
     municipal solid waste, urban transportation, septage management, and storm water drainage, as well as support project management and supervision. These will be
     based on demand from ULBs in the state, with an emphasis on “sustainability” and improvement of the urban environment.
     Credit enhancement sub-component will create a reserve fund to provide credit enhancement support for municipal bonds and other market-based loan instruments
     issued by ULBs, as well as the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund (WSPF) of TNUDF. It will seek to further enhance Tamil Nadu’s pioneering efforts in mobilizing
     resources for urban infrastructure from financial markets.
     Project development and TNUDF technical assistance sub-component would provide technical assistance to: (i) ULBs to prepare and implement sub-projects, including
     environmental and social mitigation actions, and PPP arrangements; (ii) ULBs to implement credit enhancement measures; (iii) CoC, for urban flood risk mitigation;
     and (iv) TNUDF, for institutional development.
■■   Urban sector technical assistance is aimed at strengthening the state’s capacity to carry out urban finance and municipal governance reforms in: (i) developing next
     generation municipal e-governance and GIS systems for ULBs; (ii) institutional development and capacity building, including training, sector studies, operations and
     maintenance, and strengthening public financial management at ULBs; and (iii) project management.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
■■   At least 2 million urban residents receive improved urban services as result of interventions under the project.
■■   Out of such beneficiaries of improved urban services, at least 40 percent are female.
■■   Additional financial resources mobilized by ULBs for urban infrastructure through non-budgetary sources to the extent of $80 million equivalent.
■■   Aggregate increase in Own Source Revenues (OSR) of “Model Cities” under urban governance component of over $12 million equivalent through implementation of
     OSR improvement plans.
■■   Over 90 participating ULBs with new municipal e-governance systems for improved citizen interface and transparency.

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      India is one of the world’s largest and most dynamic emerging markets with vast economic potential. However, GDP growth decreased from 10.5 percent in 2010
      to 7.6 percent in 2013 (year-to-end as of March 2013). Looking to reverse these recent trends, the objective of the 12th Five-Year Plan (FY2013–2017) is to return to
      GDP growth rates in excess of 8 percent. The manufacturing sector will have to play an important role in this endeavor as it has long been recognized as an essential
      driver of economic development for most developing countries (e.g. it has an important economic and employment multiplier effect). Recognizing this potential, the
      Government of India’s National Manufacturing Policy set the objective of “enhancing the share of manufacturing in GDP from its current level of 15 to 25 percent within
      a decade and creating 100 million additional jobs.”
      This program’s development objective is to enhance the productivity of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by improving their access to technology and
      business advisory services, as well as skilled workers through systems of financially sustainable Technology Centers (TCs). The project is composed of three components:
      ■■   Technical assistance to the existing and new TCs with respect to their technological and business needs under the guidance of Industry Specific Joint Working
           Groups comprising main industry leaders and representatives.
      ■■   Investments to upgrade the 18 existing TCs (currently called Tool Rooms and Technology Development Centers) and develop 15 new TCs spanning 25 states,
           including at least eight in low-income states.
      ■■   Technical assistance to the MSME Ministry for project implementation support as well as monitoring and evaluation.

      KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
      ■■   Increase in the number of paid services rendered by TCs to enterprises including placement services from a baseline of 23,000 to an end target of 60,000.
      ■■   Increase in the number of long-term trainees employed in industry within six months of graduating from the TCs from 8,000 to 26,000 by 2020.
      ■■   Increase in the TCs’ net profit before depreciation (not including land) from $3.5 million in 2012 to $12 million by 2020.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
TEQIP III is the third phase of an envisioned 15-year phased program initiated with the first phase of TEQIP from 2002 to 2009. The project builds on the significant
results achieved in the two phases of the project which supported over 250 engineering institutes and thousands of faculty members from institutes such as NIT
Rourkela, College of Engineering Pune, Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University Hyderabad, and BIT Mesra. It has made a considerable impact on the quality of
education by implementing institutional and policy reforms focusing on institutional autonomy and accountability.

TEQIP’s third phase will respond to the need to make distribution of skills among labor market entrants more equitable across different parts of the country by focusing
on states with under-performing engineering education systems. Nearly 50 percent of the population lives in India’s low income states, hill states, and states of the
north east with poverty rates close to 48 percent. In these states, 16.8 percent of those in higher education study engineering courses, against 28.4 percent in other
states and access to engineering courses is particularly poor for students from poorer households. Specific groups such as students from scheduled castes and tribes
and female students have lower transition rates from the first year to the second year, relative to other students, leading to higher dropout rates. TEQIP III’s project
development objective is ‘to enhance quality and equity in participating engineering education institutes and improve the efficiency of the engineering education
system in focus states . The Project will support two main types of activities:
■■   Improving Quality and Equity in Engineering Institutes in Focus States: This will include support to government engineering institutes in focus states as well as
     Affiliating Technical Universities in those states. A select number of high-performing institutes from TEQIP I and II in other states will also be funded, with the
     primary objective of building twinning relationships between these institutes and those in focus states
■■   System-level Initiatives to Strengthen Sector Governance and Performance: This component will support activities to strengthen institutes such as the All India
     Council for Technical Education and National Board of Accreditation. It will also finance rigorous studies and evaluations, including student assessment and
     stakeholder satisfaction surveys.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS.
■■   An increase in average score of students participating in tests designed to measure technical and critical thinking skills.
■■   An increase in percentage of programs that have applied for or received NBA accreditation from 50% to 70%.
■■   An increase in percentage of students from traditionally disadvantaged groups (disaggregated by SC/ST, gender) in total enrolment in participating institutes
     from 15% to 20% (SC-ST) and 26% to 30% (women).
■■   An increase in percentage of participating institutes from focus states from 42.5% to 65%.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Created in 2000, Jharkhand is a low-income Indian state with a 39.1% poverty headcount and gross state domestic product of (GSDP) of US$589 (2010-11). With a
population of 33 million, 76% is rural. The share of vulnerable groups is high with 12% belonging to a Scheduled Caste and 26% to a Scheduled Tribe. The population
is also very young; adolescents and youth (ages 10-24) constitute 31% of the total population. Adolescent girls and young women are a particularly vulnerable
group, as well as a source of vast under-realized potential for contributing to Jharkhand’s competiveness. In educational and economic opportunities, young women
and adolescent girls are clearly lagging. A 2015 World Bank household survey found that 62% of young women (ages 16-24) were not in training, education, or
employment, compared to 14% of young men in the same households. Only 16% of married girls ages 18-24 are employed (and only 1% are in regular wage
employment), and only 31% of young women ages 18-24 achieved at least class 10.

The project development objective is to improve completion of market-driven skills training and secondary education for adolescent girls and young women in select
districts of Jharkhand. The project has three components:
■■   Expanding social, educational, and economic opportunities: supporting adolescent girls and young women in Jharkhand to achieve greater social, educational
     and economic empowerment by financing two major interventions at the community and institutional levels. This will be achieved by financing formation and
     capacity building of community-level young women’s groups, life skills education, community-level business skills training, community mobilization and com-
     munications, vocational skills training and non-formal education for a subset of project beneficiaries, and cash transfers ($150 per beneficiary) to about 15% of
     the total beneficiaries.
■■   Intensive service delivery: piloting and evaluating more intensive community-level service delivery models focused on increasing young women’s access to
     educational interventions, training, and employment opportunities. This will be achieved by financing a local full-time designated safe space (“cluster center”),
     and interventions for enhanced outreach to hard-to-reach populations.
■■   State capacity building and implementation support: strengthening of institutional capacity and outreach of the department of women & child development
     and social security and the Jharkhand women development society to ensure effective and efficient delivery of services for adolescent girls and young women
     in the state.
■■

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS:
■■   200,000 project beneficiaries (ages 16–24) will complete market-driven skills training,
■■   50000 project beneficiaries (ages 14–20) will receive a secondary education certificate through bridge education or Non Formal Education (NFE),
■■   40% of the project beneficiaries will complete market-driven skills training or education (through mainstreaming or NFE) and are in paid employment or contin-
     ued education six months after completion.

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      Telangana is a middle-income state, and has experienced significant economic growth and poverty reduction in recent years. However, prosperity is unevenly
      distributed: the poverty ratio among the Scheduled Tribes, Scheduled Castes, and Muslims is quite high when compared to the rest of the population. There is an
      income deficit since the small and marginal farmers, especially SC and ST households, have not adequately benefitted from growth in agriculture. There is also the
      human development deficit, as most health and nutrition indicators are worse for SCs and STs. They need to be addressed jointly to ensure shared prosperity and a
      greater pace of poverty reduction. The project will work concurrently on economic development, human development, and social protection with a focus on ICT. The
      project development objective is to enable selected poor households to enhance agricultural incomes and secure increased access to human development services
      and social entitlements. The project has five components:
      ■■   Value chain development: The objective of this component is to increase the income of small and marginal farmers through productivity enhancement and
           improved market access. This component will also invigorate local markets.
      ■■   Human development: To enable the community to hold the service providers accountable for service delivery in the HD sector, and improve HD service delivery
           by strengthening the existing public systems. It will target health, nutrition, sanitation, and education.
      ■■   Digital local government: This component aims to improve the coverage and service delivery of social protection entitlements to the poorest households, comple-
           menting the state government’s efforts to strengthen local government.
      ■■   ICT, TA and partnerships: ICT use especially open data systems and data analytics will be critical for the project. The project will make strategic investments in
           ICT especially open data systems and data analytics, provide technical assistance to line departments, and catalyze partnerships with public, private, and social
           enterprise sectors.

      KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
      Expected results:
      ■■   Enhanced incomes for 250,000 producers in selected project mandals.
      ■■   Improved human development outcomes for 250,000 poor households though the adoption of appropriate health, nutrition and sanitation behaviors
      ■■   Enhanced access to social protection and entitlement programs for 500,000 poor households through systems that deliver improved information, enrollment
           and payments. The beneficiaries under the project would constitute more than 50 percent of the small and marginal farmers and the SC/STs living in the target
           150 mandals.
      Achievements to date:
      ■■   66,441 people have benefitted through formation of 5 Farmer Producer Companies and 1350 Small Ruminant Producer Groups
      ■■   253 Gram Panchayats have been declared Open Defecation Free through community-driven efforts in sanitation focused on behavior change.
      ■■   33 One Stop Shops have been set-up at Panchayat-level which offer bundled services including government to person (G2P), person to government (P2G), and
           basic banking services.

      IMPLEMENTING AGENCY:
      The project is being implemented by the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty, Department of Rural Development, Government of Telangana.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
The Government of India launched the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) to provide children 6 to 14 years old with universal access to education, bridge gender and social
category gaps in elementary education and improve the quality of learning in schools. The World Bank operation is now supporting the implementation of the third
phase of SSA. It focuses on four key development objectives: improving attendance rates; improving retention rates; improving transition rates from primary to upper
primary level; and enhancing and monitoring learning levels. The World Bank’s support seeks to ensure equitable participation from all sections of society; including
girls, Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, Scheduled Caste (SC) students and Children with Special Needs (CWSN).

The World Bank is supporting the entire program and is financing about 4 percent of it while focusing on three key thrust areas: improving quality for enhancing
learning outcomes; strengthening monitoring and evaluation for enhanced accountability; and enhancing access and retention for disadvantaged children. Support
for SSA has been structured through a programmatic Sector Wide Approach focused on monitoring and reporting sector-wide results; ensuring collaboration between
the Bank, GOI, and Development Partners; and improving education for underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. Key features of the approach are:
■■     Access to the entire government program and monitor program results jointly with the GoI to harmonize Bank and GOI fiduciary systems and safeguards require-
       ments, which has strengthened the SSA’s financial sustainability.
■■     A strong joint review and feedback mechanism with mandatory, transparent disclosure of program information.
■■     Introducing a strong focus on quality by developing grade-level learning indicators, focusing on early grade reading and math and on science and mathematics
       at upper primary level and making teacher training more relevant to classroom needs.
■■     Help to disadvantaged children for greater access to quality education;
■■     Establishment of local School Management Committees to empower local communities, alongside social accountability measures like community driven devel-
       opment of schools and school assessment.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■     119 million direct beneficiaries (students enrolled in government managed or government aided schools) out of which 51.5 percent are girls;
■■     Retention rate for students studying in primary grades has improved from 75.6 percent in 2012 to 83.7 percent in 2015. At the same time, school dropout rate
       has reduced from about 6.5 percent in 2011-12 to 4.3 percent in 2015-16;
■■     Transition rate between primary and upper primary levels improved from 87.1 percent in 2011-12 to 89.7 percent in 2015-16;
■■     Pupil Teacher Ratio (PTR) has improved from 30 students to a teacher in 2011-12 to 25 students to a teacher in 2015-16;
■■     1.5 million teachers provided with teacher training support;
■■     Teacher attendance rates have improved from 75 percent in 2011-12 to about 85 percent in 2015-16;
■■     Itemized Response Theory (IRT) based student learning outcome assessments are being carried out at periodic levels; with the country having recently concluded
       a grade 5 assessment; results of which can be compared with the results of a previous round of assessment.

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      Watershed management has evolved into a decentralized and participatory process with financial autonomy to the Panchayati Raj Institution (PRIs), ensuring greater
      efficiency. In watershed management the decisions regarding the use and modification of lands and water are made with the participation of all stakeholders in the
      Gram Panchayats (GPs).In the last decade, it has been accepted that ensuring livelihood opportunities and food security for the rural population is an essential element
      of any sustainable watershed management approach. Increasing the productivity of rainfed areas and protecting the livelihood of the poorest is the project’s mandate.
      The objective of the Project is to increase the efficiency of natural resource use and productivity of rainfed agriculture by participating communities in selected micro
      watersheds of the State of Uttarakhand. The project works in 82 select micro watersheds of the middle Himalayas benefitting around 55,000 households in 509 Gram
      Panchayats. It has four components:
      ■■   Social Mobilization and Participatory Watershed Planning
      ■■   Watershed Treatment and Rainfed Area Development
      ■■   Enhancing Livelihood Opportunities
      ■■   Knowledge Management and Project Coordination
      ■■

      KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
      ■■   462 Gram Panchayat Watershed Development Plans (GPWDPs) have been prepared and are in the implementation phase.
      ■■   616 ha. orchard development, 589 ha. of seedling demonstration of fruit and fodder species, 616 ha. of fuel wood and fodder plantation and 176 ha. of nappier
           grass plantation were carried out to enhance the vegetative biomass in the Project area.
      ■■   Demonstration of 69 village ponds, 202 irrigation tank resulting in increasing the additional water holding capacity of 12,395 cum.
      ■■   Demonstration of latest technology and high value crops resulted in increase in productivity by 25 percent to 40 percent of the crop.
      ■■   7,230 farmers have formed 671 Farmers Interest Groups (FIGs) for carrying out modern agricultural practices.
      ■■   293 Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (PME) teams of stakeholders have been constituted to monitor the Project interventions in the GPs as a tool for social
           audit and addressing grievances. The first round of the PME exercise is starting in Sept., 2016.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
In June 2013 the monsoon arrived almost two weeks earlier than expected in the state of Uttarakhand, located in India’s northern Himalayan region, and an extreme
amount of rain fell, causing flash floods in Mandakini, Alakananda, Bhagirathi and other areas. More than 900,000 people were affected. The disaster coincided with
the peak tourist season in one of India’s most important pilgrimage areas, significantly increasing the number of casualties. More than 4,000 people died, 4,200
villages were affected, about 3,320 houses and 995 public buildings were damaged. Close to 9,000km of roads were affected.
As well as annual damage due to heavy rains, Uttarakhand is also in an area prone to earthquakes, and suffered major quakes in 1991 and 1999. The Uttarakhand
Disaster Recovery Project supports the state government’s efforts to reduce risk and vulnerability, with assistance in reconstructing damaged infrastructure, restoring
connectivity, and improving technical support for managing future disasters. The project aims to restore housing, rural connectivity, build resilience in communities in
Uttarakhand and increase the technical capacity of state entities to respond promptly and effectively to crises. The project has the following components:
■■   Resilient infrastructure reconstruction focusing on the immediate reconstruction of damaged housing and restoration of public buildings essential for public
     services using resilient construction standards under an owner-driven reconstruction modality.
■■   Rural road connectivity focusing on providing access to markets as well as health and education services through the reconstruction of damaged roads and
     bridges with upgraded designs to withstand earthquake and flood forces, including improved drainage and slope stabilization.
■■   Technical assistance and capacity building for disaster risk management to enhance the capabilities of government entities in risk mitigation and response,
     including: risk modeling and assessment; establishing a decision support system; strengthening early warning systems and response capacity; and to finance
     relevant studies to better understand and manage natural disaster risks.
■■   Financing disaster response expenses for eligible expenses already incurred during the post-disaster response period.
■■   Implementation support for the incremental operating costs of the project, including as well the creation of small, temporary field implementation offices, train-
     ing, exposure visits, and knowledge exchange programs.
■■   Contingency emergency response, which can be triggered, at the request of the government, following an adverse natural event that causes a major natural
     disaster to re-allocate unallocated project funds to support response and reconstruction.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Out of 2,488 targeted houses, 2,225 have been completed including insurance for 10 years.
■■   23 Public building are planned to be constructed including primary schools, police station, fire stations, public health centers and technical institutions. Construc-
     tion has started for 21 public buildings.
■■   Out of 2,548 Km of roads and 23 bridges planned for rehabilitation; 546 Km of roads have been completed and construction commenced for 22 bridges
■■   4 Disaster Response Force battalions have been established within the State and search-and-rescue equipment provided
■■   3 technical studies have been initiated.
■■   Uttarakhand Disaster Management Authority has been formed and is being operationalized to lead disaster management preparedness and response measures

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      Uttar Pradesh is India’s most populous state with an estimated population of nearly 200 million, or 17 percent of the population of India. Seventy-seven percent of
      the population lives in rural areas, and about 33 percent live below the poverty line. Uttar Pradesh has been ranked in the bottom third of Indian states on the Human
      Poverty Index since 1981, and the state lags behind all other states of the country on most human development indicators.

      Given the size of the state population and the disproportionately higher mortality and morbidity rates, Uttar Pradesh will determine whether India as a whole achieves
      its health goals and its health-related MDGs. Public health spending has been steadily increasing and is no longer the main constraint. Despite increasing government,
      donor, and private investments in the health sector in Uttar Pradesh, the main challenge is centered on inadequate organizational performance. The Bank-financed
      project is expected to leverage its resources to help the Government of Uttar Pradesh improve the efficiency of the health system and enhance the effectiveness of
      public investment in the health sector.

      The development objective of the Uttar Pradesh Health Systems Strengthening Project is to improve the efficiency, quality, and accountability of health services delivery
      in the state by strengthening the state Health Department’s management and systems capacity. The project’s two components are:
      ■■   Strengthening the Department of Health’s management and accountability systems: Supports: (i) strengthening strategic planning functions; (ii) improving use
           of data for program management; (iii) strengthening the use of financial information for improved decision making, and strengthening of procurement and
           supply chain management systems; and (iv) introducing and strengthening social accountability mechanisms and introducing provider incentives in the public
           sector, and evaluating their impact.
      ■■   Improving the Department of Health’s capacity to perform its quality assurance role and more effectively engage the private sector: Supports: (i) strengthening
           the institutional capacity for service-quality improvement and regulatory capacity by establishing Quality Assurance, Environment Management, and PPP cells
           in the Directorate of Health; (ii) hospital accreditation under the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals; (iii) contracting with the private sector for delivery of
           diagnostic services and non-clinical support services; and (iv) strengthening human resources management and availability.

      KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
      ■■   The project is supporting improvements toward quality accreditation in 40 hospitals. Of these, 28 are now monitoring and producing annual data on service
           productivity, efficiency, quality; and 8 have been certified for entry level pre-accreditation.
      ■■   All districts are using an electronic system for paying salaries of health workers (against a target of 75 percent).
      ■■   75 percent of districts have completed and published data on national health programs indicators and facility-level performance.
      ■■   Social accountability interventions are being piloted in 12 districts. 50 percent of the Gram Panchayats participating in the pilot have completed a service delivery
           assessment has been and at least 1 corrective action to and at least 1 corrective action to issues raised by the Village Health, Nutrition and Sanitation Committee
           has been corrected by the government and verified by the community.
      ■■   50 district hospitals are using performance based contracts to improve the quality of service delivery, including by outsourcing cleaning and gardening as well as
           high end pathology services to private providers.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India. It is also one of the poorest, with an annual per capita income of $436 in 2011, compared to $1,410 nationally:
almost 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Agriculture is a crucial sector for the state. Eighty percent of the population is rural and highly
dependent on agricultural production for their livelihoods; agriculture employs about 66 percent of the labor force, primarily in rice and wheat cultivation. Yet the
state’s agriculture suffers from productivity gaps of more than 50 percent in key crops, such as rice and wheat.
The Bank-supported Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Reclamation Project-III builds on the lessons learned from two predecessor projects that reclaimed about 255,000
hectares of sodic lands from 1993 to 2007. The ongoing project aims to sustainably reclaim another 130,000 ha covering 25 districts of predominantly barren and low-
productivity sodic lands. This would improve household food security through increased productivity and cropping intensity. By focusing on degraded lands cultivated
by poor farmers, the project contributes to sustainable poverty alleviation. The Bank has been the Government of Uttar Pradesh’s key partner in sodic land reclamation
for the last 15 years and has helped develop and refine the intervention model, including institutional development at the state and user levels.
The project development objective is to increase agricultural productivity of degraded lands in selected areas of Uttar Pradesh by reversing water-induced land
degradation, enhancing soil fertility, and improving the provision of agriculture support services. The project’s main components: :
■■   On-farm development and land treatment: Aims to sustainably reverse water-induced land degradation—salinization, sodification, and water-logging—through
     carefully sequenced technical interventions.
■■   Improvement of drainage systems: Aims to improve the drainage networks in the project area to remove/leach effluents, excess rain, and irrigation water from
     reclaimed and adjoining areas.
■■   Agriculture support services: Aims to increase agricultural productivity by introducing improved technology, better agronomic practices, and more effective provi-
     sion of key support services.
■■   Institutional strengthening and capacity building for market access: Improves the profitability of farm production and enhances livelihoods of the poor by creat-
     ing better input-output market linkages and more efficient and effective delivery of key support services, and strengthening community-level capacities and
     provision of some productive infrastructure.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Over 92,000 ha of sodic land have been reclaimed, against an end of project target of 130,000.
■■   Over 4,000 ha of ravine land have also been reclaimed, against a target of 5,000.
■■   The productivity of the reclaimed sodic lands has increased to nearly 6.5 tons per ha and the cropping intensity to 200 percent. A majority of these lands had been
     previously barren. On both these fronts (productivity and cropping intensity), the mid-term achievements have exceeded the targets.
■■   The annual crop income per household, at nearly $700, has exceeded the end of project target.
■■   The project continues to have an inclusive, pro-poor character: 93 percent of beneficiaries are small and marginal farmers, and 80 percent of beneficiaries belong
     to backward castes, which constitute the most marginalized communities. The project has enabled nearly 40,000 landless and marginal farmers (37.5 percent of
     total beneficiaries) to obtain secure tenure and possession of land (some 17,000 ha). Of this, over 3,000 beneficiaries have been allotted new land

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      With a population of approximately 200 million, Uttar Pradesh lags behind most Indian states across a number of human development indicators. Currently, over 50
      million people live below the poverty line with a large majority living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for about 30 percent of the state GDP and 60 percent of the
      total employment. Rural people are especially dependent on agriculture as a source of labor and livelihoods. The project aims to help build the institutional capacity of
      water-related institutions—institutions needed to increase agricultural productivity in this low-income state where agriculture will continue to play an important role in
      alleviating poverty. Under the Phase 1 operation, irrigation and drainage systems covering about 3 percent of the irrigated area (343,000 hectares) were rehabilitated
      and modernized in the pilot Jaunpur Branch basin using modern surveys and designs. More than 800 WUAs were established and strengthened following the passing
      of the seminal Uttar Pradesh Participatory Irrigation Management Act (2009). Other achievements include a state-level water resource agency and introduction of
      a management information system for the state Irrigation Department. Phase 2 will rehabilitate and modernize critical irrigation and drainage infrastructure in
      identified areas, consolidate and deepen various institutional reforms established under Phase 1, and refocus on water-saving agricultural activities through farmer
      water schools and joint activities between the Irrigation and Agriculture departments.

      The Project development objective is to:
      ■■   Strengthen the institutional and policy framework for integrated water resources management for the entire state
      ■■   Increase agricultural productivity and water productivity by supporting farmers in targeted irrigation areas.

      KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
      ■■   Contracts have been awarded for the 10 packages of Parallel Lower Ganges Canal (PLGC), Haidergarh Branch as well as Rohini, Jamini and Sajnam Dam Canals.
      ■■   Appointment of a Chairman and Members of the Water Management and Regulatory Commission (WAMREC) are in the final stages.
      ■■   Consultancy activities are also under way with participating departments of groundwater and agriculture

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
India is currently the world’s third largest consumer of electricity, however, average per capita consumption of electricity is only one third of the global average – slightly
lower than the average for the African continent . India has the largest energy access deficit of any single country. Almost 300 million people remain without access
to electricity. Furthermore, India’s power sector also relies heavily on fossil fuels (primarily coal) - the country is currently the world’s fourth largest Green House Gas
(GHG) emitter, and coal consumption is poised to almost treble by 2030. To address these issues, the Government of India (GOI) plans to: (i) expand generation by
using renewable energy sources whenever feasible and strengthen the central transmission network to facilitate energy exchange across regions; (ii) improve energy
efficiency and performance of institutions in the power sector; and (iii) expand access for rural and peri-urban populations.
The Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydroelectric Power Project (VPHEP) is an important part of the Government’s clean energy plans. The Project is also a key part of the World
Bank‘s commitment to helping improve the performance and sustainability of the hydropower sector in India, which is critical to the greening of the power sector, and
sustaining the country’s economic growth.

The VPHEP is a proposed 444 Megawatt (MW) run-of-the-river hydro generation project on the Alaknanda River, which is a tributary of the Ganges River. VPHEP is an
environmental category ‘A’ project, implemented by a public sector company Teri Hydro Development Corporations (THDC)), majority-owned by the GOI, which was
set up in 1988 to develop baseload hydropower potential in Northern India, and which is now expanding its operations by developing primarily run-of-river projects.
Building on lessons learned in India and in other countries, the project will help create effective project execution for cascaded hydropower systems and foster a
coordinated approach to river basin planning and development. VPHEP will also help increase generating capacity to complement the government of India’s efforts to
improve the performance of the country’s distribution and transmission networks. In line with the Ministry of Power’s desire to develop public-sector hydro companies
into top-performing public companies in the power sector, the Project also supports THDC to strengthen its capacity and systems to become a leading hydropower
company.

The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) increase the supply of electricity to India’s national grid through the addition of renewable, low-carbon energy; and
(ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of THDC with respect to the preparation and implementation of economically, environmentally and socially sustainable
hydropower projects. The project has two components:
■■   Construction of the 444 MW VPHEP in Chamoli District, Uttarakhand, India, and
■■   Support to capacity building and institutional strengthening at THDC India Limited, the project developer.

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   Addition off the 444 MW of low-carbon energy generation.
■■   Improves institutional capacity in THDC India Limited, a public power company
■■   After an initial delay of almost 2 years in the award of the Civil Works contract, and a further 12 months due to significant flooding in 2013, major EPC (Engineer-
     ing, Procurement & Construction) contracts were finalized in 2014

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
      India is a fast growing economy with a rising demand for skilled workers. A skilled workforce enhances the efficiency and flexibility of the labor market, reduces skills
      bottlenecks, and enhances mobility and productivity. One of the key suppliers of such workers is the vocational education and training (VET) system. A major component of
      the VET system is the Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS), run under the auspices of the Ministry of Labor and Employment and the National Council for Vocational Training
      (NCVT) at the national level, and the state departments dealing with vocational training and the State Council for Vocational Training at the state level. However, graduates
      from the CTS system face low labor market outcomes; the 2006 Baseline Tracer Study conducted by the World Bank shows that less than 30 percent of graduates from
      industrial training institutes find employment upon graduation. The Indian government sought World Bank assistance to introduce key reforms at the system and institution
      levels.
      The project development objective is to improve the employment outcomes of graduates from the vocational training system, by making the design and delivery of training
      more responsive top demands. It has three components:
      ■■ Improving quality of vocational training, which focuses on: (i) improving quality and relevance of training provided in Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) selected
           competitively from eligible states/union territories; (ii) upgrading training of ITI instructors; and (iii) providing incentive funds to states to reward good performance in
           project implementation.
      ■■ Promoting systemic reforms and innovations focuses on activities that enhance the overall reach and effectiveness of the vocational training system in the medium-
           term. Implementation of activities under this component is the responsibility of the Directorate General of Training, discharged in collaboration with states, industry
           associations, and private training providers, as necessary.
      ■■ Project management, monitoring and evaluation support.
      KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED AND EXPECTED:
      ■■    80 percent of the graduates from project ITIs already exit from the CTS system with a NCVT certificate, compared to the baseline of 61 percent and an end-of-project
            target of 73 percent.
      ■■    60 percent of project ITI graduates find employment within one year of finishing training, compared to the baseline 32 percent and an end-of-project target of 50
            percent. 38 percent of female graduates find employment within a year of finishing training compared to the baseline of 18.7 percent.
      ■■    Real monthly earnings of employed graduates from project ITI, measured one year after completing training, rose from a baseline of Rs. 2,421 to Rs3,553, as compared
            with the end-of-project target of Rs 3,026.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:
Water resources development is a priority for the Government of India. Development of irrigation infrastructure is necessary to reduce climatic risks, and irrigated
agricultural development is central to the government’s strategy for ensuring food security. The average agriculture productivity levels are still relatively low in West
Bengal. There is big potential for enhancing agriculture productivity, given sufficient irrigation. Despite having abundant surface and groundwater resources, 40
percent of the state’s cultivated area is rain-fed, and the cropping intensity has stagnated over the last decade. The majority of the rain-fed area belongs to small and
marginal farmers, and the state provides them with minor irrigation schemes, including lift irrigation, deep and shallow tube wells, pump-dug wells, tanks, and small
water harvesting structures. Once implemented, these schemes are operated and maintained by the community. Performance of these minor irrigation schemes has
been mixed, mainly due to the absence of strong ownership among users. The Bank-supported West Bengal Accelerated Development of Minor Irrigation Project
aims to contribute to improved reliability of water resources for irrigation and increased agricultural productivity by empowering communities. The total area to be
developed is 139,000 hectares, benefiting an estimated 166,000 farm families.
The project development objective is to enhance agricultural production of small and marginal farmers by developing minor irrigation schemes, strengthening
community-based irrigation management, and supporting agricultural development, including provision of agricultural services, encouraging crop diversification and
use of new technologies, and creating income-generating opportunities. The project’s main components are:
■■   Strengthening community-based institutions by establishing water users’ associations (WUA) and other farmers’ organizations to assume responsibilities for
     management, operation, and maintenance of minor irrigation schemes and improved irrigated agricultural practices.
■■   Irrigation system development by supporting construction of 2,400 new minor surface water irrigation schemes and 2,260 new minor ground water irrigation
     schemes.
■■   Agriculture support services by providing agricultural support services in the project area to enhance productivity and diversification in agriculture

KEY EXPECTED RESULTS AND ACHIEVEMENTS:
■■   The project’s main contribution is in the area of modernized planning and monitoring, improved water resources development and management practices, and
     creation of sustainable institutions to efficiently operate and maintain irrigation structures.
■■   The project, in its fourth year of implementation, is in the process of providing 800 irrigation schemes with 50% already handed over to users. These schemes have
     a potential to serve 10,000 ha and benefit more than 33,000 users.
■■   The crop production and gross income of farmers in rainfed zones have improved three fold and equipped them to be ready for drought with improved water
     availability. The project is expected to result in a more than 40 percent increase in production of main agricultural crops (rice, oilseeds, and vegetables), 1800
     new operational WUAs with 15 percent female beneficiaries, and more than 60 percent of marginal and poor farmers strengthened to generate resources for
     management, operation, and maintenance of the schemes.
