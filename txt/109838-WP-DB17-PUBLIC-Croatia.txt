This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      BuildCo must obtain preliminary approvals from various
      authorities. Such approvals are issued based on the preliminary
      project design drawings and other documents. They must be
      obtained prior to applying for the building permit; however
      these applications can be filed simultaneously.

      While the new Building Act of 2014 stipulates that silence is

      would need to follow up with agencies if there has been no
      response. While agencies have improved their response time,
      usually to less than 15 days, most of the time further
      adjustments and corrections are required, leading to a longer
      time for obtaining approvals.

      According to the new building code, The Building Act, which was
      passed December 6, 2013, the warehouse would no longer
      require a location permit. However, the excerpt from the Land
      Registry would still be required for the building permit
      application as evidence of the legal interest to build.

      Land Registry Department of the Municipal Court in Zagreb has

      immediately upon request or in a shorter term. Also, as the
      backlog of cases has reduced due to increased number of staff
      and other reform efforts, general improvements in the efficiency
      of the Land Registry Department in Zagreb can be noted. The

      If the investor in the construction is not the owner of the land,
      according to The Building Act of 2013, there are other newly
      acceptable ways to prove legal interest, including contracts and
      written approval from the owner.

      Obtain the list of land owners adjacent to the future
      construction site

      The geodetic study needs to contain a list of the people/legal
      entities that own the plots of land where the building is going to
      be built (i.e. a list of neighbors). This is required so that the

      Obtain decision from the Municipal Authority regarding
      utilities

      BuildCo must obtain a decision from the Municipal Authority on
      utility fees, based on the construction permit. The amount of the
      fee depends on the building size (in cubic meters) and on the
      location. Zagreb is divided into four zones for the purposes of
      communal fee calculations. The communal fee is set from HRK
      56 to HRK 118 per cubic meter of a building, depending on the
      zone. The Doing Business case study warehouse would be
      located in Zagreb zone III, with the communal fee set at HRK 75      22 days     HRK 292,613

      per cubic meter. The fee can be paid in full or in installments.

      According to Regulation on Procedure of Determining Volume of
      Buildings for Communal Fee Calculation currently in force, the
      volume of the buliding is used, and as for the warehouse used in
      the Doing Buisness case study, the volume of the warehouse is
      3901.5 cubic meters. Therefore the cost is 3901.5 * HRK 75.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

       registry extract enjoys public faith.



       Due diligence requires that the buyer knows the status of the land
       registry. Not knowing it can also result in conflicts on the property.

       The extract must be stamped by the Land Register Court in order to be
       verified. This usually does not take more than one day.

       Croatia has been in the process of computerizing the Registry. This
       process is still in its early stages. As the process of computerizing the     1 day

       registry is progressing, the number of properties for which data are
       available online and electronic Land Registry Extracts can be obtained is
       notably increasing.



       Parties can obtain an electronic Land Registry Extract for a property that
       has been entered in the database. However, electronic extracts are not
       considered official extracts when it comes to using them for collateral
       purposes. Only Extracts obtained in paper directly in the Land Registry,
       have the legal power; the same applies for the cadastre extracts.



       In accordance with the Regulation on Technical and Other Conditions of
       Electronic Operations in the Land Registry (Official Gazette No. 119/15)
       from November 2,2015 it is possible to obtain an official land registry
       extract from a notary public or a lawyer. A notary public and a lawyer are

      It is also possible to obtain a official land registry extract personally by
      using a personal box in the so called "E-citizen system". "E-citizen sytem"
      is a government financied project initiated with a purpose of
      modernizing, simplifying and expediting communication between the
      citizens and public administration by providing public services through
      an on-line platform. The platform allows a person to use different public
      services including obtaining a valid land registry extract. The number of
      public services provided by "E-citizen system" increases every year. When
      obtaining a land registry extract from a public notary or a lawyer an
      additional fee in the amount of HRK 20 per extract is paid.

      Notary notarizes the sale contract

      The sale contract contains a clausula intabulandi (i.e. the declaration by
      the seller that the purchaser may be entered in the land register) and is
      prepared by parties or by the lawyer. Pursuant to the Croatian law on
      Ownership and Other Property Rights and Land Registry Act (OG 55/13)
      it is defined that for the transfer of the property there is only a signature
      by the person whose rights have been restricted, encumbered,
      terminated or conveyed to another person (Article 52). In accordance to
      this law, the public notary verifies signature of the seller (the party whose
      property right will be terminated by the contract).

      The notary is authorized to obtain official extracts from the Company
      registrar, maintained by the Commercial Courts. If the lawyer prepares                       HRK 47.5 per

      values, there is a fixed fee on a scale. In addition to that, according to
      the Lawyers' Fee Schedule and Cost Compensation, for drafting the sales
      contract, the lawyer is entitled to the remuneration calculated according
      to the value of the propriety increased by 25 %. Further on, the lawyer’s
      fee is increased by VAT (25%) and the expenses incurred while rendering
      these services. The documentation shall include: Land register extract

      Register the title transfer at the Land Registry Court

      The request for the property registration must be submitted to the
      Registry by the parties on the appropriate registration form approved by
      the Ministry of Justice. However, the request shall not be rejected just
      because it was not submitted on the prescribed registration form. The
      participation of an attorney is not mandatory, but if one is involved, his
      fees will be about 0.5% of the property value. The Registry conducts the
      registration Procedure and renders the decision issuing the property
      title. The process of recording the sale agreement with the competent
      land register court takes around 60-80 days, when the proceedings are
      conducted by an experienced lawyer. Depending on the various courts,
      this process may take even longer. It should be highlighted that only the
      final decision, the one allowing the registration, produces the legal
      effect. However, regardless of the time when the final decision is
      rendered, the date of applying for registration will be the date marked in
      the Registry as the moment of transferring the ownership title. From that
      moment the party is protected towards all applications submitted
      afterwards. This rule is called the rule of priority: the buyer has the legal
      right to dispose of the property (to sell, lease, bequeath, transfer by gift,
      and mortgage the property). From that moment until the final
      registration the buyer has "quasi ownership". Therefore, even before the
      registration is completed, the first buyer - quasi owner can sell the
      property to another, second buyer. However there is a risk if the final         1-2 months
      registration of the first buyer - quasi owner is not allowed. In that case he (simultaneous    To be paid in

      transactions with the person who is not the legal owner of the real-estate
      in question (or take the risk). From 2004 the Court no longer accepts
      incomplete applications. If the registration form contains certain
      deficiencies, the court will not invite the applicant to correct the request
      but will immediately dismiss the application. The applicant may submit a
      new request, which will then have a lower rank. This has resulted in some
      reduction of backlog at the Courts and has also led to higher demand for
      professional assistance with the application process. Furthermore,
      changes in 2005 entrust the Land Registry clerks with the authority to
      decide on applications, with judges deciding on appeals. With
      registration moving from a judicial process to a more administrative
      process, this is a welcome change that indicates potential for decreasing
      the amount of time for registration. Recent internal reorganization of
      the Land Books also indicates future potential for increased efficiency.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
