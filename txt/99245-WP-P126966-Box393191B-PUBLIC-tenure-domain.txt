Challenges

While the pilot project was
perceived highly successful by
most stakeholders, it encountered
the following challenges:
•	   Coordination     issues    -
     transition in management
     within ACTogether as key
     project partner during data
     collection   caused     some
     coordination challenges that
     led to delayed completion of
     the process with the agreed
     time.
•	   Difficulty in synchronizing
     timing and interventions from
     various related projects.
•	   Apprehension about using
     a new tool such as STDM by
     some technical staff.                     Daniel Woniala, and other slum dwellers from Mbale, Uganda demonstrate

Conclusion
The Social Tenure Domain Model offers practical
solutions and opportunities for land professionals,
researchers, grassroots organisations and
government authorities. These opportunities
include the empowerment of the grassroots
communities to develop and manage their own
information systems (and their own data), with
all the benefits of the advanced technologies
can offer, with less investment in resources and
with less reliance on highly paid experts. Land
professionals can also make their services available
to all and offer people-centred and affordable
solutions. They can also contribute to the further
enhancement of the STDM framework. With
STDM, it is possible to bridge the information
divide, to serve all members of society and to
undertake development interventions such as
tenure security for all at scale.                       If done at scale, future generations will benefit from STDM use

By June 2014, STDM source codes will be disseminated to the general public to openly provide more
information about STDM and its use and application, to allow more interaction with users and potentially
to attract more developers for its enhancement and further development. STDM will evolve and improve
over time with more and more partners. It will explore more opportunities by being implemented in
other contexts (e.g. customary areas) and other countries. The lessons and experience of STDM work in
the months ahead will inform its strategy for implementation in the coming years.
