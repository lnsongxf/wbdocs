Methodology,
Approach and
Outputs


T
        he goal of this research has been to create a robust body of knowledge to address cities’ questions on benchmarking their
        performance, on analyzing what has worked and what has not, and on understanding how to organize for delivery in
        different contexts. The approach has used several methodologies to tackle these questions on the basis of best practice,
data availability, replicability, and simplicity. In many cases, the research team leveraged new and existing data sources to shed
new light on unanswered questions; in other cases, the team conducted primary research because available data were inadequate.
The research involved looking at global and regional trends, comparing different typologies of cities—by income, sector, region,
and industrial mix. The team buttressed these findings with econometric “deep dives” and case studies in selected countries and
cities. Where possible, the study cites existing resources (research, analysis, toolkits, and experts) from the extensive literature
on each topic.

               Gaziantep is Turkey’s sixth-largest city. As recently as the 1970s,
               it had a population of about 120,000 people. The city’s population
               today stands at 1.54 million, not counting approximately 300,000

               years, from $620 million in 2002 to $6.2 billion in 2013. It ranked

               recorded an average of 6.3 percent in annual gross domestic product

name outside of India. yet this
booming city of more than two

          What do competitive
          cities look like?
chapter
          Cities vary enormously when it comes to their economic perfor-
          mance. While 72 percent of cities grow faster than their countries,
          these benefits do not happen uniformly across all cities. The top 10
          percent of cities increase GDP almost three times more than the
          remaining 90 percent. They create jobs four to five times faster.
          Their residents enjoy higher incomes and productivity, and they are
          magnets for external investment.

          Competitive cities include more than just household names, capi-
          tal cities, or global centers of commerce. They are often secondary
          cities, and they are experiencing rapid industrialization. According
          to this study’s data, competitive cities include Saltillo, Mexico; Me-
          knes, Morocco; Coimbatore, India; Gaziantep, Turkey; Bucaraman-
          ga, Colombia; and Onitsha, Nigeria. The success of these competi-
          tive cities was not a foregone conclusion: many of them exhibited
          success amid adversity—for example, many of them are landlocked
          and in a lagging region of the country.
Chapter 1
There is no single recipe for becoming a competitive city,
but some common patterns can be identified and some
techniques recommended to cities that are designing and
implementing an economic development strategy.

          What Have Competitive
          Cities Done to Achieve
          Their Success?
          Evidence and Analysis
          This chapter presents evidence and analysis on what
chapter
          cities have done to become competitive. Three areas of
          evidence are covered:

            What were the interventions used?
            Who were the stakeholders involved?
            How were the sequencing and processes employed?

          Mayors and city leaders worldwide are striving to under-
          stand what interventions can best achieve job creation
          and economic growth. Which interventions have the po-
          tential to generate the biggest return for a city’s growth?
          Who should be designing and implementing the inter-
          ventions? How should investments and policy reforms
          be prioritized and sequenced, using the starting point of
          each city as the basis for action?

          This chapter proceeds from the premise that private
          firms are the main job creators (IFC 2013), and thus
          firm-level performance is at the heart of a competitive
          city. If job creation and growth are to be sustained over
          time, employment opportunities and increases in produc-
          tivity and growth must come from the private sector, be-
          cause relying on government funds alone is not feasible.
          Understanding what influences firms’ performance, and
          understanding what attracts them to specific locations, is
          therefore at the core of this investigation.
Chapter 2
Job creation and economic growth in cities are clearly linked to
the cities’ success in attracting and expanding private sector firms.
City leaders need to understand what factors help attract, retain,
and expand firms that create jobs and spur economic growth.

Note: This figure illustrates a framework for thinking about competitive cities. Firm-level performance is placed at the center of the framework, because jobs,
incomes, and productivity are at root generated by private sector firms. Firm-level performance is a function of factor markets, entrepreneurial ability, output
markets, all of which are facilitated by agglomeration effects. The four arrows represent enabling factors (or levers) in the agglomeration process. Cities can
assert these levers of economic development using the city wedge.

*The term “City wedge” refers to the policy space available to and the leverage that various city actors can use to modify key conditions of the business environ-
ment in the city, that are largely shaped by external forces including market trends and national policies.

          and leaders—mayors, city managers, directors of eco-

          leaders and associations. It is designed to support efforts
          to increase competitiveness as a dynamic attribute. It
          does not contain recipes for guaranteed success. Instead
          it provides tools and processes, alternative approaches,
          and organizational systems that can help city leaders
          to identify and implement a strategy and then to evolve
          and adapt it so that it can support decisions in each city’s
          discovery process.

There is no single recipe for becoming a competitive city, but
some common patterns can be identified and some specific
techniques can be utilized by city authorities designing and
implementing economic development strategies.

efficiently (management). Currently, many cities appear to fo-
cus mainly on management, delivering a generic set of basic
services and infrastructure. By contrast, as shown in chapter
2, the most successful cities in the world in the last few de-
cades have delivered a core set of services and infrastructure
(management), and they have also intervened strategically in
support of growth opportunities (strategy).

The approach offered in this section is based on the
interpretation of a city economy as an interaction
among enabling conditions and needs of businesses
that vary across industries, sizes, and ownership
types. This approach follows directly from the case-study
findings that competitive cities engaged in both economy-
wide interventions and in sector-specific interventions. To
structure the interventions, the research team consolidated a
number of analytic techniques into three dimensions:

Figure 3.1: Three levels of growth pathways analysisa
Competitive Cities Snapshot
The snapshot is an overview of the city economy that focuses on changes in key economic indicators, on benchmarks of the city’s economic performance, and
on enabling conditions with relevant comparator cities, and provides analysis of the city’s economic structure.
Why do it: The snapshot answers the question from city leaders, “How is my city doing?”
What it delivers: Beyond an overview of the city’s economic performance, this exercise helps formulate two types of hypotheses: (a) factors
that are likely constraining city competitiveness and (b) sections of the city’s businesses (defined by sector, size, or type of ownership) that
offer growth potential or are underperforming.
How it is done: It can be done in two parts: Part 1 is an automated economic overview and benchmarking exercise. Globally available data
(global datasets, city indexes, Doing Business indicators, and data on patent registration) is used. Indicators include gross domestic product
(GDP); employment and income growth; industrial structure and location quotient for broad sectors; and index values for infrastructure, insti-
tutions, skills, and access to finance. Part 2 is a customized approach. The analysis is expanded with other data sources such as the World Bank
Enterprise Survey, Subnational Doing Business survey, and local data sources. Detailed analysis of the business structure can be conducted
using location quotient, shift-share analysis, and business demographics techniques (which global data usually do not permit). Qualitative
techniques (expert surveys and triangulation) should be used to complement the analysis, verify results, and identify gaps in local perceptions.

sometimes those that identify and target needs of specific business with growth potential given the
comparative advantages of a certain city.
What it delivers: This approach identifies detailed issues that need to be addressed to support specific types of businesses in the city.
How it is done: In-depth prioritization uses market intelligence and industrial analysis techniques (such as “five forces” and diamond analy-
sis) to understand the growth potential of given groups of businesses. These exercises rely on qualitative data collection, interviews, and focus
groups in addition to any related quantitative data.
Driving conditions benchmarking uses literature review, expert consultations, and sector analysis (such as value chain analyses) to identify
constraints and opportunities. This analysis compares a range of data sources collated in the World Bank database to evaluate these conditions
against comparator cities and to identify where the city is lagging behind the most. It is based on economic boundaries rather than on admin-
istrative boundaries, meaning that the analysis will often include the broader metropolitan area and beyond as needed.
