This report was prepared by a World Bank team based on a study undertaken by the
consortium of Systema Transport Planning & Engineering Consultants Ltd and WYG with
financing from the Western Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF). The Directorate
General for Mobility and Transport (DG Move) of the European Commission (EC)
provided overall direction.

The World Bank (WB) core team was led by Baher El-Hifnawi and consisted of Liljana
Sekerinska, Evgenia Epaneshnikova and Nargis Ryskulova. The extended team included
Artan Guxho, Desa Stanić, Dragana Varezić, Elda Hafizi, Emre Eser, Ivana Bojić, Luan
Aliu, Jean-Francois Marteau, Alexandar Rowland and Senad Sačić. The Systema/Wyg
team was led by Dimitrios Tsamboulas and Athanasios Ballis and included Maja Popovic,
Michael Thomas, Lauri Ojala, George Emmanoulopoulos, Keith Cook, Yanni
Papapanagiotou and Natalia Tselenti. The study benefitted from comments from the Peer
Reviewers: Ana Simecki (DG NEAR, EC), Benedictus Eijbergen, Doerte Doemeland,
Olivier Le Ber and Shomik Mehndiratta; and Raymond Bourdeaux (World Bank). World
Bank Management: Juan Gaviria, Ellen Goldstein and Andras Horvai provided guidance
and comments on the successive report versions.

The team would like to express its appreciation to the SEETO Steering Committee and its
Secretariat for many discussions and comments provided during the course of the study.
The team would particularly like to thank the Secretariat for the coordination role it played

Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

Executive Summary
1.     In an effort to further develop the South East Europe Transport Observatory
(SEETO) Comprehensive Network, integrate it in the European Union’s (EU) Trans-
European Transport Network (TEN-T) and strengthen underlying transport planning
systems, an Update of the Regional Balkans Infrastructure Study (REBIS) was prepared. 1
The motivation for the Update was the fact that, since the completion of REBIS in 2003,
there had been no review or update of the study’s projections and recommendations that
would in turn enable an informed assessment and updating of the regional priorities for
investment in the SEETO Comprehensive Network.
2.      The main objective of the REBIS Update was to develop a Priority Action Plan for
enhancing the efficiency of the SEETO Comprehensive Network. The Action Plan
identifies priority physical investments as well as non-physical improvements including
regulatory, institutional and managerial changes required to reduce impediments to the
efficient performance of the Network. The Action Plan should be followed by a series of
prefeasibility and feasibility studies (beyond the scope of the Update) for the identified
interventions. The studies would be used to identify economically viable interventions for
inclusion in the SEETO Multi Annual Plan (MAP) along with other eligible priority
projects.
3.     The World Bank carried out this Update with a grant awarded by the Western
Balkans Investment Framework (WBIF). The Beneficiary of this Update is the SEETO
Steering Committee with representatives from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH),
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Kosovo*. The
Update also benefits Croatia, which was a member of SEETO at the inception of the study
and prior to joining the EU on July 1, 2013.
4.      The scope of work included (i) an assessment of the 2010/2011 traffic projections
from the 2003 REBIS against actual traffic counts to better inform the Update, (ii)
development of transport demand models for the different transport modes, (iii) assessment
of the 2012 traffic flows against the current capacity of the road, rail, inland waterways
ports and airports of the Comprehensive Network , (iv) development of 2030 traffic
projections for all modes, (v) assessment of future traffic flows against existing and
planned network capacities, (vi) identification of non-physical and physical impediments
on the Network, and (vii) development of a priority action plan for network improvements.

modal Core Transport Network for the Balkan region, similar to the Trans-European Networks of the
European Union.

Assessment of the 2003 REBIS Traffic Projections
5.     The 2003 REBIS model is based on a well-documented relationship between
economic variables and future traffic for road, rail, inland waterway and air transport. A
review of the traffic projections of the 2003 REBIS model against reported traffic counts
showed significant variations which were not consistent across the network or at the
national level. (The results of the comparison are presented in Annex IX). While
overestimation of traffic could generally be attributed to the economic and financial
European crisis that started in 2007, traffic projections for 32 percent of the Comprehensive
Network were underestimated by over 100 percent. Possible reasons for the
underestimation (such as the use of one rate of traffic growth only for a regional participant,
not accounting for local traffic, and the relationships between traffic growth and economic
growth) were taken into account in the development of the model for the REBIS Update.
Impediments to the Efficient Use of the SEETO Comprehensive Network
6.      The report identifies key non-physical and physical transport and trade logistics
barriers within the SEETO Comprehensive Network. These impediments contribute to the
increase in transport costs and to the reduction in the reliability of supply chains raising the
cost of doing business and ultimately diverting potential investment and jobs from the
region. Most of the Regional Participants are small open economies which depend, or will
need to depend, to varying degrees, on trade for sustainable economic growth. Enhancing
the efficiency of the Comprehensive Network, particularly the main export corridors, will
help attract foreign direct investment (FDI), a key “push” factor for exports in the region.
The key impediments are discussed below:
Non-Physical Impediments
7.     Addressing non-physical impediments is critical for enhancing connectivity in
Southeast Europe and for better integrating SEETO Regional Participants into the EU. Not
only does the alleviation of non-physical obstacles require significantly lower financial
resources than the construction of costly infrastructure, it yields high economic returns.
Moreover, the economic development benefits expected from investments in costly
transport infrastructure will not be fully realized if non-physical impediments, including
regulatory and procedural constraints at borders and along the corridors, are not removed.
Improving the quality of the road or railway network to reduce travel time within a
Regional Participant only to spend the saved time at the border is highly inefficient and
would greatly reduce, if not negate, the benefits of the improved infrastructure. Table ES1
(below) of the Priority Action Plan presents the proposed interventions for addressing non-
physical barriers together with an order of magnitude of the cost for each intervention.
Tables 18 and 19 show the economic benefits and the benefit-cost ratio respectively for
each measure.

8.      While there have been significant improvements in the past decade in eliminating
non-physical bottlenecks impeding trade and transport in the region, the study found that
unpredictability of border-crossing times remains an issue. The main cause of this problem
does not appear to be that of inefficient or non-transparent customs procedures, but rather
weak inter-agency coordination among border authorities. If the operational environment
in the region would reach the average EU levels, the order of magnitude of possible savings
is about 1 per cent of the region’s GDP or about €900 million a year.
9.      Overseeing the implementation of the measures that eliminate the non-physical
impediments would be best coordinated by both the SEETO and Central European Free
Trade Agreement (CEFTA) authorities with strong technical support from the European
Commission. Success in their implementation will require high level government support
that extends well beyond transport authorities.
Physical Impediments
10.    In order to define the priorities for infrastructure investment in the SEETO
Comprehensive Network, two broad types of analyses were carried out. The first was a
capacity analysis in which the capacity of the SEETO Comprehensive Network was
assessed against existing traffic flows and projected 2030 traffic flows to identify current
and future bottlenecks in the network based on purely engineering considerations.
Interventions were then proposed to address the identified capacity constraints. The second
analysis was a preliminary level economic efficiency analysis of the proposed interventions
that was utilized to develop the priority action plan. Two economic growth scenarios were
considered in estimating traffic projections.
11.    (a) The capacity analysis shows that about 60 percent (about 4,000 km) of the
Comprehensive Road Network is in no need of any immediate intervention and another 23
percent (1,500 km) only requires rehabilitation. About 16 percent (1,100 km) of the
network may require some intervention for upgrading or widening at present. Depending
on the economic growth scenario, between 25 and 30 percent of the network (1,700 km -
2,100 km) may require some upgrading or widening intervention before 2030.
12.     The capacity analysis also shows that about 63 percent of the Comprehensive
Railway Network (about 2,900 km out of 4,600 km) is in no need of any immediate
intervention to increase capacity. However, based on the poor infrastructure condition and
maintenance backlog, a large proportion of the 2,900 km that do not need immediate
intervention to increase capacity, will require maintenance/rehabilitation. About 19
percent (900 km) may require interventions for upgrading at present. Depending on the
economic growth scenario, between 25 and 33 percent of the network (1,200 km - 1,500
km) may require some upgrading intervention before 2030. Lower cost interventions such
as the implementation of modern signaling and managing the heterogeneity of trains should
be considered before a decision is made to invest in costly infrastructure.

13.     It was determined that the existing air services for passengers and freight within the
SEETO airports are adequate to meet the demand and that no financially viable additional
services could be envisaged in the short- and medium-terms. However the terminal
capacity in many of the airports in the region has either exceeded capacity (Zagreb and
Podgorica) or is reaching its physical limit (Sarajevo, Tirana and Tivat). Belgrade could
further reinforce its role as a gateway to the SEETO region leveraging its connections to
the other airports in the region.
14.      The capacity of all maritime container ports in the region is sufficient to handle the
current freight flows, with the exception of the ports of Split and Durres where capacity is
only marginally sufficient. Passenger terminal capacities for the ports of Vlore, Dubrovnik,
Ploce, Pula, Zadar, Split and Durres will not be able to cope with future (2030) passenger
traffic and expansions should be considered.
15.    The capacity analysis of the inland waterway ports indicates that the ports of Serbia
(Belgrade, Novi Sad and Samac) may require expansion and that the ports on the Sava
River are not being fully utilized due to the lack of dredging and river rehabilitation.
16.     (b) A preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis was carried out to develop a
priority action plan consisting of the key interventions and measures to alleviate
bottlenecks and enhance regional connectivity. The preliminary-level economic analysis is
based on rough costs and benefits and is intended to provide a general sense of the viability
of proposed efficiency-enhancing investments and measures. It is intended to identify
interventions for which prefeasibility and feasibility studies should be prioritized.
17.     In determining the priorities using the preliminary-level efficiency analysis,
interventions were divided into three categories: (i) High Priority, (ii) Medium Priority and
(iii) Low Priority. High priority investments were those which had a high positive Net
Present Value and were very likely to prove viable following the completion of a feasibility
study. High Priority investments were divided into two sub-categories: Immediate High
Priority projects that are needed to address current constraints and bottlenecks; and Future
High Priority projects that are not an immediate priority but that will need to be
implemented before 2030. Future High Priority Projects are expected to have positive
economic returns when implemented at the optimal time. The Priority Action Plan
includes the immediate high priorities—i.e. investments that are required to address
current bottlenecks and that are expected to have high positive economic rates of return.
18.     Since the economic efficiency analysis is based on crude costs and benefits,
interventions that may have a marginal negative rate of return were considered a medium
priority and should be subject to further analysis. Finally, projects/interventions that have
large negative rates of return were classified as low priority and in principle should not be
considered further.

19.     It is also important to note that the economic benefits were based on time and
vehicle operating cost savings only and did not take into account safety or environmental
considerations. In addition, the wider development impacts of large transport projects such
as agglomeration, potential increase in competition due to better transport, and tax impacts
resulting from changes in product and labor markets were not taken into account. This may
warrant the consideration of certain projects which are not included in the high priority list.
20.     While SEETO’s prioritization criteria for inclusion in SEETO’s MAP reflect, inter
alia, project readiness, the number of countries involved in the project, prioritization in this
exercise is predicated on economic efficiency only using the Net Present Value criterion.
If there are projects which prove to have a high economic return but are for some reason
not reflected in SEETO’s MAP, it would be worth understanding the reason for the
exclusion from the MAP and what would be necessary to include them.
High Priorities
21.    The high priorities that were included in the Priority Action Plan covered both non-
physical as well as physical interventions. The physical interventions included both asset
preservation as well as upgrading/new construction.
(i) Non-Physical Interventions. Given the relatively low cost of these interventions and
their substantial benefits, all non-physical impediments are considered a top priority.
(ii) Physical Interventions. Given the large rehabilitation and maintenance needs for the
Comprehensive Network, and the importance of addressing them to preserve the value of
expensive infrastructure assets, the proposed physical interventions included both (a) asset
preservation and (b) upgrading and new construction.
    (a) Asset preservation. The estimates covered roads and railways for both regular
maintenance (routine and winter) and rehabilitation (see Table ES-2.1). The details of the
estimation are provided in Section 6 of the report.
    (b) Investment in High Priority Physical Infrastructure. The investment cost in high
priority roads to address existing bottlenecks was estimated at €2,640 million. The
preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis did not support any further infrastructure
investment in the railways beyond rehabilitation and maintenance. Expansions in ports and
airports with capacity constraints were considered medium priority. No preliminary-level
economic efficiency analysis was carried out for interventions in these areas as the type
and cost of interventions vary significantly from one port/airport to another.

The Priority Action Plan
22.    Based on the analyses carried out in this study, an action plan was developed for
addressing the most important priorities for enhancing connectivity in the region. These
cover both physical interventions as well as soft measures. Physical interventions include
both asset preservation and new investment. As discussed above, the candidates for

upgrading/widening identified in the plan above should be subject to
prefeasibility/feasibility studies before proceeding further. The total cost of the proposed
interventions from 2016-2020 is about €8,140 million, an average annual cost of €1,630
million. Tables ES1-3 below present the Priority Acton Plan.

Moving Forward
23.          Moving forward, there are four areas worthy of attention.
      (i)       Prefeasibility and feasibility studies for High Priority projects prepared to
                International Financial Institution (IFI) standards; and SEETO to develop a
                pipeline of projects ready for implementation for each Regional Participant.
      (ii)      Developing a financial plan that includes national, EU as well as private
                resources for implementing the priority actions.
      (iii)     Measuring and benchmarking corridor performance systematically and on a
                regular basis. SEETO is well placed to oversee the development and
                implementation of a measurement methodology. This can be carried out as part
                of the extension of the TEN-T Core Network Corridors into the Western
                Balkans. This would also help monitor the implementation of measures to
                address physical as well as non-physical impediments.

                vehicle operating cost savings and time savings as the measure of economic
                benefits misses potential development benefits resulting from agglomeration,
                relocation of employment and residences, and labor impacts as discussed above.
                This could ultimately lead to suboptimal project selection.

Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies


                        Enhancing Regional Connectivity
                 Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

    1. Introduction
1.      In an effort to further develop the South East Europe Transport Observatory
(SEETO) Comprehensive Network, integrate it in the European Union’s (EU) Trans-
European Transport (TEN-T) Network and strengthen the underlying transport planning
systems, a grant was awarded by the Western Balkans Infrastructure Framework (WBIF)
for the update of the Regional Balkans Infrastructure Study (REBIS). 2 The motivation for
the Update was the fact that since the completion of REBIS in 2003, there had been no
review or update of the study’s projections and recommendations that would in turn enable
an informed assessment and updating of the regional priorities for investment in the
SEETO Comprehensive Network.
2.     The Beneficiary of this Update is the SEETO Steering Committee with
representatives from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Kosovo*. The Update also benefits
Croatia, which was a member of SEETO at the inception of the study prior to joining the
EU on July 1, 2013.
3.      The main objective of the REBIS update was to develop a Priority Action Plan for
enhancing the efficiency of the SEETO Comprehensive Network. The Action Plan
identifies priority physical investments as well as non-physical improvements including
regulatory, institutional and managerial changes required to reduce impediments to the
efficient performance of the Network. The Action Plan should be followed by a series of
prefeasibility and feasibility studies (beyond the scope of the update) for the identified
interventions. The studies would be used to identify economically viable interventions for
inclusion in the SEETO Multi Annual Plan (MAP) along with other eligible priority
projects.
4.      The scope of work included (i) an assessment of the 2010/2011 traffic projections
from the 2003 REBIS against actual traffic counts to better inform the Update, (ii)
development of transport demand models for the different transport modes, (iii) assessment
of the 2012 traffic flows against the current capacity of the road, rail, inland waterways
ports and airports of the Comprehensive Network , (iv) development of 2030 traffic
projections for all modes, (v) assessment of future traffic flows against existing and

  The 2003 REBIS study - funded by the EU Commission focused on the development of a multi-modal Core
Transport Network for the Balkan region, similar to the Trans-European Networks of the European Union.

planned network capacities, (vi) identification of non-physical and physical impediments
on the transport network, and (vii) development of a priority action for network
improvements.
5.     The focus of the final report is the assessment of the 2030 traffic projections under
low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth scenarios against the capacity of the
network under the “do-nothing scenario” (the 2012 network) and the “full SEETO
scenario” (network based on the 2015 MAP) and on the development of the Priority Action
Plan.
6.      The report is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a brief assessment of the 2003
REBIS traffic projections against reported counts. Section 3 presents key non-physical
impediments to transport and trade facilitation, as well as the costs and benefits associated
with their alleviation. Section 4 presents the 2030 traffic projections for both the
low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth scenarios. Section 5 presents the results
of the capacity assessment of the existing/planned networks to handle the projected traffic.
It identifies physical bottlenecks and proposes interventions for their alleviation. Section 6
presents the methodology used in the preliminary economic efficiency analysis for
assessing the proposed physical interventions and the results, while Section 7 presents the
priority action plan. Section 8 provides some concluding comments. Annexes I – X provide
detailed assumptions and model results.

    2. Assessment of the 2003 REBIS Traffic Projections
7.     The 2003 REBIS model is based on a well-documented relationship between
economic variables and future traffic for road, rail, inland waterway and air transport. A
review of the traffic projections of the 2003 REBIS model against reported traffic counts
showed significant variations which were not consistent across the network or at the
national level. (The results of the comparison are presented in Annex IX). While
overestimation of traffic could generally be attributed to the economic and financial
European crisis that started in 2007, traffic projections for 32 percent of the Comprehensive
Network were underestimated by over 100 percent. Possible reasons for the
underestimation (such as the use of one rate of traffic growth only for a regional participant,
not accounting for local traffic, and the relationships between traffic growth and economic
growth) were taken into account in the development of the model for the REBIS Update.

    3. Non-physical Impediments to Transport and Trade
3.1 Overview
8.      This section identifies key non-physical transport and trade logistics impediments
within the SEETO Comprehensive Network. These impediments contribute to the increase
in transport costs and to the reduction in the reliability of supply chains raising the cost of
doing business and ultimately diverting potential investment and jobs from the region.

Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

9.      Addressing non-physical impediments is critical for enhancing connectivity in
Southeast Europe and for better integrating SEETO Regional Participants into the
European Union (EU). Not only does the alleviation of non-physical obstacles require
significantly lower financial resources than the construction of costly infrastructure, it
yields high economic returns. Moreover, the economic development benefits expected
from investments in costly transport infrastructure will not be fully realized if non-physical
impediments including regulatory and procedural constraints at borders and along the
corridors are not removed.
10.    Table 1 presents the status of customs and transport policy preparation of SEETO
Regional Participants for EU accession through convergence with the EU acquis
communautaire (the acquis). The findings are in line with those proposed in studies/reports
provided by the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA), Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and SEETO.

11.     A comparison of border crossing waiting times for SEETO Regional Participants
and for EU countries shows that significant improvements could be made. Figure 1 shows
that while about 60 percent of EU bound loaded trucks cross the border in less than an
hour, the corresponding figure for SEETO Regional Participants is only 10 percent. The
costs and benefits associated with the non-physical impediments are discussed in Section
6.

3.2 Key Measures to Alleviate Non-physical Impediments in Customs and Transport
    Policy
12.     The key areas of intervention necessary to alleviate non-physical impediments in
customs and transport policy and facilitate trade and passenger movements within, as well
as in and out, of the region are:
 Administrative and institutional capacity development in regulatory and implementing
  agencies,
 Adoption and implementation of interoperable information technology (IT) systems in
  trade and transport,
 Inter-agency cooperation both in trade and transport operations,
 Safety regulation and enforcement in all transport modes, especially in road transport,
 Access to markets for transport services, especially in rail transport,
 Risk management systems and simplified customs procedures in customs; and
 Adoption of inter-connected IT systems in customs, such as the New Computerized
  Transport System (NCTS) in transit operations.

13.     Table 2 summarizes by mode and country the key proposed actions/measures that
would alleviate non-physical impediments and enhance regional integration in the short to
medium term. The overall analysis of non-physical bottlenecks identified about 70 country-
specific “soft” measures in customs and border crossing issues and transport policy for the
Western Balkans that need to be addressed. Given that many of these constraints are
common to SEETO Regional Participants, regional bodies such as SEETO (and its
expected successor, the Transport Community Treaty) and CEFTA can, and ought to, play
a leading role in alleviating them. The successful implementation of these measures not

only requires interagency cooperation within a country but also strong collaboration across
countries in a number of sectors.

14.     Addressing non-physical impediments would substantially improve the safety and
quality of transport operations for passengers and goods, and permanently reduce costs and
improve the predictability of transport and logistics. Such improvements are necessary to
enable the region to more deeply engage in international trade and also utilize its potential
to attract foreign direct investment, the level of which remains low.

    4. Traffic Projections for 2030
4.1 Methodological Approach
15.   Two scenarios were considered for traffic projections on the SEETO
Comprehensive Network based on projections of key economic and demographic variables
(GDP, population and employment). The two scenarios represent two alternative economic
growth options: low/moderate and moderate/high.
16.    GDP projections for 2014, 2015 and 2019 were based on the IMF’s 2014 World
Economic Outlook.3 Projections from 2020 to 2030 were developed taking into account
the economic conditions of the region and the growth prospects given the stage of
economic development of the different Regional Participants. The projected economic
growth rates within a Regional Participant varied to reflect higher growth rates in some
zones due to an expected higher intensity of economic activities. Zones with economic
growth rates higher than average for the Regional Participant included large cities, ports
and industrial areas.
17.   Population projections were obtained from the World Bank’s population datasets.4
Employment growth rates were estimated based on accepted empirical relationships
between economic growth and employment growth (employment intensity). Details on
growth rates used and their calculation are presented in Annex I.
18.    Traffic growth rates were applied to the traffic counts received from the SEETO
Secretariat, which had been collected from the Regional Participants. The results presented
below are for the low/moderate and the moderate/high economic growth scenarios for each
transport mode.
19.    With regards to the road and rail networks, for each of the two economic growth
scenarios, two network scenarios are considered: the “do-nothing scenario” (existing
network) and the “Full SEETO scenario”. The “do-nothing scenario” is based on the 2012
network and so does not reflect ongoing projects. The “Full SEETO” scenario is based on
the SEETO Comprehensive MAP 2014 and 2015 which present a set of infrastructure
developments and network upgrades expected to be initiated by year 2020.

4.2 Modelling Results for 2030 – Low/Moderate Economic Growth

    4.2.1   Road Network
20.    Traffic volumes were assigned to the different routes along the Comprehensive
Network based on the 2030 projections for trip productions and attractions for each zone.5
Figure 2 shows the 2030 traffic projections on the SEETO Comprehensive Road Network
under the low/moderate economic growth scenario, for both the “do-nothing” and “full
SEETO” scenario. Complete road traffic projections for 2030 for the “do-nothing”
scenario and the “full SEETO” scenario are presented in Annexes II and III respectively.
21.      Not surprisingly, the highest traffic projections for 2030 are on the sections along
the main corridors in South East Europe (Corridors V, VIII and X). Annex IIIa presents a
list of the road network sections with the highest traffic 2030 projections and largest annual
traffic growth rates under the low/moderate economic growth scenario. The highest traffic
projections for 2030 are found on Corridor X in proximity to significant urban areas. For
example, the projected number of vehicles per day near Belgrade in 2030 is between 55,000
to 145,000, and Sections. The equivalent figures near Zagreb are 50,000 to 66,000. For the
rest of Corridor X, the 2030 projections varied significantly across sections with the lowest
volumes between Orlovaca and Bubanj Potok) in Serbia (about 4,500 vehicles/day) and
Gradsko to Udovo in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (about 4,800
vehicles/day). The average projected traffic for Corridor X is around 23,500 vehicles/day
for 2030.

22.    Significant variations in traffic are also found along Corridor VIII with highest
projected traffic level near Tirana and the port of Durres reaching about 34,000
vehicles/day and the lowest traffic projections between Rugince and Deve Bair in the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (approximately 2,700 vehicles/day). The average
projected traffic flows for Corridor VIII is about 10,000 vehicles/day.
23.    Other road sections with high traffic projections for 2030 are on Corridor Vb
between Ivanja Reka and Kraljevecki Novaki, and between Jastrebarsko and Lucko in
Croatia (traffic between 40,000 and 45,000 vehicles/day), the section from Pristina to
Lipljan and to Sllatine/Slatina in Kosovo (projected traffic between 38,000 and 42,000
vehicles/day).

Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

24.      A careful comparison of the flows in Figure 2 shows significant increases in the
projected number of vehicles per day for 2030 on Corridor X around Slavonski Brod which
is the intersection of two of the three major corridors in the region: Corridor X and Corridor
Vc6. Traffic is projected to increase on that section of Corridor X from around 17,000 in
2012 level to around 31,000 vehicle per day in 2030. The number of trucks is expected to
increase by about 20 percent during that period. Annex IV presents a comparison of the
2030 traffic projections for the “do-nothing” and “full SEETO” networks under the
low/moderate growth scenario.

    4.2.2    Rail Network
25.    Similar to the road network, two scenarios were considered for the rail network: the
“do-nothing” scenario and the “full SEETO” scenario, which includes projects identified
by the SEETO MAP 2014 and 2015.
26.     Figure 3 presents the 2030 traffic forecasts for the SEETO Comprehensive rail
network for the “do-nothing” scenario as well as for the “full-SEETO” scenario under
low/moderate growth rates assumption. Figure 3 shows that there are only minor
differences between the two scenarios. This is to be expected given that, unlike the road
network, there are not a lot of practical route alternatives for rail shipments between two
points within the region. Annex IV presents the detailed comparisons between the two
scenarios. Similar to roads, the highest traffic projections for rail are on Corridor X. Rail
cargo projections for 2030 on sections close to Zagreb and Belgrade are the highest at about
12,000 – 14,000 tons per day. Rail traffic on Corridor X in fYR Macedonia is projected to
reach 5,500 – 7,500 tons per day by 2030. For Bosnia and Herzegovina the 2030 projections
are 6,000 – 8,000 tons per day between Doboj and the port of Ploce in Croatia; and around
8,000 on Route 9 between Banja Luka, Doboj, Tuzla and Brcko. The 2030 rail projections
for Albania (for Corridor VIII) are quite low and are expected to reach 700 tons per day on
the section from Durres to Rrogozhine if it were upgraded. Traffic on Route 4 in
Montenegro connecting the port of Bar to Belgrade in Serbia is projected to reach around
4,000 – 4,500 tons per day in the northern section between Podgorica and Bijelo Polje close
to the border with Serbia. The sections close to Bar port are projected to carry about 1,500
tons per day in 2030.

  Corridor X runs between Salzburg in Austria and Thessaloniki in Greece and passes through Austria,
Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and fYR Macedonia. Corridor Vc starts in Hungary, goes through Croatia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina and ends in the Port of Ploce in Croatia, which serves as the primary port for Bosnia
and Herzegovina.

    4.2.3    Maritime and Inland Waterway (IWW) Transport
27.     For the low/moderate economic growth scenario, Figures 4-6 present 2030 traffic
projections for both passenger and freight for IWW and sea ports. The port of Rijeka in
Croatia is expected to handle the largest cargo throughput projected at 11.3 million tons
per year in 2030 (from 9.4 million tons in 2012), followed by port of Duress in Albania at
4.8 million tons per year. The ports of Split and Ploce are each projected to handle around
3-3.5 million tons per year. The ports of Croatia are projected to have the largest number
of passengers in 2030, with the ports of Split, Zadar and Dubrovnik expected to handle 5.5,
3.1 and 2.2 million passengers respectively.
28.    For the IWW, throughput for the port of Novi Sad on the Danube River in Serbia is
projected to increase from around 1.1 million tons in 2012 to 1.4 million tons in 2030, the
highest throughput for the regional inland waterways. The port of Vukovar on the Danube
River in Croatia is expected to handle the second large throughput (750,000 tons in 2030).
Brcko port on the Sava River, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s only international port is

    4.2.4    Air Transport
29.     Figures 7-8 present air traffic projections for 2030 for passengers using direct
flights and for those using connecting flights for the low/moderate growth scenario. Vienna
and Munich airports, the two main airport hubs, outside the SEETO region, were
considered. The newly introduced direct flight connections between Tirana and Belgrade,
and Zagreb and Belgrade were taken into account. Belgrade airport is expected to continue
to handle the largest number of passengers in the region projected to reach 4.3 million in
2013.Tirana and Zagreb airports are expected to reach about 3 million passengers each, in
2013. Pristina airport is projected to have around 2.8 million passengers in 2030.
Podgorica, Skopje and Sarajevo are projected to handle 1.9, 1.6 and 0.9 million passengers
in 2030. The detailed 2030 air transport forecasts are presented in Annex II.

4.3 Modelling Results for 2030–Moderate/High Economic Growth
30.    For the moderate/high economic growth scenario, the same modelling approach
was used as for the low/moderate economic scenario. The detailed results for all transport
modes are presented in Annexes II and III.
31.    Comparing the 2030 traffic forecasts for the low/moderate and moderate/high
scenario for the road network (expressed in total number of vehicles/day), the
moderate/high forecasts are on average approximately 12 percent higher. Freight traffic
(both expressed in tons/day and number of trucks/day), is about 15 percent higher in the
moderate/high growth scenario than in the low/moderate growth scenario.
32.    As for railway network projections, passenger traffic (number of passengers) is
found to be approximately 13 percent higher and freight traffic (tons) 11 percent higher in
the moderate/high growth scenario than in the low/moderate scenario.
33.     Regarding maritime and IWW transport, the forecasted traffic, both passenger and
freight, for the low/moderate scenario are calculated to be 20 percent lower than for the
moderate/high scenario. Finally, the air traffic forecasts for 2030 are found to be
approximately 17 percent higher in the moderate/high growth scenario, compared to the
low/moderate scenario.

    5. Capacity Assessment: The Identification of Physical Bottlenecks
34.     This section of the report assesses the capacity of the existing SEETO
Comprehensive Network (defined as the “do-nothing” network scenario) to handle the
existing traffic as well as the 2030 projected traffic. It also assesses the capacity of the Full
SEETO Comprehensive Network (which is based on the MAP 2014 and 2015) to handle
the 2030 projected traffic. The objectives of this exercise are to identify, based on technical
capacity constraints, whether an intervention is required to alleviate a bottleneck and if so
what type of intervention; and when it would be required. The proposed interventions need
to be subject to pre-feasibility and feasibility analyses involving sound economic cost-
benefit criteria to determine their viability before a decision is made regarding their
implementation.

5.1 Road Network
35.     Road capacity was defined for the different roads on the SEETO Comprehensive
Network based on road type, design speed, terrain and other operating factors (see Annex
V). Existing traffic and 2030 traffic projections were then assessed against the capacity of
the networks to identify bottlenecks where interventions need to be considered. This was
carried out for both the low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth scenarios.

South East Europe: Updating the Regional Infrastructure Balkans Study (REBIS)
Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

36.     Four broad categories of interventions were considered:
(i) Road sections that require no immediate upgrading
This is based on the 2012 SEETO Comprehensive network and does not take into account
ongoing projects. There are a few complete corridors/highways that fall into that category:
 Route 9 - Croatia – all sections [Vukovar-Vinkovci-Zupanja]
 Corridor Xa - Croatia – all sections [Zagreb/Donji Macelj – Jankomir]
 Corridor Xb - Serbia – all sections [Horgos-Subotica-Novi Sad-Batajnica-Dobanovci]
In addition, there are many sections within each corridor/route which also fall into this
category.
(ii) Road sections that are candidates for immediate rehabilitation to preserve
     capacity
These are road sections where existing road and pavement conditions require rehabilitation;
otherwise, they will operate at a reduced capacity.

(iii) Road sections that are candidates for immediate upgrading to increase capacity
The interventions in this category include upgrading to sustain optimum existing lane
capacity, widening from 2 lanes to 4 lanes and widening from 4 lanes to 6 lanes.
(iv) Road sections that are candidates for future upgrading to increase capacity
     before 2030
These are specific sections where the current road conditions may require future
upgrading/widening to increase capacity to meet the 2030 traffic projections. It is therefore
recommended that these specific sections be subject to further studies in due course, to
identify the appropriate type of intervention, which will be likely to take place before 2030.
37.     For the low/moderate economic growth scenario, Figure 9 provides the locations of
identified current and future bottlenecks in the road network and Table 3 provides a
summary of the interventions proposed for addressing them. Similarly, for the
moderate/high economic growth scenario, Figure 10 provides the locations of identified
current and future bottlenecks in the road network and Table 4 provides a summary of the
interventions proposed for addressing them. The proposed interventions are based on
technical capacity considerations but need to be subject to an economic analysis to
determine their viability. All identified interventions for the different road sections are
presented in Annex VI.

* The sum exceeds 100% because some road sections require immediate as well as future interventions. For example a section
may require rehabilitation now and upgrading in the future.




    38.    The capacity analysis for the road network shows that about 60 percent of the
    Comprehensive Network (about 4,000 km) is in no need of immediate interventions and
    another 23 percent (1,500 km) only requires rehabilitation. About 16 percent of the network
    (1,100 km) may require some intervention for upgrading or widening at present. Depending
    on the economic growth scenario, between 25 and 30 percent of the network (1,700 km -
    2,100 km) may require some upgrading or widening intervention before 2030. As

       mentioned earlier, the economic viability of the different interventions needs to be
       examined before a decision is made on whether to implement the intervention or not.

       5.2 Rail Network
       39.     The capacity of the SEETO Comprehensive Railway networks (the “do-nothing”
       and the “Full-SEETO” networks) was assessed against the 2012 railway traffic and 2030
       traffic projections to identify bottlenecks where interventions need to be considered. This
       was carried out for both the low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth scenarios.

Based on the current average speeds and temporary speed restrictions on the
Comprehensive Network, it is clear that the infrastructure condition needs significant
improvement. However, the capacity analysis carried out in this update is to determine
whether the railway infrastructure, if in reasonable condition, could handle the existing and
projected traffic flows or not. Four broad categories of constraints and corresponding
interventions were considered:
   i. Rail sections with no capacity constraints related to infrastructure. These rail
      sections refer to links with less than 40 percent utilization, thus no improvements are
      needed.
  ii. Rail sections with minor capacity constraints. Minor capacity constraints in
      infrastructure that can be improved with minor improvements. These are assumed to
      be the links with average utilization 40-65 percent.
 iii. Rail sections with significant capacity constraints. Significant capacity constraints
      in infrastructure that need major upgrading. These are links with utilization of 65-80
      percent.
 iv. Rail sections with major capacity constraints. Major capacity constraints in
      infrastructure that would require based on engineering technical capacity standards
      construction of new line: links with utilization above 80 percent.

40.     Possible interventions for increasing capacity include: (i) double tracking; (ii)
adding auxiliary tracks at crossing stations; (iii) managing network effects; (iv) managing
track structure and speed limits; (v) managing train heterogeneity; and (vi) implementing
modern signaling. More specifically, for rail sections with minor capacity constraints,
minor works are proposed; for rail sections with significant capacity constraints, upgrading
measures to optimize capacity and/or major rehabilitation are proposed; for rail sections
with major bottlenecks, the construction of additional track/new line is proposed. It should
also be noted that less costly interventions than the construction of new lines (such as the
implementation of modern signaling and managing train heterogeneity) should be
considered first and can typically lead to significant increases in capacity. The closure of
railway lines is not considered in this study, because such a decision should be based on a
careful line by line and network economic efficiency analysis. The proposed interventions
for addressing the capacity bottlenecks are presented in Annex VII.

       41.     For the low/moderate economic growth scenario, Figures 11-12 present the maps
       of the SEETO Comprehensive Railway Network displaying current and future capacity
       constraints respectively and Table 5 provides a summary of the interventions proposed for
       further analysis on the rail network. For the moderate/high economic growth scenario,
       Figure 13 presents the map of the SEETO Comprehensive Railway Network showing
       future capacity constraints and Table 6 provides a summary of the interventions proposed
       for further analysis on the rail network. Annex VIIa presents a breakdown of the railway
       infrastructure by type of intervention proposed for consideration. The economic viability
       of the identified interventions would need to be assessed before a decision on
       implementation is made.

42.     The capacity analysis for the SEETO Comprehensive railway network shows that
about 63 percent of the Comprehensive Network (about 2,900 km out of 4,600 km) is in
no need of any immediate intervention to increase capacity. However this figure needs to
be interpreted with caution. As mentioned above, the capacity analysis is used to determine
whether the designed railway infrastructure could handle the existing and projected traffic
flows or not. But based on the poor infrastructure condition and maintenance backlog, a
large proportion of the 2,900 km that do not need immediate intervention to increase
capacity, will require maintenance/rehabilitation. About 19 percent (900 km) may require
interventions for upgrading at present. Depending on the economic growth scenario,
between 25 and 33 percent of the network (1,200 km - 1,500 km) may require some
upgrading intervention before 2030. The economic viability of the different interventions
needs to be established before a decision is made to move ahead with implementation.

       5.3 Airports
       43.    Based on the analysis undertaken using current traffic data (IATA 2013) and the
       model forecasts for 2030 for both low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth
       scenarios, it was determined that the existing air services for passengers and freight within
       the SEETO airports are adequate to meet the demand and that no financially viable
       additional services could be envisaged in the short- and medium-terms.
       However the situation is different when considering terminal capacity in many of the
       airports in the region. Table 7 shows that passenger traffic in Zagreb and Podgorica airports
       has exceeded terminal capacity. Split and Tirana airports are also close to reaching terminal
       capacity. Tables 7 and 8 present a list of airports that are expected to face capacity
       constraints by 2030 for the low/moderate and moderate/high economic growth scenarios


                                                                23

respectively. The tables also show the interventions proposed for consideration to enhance
capacity. Figures 14 and 15 highlight the airports that have or are expected to have capacity
constraints by 2030.
44.      Most of the indirect traffic between the SEETO airports and Europe currently
connects through European hubs. Zagreb and Belgrade could further reinforce their role as
gateways to the region leveraging their connections to the other regional airports. As a
result, more services from Zagreb and Belgrade to the other regional airports could be
foreseen and there is potential for these airports to develop as gateways to Europe and the
rest of the world from/to the South East Europe.

5.4 Maritime and Inland Waterways Ports
45.      Below is an overview of the main ports in the SEETO region.
Maritime Container Terminals
46.    Among the maritime ports in the region, five have container terminals: Rijeka,
Ploce and Split in Croatia, Durres in Albania and Bar in Montenegro. The port of Zadar in
Croatia allows for container transport in one pier using a ramp for Roll on – Roll off (Ro-

Ro) vessels. The total capacity of all the container terminals in the region is estimated at
around 900,000 TEU/year.7
47.    Rijeka port is currently upgrading its container terminal facilities. The new terminal
will handle approximately 600,000 TEU/year (up from the current capacity of 385,000
TEU). Minor container flows are also handled in the Croatian port of Split.8 Container
volumes are served in the port of Durres (100,000 TEUs), as well as in the port of Bar
(50,000 TEUs).
48.    Once the expansions are completed, the total capacity of the container terminals in
the region will be sufficient to handle the 2030 forecasts. At the individual port level,
however, insufficient capacity exists in the ports of Split and Durres.
Maritime General Cargo Terminals
49.    All ports in the region can handle general cargo, except the port of Dubrovnik which
is a passenger-only port. Rijeka port can handle 2,000,000 tons/year, Ploce can handle
600,000 tons/year. Ploce’s capacity will increase when the bulk terminal will be relocated
to new bulk cargo installation. Split can handle 500,000 tons/year operating at maximum
capacity but with yard side restrictions. Durres handles 1,000,000 tons/year (maximum
capacity of the existing facilities 1,500,000 tons/year; further expansion is limited by
inadequate space) and Pula can handle 400,000 tons/year limited by yard side restrictions.
50.    In total the ports in the area can handle approximately 5,000,000 tons/year of
general cargo.
Maritime Bulk Cargo Terminals
51.    Almost all ports in the region (except Dubrovnik, Vlore and Pula) can handle bulk
cargo. Rijeka port can handle 1,400,000 tons/year, Sibenik port can handle 1,400,000
tons/year (further expansion is restricted by yard-side capacity), Split port can handle
1,300,000 tons/year (further expansion restricted also by seaside capacity), Zadar port can
handle 600,000 tons/year (further expansion restricted by seaside capacity) and Bar and
Durres ports can handle about 400,000 each (further expansion restricted by seaside
capacity). Ploce port (current capacity of bulk cargo is 400,000 tons/year) is constructing
a new bulk terminal with an estimated capacity of 6,200,000 tons/year. Once construction
is completed, the total annual capacity of the bulk terminals in the region will exceed
11,500,000 tons/year.
Maritime Liquid Cargo Terminals
52.    The ports that can handle liquid cargo are: Rijeka (24,000,000 tons/year), Zadar
(1,600,000 tons/year), Ploce (1,200,000 tons/year), Bar (1,400,000 tons/year) and Vlore

(300,000 tons/year). In total, the ports in the region can collectively handle 27,000,000
tons/year of liquid cargo.
Maritime Port Capacities against 2030 Projections
53.     Tables 9 and 10 present assessments of the 2030 projected passenger and cargo
traffic against the maritime port capacities under the low/moderate and moderate/high
growth scenarios. Detailed results are presented in Annex VIII. Figure 16 shows ports with
insufficient capacity, where interventions need to be considered. According to the capacity
assessment, all of the maritime container ports in the region have can handle the current
freight flows, with the exception of the ports of Split and Pula where capacity is marginally
sufficient. However, against the 2030 traffic projections (and taking into account the
planned port expansion projects) the capacities of the ports of Split and Pula (Croatia) and
Durres (Albania) are inadequate to cope with the expected future freight flows.
54.    The container terminals in Rijeka and Ploce ports will contribute to the
modernization of containerization in the region and (given the good rail connections that
both ports offer) will allow for ship-rail transport chains from Adriatic Sea to Central and
North-West European destinations.
55.    The extension plan of the port of Split includes projects in St. Nikolas pier and
Resnik-Divulje passenger terminal. These projects will allow Split to retain its key/hub role
in passenger transport and stimulate the growth of tourism activities, which support
economic growth of the wide port region and nearby islands.
56.    With regards to passenger traffic, passenger terminal capacities for the ports of
Vlore, Dubrovnik, Ploce, Pula and Zadar will not be able to cope with future (2030)
passenger traffic under the low/moderate growth rate scenario. At the same time, based on
the moderate/high scenario forecasts for 2030, the ports of Durres and Split will also have
passenger capacity constraints (marginally sufficient capacity).

Inland Waterways (IWW) Terminals
57.     The inland waterways terminals are smaller in size than the maritime terminals of
the region. Three (out of eight) terminals can handle container traffic. These terminals are
Vukovar (Croatia), and Belgrade and Novi Sad (Serbia). The total capacity of all the
container terminals in the region is estimated at around 25,000 TEU/year.
58.     General and bulk cargo represents the main commodities transshipped to the IWW
ports. All of these ports offer options for handling general cargo and bulk cargo
commodities. Capacities range from 60,000 to 1,500,000 tons/year (Belgrade and Vukovar
ports handle the largest quantities of cargo). Terminals can be categorized according to
their location in two clusters: The first cluster contains the ports of Belgrade, Sisak, Brcko,
Samac, Vukovar, and Novi Sad, which have well designed installations although of small
scale. A common characteristic of these terminals is that they are surrounded by urban
areas.
59.    The second cluster consists of the ports of Slavonski Brod and Osijek, which are
located in rural areas where there is a potential for easy expansion.

IWW Port Capacities against 2030 Projections
60.     The assessment of IWW port capacities against the 2030 projections was carried
out by assigning each river segment to one or more IWW ports that are located in the
specific segment. The outcomes indicate that the IWW terminals of Serbia have insufficient
capacity, while most of the IWW terminals of the other countries in the region can handle
the forecasted freight traffic. However, the lack of sustainable dredging in Sava River
precludes the utilization of the Sava River ports to their full potential.
61.     While the port of Belgrade is strategically positioned as a transshipment hub at the
intersection of the Danube and Sava Rivers, the port’s location in an urban area is an
obstacle to further development which argues for the gradual relocation of the port and the
further development of other river ports as envisioned in the Spatial Plan of the Republic
of Serbia for the period 2010 – 2020. The expansion of other IWW ports in Serbia, as well
as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia is physically feasible and would need to be
subject to economic viability tests.
62.    Tables 11 and 12 present the results of the passenger and freight capacity
assessment of the IWW ports under both economic growth scenarios and Annex VIII
provides additional details.

Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

      6. Preliminary Economic Efficiency Analysis
63.     A preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis was carried out to develop a
priority action plan consisting of the key interventions and measures to alleviate
bottlenecks and enhance regional connectivity. The preliminary-level economic analysis is
based on rough costs and benefits and is intended to provide a general sense of the viability
of proposed efficiency-enhancing investments and measures. The analysis covers both
non-physical as well as physical interventions. For physical upgrading or new construction,
the analysis is intended to identify interventions for which prefeasibility and feasibility
studies should be prioritized.

6.1 Physical Impediments
64.     Enhancing the physical connectivity of the SEETO Comprehensive Network in an
economically sustainable manner, requires two types of interventions: (i) asset preservation
to safeguard the valuable and costly investments in the Network, and (ii) economically-
justified investments in upgrading or new construction to address physical bottlenecks.
Asset Preservation
65.     The economic rates of return to investment in asset preservation are typically high,
often in the double digits. This, coupled with international evidence that a euro not spent
on maintenance will result in multiple euros in additional vehicle operating costs provides
a sound basis for setting asset preservation of the Comprehensive Network as a high
priority.
66.     The annual asset preservation cost for the Network includes three elements:
1. Regular maintenance (which includes routine and winter maintenance).
2. “Planned” rehabilitation/renewal of a proportion of the network.
3. Backlog rehabilitation/renewal of a proportion of the network.
67.     The estimation was based on the following data:
Roads
Comprehensive Road Network: 6528 km
Annual unit cost of regular maintenance: €10,000 per km.
Unit cost of rehabilitation: €300,000 per km.
Percent of network undergoing regular rehabilitation annually: 12.5%
Percent of network rehabilitation to address backlog: 5%
Based on this data:
Annual cost of regular road maintenance: €55 million
Annual cost of road rehabilitation (regular and backlog): €340 million
Total annual cost of road rehabilitation and maintenance: €395 million

South East Europe: Updating the Regional Infrastructure Balkans Study (REBIS)

Railways
Annual unit cost of regular maintenance: €15,000 per km.
Unit cost of renewal: €1,000,000 per km.
Percent of network undergoing regular renewal annually: 2.5%
Percent of network rehabilitation to address backlog: 10%
Based on this data:
Annual cost of regular railway maintenance: €60 million
Annual cost of railway renewal (regular and backlog): €580 million
Total annual cost of railway renewal and maintenance: €640 million

Upgrading and New Construction
68.     The capacity of the SEETO Comprehensive Network was assessed against existing
and 2030 traffic flows to identify current and future bottlenecks in the network based on
purely engineering considerations. Interventions were then proposed to address the
identified bottlenecks. In order to develop a priority action plan consisting of the key
interventions and measures to reduce bottlenecks and enhance regional connectivity, a
preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis based on rough costs and benefits was
carried out. Below is a brief description of how the costs and benefits were estimated.
69.     It is necessary to make a distinction at this point between the prioritization criteria
that SEETO uses in the preparation of the MAPs and the criterion used in this exercise for
prioritization. While SEETO’s prioritization criteria for inclusion in the MAP reflect, inter
alia, project readiness, and the number of countries involved in the project, prioritization
in this exercise is predicated on economic efficiency only using the Net Present Value
criterion. If there are projects which prove to have a high economic return but are for some
reason not reflected in SEETO’s MAP, it would be worth understanding why they are not
in the MAP and what would be needed to include them.
The Costs
Capital Cost of Road and Rail Interventions
70.     The cost estimation for each SEETO road and railway network intervention was
based on a unit cost (euro/km) for each of the various categories of road and rail
interventions. These unit costs are averages for a large number of projects in each of the
different countries. Tables 13 and 14 present the unit costs for each SEETO Regional
Participant for roads and railways respectively. These costs are rough averages and should
be more accurately identified through prefeasibility and feasibility studies.

Maintenance Costs
71.    For this preliminary-level efficiency analysis, the maintenance cost was assumed to
be 2.5 percent of the construction cost for the whole life period of road projects. For rail
interventions, maintenance cost was taken as 10,000 €/km.
Economic Cost of Capital
72.    An economic cost of capital of 9 percent was used to discount real costs and
benefits.
The Benefits
73.    The benefits of the proposed interventions on the SEETO Comprehensive Network
that were considered in this analysis are the standard benefits of a transport project: time
savings and vehicle operating cost savings. Other benefits such as the reduction in
accidents, environmental impacts have not been considered in the current calculation. In
addition, the wider development impacts of large transport projects such as agglomeration,
potential increase in competition due to better transport, and tax impacts resulting from
changes in product and labor markets were not taken into account.11 Time savings were
estimated on the basis of the transport demand model used to project future traffic.
74.      The value of time for car passengers was estimated at 3.3 €/hour for car passengers,
and a car occupancy rate of 2.25 passengers per car was used. The value of time for a driver
on the road network was estimated at 10.40 € per hour. The value of time for passengers
using the railways was 3 €/hour for passengers and 2.13 €/ton-hour for freight railway
traffic.
75.     Residual values were taken as 10 percent of the cost of a “minor upgrade”, 15
percent of a “major upgrade” and 25 percent of road widening interventions; whereas for
rail projects, the residual value was taken as 30 percent of construction costs. The economic
lives of road and rail infrastructure investments were taken as 30 years and 50 years
respectively.
The Results
76.     Based on outcomes of the preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis,
interventions were divided into three categories: (i) High Priority, (ii) Medium Priority and
(iii) Low Priority. In determining the priorities using the preliminary-level efficiency
analysis, interventions were divided into three categories: (i) High Priority, (ii) Medium

Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2010
WBIF-TA-ALB-06: Albanian Railway Network: Infrastructure and Signalling Improvement Project, 2010

   The methodology for estimating wider economic benefits has been applied to the Crossrail project in
London (Crossrail Ltd, 2005; Colin Buchanan and Partners Limited, 2007) and the HS2 high-speed rail
project (HS2 Ltd, 2011), among others.

Priority and (iii) Low Priority. High priority investments were those which had a high
positive Net Present Value and were very likely to prove viable following the completion
of a feasibility study. High Priority investments were divided into two sub-categories:
Immediate High Priority projects that are needed to address current constraints and
bottlenecks; and Future High Priority-projects that are not an immediate priority but that
will need to be implemented before 2030. Future High Priority Projects are expected to
have positive economic returns when implemented at the optimal time.
77.    Based on the preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis, capacity expansions
on the SEETO Railway Comprehensive Network did not prove to be economically viable
suggesting the need to focus on railway rehabilitation.
78.     Expansions in ports and airports with capacity constraints were considered medium
priority. No preliminary-level economic efficiency analysis was carried out for
interventions in these areas as the type and cost of interventions vary significantly from
one port/airport to another.
79.     Since the economic efficiency analysis is based on crude costs and benefits,
interventions that may have a marginal negative rate of return were considered a medium
priority and should be subject to further analysis. Finally, projects/interventions that have
large negative rates of return were classified as low priority and in principle should not be
considered further.
80.    Table 15 below shows the priority categories for the interventions considered for
addressing the constraints.

Legend:
High: Interventions needed to address current constraints and bottlenecks and that are expected to have
high economic returns.
High-F: Interventions that are not an immediate priority but that will need to be implemented before 2030
and that are expected to have positive economic returns when implemented at the optimal time.
Medium: Interventions that have marginal negative rates of return.
Low: Interventions that are expected to have large negative rates of return and in principle should not be
considered further.

for EU based on FRONTEX, IRU and data from Sweden and Finland.


82.     According to data from SEETO Regional Participants and FRONTEX,12 over 3
million trucks crossed a border either within the region or an external border to the EU in
2012/13. This is the net figure of truck movements. As each crossing typically involves
separate inspections on both sides, about 6 million controls are performed annually on
international traffic to, from and within the SEETO Regional Participants.
83.     There are four main types of cost resulting from truck waiting and processing times
at a border. These are (i) inventory carrying costs related to cargo; (ii) vehicle costs for
both tied capital and idle running; (iii) driver costs; and (iv) other costs, including the
additional capacity (trucks) needed for traffic as a whole.
84.     Using the estimated waiting time distribution for SEETO Regional Participants,
trucks spend collectively over 26 million hours at border crossing points (BCPs). Table 16
provides the cost of waiting and processing at the border using an estimated average value

   The European Council established the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation
at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) in 2004 to improve procedures
and working methods within the European Union. Frontex promotes, coordinates and develops European
border management in line with the EU fundamental rights charter applying the concept of Integrated Border
Management.

of cargo of € 100,000 per truck, and an average value of a second-hand truck and trailer of
€ 150,000. The sum of inventory carrying costs, vehicle costs and driver costs attributed to
border crossings in a SEETO Regional Participant is more than 5 times the cost in an
efficient EU country.

 waiting times at border crossing points
Source: Consultant’s estimates of waiting times based on available border crossing information for SEETO Regional
Participants incl.: SEETO. (2012) Report on Border Crossing Facilitation, FRONTEX (2012) Western Balkans Risk
Assessment Reports 2012-2014 and interviews with authorities and logistics industry representatives in spring/summer
2014. Typical operational costs of road haulage and average value of cargo (100,000 €/ loaded truck).

85.     Unpredictable waiting/processing times also have a significant negative multiplier
effect on the supply chain, both upstream and downstream. Uncertainty makes inventory
planning more difficult and leads businesses to hold higher levels of inventory than
necessary if the supply chains were predicable. The increase in inventories is not reflected
in this estimate in Table 16 (€52 million) which only considers the inventory holding cost
of cargo at the border. Truck idling is another cost not included the table. A truck consumes
2-3 liters of fuel per hour in idle running, which is equivalent to € 2-3 per hour. If a truck
idles only 12 minutes each hour of the total 26 million hours spent at the border, this would
add another €13 million per annum to total vehicle costs for the region. The differences per
annum for cost types (i) and (ii) between the average for the SEETO Regional Participants
and an efficient EU country are €47 million and €41 million, respectively.
86.    Driver salaries in international traffic vary a lot, as does the way they are paid. The
remuneration for a trip may be partly or wholly a lump-sum payment, where additional
waiting time does not raise the income of an individual driver. Unnecessary waiting time
does, however, mean that more drivers are needed to perform the same duties. For an
average cost of a driver of 7 €/hour, 26 million hours is equivalent to almost 3,000
trucks/drivers spending a whole year at the borders in the region. For a well-functioning
EU country with a similar traffic flow, the corresponding figure would be 6.5 million hours,
equivalent to 760 trucks or drivers per year. In other words, the current procedures require
over 2,200 trucks/drivers more to provide the same transport service that would be
provided under efficient BCP operations.

Interventions to Address the Non-physical Impediments
87.     A number of interventions have been identified to address the non-physical
impediments at the border. Many of these measures relate to customs and border crossing
activities (C/BC), or involve strengthening the administrative capacity of the competent
authorities in transport and trade.
The Costs
88.    The total cost, up to 2020, for the measures proposed to alleviate non-physical
impediments to trade and transport were estimated at € 300-350 million in the SEETO
Regional Participants, as shown in Table 17. On an annual basis, the total cost for the
proposed measures is about € 60-70 million in years 2016-2020.

The Results
90.     Based on the costs and benefits in Tables 17 and 18 above, indicative economic
efficiency criteria were estimated by dividing the cumulative economic benefits by the
cumulative economic costs. Table 19 presents the summary results for each measure for
each Regional Participant as well as an aggregate for each Regional Participant. The
analysis shows high estimates of benefit/cost ratios for the interventions reaching as much
as 8.0 in the case of more efficient management of railway infrastructure. Implementing
efficient risk management practices is expected to yield the most benefits measured in
absolute terms (€) for each of the Regional Participants.

     7. Priority Action Plan
91.    Based on the analyses carried out in this study, an action plan was developed for
addressing the most important priorities for enhancing connectivity in the region. These
cover both physical interventions as well as soft measures. Physical interventions include
both asset preservation and new investment. As discussed above, the candidates for
upgrading/widening identified in the plan above should be subject to
prefeasibility/feasibility studies before proceeding further. The total cost of the proposed
interventions from 2016-2020 is about €8,140 million, an average annual cost of €1,630
million. Tables ES1-3 below present the Priority Acton Plan.

South East Europe: Updating the Regional Infrastructure Balkans Study (REBIS)
Enhancing Regional Connectivity--Identifying Impediments and Priority Remedies

    8. Concluding Comments
92.     Impediments to the efficient utilization of the Comprehensive SEETO Network and
the integration of the Regional Participants into the European Union can be categorized
into two broad categories: physical and non-physical.
93.     There is a strong argument for prioritizing the measures to address non-physical
impediments. In addition to the high economic rates of return of interventions to reduce
these impediments, they enhance the economic benefits of the investment in physical
infrastructure. Improving the quality of SEETO Comprehensive network to reduce travel
time within a Regional Participant only to spend the saved time at the border is highly
inefficient. This would greatly reduce, if not negate, the benefits of the improved
infrastructure.
94.    While there have been significant improvements in the past decade in eliminating
non-physical bottlenecks impeding trade and transport in the region, long and
unpredictable border-crossing times remain an issue in the region. This applies to both
passengers and freight. If the operational environment in the region would reach the
average EU levels, the order of magnitude of possible savings is about 1 per cent of the
region’s GDP or about €900 million a year. About 80 percent of these potential savings
would stem from reduced inventory carrying and other indirect logistics costs due to more
predictable operations.
95.    If such savings would materialize, they would directly benefit manufacturing,
trading and agricultural firms, and improve their competitiveness. A more predictable
operational environment for logistics is also essential for attracting FDI into the region.
Eventually, the consumers in the region would also benefit as the savings would also help
manage the price level especially of imported goods.
96.     The main cause of border crossing delays does not appear to be that of inefficient
or non-transparent customs procedures, but rather weak inter-agency coordination among
border authorities. In most of the Regional Participants, customs declarations are submitted
electronically to a high degree (especially in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)
and customs authorities are also adopting more modern customs systems for trade and
transit along models from the EU. At present, there is no systematic measurement of
waiting times at the different borders between Regional Participants. Having a system in
place for monitoring the performance of entire corridors and routes along the SEETO
Comprehensive Network is essential to reducing border waiting times and increasing
corridor efficiency. Monitoring performance would allow for benchmarking and setting
concrete targets for improvement.
97.   Overseeing the implementation of the measures to eliminate non-physical
impediments would be best coordinated by both the SEETO and Central European Free
Trade Agreement (CEFTA) authorities with strong technical support from the European

Commission. Success in their implementation will require high level government support
that extends well beyond transport authorities.
98.    As the majority of international trade in the Regional Participants and Croatia is
with the EU (notably with Germany, Italy, Austria, Croatia, and Hungary), the importance
of aligning to EU practices has also been recognized. Realignment with EU acquis is
expected to gain further momentum with EU membership preparations that have started
with Serbia in spring 2014 and Albania that was confirmed as a candidate in June 2014.
99.    The low average wages in the region – both in manufacturing and in services
together with the close proximity to the EU market provide an opportunity to attract more
manufacturing activities in the region. Proximity and low wages are not enough, however,
if the predictability of supply chains remains low due to the lack of reliability and
transparency of border crossing procedures.
100. It is also worth mentioning that many of the potential investments identified in this
study could be eligible for EU grant financing either full or partial through the IPA or the
CEF.
101.       Moving forward, it is recommended that SEETO focus on four activities.
    (i)       Prefeasibility and feasibility studies for High Priority projects prepared to
              International Financial Institution (IFI) standards; and SEETO to develop a
              pipeline of projects ready for implementation for each Regional Participant.
    (ii)      Developing a financial plan that includes national, EU as well as private
              resources for implementing the priority actions.
    (iii)     Measuring and benchmarking corridor performance systematically and on a
              regular basis. SEETO is well placed to oversee the development and
              implementation of a measurement methodology. This can be carried out as part
              of the extension of the TEN-T Core Network Corridors into the Western
              Balkans. This would also help monitor the implementation of measures to
              address physical as well as non-physical impediments.
    (iv)      Estimation of the wider development impacts of large transport projects. Using
              vehicle operating cost savings and time savings as the measure of economic
              benefits misses potential development benefits resulting from agglomeration,
              relocation of employment and residences, and tax and labor impacts as
              discussed above. This could ultimately lead to suboptimal project selection.
