Water Supply
and Sanitation
in Cambodia
Turning Finance into
Services for the Future
This report is the product of extensive collaboration and information sharing between many government agencies and
organisations in Cambodia. A core team drawn from the Ministry of Rural Development (Department of Rural Health Care,
Department of Rural Water Supply and Department of Planning and Public Relations), and the Ministry of Industry and
Handicraft, as well as the Ministry of Public Works and Transport have been key partners with the Water and Sanitation Pro-
gram (WSP) of the World Bank in analyzing the sector. The authors acknowledge the valuable contributions made by these
organizations, as well as other sector stakeholders, including development partners and NGOs partners in the sector that
participated in the workshops and have shared their information, such as UNICEF, ADB, JICA, UN-Habitat, SNV, and others.

The Task Team Leader for the Regional Service Delivery Assessment (SDA) in East Asia and Pacific is Susanna Smets. The
following World Bank staff and consultants have provided valuable contributions to the Service Delivery Assessment pro-
cess and report for Cambodia: Phyrum Kov, Sopheap Ly, Virak Chan, Kuysrorn Seng, Sandra Giltner and Almud Weitz. This
report was peer reviewed by World Bank staff Lixin Gu and Claire Grisaffi, as well as Belinda Abraham from UNICEF.

The report also has benefited greatly from the Cambodia Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Review completed in 2013,
which was led by World Bank staff Lixin Gu.

The SDA was carried out under the guidance of the World Bank’s Wa­  ter and Sanitation Program and local partners. This re-
gional work, implemented through a country-led process, draws on the experience of water and sanitation SDAs conduct­ ed in
more than 40 countries in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia.

An SDA analysis has three main components: a review of past water and sanitation access, a costing model to as­       sess the ad-
equacy of future investments, and a scorecard that allows diagnosis of bottlenecks along the service de­   livery pathways. SDA’s
contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector targets for infrastructure
and hardware but also what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure that fi­   nance is effectively turned into accelerated
and sustainable water supply and sanitation service delivery.

The Water and Sanitation Program is a multi-donor partnership, part of the World Bank Group’s Water Global Practice, sup-
porting poor people in obtaining affordable, safe, and sustainable access to water and sanitation services. WSP’s donors
include Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Nor-
way, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and the World Bank.

   The NSDP 2014-2018 specifies a target of 80% access to improved sanitation for the urban population, however as per JMP (2014) estimates this is
already achieved (82% by 2012); the NSDP is not clear about the definition that applies to this target, however it seems that this refers to piped water supply
access

   The JMP definition for improved water supply includes all rainwater sources to be improved, although the Cambodia definition only considers rainwater to
be improved if it is stored in a tank of more than 3000 litres.

   Using JMP access rates might have led to conservative estimates for rural water supply as government estimates report a lower access rate; for rural
sanitation, it might have led to a slight overestimation of the costs as government estimates are higher than JMP. For urban sectors consistency between
JMP and government estimates seems better.

   By keeping the technology mix constant, it is expected that piped services would increase linearly from 5% in 2012 to 8% of total access by 2025.
However, it is to be expected that piped services provision will become increasingly viable in areas that are “characterized” as rural and hence this
assumption could be adjusted for the purpose of scenario assessment
25
   Based on CSES (2011), current levels of urban access to septic tanks connected to combined sewer systems is around half. However, there is hardly any
treatment capacity in place at this moment.

finances on tariffs and maintaining household toilet facilities.

 Financial Reforms in Support of
 Decentralization and Deconcentration

 Around 2.8% of national budget is allocated to the com-
 mune/sangkat fund and although some funds might be
 used for rural water supply and sanitation, over 90% of the
 expenditures are estimated to be allocated to rural road
 construction.56 At national level it is not possible to clearly
 track if funds have been spend on water supply and sanita-
 tion, as broad categories are defined as infrastructure and
 social services. Hence, water and sanitation spending un-
 der this fund has not yet been included. Water and sanita-
 tion expenditure under the recently established district and
 municipal fund (0.8% of national budget) is unknown and
 could not be included. In line with the ongoing decentraliza-
 tion reform, it is expected that more funding will become
 available at the discretion of sub-national authorities, in-
 cluding a sub-national investment fund from 2014 onwards,
 some of these funds might flow into the urban and rural wa-
 ter and sanitation sector. It will be important in the future to
 track and understand how such expenditure will (or will not)
 be contributing to the sector. Hence, it will be critical to bet-
 ter monitor spending at sub-national level through the na-
 tional Financial Management Information System on water
 and sanitation in the long-term. A first start is to implement
 national level programme-based budgeting for water and
 sanitation and to routinely monitor resource flows to the
 sector that are not going through the government budgets.

  As per the government definition rainwater is only considered improved if stored in a tank of more than 3000 liters. Due to the preference of rainwater taste,
most urban and rural households store and use rainwater at least as a complementary source for consumption, while relying on other sources for hygienic
uses.
69
  The difference between CSES 2011, and NSDP 2012 estimates piped access outside of Phnom Penh is most likely due to other definitions of urban areas.
The most recent CIPS (2013) estimates piped water supply access in urban areas slightly lower at 64%.

  The NSDP 2018 target does not clearly specify whether this target refers to piped household connections only.

     outcome. The overall building block scores for each subsector are presented in the relevant subsector sections of the report.

      For rural water supply this might have led to underestimation of the investment costs, as for rainwater, only government definition of improved was included (> 3000 l tank
    available), while the overall improved access levels of JMP 2014 were used (that include all rainwater as improved). However, this underestimation is not likely to have a
    major impact on the overall findings and narrative with respect to sector financing.

      This estimate is based on the cost for the Niroth project, which was said to be around 200 USD/capita overall, covering 600,000 people costing US% 120 million. However
    to get a more realistic figure for expansion of urban services outside of Phnom Penh, expensive land costs (US$20 million), industrial treatment capacity (US$30 million),
    reduces the amount to around US$70 million for 600,000 people, which is USD 117.

   As per WSP Economics of Sanitation Study (2012), a septic tank costs US$215, and a wet lined soak pit around US$118. WB and ADB project cost for
soak pit are estimated at US$80 million. Thus, and average of US$80 has been used for a wet-pit; and the lifespan is expected to reflect the average between
septic tank (15 years) and wet lined pit (8 years) is weighted average is 9 years.
