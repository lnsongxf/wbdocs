THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

        The time and cost for obtaining a business license varies from sector to

        fees are about ILS 20 for application and ILS 100 for the license. The
        municipality previously sent notices to the health and the relevant
        security authorities, such as the civil defense, to proceed with their        36 days

      The client obtains external connection works and meter installation
      from the Jerusalem Electricity Distribution Company (JDECO)

      After the customer has paid the connection fees, the utility applies for an
      excavation permit at the municipality. The electricity company also needs
      to obtain clearances from other utilities and agencies such as water,
      drainage, telephone, and roads departments.

      In this case, a substation is most likely needed. The utility might need to
      wait some time to obtain the clearances and acquire any material it
      might not have in stock for an expansion of the network (such as            41 calendar days       ILS 71,000

      the medium voltage network).

      When the external works have been completed, and after the electrician
      has finished the internal installation, the electrician (licensed by the

        attesting to the required specifications, and request an inspection of the
        wiring. In order to obtain a license from the utility the electrician needs
        to have earned a diploma and had a certain number of years of work
        experience.

        An inspection to assess the internal wiring (including checking of air

       When the buyer of a property is a company it needs to obtain a

       transfer. Companies submit a request for a purchase permit with the
       Land Authority. They have to provide copy of the title deed, information
       about the land and the seller, and also a copy of the certificate of
       incorporation. Afterwards, the Land Authority will be in touch with the         30 days               no cost

      be in the title file or the parties give an estimate. If not, then an
      inspection/valuation is required which takes 3 days total and no cost.
