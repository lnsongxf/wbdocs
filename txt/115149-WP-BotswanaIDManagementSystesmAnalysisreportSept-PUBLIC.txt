       This report analyses the Identity Management System of the Republic of
        Botswana with respect to 1) accessibility, 2) robustness, 3) integration and
        regulated access to data, and 4) legal frameworks and data protection, and
documents the extent to which the legal and institutional framework and the
human and physical infrastructures have facilitated the establishment, operational-
ization and management of identity management as a comprehensive system.

mary tool for public administration and governance as well as facilitation of service
delivery to the public. It creates one identity per person pursuant to the current
legal framework which is used several times by the person at various institutions

document for obtaining other documents such as passports, driver’s licenses and
voter registration cards.
        The National Identity number used at age 16 is the same unique identifi-
cation number (UID) issued upon registration of birth. This strategy ensures an
identity life cycle from “Identity Establishment” to “End of Identity”. “Identity
Establishment” is accomplished on the basis of ‘Evidence of Identity’, such as
timely birth registration, and “End of Identity’ is accomplished through death reg-
istration or emigration. In the case of a resumption of citizenship, identity will be
reactivated.
        The National Identity Management System is linked with other systems,
such as the electoral system, the Social Benefit Registration System (SOBERS),
government payroll, and the transport system. Similarly, through this link, the
National Identity Management System is updated in real time when a death occurs.
The status of the registered citizen is changed from ‘Live’ to ‘Deceased’ and subse-
quently all other systems for service ministries interfaced with the NIS receive the
update as well.
        Although Botswana is a vast country with low population density, the reg-
istration services are highly decentralized in the country. There is a network of 37
offices across the country in 12 districts and 25 sub–districts. It also operates 13
on-site registration offices at various hospitals across the country. Further, birth

Department of Civil and National Registration

The Department of Civil and National Registration (DCNR) was established in
2003 with the merger of the division of National Registration with the division
of Civil Registration and Vital Events. It is a Government Department within
the Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs (MLHA). It is statutorily headed by a
National Registrar who is also an administrative Director. The core mandate of the
Department is the delivery of registration services on civil registration (CR) and
identity management (ID-M), as well as registration and monitoring of societies.
The DCNR has a staff complement of four hundred and fifty four (454) stationed
in 37 stations across the country in 12 districts and 25 sub–districts. It also operates
13 on-site registration offices at various hospitals across the country. There are plans
for future expansion of the on-site registration initiative to other health facilities.
The annual budget for civil registration for the 2014/15 financial year was P56 000
000 (equivalent to US$ 5.6 million). The different items of infrastructure available
at the offices across the country are shown in Table 2.
        The DCNR derives its core mandate from six (6) Acts of Parliament: The
Births and Deaths Registration Act; the National Registration Act; the Marriage
Act; the Married Persons Property Act; the Change of Name Act; and the Societies
Registration Act. In carrying out its work, the DCNR utilizes strategic partner-
ship alliances with numerous other stakeholders, including: the Ministry of Health,
which is both a source and user of the births and deaths data; the Administration
of Justice, which is responsible for divorce administration; and Statistics Botswana,
which by law is responsible for the compilation, analysis, and dissemination of
vital statistics. The DCNR has working collaborations with various development

3          National/
           Foundational ID


T   he Botswana national identity management system is foundational (that is the
     mode of identification is national and is used for multiple purposes).
        According to the National Registration Act CAP 01:02, it is compulsory for
every citizen of Botswana to undertake National Registration within thirty (30)
days of attaining the age of sixteen (16), and within 30 days of acquiring Botswana
citizenship. Birth registration establishes the identity of an individual or citizen
and the additional enrolment in the national registration and the issuance of the
National ID card, confirm his or her legal identity. The ‘Omang’ or National iden-
tity Card is the prima facie proof of the particulars stated on the identity card. The
National Identity Card enables every citizen to access reserved public services (such
as social safety net programs) by presenting it to service providers for identification
purposes and authentication of person data.
        The Government of Botswana has established an organic link between
births registration, national registration, and death registration through a unique
identifier to ensure that birth registration becomes a credible foundation for iden-
tity management beyond just serving as a source of vital statistics and to ensure
that death registration marks the official end of identity. In 2011, in addition to a
certificate of naturalization, the birth certificate was made a compulsory require-
ment for National Registration and for acquisition of national identity card at the
age of 16 years. In a case where the birth certificate is not available, mechanisms
for dealing with the lack of breeder documents when applying for a new, national
ID have been put in place. For instance, social footprints like school certificates
and baptismal certificates are used to inform the reconstruction or establishment
of identity. Moreover, the law provides that the Registrar can require any addi-
tional information necessary to ensure authenticity of registration. In such cases
the next of kin/parent /guardian or those with material knowledge of the events
are often required to depose to an affidavit attesting to the facts they present. An
additional affidavit from a local or village Chief or Headman may also be required
in certain cases.

           of the National/
           Foundational ID
           system


T
       he following sections describe the four key dimensions of the status of the
       national ID (Omang) system: (1) accessibility, (2) robustness, (3) integration
       and regulated access to data, and (4) legal frameworks and data protection.



Accessibility

Accessibility is important to achieve significant access of an individual to a foun-
dational ID. The extent of coverage of civil registration and the Omang is noted
above. Some factors that affect the accessibility of the National ID System are
described below.



Financial Costs
As noted earlier, in Botswana, birth registration, birth certificates, and the first issu-
ance of the national ID are all free. The renewal of the national ID is done every 10
years for a nominal fee of P5 (50 Cent in US$). The replacement of a lost national
ID card is P110 (US$11), which is imposed with a purpose to instill responsibility
and to ensure safe keeping of the card. The free service and the nominal fees are
instrumental in ensuring that there are no barriers to service access. In order to help
improve access to registration services, there are set turnaround times for officials to
provide these services.

A
         s already indicated, Botswana has a single foundational Identity
          Management System which creates one identity per person pursuant to the
          current legal framework which is used several times by the person at vari-
ous institutions, and by those other institutions, to facilitate transactions between
themselves as individuals and service providers. For instance, the post office card
is simply a debit card produced on the basis of the Omang. The same principle
applies to the voter’s card, which is given as proof that somebody has registered and
is issued purely on the basis of the identity card issued under national registration.
Also, the Electoral Act is explicit that a valid Omang is a requirement for one to reg-
ister for elections and to be given a voter registration card and to vote in elections.
The Electoral act, Ch0209s54]54(b) states that every voter desiring to vote shall go
to the polling station where the voter is registered to vote, and shall produce his or
her voter registration card and identity card to the presiding officer.



Social Protection

The Government of Botswana has created a comprehensive social protection sys-
tem with numerous programs, including labor (SPL) programs, the Orphans and
Vulnerable Children Program (OVC), the Destitute Persons Program (DPP), the
universal Old Age Pension (OAP), the Community Home Based Care Program,
Disability Cash Transfer, Vulnerable Group Feeding, Primary School Feeding, and
the public works Ipelegeng program (which has reached roughly 220,000 persons).
       The Department of Social Protection (DSP) under the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development uses the Identity Management System and
the resultant identity cards to facilitate their clients to access programs as follows:

6          CONCLUSION


T
       he right to identity and nationality are firmly embedded in the Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the
        Child. The possession of an identity is a precondition for full citizenship. The
Botswana government has committed through legislation and operations to ensure
that people can enjoy these most fundamental rights. The Department of Civil and
National Registration in the Ministry of Labour and Home Affairs is responsible for
administering the single foundational National Identity Management system based
on birth registration. The Government of Botswana has established an organic link
between births registration, national registration, and death registration through a
unique identifier to ensure that birth registration becomes a credible foundation
for identity management beyond serving just as a source of vital statistics, and that
death registration marks the end of registration. In order to synchronize the pro-
cesses and decision making, one Registrar is responsible for both civil and national
registration. In order for individuals to have access to a national ID, they must be
citizens of Botswana, born in Botswana, and aged 16 years or over.
        The national level ID is commonly used for accessing most services. An
identity card is a requirement to access numerous services, including: health care;
opening a bank account; obtaining credit or loans; reporting to the tax authority;
obtaining a marriage certificate; obtaining private health insurance; enrolling in
social insurance programs; qualifying for cash transfers, food or other safety net
programs, especially those provided by or through government; obtaining a cell
phone account; obtaining a passport; getting a drivers’ license; voting in national
elections;, registering a vehicle, purchasing property such as a houses, and obtaining
tuition assistance for education
        An inadequate budget and a shortage of skilled manpower are some of the
political and economic limitations that affect the government’s ability to imple-
ment the ID system. However the resources that are available show a significant
commitment on the part of government to CRVS and IDM development and
maintenance. The current political commitment and leadership is visible both
nationally and locally at councils and among local authorities.
7          WAY FORWARD


T
       he recently completed Comprehensive Assessment of CRVS and ID-M in
        Botswana has identified gaps and bottlenecks that require remedial action.
        The Investment Plan based on the assessment and the on-going project on
creation of a People Hub will be extensively relied on to further improve Identity
Management in Botswana. The use of a formalized Memorandum of Understanding
between the MLHA and other user agencies for secure data management and
interoperability will facilitate service delivery in numerous programs, especially
social protection programs.
        Botswana has deliberately moved slowly towards creating a People Hub and
introducing electronic Identity cards in order to first ensure that data integrity
and efficiency of processes for the civil registration and identity management sys-
tems are maintained, and also to ensure that the systems are reliable, stable, and
dynamic, and not vulnerable to fraud. This is done by ensuring that the registra-
tion processes are dynamic and foolproof before proceeding with digitization and
that the environment is in fact ready to embrace a full scale population register or
People Hub. Rushing into digitization before ensuring that processes are efficient,
adequately inclusive, and rigorous, could result in Identity Management Systems
that are vulnerable to fraud, with multiple or ghost beneficiaries for social protec-
tion programs and other entitlements and services. This could erode trust and con-
fidence of the national Identity Management System, and also could result in high
implementation costs for various government programs. Botswana was careful to
first build robust processes before proceeding with digitization and a People Hub.

The following section highlights some of the key elements of the CRVS and Identity
Management Investment Plan, which point a way forward for further development
of Botswana civil and national registration.
