Governments and protected area
Authorities are under increasing pressure
to preserve the beauty and biodiversity of
their beaches, parks, and pristine natural
sites, while also growing tourism activity.
Is it possible to do both?
Tourism concessioning is one solution. The private sector
can be an important partner in helping protected area
authorities achieve their twin goals of conservation
and attracting visitors. Delivering successful tourism
concessioning programs, however, is challenging and
depends on the right mix of characteristics, technical
expertise, and institutional experience.

The World Bank Group presents 14 key characteristics
displayed in most successful tourism concessioning
programs.

         This short guide is designed for protected area managers,
         tourism authorities and their advisors in the international
         development and non-governmental organization (NGO)
         community.

         It has been jointly produced as an introduction to
         concessioning practices by the World Bank Group’s
         Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice and the IFC’s
         Advisory Team on Public Private Partnerships.


         It has been written for those who are new to concessioning,
         new to the tourism sector or new to protected areas.
         The guide intends to provide a brief overview of the key
         messages to consider when starting work in this area.

         There are a minimum of 14 key characteristics displayed by
         most successful concessions programs.

                               SOME AREAS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR TOURISM

Why is this Important?

The primary function of a protected area is to
protect nature and biodiversity. In some cases,
protected areas will also safeguard valuable and
threatened cultural and/or historic assets. Covering
nearly 12 percent of the Earth’s surface, protected
areas are also becoming key components in climate
change mitigation strategies.

Almost half (47%) of the average US$1,376 a tourist spends on a
mountain climbing holiday to Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania goes
towards park fees. A further 18% is spent on wages and tips for
porters and guides, and 4% on local cultural goods and services8
(see the figure below). Increasing the proportion of expenditure
that reaches the local economy is typically a primary aim of
national governments.

Why is this Important?

It is equally important for both the Protected Area
Authority and the concessionaire to protect the
natural resources on which the tourism operation is
based (for example, thriving wildlife populations).
If the natural or cultural asset quality becomes
degraded through pollution, deforestation or over-
exploitation, visitor demand and pricing are likely to
decrease, hurting the businesses’ bottom line and
the local economy.

In some cases, technical support agencies (e.g. NGOs) will have to engage
with a community for several years before the community can make
informed decisions to partner with the private sector in a joint-venture
or as a community-based tourism initiative (i.e. where ownership is by a
collective of community members). Expectations need to be managed for
a significant period after the concession is awarded and the facility is being
built and actually starts to generate income. A protected area authority
must factor these elements into the overall concession planning timeframe.
In some instances, authorities may invite NGOs to ready communities for
concessioning a year or two in advance of a concession tender process (e.g.
Maputo Special Reserve, Mozambique).21

Experienced investors evaluate a number of factors to determine viability.
Before making a commitment to invest, prospective opportunities are typically
scored. The most viable projects tend to do well in the following areas:

                 AND STRONG ENGAGEMENT

Why is this Important?

A successful and sustainable concession process identifies
and engages with stakeholders early on to understand their
various concerns and expectations, and works with them
to ensure a project’s success. Dialogue over environmental,
social, political, economic, or other concerns can help avoid
problems and delays later on. Because protected areas are
valuable to different groups and individuals for different
reasons, effective concessions are built on shared trust and
understanding among many stakeholders.




A sound stakeholder engagement process
is continuous

It often begins before the start of a project and continues
even after the project ends, and includes the following
activities:
•	   Identifying the main stakeholders.
•	   Informing and communicating all relevant information
     to each stakeholder.
•	   Consulting with stakeholders and involving them in
     planning discussions.

•	   Negotiating with stakeholders over sensitive issues in
     complex projects.

•	   Involving stakeholders and reporting to them to keep
     them abreast of developments.

Concessions are by far the most common model in protected areas, with some
lease arrangements where existing authority-owned infrastructurealready exists.

All models mean sharing risks and rewards to deliver the tourism product.
Inexperienced authorities might grant the private sector more responsibility;
confident authorities might take on a greater role. Whatever the arrangement,
a successful agreement should last long enough for the investor to generate a
reasonable return.

There are different types of concessionaires

Bodies that enter into concession agreements with protected area authorities are
usually private entities, but can also be public or quasi-public, community associations,
or combinations of any of these – such as private-community partnerships.

Direct negotiations and unsolicited proposals

Direct negotiation may be preferred in some instances. (For small projects, for
example, where there is limited competitive interest, or extensions of existing
contracts). Direct negotiation is not necessarily faster than competitive procurement,
however, and open tenders can demonstrate an authority’s commitment to
transparency, and help to secure the best investor and the best deal for the project.
Best practice assumes competitive and transparent procurement. There is research
into how unsolicited proposals can be managed to protect transparency in the
procurement process, but this is typically a difficult thing to accomplish.

Methods and duration of procurement differ among Protected
Area authorities

The preferred procurement method used by a selection of protected area
agencies is outlined below, and includes the typical duration for each process.39                                                                                   Fano, member of a local guide Association, Andasibe National Park,

Applying Risk Management to Tourism Concessions

Sound risk mitigation systems establish standards, and identify and monitor changes in those standards throughout the life of
a tourism concession. Managing risk might require additional external support from specialists. The IFC’s Sustainability Policy
identifies eight broad areas of performance standard monitoring:47
•	    Standard 1: Environmental and social risks and impacts.
•	    Standard 2: Labour and working conditions.
•	    Standard 3: Resource efficiency and pollution prevention.
•	    Standard 4: Community health, safety, and security.
•	    Standard 5: Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement.
•	    Standard 6: Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources.
•	    Standard 7: Indigenous peoples.
•	    Standard 8: Cultural heritage.

Project Example: Managing Environmental risk in South Africa


South Africa: Concessionaires in Kruger National Park undertook Environmental
Impact Assessments as part of their infrastructure development planning.
Environmental Management Plans were also devised for the construction and
operational phases of the concession, which provided the basis for monitoring
compliance with environmental standards. Monitoring targets were established
in relation to the length of new roads developed, the number of beds, water
consumption, waste production, and specific game drive guidance (e.g. minimum
approach distances for Big Five wildlife). Concessionaires employed environmental
control officers to monitor and report on environmental impacts. Stiff penalties
were applied for every incidence of non-compliance with the environmental
conditions of the concession agreement.48

Why is this Important?

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is essential to understanding the impact and                                                         Monitoring and evaluation

What can be done better next time? Effective concessions are effective because
they almost always modify or update their approaches or systems.
