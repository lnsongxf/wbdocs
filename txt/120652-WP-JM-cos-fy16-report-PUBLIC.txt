I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Jamaica perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Jamaica
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Jamaica
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From June to September 2016, 244 stakeholders of the WBG in Jamaica were invited to provide
their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects;
consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments;
bilateral/multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 91 stakeholders participated in the
survey (37% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via courier. Others responded to the
survey on the independent online platform, Qualtrics. Respondents were asked about: general
issues facing Jamaica; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and
results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future
role in Jamaica; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 68%, N=108). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, and E. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown
and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix D (page 86).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, employees from a ministry were combined with consultants working
       on WBG projects, and respondents from PMUs; respondents from the financial
       sector/private banks were combined with those from private sector organizations;
       respondents from NGOs/community based organizations, private foundations, and faith
       based groups were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number of
       respondents from the office of a minister, office of a parliamentarian, local governments,
       independent government institutions, and other organizations were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from the office of the President/Prime
       Minister, trade unions, youth groups, or the judiciary branch.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly lower
        levels of familiarity with the WBG than the respondents in the FY’13 survey (weighted
        mean in FY’16 = 7.0; weighted mean in FY’13 = 8.3)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Jamaica, and the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Jamaica, and significantly, moderately
        correlated with the extent to which the WBG helps to achieve development results in the
        country.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts
      Year comparison: Respondents in the previous FY’13 Country Survey most often
       attributed failed or slow World Bank assisted reform efforts to that “the World Bank is
       not sensitive enough to political/social realities on the ground” (53%) and that “there is
       not an adequate level of citizen/civil society participation” (47%).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

The Effectiveness of the World Bank Group and Other Development Banks4
(Indicator Question)
          Year comparison: This year’s respondents gave significantly lower ratings for the
           effectiveness of the WBG than the respondents in FY13. Respondents in the FY’13 and
           FY’16 Country Surveys gave statistically similar ratings for the effectiveness of the IDB.
          In FY16, stakeholders gave significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness than
           the effectiveness of the Caribbean Development Bank, and statistically similar ratings for
           the effectiveness of the Inter-American Development Bank.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Jamaica, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Jamaica. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at transport;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at access to affordable finance for micro, small, and
             medium enterprises; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Jamaica, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at education;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at early childhood development.

Appendix D: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 101  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 84

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
