2     IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
Introduction
This document should be read in conjunction with the International Development Association’s (IDA) financial
statements and management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) issued for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
IDA undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IDA’s selected financial
data as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 (FY16 YTD) and September 30, 2014 (FY15
YTD) as well as for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

I.    Organizational Overview and Business Model
IDA is an international organization established in 1960 and is owned by its 173 member countries. It is the
largest multilateral channel for providing concessional financing and knowledge services to the world’s poorest
countries, and is one of the five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG); the others are the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID). Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent, with separate assets and liabilities.
IDA is not liable for their respective obligations. The WBG’s two goals, to be achieved by 2030, are to end
extreme poverty by reducing the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3%
globally, and to promote shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by fostering income growth for the bottom
40% of the population in every developing country. In October 2015, the WBG raised its poverty line figure
upwards, from $1.25 to $1.90 a day, to reflect the increase in prices worldwide based on updated purchasing-
power-parity data.
IDA plays a pivotal role in the global aid architecture and pursues the WBG goals by providing concessional
development credits, grants and guarantees to the world’s poorest countries for programs and operations that
help meet their development needs. IDA provides technical assistance through reimbursable advisory services,
policy advice and global knowledge services through economic sector work and country studies. It also supports
member countries with disaster risk financing and insurance to help increase their financial resilience against
natural disasters, as part of their broader disaster risk management agenda. In addition, IDA provides or
facilitates financing through trust fund partnerships with bilateral and multilateral donors.
The resources available to IDA for funding its activities constitute its commitment authority. IDA finances its
development credit, grant and guarantee commitments primarily from partner contributions and loans, funds
from its internal resources, as well as transfers from IBRD’s net income, and grants designated out of IFC’s
retained earnings. The three-year replenishment process allows IDA to be responsive to changes in the needs of
its borrowers and the development environment. Given that the disbursements of IDA’s credits and grants take
place over several years, commitments do not have to be fully funded at the time of approval and this allows
partner contributions to be encashed over several years, and internal resources to be committed in advance of
their expected receipt.
Since its inception, IDA’s resources have been replenished seventeen times, complemented by an additional
replenishment agreed to in 2006 for financing the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Details of the
Seventeenth Replenishment of IDA’s Resources (IDA17), which is effective from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2017,
are provided in Chart 1.

II.   Funding and Resource Allocation
The funding of IDA’s lending, grant financing and guarantee activities is presented and discussed below.
Sources of Funds
Partner Resources (Subscriptions and Contributions and Borrowings from Partners): IDA finances its
commitments for development credits and development grants primarily through partner resources. The partner
resources that are in the form of subscriptions and contributions are assigned voting rights. Prior to IDA17, IDA
had not entered into long-term borrowings, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles. Whilst grant
contributions from members remain at the core of IDA’s financing framework, borrowings from partners were
introduced in IDA17 to increase the lending envelope available by incorporating a limited amount of debt
funding into the financing framework in a sustainable manner.

Internal Resources: These primarily comprise contractual principal repayments (including any contractually
accelerated repayments and voluntary prepayments), interest income on blend term credits, income from the
investment portfolio and any carryover of residual resources from previous replenishments.
Transfers and Grants from affiliated organizations: These are transfers from IBRD’s net income and grants
from IFC’s retained earnings.
Applications of Funds
Disbursement of development credits and grants: Through its development operations IDA’s development
credits, grants and guarantees benefit the poorest and least creditworthy countries, which are eligible to borrow
from IDA.
Administrative Expenses: IDA’s policy is to maintain its service and commitment charges at a level that will
cover its administrative expenses. Commitment charges are set annually and take into account the extent to
which service and certain interest charges, and partner compensation for development grant financing and
forgone charges on development credits forgiven under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) and
the MDRI, cover administrative expenses. FY16 commitment charges are set at nil.
Commitment Authority
The IDA17 Commitment Authority Framework amounts to Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 33.7 billion
(approximately U.S. dollar equivalent $50.8 billion using the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate).
Chart 1 provides a breakdown of the principal sources making up the total lending envelope under IDA17 and
the extent to which these sources have been used for commitments of development credits, grants and guarantees
through September 30, 2015.

 a. Commitment Authority is measured and monitored in SDR. The chart represents the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts for
    presentational purposes only, based on the IDA17 foreign exchange reference rate of U.S. dollar/SDR 1.50718. Actual
    commitments are recorded based on historical U.S. dollar rates.
 b. Amounts may not add due to rounding.
 c. Includes U.S.dollar equivalent 4.5 billion of partner commitments for compensation of debt relief provided under MDRI.



III. Basis of Reporting
IDA prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. The financial statements
provide a basis upon which users are able to analyze IDA’s sources and uses of resources. Under the reported
basis, IDA’s Statement of Income alone does not reflect the true economic results of IDA due to a number of
asymmetries, which are explained in the MD&A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

IV. Statement of Activities Analysis
The Statement of Activities (Table 1) is designed to reflect how IDA manages its sources and applications of
funds in executing its operating activities. Specifically, it presents the flows associated with IDA’s operating
activities and the impact of these activities on the net asset value of IDA’s investment portfolio. This
presentation addresses the majority of the asymmetries (explained in IDA’s June 30, 2015 MD&A) embedded in
IDA’s reported basis results.

Results from Operating Activities
IDA’s operating activities resulted in a net outflow of $764 million for FY16 YTD. This primarily reflects the
$2,358 million of outflows for disbursements of development credits and grants, partially offset by $528 million
of cash receipts relating to members’ subscriptions and contributions and, $960 million of cash receipts relating
to principal repayments and prepayments.
The $981 million variance in FY16 YTD as compared to FY15 YTD is primarily due to the $1,000 million in
borrowings from partners received in FY15 YTD.




                                   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015            5
The following are additional details of the key drivers of IDA’s results from operating activities:
Members’ Subscriptions and Contributions
The subscriptions and contributions of $528 million represent the cash contributions received from members and
the encashment of demand notes. This excludes $60 million of member contributions received to finance
foregone charges for debt relief and development grant financing, which is reflected as part of administrative
activities.
Borrowings from Partners
There were no receipts from partner borrowings during FY16 YTD , as compared to $1,000 million which was
received over the same period in FY15 YTD. At September 30, 2015 borrowings from partners was $2,152
million as compared to $1,000 million as at September 30, 2015. (See Note D in the Financial Statements for
more details). The increase in FY16 YTD borrowing expenses is in line with the increase in borrowing balances
over the period.
Transfers and Grants from Affiliated Organizations
On October 9, 2015, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved a transfer to IDA of $650 million, under IDA17.
This transfer was received on October 15, 2015.
Development Operations
Gross disbursements of development credits and grants
during FY16 YTD were $2,358 million, with Africa and
South Asia together accounting for 83%. The largest
declines in disbursements were in South Asia and Middle
East and North Africa which decreased by $125 million
and $40 million respectively, over the period.

Of the $1,977 million in development credit disbursements,
33% related to commitments made under IDA17, 39%
under IDA16, and 28% related to commitments made
under earlier replenishments.
Of the $381 million in development grants disbursements,
30% related to commitments made under IDA17, 48%
                                                                       (a.Includes adjustments for certain PPA activity)
under IDA16, and 22% related to commitments made
under earlier replenishments.
In June 2015, the Board approved a Policy-based Guarantee for up to $400 million equivalent, to support the
issuance of up to $1.0 billion of long-term debt by a borrowing member country. This guarantee became
effective in October 2015. (See note F in the Financial Statements for more details). This was followed by an
approval by the Board in July 2015 for the same member country of an IDA payment guarantee for $500 million
in conjunction with an IBRD enclave loan guarantee of $200 million. This is the first time an IBRD enclave
instrument has been used in combination with an IDA instrument. It is structured to protect both investors and
lenders against debt service default of principal and interest. These gurantees are expected to attract significant
private sector participation in the project. They were not effective as of November [ ], 2015.
Table 2, shows a reconciliation of the results from operating activities as presented in Table 1, Statement of
Activities, to the reported basis, net income (loss). The reconciling items are presented as either (i) items in the
reported basis results, but not included in the Statement of Activities, or (ii) items included in the Statement of
Activities, but not in the reported basis results. These are further classified as: addressing asymmetries,
adjustments to reflect cash and non-cash operating activities, and adjustments for non-operating activities.

Table 3 represents IDA’s share of administrative expenses, net of other revenue,jointly incurred by IBRD and
IDA. The allocation of expenses between IBRD and IDA is based upon an agreed cost sharing formula. The
decline in FY16 YTD net administrative expenses as compared to FY15 YTD is in line with changes in the cost
sharing ratio between IBRD and IDA over the same period.

Development Credits Outstanding and Accumulated Provision for Debt Relief
and for Losses on Development Credits
Development credits outstanding increased by $253 million during FY16 YTD, primarily due to positive net
disbursements of $1,015 million offset by the $524 million MDRI write-off of credits pertaining to Chad
reaching completion point under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and by negative translation adjustments of $238
million resulting from the 0.2% depreciation of the SDR against the U.S. dollar. The majority of the decrease of
$443 million in the accumulated provision for debt relief and for losses on development credits reflects the
MDRI write-off. All eligible members of the HIPC Debt Initiative in accrual status have now reached their
completion point.
Investment Assets, net of related Liabilities
The net investment portfolio decreased from $28,418 million as of June 30, 2015 to $27,754 million as of
September 30, 2015, a decrease of $664 million. The main driver for the decrease was the net outflow of IDA’s
operating activities as reflected in the Statement of Activities (Table-1), as well as the $40 million negative
impact of exchange rate movements, reflecting the depreciation of the non U.S dollar component currencies of
the SDR against the U.S dollar. See Section IV for variance analysis of operating activities.
Subscriptions and Contributions
The $136 million decrease in subscriptions and contributions paid-in is primarily attributable to the negative
translation adjustment of $212 million which was partially offset by receipts from members of $39 million of
demand notes and $37 million of cash contributions.




8    IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
VI. Financial Risk
IDA is subject to four main types of financial risk: funding risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk.
Funding Risk is managed using the Commitment Authority Framework and monitored, in part, by the funding
position ratio, see Section II, Funding And Resource Allocation and Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
Positions.
Liquidity Risk is managed through a combination of IDA’s daily cash flow monitoring and management, timing
of partner contributions, and prudent investment policies under an established financial framework. A key
indicator of liquidity management is the core liquidity position which reflects the number of months of gross
disbursements (based on the average for a particular year) that can be met out of the core liquidity (comprised of
investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3) available at any point in time, see Section VII, Funding and Liquidity
Positions.
Credit Risk includes two types: Country credit risk and Commercial credit risk.
Country credit risk is managed by the Development Finance Resource Mobilization Department, which regularly
reviews the credit risk of its recipient countries in terms of country’s debt sustaining capacity. These reviews
provide an input into the composition of development credits versus grants for new operations. Reviews are also
performed to determine the adequacy of provisions for losses on credits and other exposures.
Table 5 provides details of the top five borrowers with the largest development credits outstanding as of
September 30, 2015. These borrowers represented 50% of total development credits outstanding as of that date.

Commercial Credit Risk: The monitoring and managing of this risk is a continuous process due to the changing
market enviroment. IDA's commercial counterparty credit risk is concentrated in investments in debt instruments
issued by sovereign governments, agencies, corporate entities and banks, as shown in Table 6. The credit quality
of IDA’s investment portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 82% of the
portfolio rated AA or above, reflecting IDA’s continued preference for highly rated securities and counterparties
across all categories of financial instruments. Total commercial counterparty credit exposure, net of collateral
held, was $31,139 million as of September 30, 2015.

                                   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015                            9
Market Risk: IDA faces foreign exchange risk with respect to its future partner contributions, which it manages
using currency forwards and by rebalancing the currency composition of its investment portfolio, and interest
rate risk on its investment portfolio, which is managed by aligning the duration of the investment portfolio with
that of the projected net cash requirements. The impact of these strategies is reflected on IDA’s Statement of
Income, however, the economic offset is not reported as it relates to future net cash outflows. Further details can
be seen in IDA’s June 30, 2015 MD&A. The analysis below discusses the impact of these activities on IDA’s
Statement of Income and the corresponding economic offset.
Foreign Exchange Risk
IDA conducts its operations in SDR and its component currencies of U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen and pound
sterling. These constitute the functional currencies of IDA, and all other currencies are considered non-functional
currencies. Any translation adjustments due to exchange rate movements against the U.S. dollar for non-
functional currencies and functional currencies, are reflected in the Statement of Income, and in Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income in the Equity section of the Balance Sheet, respectively.
IDA faces foreign exchange rate risk exposure as a result of the currency mismatch between its commitments for
development credits and grants, which are denominated in SDRs; partner contributions, which are typically
denominated in national currencies; and the portion of IDA’s internal resources and expenditures that is
denominated in U.S. dollars and euro.
IDA uses currency forward contracts to convert the majority of partners’ encashments provided in national
currencies into the four currencies of the SDR basket. These transactions are intermediated by IBRD for efficiency
purposes.The payable leg of the currency forward contracts economically hedging partner pledges are
denominated in non-functional currencies. Accordingly, appreciation (depreciation) of these currencies against
the U.S. dollar results in exchange rate losses (gains), which are reported in the Statement of Income.
The translation adjustment on future inflows from partners is the economic offset to the translation adjustment
on non-functional currencies of currency forward contracts. The translation adjustment gain on non-functional
currencies of $234 million in FY16 YTD was due to the depreciation of the non-functional currencies against
the U.S. dollar. This was offset by the effect of foreign exchange movements on the economic offset to the
currency forward contracts, i.e., the future inflows from partners, which was a loss of $278 million in FY16
YTD. In FY15, the translation adjustment gain on non-functional currencies of $389 million in FY15 YTD was
due to the depreciation of majority of the non-functional currencies against the U.S. dollar. This was offset by
the effect of foreign exchange movements on the economic offset to the currency forward contracts, which was a
loss of $479 million in FY15 YTD. The difference between the reported translation adjustments and the effect of
foreign exchange movements on the economic offsets, primarily represent the effect of foreign exchange
movements on the partner contributions in non-functional currencies that are not economically hedged through
forward contracts due to their relatively small contribution amount or the unpredictability of the expected
payment date. These residual partner contributions are hedged using a currency correlation methodology under
the overall currency management framework.
In addition, IDA also mitigates the currency exchange rate risk by aligning the currency composition of its liquid
asset portfolio and the hedges of its non-SDR cash flows with the SDR composition.
Interest Rate Risk
The primary objective in the management of IDA’s investment portfolio is to provide a ready source of liquidity
when needed by IDA to meet projected net cash requirements. Accordingly, IDA’s assets are invested so that
their duration closely matches the duration of these projected net cash requirements. Given IDA’s lengthy
disbursement profile, the duration of IDA’s investment portfolio is therefore relatively long. This long duration,
combined with volatility in market interest rates, results in significant year-on-year variability in unrealized
mark-to-market gains/losses on the portfolio. The economic offset to the unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses
on the investment portfolio would be the change in the present value of the projected net cash outflows.
IDA’s investment portfolio had a duration of approximately three years as of September 30, 2015, and has two
components: core liquidity and partner asset and liability management. During FY16 YTD, the investment
portfolio experienced unrealized mark-to-market gains of $122 million as compared to unrealized mark-to-
market gains of $53 million in FY15 YTD, as a result of the more pronounced tightening of the yield curves for
the major currencies.




10   IDA MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
The non-trading portfolios incurred unrealized mark-to-market gains of $7 million during FY16 YTD,
comprising of unrealized mark-to-market gains of $17 million on investments with IFC, partially offset by
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $10 million on the currency forward contracts. This is compared to
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $91 million in FY15 YTD, comprising unrealized mark-to-market losses of
$56 million on the currency forward contracts, resulting from the more pronounced downward movement of
yield curves of the majority of the payable currencies during FY15 YTD, and unrealized mark-to-market losses
of $35 million on investments with IFC.

VII. Funding and Liquidity Positions
Management monitors IDA’s funding and liquidity positions to assess IDA’s ability to conduct its operations.
Since IDA has not borrowed from the capital markets, even though it is allowed to do so under its Articles of
Agreement, it is important that IDA has sufficient funding resources and liquidity to meet its contractual
obligations to disburse approved development credits and grants in a timely manner.
IDA’s funding position is determined as the total of its investment portfolio and unrestricted demand notes as a
percentage of undisbursed commitments of development credits and development grants payable. Any remaining
funding gap will primarily be covered by future receipts of cash, demand notes already committed by partners,
and repayments on outstanding credits by recipient countries. At all times, IDA enters into new commitments
based on the commitment authority available. See Section II for further details on IDA’s Commitment
Authority.
IDA’s liquidity position is determined as the number of months of average gross disbursements covered by
IDA’s core liquidity, comprised of investment portfolio tranches 2 and 3.
Funding Position                                           Liquidity Position




As of September 30, 2015, the investment portfolio         As of September 30, 2015, IDA’s liquidity position
and unrestricted demand notes covered 68% of all           was sufficient to cover approximately 9 months of
undisbursed commitments of development credits and         average monthly gross disbursements, within the 5
grants as compared to 70% at June 30, 2015. The 68%        year historical range of 9 to 14 months of average
funding position is slightly below the 5 year historical   monthly gross disbursements and above the minimum
range of 70% to 81%. This is due to the relative           requirement of 4 months. The liquidity position as of
reduction in the investment portfolio and unrestricted     September 30, 2014 of 7 months, was an outlier to
demand notes balance as result of the net outflows for     this historical range.
IDA’s operating activities, being greater than the
relative reduction in the undisbursed commitments and
grants balance.


VIII. Senior Management Changes
On November 6, 2015, Bertrand Badre announced that he will be leaving as Managing Director and WBG Chief
Financial Officer at the end of March 2016.

NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2015
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2015 audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management, the
condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IDA’s financial
position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for debt relief and losses on development credits and other
exposures, and valuation of certain financial instruments carried at fair value. The results of operations for the first
three months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full
year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation.
These financial statements were approved for issue on November [ ], 2015 which was also the date through which
IDA’s management evaluated subsequent events.
Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IDA continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of September 30, 2015, IDA believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its
business.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of
the Effective Date. The ASU defers for one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. As a result, for IDA, ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning from the year ending June 30, 2020, with
earlier application permitted as of the quarter ending September 30, 2017.

18 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
NOTE C—INVESTMENTS
The investment securities held by IDA are designated as either trading or non-trading. These securities are carried
and reported at fair value, or at face value which approximates fair value.
During the year ended June 30, 2015, IDA purchased a security which is held in a non-trading portfolio. While IDA
does not plan to sell the security, IDA elected to measure it at fair value, so that all its investment securities would
be measured on the same basis. The changes in fair value for this security are reflected in the Condensed Statement
of Income. For details regarding this transaction, see Note G – Affiliated Organizations.
As of September 30, 2015, the majority of IDA’s Investments comprised government and agency obligations (91%),
with all the instruments being classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, there were no securities transferred between Level 1 and Level
2 within the fair value hierarchy. On June 30, 2015, $3,499 million of investments related to non-U.S government
securities were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. This reclassification was done
based on the annual review of the inputs used to measure fair value.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Where available, quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include
most government and agency securities and futures contracts.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment spreads.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default, and loss severity
are used.
Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value, which approximates fair value, as they
are short term in nature.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and are reported at face value, which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IDA is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IDA limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, credit limits have been established for counterparties by type of
instrument and maturity category.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through a credit approval process, volume limits, monitoring procedures
and the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements. IDA may require collateral in the form of cash or other
approved liquid securities from individual counterparties to mitigate its credit exposure.
IDA has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions, see note E-Derivative Instruments.

The following is a summary of the collateral received by IDA in relation to swap transactions as of September 30,

Securities Lending: IDA may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and ABS.
These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow IDA to
reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. As of September 30, 2015, amounts which could
potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $415 million ($457 million-
June 30, 2015).
Transfers of securities by IDA to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as IDA still retains control over these
securities and therefore the accounting criteria for the treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are
permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase date.
Securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements expose IDA to several risks, including counterparty risk,
reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged). IDA has
procedures in place to ensure that trading activity and balances under these agreements are below predefined
counterparty and maturity limits, and to actively monitor net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily
mark-to-market. Whenever the collateral pledged by IDA related to its borrowings under securities lending
agreements and repurchase agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by returning
cash or pledging additional collateral.
The following is a summary of the carrying amount of the securities transferred under repurchase or securities
lending agreements, and the related liabilities:

In the case of resale agreements, IDA receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to repledge
these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the securities
received are not recorded on IDA’s balance sheet as IDA has not obtained control over these securities and therefore
the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of September 30, 2015, securities purchased
under resale agreements included $396 million of securities which had not settled on that date ($181 million—June
30, 2015). For the remaining purchases, IDA received securities with a fair value of $281 million ($418 million—
June 30, 2015 million). Out of this amount, $27 million of these securities had been transferred under repurchase or
securities lending agreements ($81 million—June 30, 2015).

NOTE D—BORROWINGS
IDA’s borrowings comprise concessional partner loans. These borrowings are unsecured and unsubordinated fixed
rate debt in SDR component currencies. IDA may prepay some or the entire outstanding amounts without penalty.
These borrowings are carried and reported at amortized cost.
As of September 30, 2015, IDA’s borrowings outstanding were $2,152 million. These borrowings have original
maturities of 25 and 40 years, with the final maturity being 2054. This does not include the effect of the amounts
relating to proceeds received under the grant component of the concessional partner loan agreements, for which
voting rights have been provided and are reflected in equity.

As September 30, 2015, IDA’s borrowings were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
The fair value of IDA’s borrowings is calculated using a discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and proxy funding spreads.

Under its derivative agreement with IBRD, IDA is not required to post collateral as long as it maintains liquidity
holdings at pre-determined levels that are a proxy for a AAA credit rating. As of September 30, 2015, IDA had not
posted any collateral with IBRD in accordance with the agreement.

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IDA enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IDA the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.

The following tables summarize information on derivative assets and liabilities (before and after netting
adjustments) that are reflected on IDA’s Condensed Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015.
Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements. The net derivative asset positions have been further reduced by the
cash and securities collateral received.

Inter-level transfers
During the periods ended September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, there were no inter-level transfers in the
derivatives portfolio.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBA securities, swaptions, exchange traded options and
future contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. These are valued using the standard discounted cash flow
methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates and basis spreads and funding
spreads.

NOTE F—DEVELOPMENT CREDITS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
Development credits and other exposures are generally made directly to member countries of IDA. Other exposures
include irrevocable commitments, guarantees and repaying project preparation facilities.
Development credits are carried and reported at amortized cost. Of the total development credits outstanding as of
September 30, 2015, 90% were to the South Asia, Africa, and East Asia and Pacific regions combined.
Based on IDA’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of the development credits outstanding are in the
Medium and High risk classes.
As of September 30, 2015, development credits outstanding totaling $2,548 million (representing about 2% of the
portfolio) from five borrowers, were in nonaccrual status. 




32 IDA CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
Credit Quality of Sovereign Development Credits

Based on an evaluation of IDA’s development credits, management has determined that IDA has one portfolio
segment — Sovereign Exposures. Development credits constitute the majority of sovereign exposures.
IDA’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IDA on time and in
full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative factors. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IDA’s exposures,
exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status.
IDA’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provisions for development credit losses.
IDA considers a development credit to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, service,
interest or other charges due to IDA, on the dates provided in the contractual development credit agreements.
The following tables provide an aging analysis of development credits outstanding as of September 30, 2015 and
June 30, 2015:

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Development Credits, Debt Relief (HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI)
and Other Exposures
Provision for Losses on Development Credits and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provision for losses, which reflects the probable losses
inherent in IDA’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of losses arising from default and nonpayment of
principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Management reassesses the adequacy of the accumulated
provision and the reasonableness of the inputs used, on a periodic basis, at least annually, and adjustments are
recorded as a charge against or addition to revenue.

Provision for Debt Relief
HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI provisions are based on quantitative and qualitative analyses of various factors,
including estimates of Decision Point and Completion Point dates. These factors are reviewed periodically as part of
the reassessment of the adequacy of the accumulated provision for debt relief. Provisions are released as qualifying
debt service becomes due and is forgiven under the HIPC Debt Initiative, and are reduced by the amount of the
eligible development credits written off when the country reaches Completion Point, and becomes eligible for
MDRI debt relief.
Changes to the accumulated provision for losses on development credits and other exposures, as well as the debt
relief under HIPC Debt Initiative and MDRI for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2015 are summarized below:

During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, no development credits were placed
into nonaccrual status.
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, service charge revenue recognized on development credits in
nonaccrual status was less than $1 million (less than $1 million—September 30, 2014).
Guarantees
Guarantees of $440 million were outstanding at September 30, 2015 ($411 million—June 30, 2015). This amount
represents the maximum potential undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under these
guarantees, and is not included on the Condensed Balance Sheet. The guarantees issued by IDA have original
maturities ranging between 9 and 23 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2035.
As of September 30, 2015, liabilities related to IDA’s obligations under guarantees of $36 million ($33 million—
June 30, 2015), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the
accumulated provision for guarantee losses of $6 million ($6 million—June 30, 2015).
During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, no guarantees provided by IDA were
called.
Subsequent event:
On October 14, 2015 a new financial guarantee issued by IDA became effective. The maximum potential
undiscounted future payments that IDA could be required to make under this guarantee is $400 million. The
guarantee has an original maturity of 15 years, and expires in 2030. Given that this guarantee became effective
subsequent to September 30, 2015, liabilities related to IDA’s obligation under guarantees as of September 30, 2015,
do not reflect $46 million of amounts related to this guarantee, of which $10 million was charged to the statement of
income in the period this guarantee became effective.

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of its operations, Management has determined that IDA has only one reportable segment.
Charge revenue comprises service charges and interest charges on outstanding development credit balances and
guarantee fee revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, charge revenue from 2 countries of $52
million and $34 million, respectively, was in excess of ten percent of total charge revenue.
The following table presents IDA’s development credits outstanding and associated charge revenue as of and for the
three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, by geographic region:

Valuation Methods and Assumptions

The fair value of development credits is calculated using market-based methodologies which incorporate the
respective borrowers’ Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads and, where applicable, proxy CDS spreads. Basis
adjustments are applied to market recovery levels to reflect IDA’s recovery experience.

NOTE I—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, along with IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, sponsor a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan and Trust, a Retired Staff Benefits Plan and Trust and a PEBP that cover substantially all of their
staff members.
While IDA is not a participating entity to these benefit plans, IDA shares in the costs and reimburses IBRD for its
proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD, as part of IBRD’s allocation of staff and
associated administrative expenses to IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio.
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, IDA’s share of IBRD’s benefit costs relating to all the three
plans totaled $57 million (three months ended September 30, 2014—$68 million).
The cost of any potential future liability arising from these plans would be shared by IBRD and IDA using the
applicable share ratio.
