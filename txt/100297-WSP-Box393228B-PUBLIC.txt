     Education
     Key priority areas for ICTs in the education sector include professional development for teachers, digital learning resources,
     affordable technologies, Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) and National Research Education Networks
     (NRENs).

     Governance
     Advances in ICTs have created opportunities for improved participation and are being exploited to improve governance.
     ICTs have strengthened partnerships between institutions such as parliaments, media and civil society organizations through
     interactive platforms or fora that support information sharing and collaboration. Systems that allow citizens to report graft
     or misuse of public funds have contributed to the fight against corruption and have created better mechanisms for ensuring
     government accountability of public resources and transparency in the delivery of services.

                                                    Akvo FLOW – Africa, Asia, Latin America

     FLOW is an open source mapping software used for data collection and monitoring of the functionality of water
     access points.19 It was developed by Water for People (WfP) and in 2012 Akvo Foundation took over and continued
     development of FLOW. The software runs on Android platforms (smartphone), and allows users to take GPS
     coordinates, fill out text, take pictures and videos, and fill out questionnaires. This information is then translated to
     Google Earth data and plotted on online maps. FLOW can be used in areas where there is no Internet connectivity.
     However, when there is internet connectivity, the software automatically transmits the data to the central database
     and uploads it to Google Earth.20


     WfP implemented FLOW in a number of countries and thousands of water points were included in the database.21
     The countries include Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Congo, India, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Guatemala,
     Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Liberia, Nepal, Burkina Faso and Mozambique.22
     In Liberia, the use of FLOW achieved the following results:
         •	   Over 10,000 water points mapped in less than
              6 months in 2011.
         •	   A national WASH sector investment plan
              (USD400 million from 2012 to 2017) identified.


     Lessons learnt from the data collection phase
     included:23
         •	   Absence of good road infrastructure led to extra
              costs for transportation of mapping teams.
         •	   The lack of electricity made it necessary to
              purchase external battery adapters for the
              FLOW devices.
         •	   Absence of mobile phone network coverage
              and high costs of mobile data transfer made it
              necessary to use physical data collection.
                                                                                Source: http://flow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/docs/dashboard/6-maps.

     Another recent 2013 study25 analysed the use of mobile-                                      experienced paper based data recorders”. In their mobile-to-

                                                        NFC Phones for Water Purification Tracking – Haiti
          Near-Field Communication (NFC) phones with Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is an application that supports
          the monitoring of water purification in Haiti. Programmed NFC phones are used by Haitian water technicians to
          support the tracking of chlorine levels in thousands of households through RFID tags on the drinking water buckets
          in homes.

          The NFC tags augment an existing socio-technical system for providing clean water to households throughout Haiti.
          Community Health Workers (CHWs) visit households approximately once per month and conduct a test for residual
          chlorine in stored water. Prior to the NFC and SMS-based questionnaires, paper-based forms were used and it was
          difficult to establish a regular electronic data entry program. As the CHWs were often in the field for long periods
          of time, the data entry was delayed to the point of rendering the data irrelevant. Use of NFC phones facilitated the
          real-time submission of data.

          Haiti had difficulty supplying clean drinking water to more than 9.7 million inhabitants, a situation was compounded
          by devastating earthquakes and a cholera outbreak in 2010, which claimed thousands of lives.26,27 The mountainous
          terrain coupled with poor transportation and communications networks made it challenging to supply clean drinking
          water. Without regular household visits, the population reverted to drinking unclean water, which resulted in cholera
          outbreaks and other diarrhoeal infections.28

          The project was a collaboration between an industrial research lab (Nokia Research Center, Palo Alto), the Public
          Health School of University of Carolina Berkeley, and Deep Springs International (DSI), a non-profit organization in
          Haiti.29 Through NFC and SMS-based questionnaires, technicians spend less time collecting data and more time
          visiting houses, ensuring that more households have clean water.30 Over 35,000 families in Haiti were reached and
          incidences of diarrhoea among users were reduced by about 50 percent.31

          In post-disaster environments left with a fragile or non-existent infrastructure, NFC technology was a fast and
          cost-effective way of improving water supply and maintenance.32 However, the project faced challenges linked to
          sustainability and scaling up, including:
              •	 High costs of battery charging.
              •	 Inability to find additional low-end NFC phones.
              •	 Resource constraints.
              •	 Lack of a centralized accounting scheme.

     Theme 2: Sustaining ICT-Based Planning and Programming Initiatives

                                                              Rural Sanitation Monitoring System– Indonesia35

          In 2009, with the support of the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), the Ministry of Health conducted
          a pilot study to monitor rural sanitation in two districts in East Java using a mobile phone short message service
          (SMS) text-monitoring (mobile monitoring) system. Information on the community’s progress towards becoming
          open defecation free (ODF) and changes in households’ access to improved sanitation was collected and sent via
          SMS and stored in a district-level database.
          Based on the success of the pilot, in 2012 the mobile monitoring system was rolled out to all 119 districts and cities
          in five of the country’s provinces, covering approximately 36 million households and 123 million individuals. The
          current rollout plan aims to reach all 500 districts in 34 provinces in the country by December 2015.
          As of August 2014:
               •	 3,787 of the 10,559 health center sanitarians in the country had sent village sanitation data via SMS.
               •	 800 to 1,000 messages per month were received by the central server.
               •	 50,850 messages with data were collected.
               •	 Data for 20 provinces, including 40,470 villages and 42.9 million households, had been uploaded into the
                   mobile monitoring system

          Key lessons learnt:
             •	 A structured approached, which allows for adjustments and improvements, is needed in order for real-time
                  village data mobile monitoring to scale up.
                •	    A national harmonized approached to rural sanitation, with sector-wide objectives and monitoring framework,
                      is necessary for scaling up data collection.
                •	    It is possible to increase the use of the monitoring tool as a programming tool by establishing feedback
                      loops, additional data management tools and communication channels to reach target users.
                •	    To increase the use of the monitoring system as a management tool for programming, feedback loop, a larger
                      set of customized data information tools, and channels to reach specific target users could be explored.

          NextDrop leverages the recent proliferation of mobile phones in India to provide households with accurate and
          timely information about local piped water delivery, while also enabling water utilities to access real-time information
          about the status of their distribution system. NextDrop sources this information from water consumers who send
          SMS notifications when water begins flowing in their area, NextDrop in turn notifies residents in the same locality
          of the current delivery of water.43 The project is built on the idea of collecting and sharing data as well as engaging
          communities to advocate for more equitable distribution. NextDrop’s Live Valve Map system displays the status
          of water delivery in every part of the city. The customized dashboard helps the local utility to manage staff and
          infrastructure. Engineers monitor progress on an internal dashboard, which provides information on valve activity,
          potential diversions due to power and infrastructure issues.
          NextDrop was launched in July 2010, with the first pilot project recruiting over 180 families in five valve areas to
          provide information and receive free updates in Hubli-Dharwad, Karnataka State, India.44 The application provided
          messages to households every week about the status An example of an SMS from NextDrop sent to a citizen48
          of water supply and the reasons for non-supply. The
          immediate positive development was that people living
          in remote areas no longer had to spend between 20
          to 40 hours per month waiting for water.45 The socio-
          economic challenge of having to take a day off work
          to wait for water was also reduced. NextDrop currently
          serves over 75,000 citizens in the twin cities of Hubli-
          Dharwad (with a population of one million46) and is
          working with utility services in Bangalore to provide
          water management tools to their engineers. In future, it
          aims to serve all citizens in Hubli-Dharwad, and scale
          up to the whole of Bangalore47.

Unlocking the Potential of Information Communications Technology to Improve Water and Sanitation Services | Landscape Analysis and Findings of the Study




                                                                         SLB Connect– India52

     The SLB Connect project was initiated in early 2012 by the Water and Sanitation Program in consultation with the
     Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD). Implementation was done in PimpriChinchwad in partnership with the
     PimpriChinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). There is growing recognition in India of the need to engage citizens
     in setting service delivery standards and monitoring performance. The aim of the tool was to provide a model for
     collecting citizens’ feedback and integrate the same into the workflow of respective government agencies.
     Feedback from citizens is obtained not only on satisfaction levels, but also on customer’s experience of services.
     The feedback from citizens is compiled in a scorecard and made available to interested stakeholders who can
     measure the quality of services provided.

     SLB Connect has four major components:
        1.	 Conducting a mobile-based survey of sample households on service aspects.
        2.	 Real-time monitoring of survey quality and timelines using an online survey management module.
        3.	 Real-time analysis of survey results using a web-based Dashboard and data analysis tools.
        4.	 Supporting the Urban Local Body (ULB) to design appropriate reform and response processes based on
            the findings from the survey.

     The implementation of SLB Connect in
     PimpriChinchwad demonstrated a model
     that is socially sustainable (relies on voluntary
     feedback       from     citizens),   institutionally
     compatible (embedding processes within
     existing institutional structures), and financially
     viable (leveraging mobile technology for faster
     and cost-effective iterations).

     Going forward, SLB Connect aims to:
        •	 Replicate the citizen feedback exercise
             across multiple cities.
        •	 Integrate        with     state/national
             investment programs in water
             supply and sanitation for improved
             tracking of service outcomes.

 SIASAR, the Rural Water and Sanitation Information System, was designed to monitor the development and
 performance of rural water supply and sanitation services in participating Latin American countries. In addition to
 addressing the needs of stakeholders for updated, complete and trustworthy data, it is also helping countries identify
 needs, guide sector policies, and enables the continuous knowledge exchange between platform participants. It
 operates on an interactive web platform adapted for Android cell phones and tablets. It is an ICT-based information
 system that collects, synthesizes and analyzes data on rural water service delivery, measuring four basic
 dimensions of service provision: (i) access to services (ii) quality of services (iii) performance of service providers
 and (iv) the effectiveness of technical
 assistance. Data collected is verified
 and automatically processed before
 performance rankings are published,
 “grading” each of the four dimensions
 from A (very good) to D (poor). One
 of the major aims of the SIASAR
 initiative is to build the capacity of
 local technical staff to plan, monitor
 and manage rural WSS.            These
 rankings help officials to prioritize
 needs, leading to higher standards
 in terms of coverage, quality and
 sustainability.

     One of the most common PPP ICT4WASH initiatives to date has been the introduction of mobile water payments.
     Mobile water payment platforms offer mutual benefits to water service providers, mobile network providers and
     consumers and have the potential to support African utilities to escape the vicious cycle of low cost recovery and
     poor operational performance71.
     “Mobile money is an electronic payment system that enables money transfers to and from an electronic account that
     can be accessed via an ordinary mobile phone. Each customer’s account is linked to their mobile phone number
     by means of an in-built SIM-card application. Physical cash withdrawals and deposits are facilitated by a network
     of retail agents. While configurations vary across providers, the viability of mobile money is premised upon the

                 Invest in devices that have the capacity of using alternate energy sources
                 Allow for tools and data to create value for the tool amongst stakeholders and allow consumers to
                 agitate for improvements
                 Allow for offline modes to combat poor connectivity
                 Allow for transparency to combat corruption

                       	 NGOs and CBOs to build trust and market initiatives at the community level
                       	 The media to facilitate dissemination of information
                       	 Technical partners/private sector for technical and financial support


       3.	Customer

                 Develop an outreach plan (for both design and implementation stages) and ensure dedicated funding
                 Include a response mechanism to inform the customer that action is being taken by the service provider
                 Ensure responsiveness to generated reports to build trust among users, value among stakeholders and
                 encourage uptake
                 Include complaints management component
                 Ensure privacy of data and anonymity
                 Enable feedback loops to allow for continual refinement
                 Build a user community through system development and implementation to promote the sharing of
                 experiences and to create a support network
