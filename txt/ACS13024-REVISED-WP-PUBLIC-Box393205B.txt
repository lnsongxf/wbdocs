I.      Motivation: Why should we care about care?

1.       Attainment of greater longevity by many European societies implies a longer period of multi-
generational coexistence. The combined forces of lower fertility and higher life expectancy drive
population aging in European societies. The increase in longevity implies more years of shared living
between generations. This phenomenon provides an opportunity for people of different generations to
interact with and learn from each other, but it also presupposes a rising importance of multi-generational
bonds in the provision of social support and care for the old and the young (Bengston 2001; Hank 2007;
Brandt et al. 2009).

2.      The exchange of social and economic support between the generations is important from both
micro and macro perspectives. Within the family, parents generally support their children not only while
they grow up but also when they have become independent and left the parental home, whereas grown-up
children often support their parents when they have become disabled and need help. Within the welfare
system, those of working age provide the economic resources both for the young, in terms of family support
and schooling, and for the old, in terms of pension and health care financing. This may be conceptualized
not only as redistribution among age groups, but it also refers to the succession of generations. Today’s
children will provide for the welfare of their parents’ generation when the latter has become old, and in
exchange, their parents will provide care for their grandchildren (Hank and Buber 2009; Silverstein et al.
2006; Grundy and Henretta 2006).

3.       The demand for informal elder care in most countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia
(ECA) is expected to increase due to larger older cohorts and longer periods of care needs. As the age
profile of many ECA countries changes from the traditional pyramid to a ‘mushroom’ with a distinct bulge
at older ages, there will be more people in each of the older age groups who may require some help with
activities of daily living. As can be observed in the projections of care demand in Figure 1a, the number of
adults with limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) per adult who is healthy (that is, without ADL
limitations) is projected to rise significantly from 2010 to 2060. Combined with a slightly decreasing trend
in the demand for childcare (based purely on the United Nations [UN] demographic projections for children
aged 0 to 5 years), Figure 1b demonstrates that the increase in the aggregate demand for care in an average
ECA country stems largely from the increase in moderate rather than severe disability. This implies a rising
demand for informal care, as the existing systems of formal care provision, which are largely focused on
health care for the severely disabled, will see less of an increase in its already oversubscribed capacity. In
most countries, the formal long-term care system for elderly with severe ADL limitations are already
experiencing excess demand, resulting in queuing and inefficient use of hospital stays for long-term care
needs among individuals that do not require such intensive and intrusive care and could be cared for either
in a special eldercare facility (non-medical), or at home, given adequate support. In addition, if growth in
life expectancy outpaces growth in health outcomes, individuals may spend more years of life in frail health
and may need longer spans of non-medical support with daily activities, such as shopping, housekeeping,
food preparation, and/or handling medications and finances, even if they do not require specialized medical
help.1 Such formal help systems do not exist in the majority of ECA countries, where the next of kin of the

 This includes elderly experiencing age-related mental health and emotional well-being problems, such as dementia,
Alzheimer’s disease, and other type of disorders affecting memory, thinking, behavior and ability to perform
everyday activities (WHO 2013).

                                                                                                                7
elderly largely absorbs the responsibility. Thus, without any policy adjustment, we can expect to see
increasing demand for informal care, especially in some of the ECA countries where the age pyramid
dynamics combine with a high rate of disability in certain age groups, such as countries in the Western
Balkans (Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic [FYR] of Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) as well
as Armenia and Slovakia (Figure 1c).

4.       The extent to which eldercare and childcare needs are met by formal providers is shaped by
normative, institutional, and labor market factors. Caregiving decisions are affected by normative views
about filial obligations and intergenerational solidarity (Finley 1988; Gans and Silverstein 2006).
Preferences for informal care and at-home care shape the potential expansion of formal care services and
increased expenditure on such services.2 The success of policy initiatives in maintaining or enhancing the
supply of formal care requires an understanding of the determinants of the use of such care. Institutional
factors, such as the availability, accessibility, affordability, and quality of alternative care services to the
informal care provided at home factor into families’ decision making around the use of one type of care
over the other. Moreover, the weights assigned to different objectives fulfilled by formal care systems —
such as ensuring educational readiness of children, health and dignity of elders, and/or promoting women’s
labor force participation—can affect the shape of resulting care institutions. In many countries across ECA,
the supply of appropriate care services remains thin, often outstripping demand (as will be discussed below).
Finally, household composition and income-earning opportunities for household members figure into
families’ decisions about the use of formal care services. Household members with limited earning potential
may add to their current labor market participation earnings disincentives, the care needs their households
have, and prefer not to invest in formal care provision, especially if the cost of these providers becomes
prohibitive compared to their expected labor income. These factors in combination result in a low use of
formal care providers in the region, as households rely heavily on informal care providers instead.

5.        The demand for childcare services for children aged 0–5 years will remain significant as
countries aim to reverse fertility declines and encourage higher female labor force participation and
productivity. Although pure demographic projections (such Figure 1a) suggest the shift in the structure of
care demand from children to the elderly, in reality pressure will continue to build for the provision of
accessible, affordable, and quality childcare services. This can be explained by several factors. First, there
is the existing unfulfilled demand for these services in many ECA countries (for example, the Russian
Federation) caused, at least in part, by relative neglect of these institutions during the fertility decline of the
1990s transition period. Second, there is mounting evidence that increases in fertility in aging European
societies can be achieved only by providing women with a favorable environment for combining work and
motherhood (Luci-Greulich and Thevenon 2013). Thus, the availability of accessible, affordable, and
quality childcare options are an essential ingredient of successful pro-natalist policy design both in terms
of their push for women to have more children and to start the process earlier than what the trend has been
to date. In addition, to sustain economic growth in the context of aging, even without a push for increased
fertility, aging societies need to invest in the skills of their young population, which starts with early
childhood education replacing or at least complementing informal provision of childcare.

    And of home care as a potential intermediate arrangement (see for example, Tarricone and Tsouros 2008).

                                                                                                                 8
6.       Care recipients’ preferences and fiscal sustainability analyses tend to align in favor of
informal care provision. There is a vast literature demonstrating the relationship between informal support
and the economic, physical, psychological and social well-being, and social status of the recipients of this
support (Albertini 2014). Children benefit from their parents’ care starting before their birth and well
beyond their entry into adulthood: the quantity and quality of parental support is correlated with educational
opportunities and labor market outcomes, as well as such correlates of well-being as access to housing and
credit and geographical mobility. Moreover, through provision of informal grandparental childcare, parents
can enable their children to remain in the labor market, which can also affect children’s fertility decisions.
For the elderly, receiving informal support enables healthier and more active aging, lower risk of social
isolation, and delayed entry into institutionalized care facilities (Albertini 2014). Informal support from
children is also necessary to connect frail parents to appropriate formal care services (Choi 1994; Litwin
1997). It is thus not surprising that across different country contexts, the majority of elderly prefer receiving
care in their homes or in community-based settings (Colombo et al. 2011; Keenan 2010). At the same time,
the realization of the potential impact of population aging on the fiscal sustainability of health care and
Long-Term Care (LTC) systems has resulted in a shift away from reliance on expensive institutionalized
care and toward more decentralized, privately provided care. In most developing countries, where formal
care systems for the elderly are still exclusively focused on institutionalized care, these preferences of care
recipients and policy trends translate into a greater demand for informal, mostly family-provided care.

7.       There is relatively scarce recognition of the tradeoffs and risks faced by providers of informal
care. The importance of ensuring that elders can live their lives in dignity and that children are in an
environment conducive to development should not be underestimated. Yet, the second imperative to care
about care—the well-being of caregivers—has been largely overlooked in the economics literature and in
policy discussions on the relative effectiveness of various eldercare and childcare models, including those
regarding early childhood education and care and long-term care. Indeed, Albertini (2014) finds relatively
little comparative research about the effects of caregiving on the well-being and life chances of caregivers.
He emphasizes the importance of adopting the ‘donor’s perspective’ in analyzing the consequences of
intergenerational support, especially as “help with personal care and household chores is time-consuming,
physically demanding and, most importantly, usually is highly needed at a point of the donor’s life course
in which her working and career maturity is at its peak” (Albertini 2014). The current paper aims to fill this
important gap in the literature and to assess the state of policy discussion on care systems from the
perspective of caregiver well-being.

8.       Within families, the burden of increasing informal and at-home care falls disproportionately
on women of all ages. Similar normative and household factors that shape the balance between formal and
informal care provision also affect the gender division of care duties within families. It is well documented
that childcare duties fall disproportionately on women in all of the ECA countries as well as in the rest of
the world. For the case of eldercare, while filial obligation on the part of the child might rest equally on
daughters and sons, those more likely to act upon it are daughters and daughters-in-law. In an expanded
generational view, as mothers are expected to be the main childcare provider, grandmothers are often
expected to provide care for grandchildren when mothers need support. Ciani (2012) suggests that the
selection and decision on who is to provide informal care to the elderly is often made before the need arises.
For example, children who opt for geographical proximity to parents before they retire might be opting in
for eldercare and deciding to forgo better labor opportunities that will require moving further from them.3
Patterns of elderly relocation (Litwak and Longino 1987; Speare et al. 1991; Smits et al. 2010) also suggest
that emerging care needs are one of the factors for relocating closer to those who can provide informal care
or to cohabitation with an adult child, particularly in the absence of public provision of home care or long-
term care options (Pezzin et al. 1996). Finally, women’s higher life expectancy, as well as their oftentimes
lower labor market attachment and earning potential (partly as a result of their childcare role), frequently
results in their higher propensity to become caregivers at one point or another in the life cycle.

9.      The burden of eldercare and childcare responsibilities can have serious negative
repercussions on women’s economic outcomes, leading to increased vulnerability and exacerbating
gender-based inequalities. As women spend more time engaging in unpaid, informal care work, they have
less time to work in the market. Studies looking at the relationship between caregiving and labor market
outcomes show negative impacts both on the extensive and intensive margins and reduced human capital
accumulation (Becker 1985; Behrman and Wolfe 1984; Ribar 1995; Jaumotte 2003). There is also evidence
that caregivers receive lower wages, further discouraging labor force participation (Correll et al. 2007;
Carmichael and Charles 1998, 2003; Heitmueller and Inglis 2007). Together, these may contribute to
reduced lifetime earnings for caregivers, leading to a disadvantageous position in terms of financial status,
lower pension accumulation, and long-term economic vulnerability.

10.      Yet, if care demands are addressed by appropriate policy interventions, there is an
opportunity to increase labor force participation and productivity, especially for women, goals which
are vital for sustainable development in aging countries. The rising demand for care services provides
an opportunity to develop a formal care industry, which can contribute to the active aging objective by
recruiting younger old to care for older old, as well as increase female labor force participation, in particular
for women with low skills. This is critical, as the reduction in the size of the working age population in
aging societies will require more individuals to enter the labor force, particularly in developing countries.
As productive and reproductive years overlap for women, and single women and those without children
already exhibit a labor force participation rate comparable with their male counterparts, support for working
mothers (and fathers) needs to be provided to prevent women to drop out of the labor force due to childcare
demands. This target cannot be attained without improved care services that not only free women to take
part in paid work but also ensure adequate human capital investment in the young generations.

  Rainer and Siedler (2010) look at siblings in the United States and find these results. Stern (1995) suggests that
family members make the decision about long-term care well in advance of the need.

11.      We examine the provision of childcare and eldercare in ECA countries and suggest policy
priorities that address these risks, maximizing the potential of aging societies. An aging society obliges
households to juggle multiple imperatives: to have more children, participate longer in the labor force,
increase savings, and provide care of the rising ranks of the elderly. This paper examines how households
in Western Europe and ECA currently fare on fulfilling these roles and how policies can assist households
in attaining healthy, active, and prosperous lives for themselves and the people they care for. Specifically,
the paper assesses the normative, institutional, and household-level factors shaping the balance between
formal and informal care provision, the characteristics of informal caregivers, and the relationship between
caregiving and labor market outcomes. The paper draws on several sources of information as the evidence
base—from quantitative surveys, including the Generations and Gender Survey (GGS), Time Use Surveys,
the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), to a new mixed-methods dataset (see
Table 1 for a summary of data sources by ECA countries, Box 1 for detailed information on the independent
mixed-methods dataset, and Annex on Major Data Sources for additional details). The paper is structured
as follows: Section II addresses the split between formal and informal childcare and eldercare provision in
ECA. Section III focuses on informal care, discussing how women at different stages of life provide
childcare and eldercare. Section IV focuses on the challenges that caregiving demands pose in terms of
labor market outcomes and consequent economic well-being. Section V concludes the paper by examining
what we know in terms of policies that can support families in informal care provision in a sustainable and
incentive-compatible manner.

Box 1: A new, independent mixed-methods dataset on care, aging, and gender

To better understand the context of childcare and eldercare provision in the region, a survey on the distribution of
formal and informal care was designed and implemented in seven ECA countries. The field work was divided broadly
into two components: (a) a demand assessment, which investigated the care needs and preferences of families with
children and/or elders and (b) a supply assessment of available care services, with a focus on their quality, accessibility,
and affordability.

The demand assessment targeted households with children and/or elders and included an investigation of time use,
care needs, perceptions, and preferences about care responsibilities, as well as barriers in access to formal child or
elder care services. Whenever possible, it followed the dynamics of care demand and supply at the household level,
with women and their labor force engagement at the center. This assessment included quantitative individual-level
questionnaires as well as qualitative focus group discussions.

The supply assessment investigated the types of child and eldercare services available to households, both public and
private, and explored their quality, cost, and accessibility, as well as the social perception and normative views around
care and the use of the different available alternatives. This included site visits, mixed-methods interviews, and, when
appropriate, quantitative observational checklists.

Both demand and supply assessments were conducted in each of seven countries: Ukraine, the Kyrgyz Republic,
Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, and Serbia. In each country except Bosnia and
Herzegovina, we chose three sites: a rural community, a small city, and a middle-class neighborhood in the largest
urban center of the country. Due to its unique political structure, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we selected four sites—
two urban and two small cities— to maintain balance across the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika
Srpska.

For the demand assessment, individual interviews were conducted with 734 individuals, all of whom were invited to
one of the 66 focus group discussions. These participants were one-third male and two-thirds female, between 25 and
65 years of age, who had different levels of engagement in the labor market (employed, unemployed, and inactive).

The supply assessment was a census-type study of all care services available in the sites we targeted for the demand
assessment. Overall, 156 childcare facilities, 33 eldercare facilities, and 21 care intermediaries were interviewed and
assessed.

II.      How is care organized in ECA? Formal and informal supply


12.      The organization of care—for children or elderly—is closely linked to three interrelated
factors: household-level capacity to provide care, social norms about the distribution of
responsibilities, and the extent of available services and support structures. Informal care in this study
refers to unpaid and generally unregulated care, usually provided by family members, whereas formal care
is defined as care that is paid and is thus regulated by some type of a contractual arrangement (see Table
2). In most countries, formal care tends to emerge as a response to support families in their caregiving role
when that role cannot be fulfilled within the family. An interaction between prevailing social norms and
institutional environment determines each society’s reliance on particular modalities of formal support for
caregiving, such as leave arrangements, financial support, and in-kind services.

13.     The particular mixes of formal care policies and households’ caregiving decisions in the
context of these policies can, in turn, generate different ‘care regimes’ that exhibit varying prevalence
of formal and informal care provision. Work by Kraus et al. (2010) classifies 14 European Union (EU)

                                                                                                                      15
countries according to use and financing of care (Table 3). Indicators for this classification include income
and needs-corrected spending, share of private expenditures, formal care use, role of informal care, support
for informal caregivers, accessibility, targeting, and importance of cash benefits. They find a variety of care
systems that provide a range of levels of support to informal care providers. These care regimes also differ
in the extent to which formal care substitutes for or complements family-provided care. For instance, Bettio
and Plantenga (2004) classified Mediterranean countries, such as Italy, Greece, and Spain, in a cluster with
high reliance on informal care for both children and elderly and underdevelopment of any formal care
support policies. At the other extreme, in Nordic countries, families play a modest role in care provision,
given the broad range of publicly provided care services for the youngest and oldest members of society.
In between the two ends of the spectrum, formal care support in the U.K.-Netherlands regime is limited to
the elderly, while that for children is considered to be the natural domain of the family; in the Austria-
Germany cluster, informal care by the family is financially subsidized by the state; and in the Belgium-
France cluster, formal care policies focus on services and financial support rather than leave arrangements,
resulting in greater reliance on formal rather than informal care. The aim of this section is to identify the
prevailing care regimes in ECA and to discuss the forces that determine the shape of these care regimes.

14.      The interaction of formal and informal care is a widely acknowledged feature of the childcare
part of the care regime. Societies provide different types of formal support to households for them to
better decide how to allocate household’s members’ time between care and work. The type of support
available varies, with some countries supporting family-provided care and others providing options that
substitute family care with center-based care. There is a widespread recognition that access to formal
affordable and quality childcare—mostly center-based—allows informal care providers to reallocate their
time to other activities, largely paid employment (Gornick and Meyers 2004; Esping-Andersen 2009),
enabling them to accumulate valuable labor market experience, attain economic independence through
income generation, as well as achieve future income security through pension contributions.

15.      The links between formal and informal eldercare are complex and may depend on the
intensity of recipients’ care needs. Formal caregiving can compensate, substitute, complement, or
reinforce informal caregiving by family members (Chappell and Blandford 1991; Denton 1997; Van
Houtven and Norton 2004). Different ‘care regimes’ play a role in the distribution of care tasks between
formal and informal provision. In the same vein, families do not give up providing care when formal care
is available. However, while childcare is likely to complement informal care and alleviate some of the
informal caregivers’ burden, this link is not as direct when it comes to eldercare, as the degree of
substitutability of the two types of care depends on the extent of the care recipient’s needs (Bonsang 2009).
Whereas recipients with low levels of disability may be cared for either formally or informally, as the level
of disability rises, the resources (in terms of time, knowledge, and money) of informal care providers may
become insufficient; in this case, informal care turns from a substitute to a complement to the available
formal care. This interaction suggests a ‘task-specific model’ where formal and informal care are
complements focusing on different tasks, with informal care satisfying recipients’ basic care needs (such
as bathing and feeding), while formal care focuses on tasks that require specialized knowledge (such as
health monitoring and physical therapy maintenance). However, even as care needs of the elderly increase,
the decision to use formal care remains dependent on the actual and perceived accessibility, quality, and
affordability of formal care, as well as on the social norms surrounding care obligations.

16.      The confluence of multiple factors results in a higher prevalence of informal childcare in
ECA, compared to their Western European benchmarks. A combination of service availability and
intra-household decision-making processes underlies the relatively low utilization of formal care services
in the ECA region. As one proxy for formal childcare, pre-primary school enrolment shows large variation
across countries (Figure 2). Young countries in Central Asia and Turkey, independent of income levels,
still exhibit low levels of coverage, while aging countries have a much higher participation of children in
early education, although all but three (Ukraine, Belarus, and the Czech Republic) have enrollment rates
below the EU average. As Figure 3 shows, utilization of formal care also varies by child’s age, with children
over the age of 3 years being more likely to be in formal care than younger children. Indeed, on average,
63 percent of children in the EU (28 countries) under the age of 3 years receive only parental care (going
as high as 95 percent in Bulgaria). Other surveys specifically looking at intra-household care arrangements
such as the GGS demonstrate that households with young children are more likely to use some form of
informal care—unpaid care by a family member, friend, or another person—to complement parental care
compared to using formal/institutional care (Figure 4). Interestingly, the split between unpaid care and
formal institutional childcare is high even in EU-13 countries as well as Eastern Partnership countries,
suggesting that the two forms of care might be used as complements in these sub regions.

17.      In ECA, utilization of any care arrangements is much lower for elders than for children; and
most eldercare remains informal. Compared to data on childcare, data on eldercare arrangements is much
more sparse and difficult to interpret. SHARE provides some suggestive evidence on the topic of utilization
of different forms of eldercare. In all the countries included in the study, less than a quarter of older (50+
years) adults with self-reported limitations in activities of daily living received any help with personal care
(Figure 5). Of the ones that did receive help, the vast majority relied on informal assistance from someone
in the household, a friend, or a neighbor. Less than two percent of individuals are receiving formal care in
the form of long-term stay in nursing homes, which would represent the highest level of substitution of
informal care for formal care. The much greater reliance on informal/unpaid care is confirmed by the mixed-
methods data collection in a subset of countries (Figure 6). Notably, some Western Balkan countries (FYR
Macedonia, Kosovo, and Bosnia and Herzegovina) have already developed a menu of eldercare options,
while in other countries (Serbia, Armenia, Ukraine, and the Kyrgyz Republic), unpaid care appears to be
the exclusive mode of eldercare arrangement.

18.     Given the constraint on available time, families consider normative, institutional, and labor
market factors when allocating resources to childcare and eldercare. When deciding between formal
and informal care, household members are faced with the choice between three kinds of activities—work
for the market, work for the household, and leisure (Pagani and Marenzi 2008; Becker 1965). Decisions
about allocating time to each activity are shaped largely by a set of forces coming from prevailing social
norms, specific household-level factors, as well as institutional arrangements that can affect both the
demand for and supply of formal and informal care.

Notes: Informal care is defined here as help during the last 12 months with personal care such as washing, getting out of bed or
dressing, or practical household help from someone in the household, any family member from outside the household, any friend
or neighbor. Formal care is defined here as an overnight stay in a nursing home in the last 12 months.

Social norms and views

19.     The decisions regarding time allocation for market work and care duties take into account
norms with respect to care obligations. These norms and societal views on how care should be provided
and who should be providing it also shape the types of formal services and caregiver support that become
available, through the mediating influence of the social policy environment.

20.      Social norms in ECA countries place a high expectation on the provision of intergenerational
support, in particular around women acting as caregivers for both children and the elderly. In
virtually all countries in the world, women face much higher expectations than men when it comes to
providing time for both childcare and eldercare. In fulfilling the roles of both sons and fathers, men are
more likely to be expected to help with financial matters and specific practical tasks such as home repairs
or moving heavy objects (Campbell and Martin Matthews 2003; Gallagher 1994; Bender 1994; Finch and
Mason 1990; Hugentobler 2003). Prevailing social norms, such as the degree to which a mother’s
employment is damaging to her children’s well-being, can alter a woman’s calculus in terms of combining
work and motherhood and can also shape the availability of services for those mothers (Crompton and
Lyonette 2006; Morgan 2008). Indeed, as can be observed in Figure 7a, respondents often connect the
welfare of the care recipient (in this case, preschool age child) with women foregoing care duties.

21.      While younger generations, which have been exposed to more flexible norms and higher levels
of female labor force participation, are somewhat less likely to have a gendered view on childcare
issues, this is not the case for all countries. Notably, the data identify a conservative cluster of nine
countries (where more than half of the respondents both above and below 50 years associate mothers’
employment with negative outcomes for children), consisting of Armenia, Georgia, the Russian Federation,
the Kyrgyz Republic, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Kosovo. At the other end of the spectrum
is a more liberal cluster of Norway, Serbia, and Estonia, where 20 percent or less have this association.
More generally, Eastern Partnership and the Russian Federation countries appear to have the most
conservative norms related to women’s involvement in childcare duties, and European Free Trade
Association (EFTA)/EU-15 countries the most liberal ones, with EU-13 and Western Balkan countries
falling in between. There is also evidence that social norms related to eldercare appears to be less gender-
specific. In virtually all countries sampled in the GGS and fieldwork, the agreement with the statement
“When parents are in need, daughters should take more caring responsibility than sons,” falls below 50
percent (except older respondents in Kosovo and the Kyrgyz Republic) (Figure 7b). However, relative to
most EFTA/EU-15 countries (except Italy), countries in ECA were more likely to agree with this statement,
implying a higher burden of care placed on daughters.

22.     The acceptability of state involvement in childcare and eldercare is much lower in ECA
relative to Western European benchmarks. As shown in Figure 9, two countries—Norway and the
Netherlands—have relatively high shares of respondents who believe that care for children and elderly is
mainly a task for society rather than the family. At the other end of the spectrum are most ECA countries,
where the opinion that the primary responsibility of society for the care of the elderly and preschool children
is shared by less than 15 percent and 10 percent of respondents, respectively. A similar picture emerges
from SHARE data based on opinions of respondents aged 50+ years. The majority of respondents in Nordic
countries assign the main responsibility for supporting older people to the state, including with personal
care and household chores; on the opposite end, in Poland and the Czech Republic (the only two ECA
countries included in SHARE at the time), the vast majority of respondents see more of a role for the family,
especially when it comes to help with everyday tasks and chores (Figure 8). Regardless of levels, however,
across countries formal care gains relevance when limitations increase to bathing, dressing, or needing
support at night.

23.     These normative perceptions about state responsibility in care are important both as a driver
of care-related policy and as a reflection of the availability of formal care. The stronger the view that
eldercare or childcare should be done by the family, the more likely it is that the family will fulfill this
obligation. Thus, the earlier observation of greater reliance on informal childcare in ECA compared to EU-
15 countries could stem, at least in part, from the normative assignment of responsibility for care to the
families being reflected in social policies promoting informal rather than formal care. Moreover, these
opinions are not independent of the availability, diversity, and quality of support provided by the state to
individuals in need. Interestingly, Figure 9 demonstrates that in most ECA countries, there is more general
acceptance of state involvement in provision of eldercare, relative to childcare (except in three Western
Balkan countries—Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and FYR Macedonia—as well as Germany). This
could potentially be explained by the expectation of state support for care based on older people’s lifetime
contributions.

24.     The evolution of norms around formal childcare in different settings suggests the possibility
of policy driving gradual adjustment in norms around eldercare as well. The norms around provision
of childcare have evolved, partly due to the growing recognition of the importance of the educational
element in this service, which can be better monitored when childcare is provided formally. This combines
with the expansion of pre-primary education in many countries (for example, Turkey, Romania, and
Bulgaria, among others). A similar logic can apply to the health aspect of eldercare provision. If the state
can take on quality control in the provision of eldercare in the same manner as it provides it for preschool
education, the expectation that families (and in particular, women) should bear the sole responsibility to
ensure comfort to their elderly relatives can slowly change. The sharing of the care burden between the
state and the family will then allow caregivers to devote more time to other productive activities, such as
paid employment.

Social policies and supply of formal care

25.     The lower availability of acceptable options for formal childcare and eldercare can explain
the higher prevalence of informal care in ECA. While the question of what should come first, demand
or supply, has often plagued policymakers involved with childcare provision, norms about the acceptability
of formal care options are more likely to change in the presence of adequate supply of such options. In
many ECA countries, demand for formal childcare and eldercare services indeed outstrips supply, with
some countries experiencing long queues for both kindergartens as well as social care services targeted to
the elderly. In contexts where formal care services are not available, families are forced to provide informal
care even when such provision is inefficient or exposes households to economic vulnerability (due to taking
an income earner out of the labor market or via finding private arrangements at home or via paid care
support).

26.      Accessibility, affordability, and quality of formal care options figure prominently in the
decision-making process for households with care needs. While care policies will be discussed in detail
in the policies section of this document, a few elements are important when assessing the allocation of care
between formal and informal. The first has to do with accessibility of services. This refers not only to
location of care providers but also to the capacity at each location. The second is the affordability of these
services—the explicit or implicit cost associated with utilization of formal care services, and conversely,
the available financial support provided for informal caregivers. Third, the quality of care services can not
only determine current utilization of formal care but also shape the norms surrounding such utilization. The
quality of care services depends, in a large part, on regulations and standards, which ideally would reflect
priorities and expectations of households consuming these services. Javornik (2012) collected information
on these three aspects of childcare services for eight former socialist countries, finding important
differences in the priority given to different elements (Figure 10). Some, like Poland and the Czech
Republic, scored poorly across the board. Slovenia was the only country receiving full marks for setting
uniform quality standards at the central level while quality standards in other countries were more
decentralized. Accessibility (in terms of service hours, age at entry and exit, and allocation of places) was
highest in Lithuania, Hungary, and Slovenia. Affordability was highest in Hungary, where childcare
services were provided free of charge in 2007, while Slovenia used a sliding scale taking into account
family incomes and household size.4

27.      Capacity to meet demand—actual and potential—emerges as one of the key constraints in
the provision of formal childcare and eldercare services in ECA. Insufficient accessibility of formal
care services, both for children and the elderly, appears to be a common phenomenon in ECA. In 2010, of
the women in the EU-27 countries who were out of the labor force or working part-time for reasons related
to child or eldercare, 25 percent did so due to a lack of availability of childcare services, but this went up
to almost 50 percent in the Czech Republic and Croatia.5 Observing the availability of care services in
selected ECA countries via data collected specifically for this study, we find large variations in the number
of available care facilities across countries and between different areas within a country. Childcare and (the
very few existing) eldercare services are largely concentrated in urban areas, with few, if any, care services
available in other localities. Services for the elderly are particularly sparse, and even when present in urban
areas, they cover a larger geographical location (that is, the entire city) compared with childcare services,
which generally focus on a narrower catchment area (Table 4). Participants in focus group discussions in
each of the seven countries confirmed this limited availability. Another piece of evidence on capacity
constraints is provided by data from questionnaires filled out at care facility sites in the selected countries.
Almost two-thirds of childcare providers visited do not accept new clients right away, with nearly half
referring clients to a waitlist; indeed, only Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia appear to have available
spots in most childcare facilities (Figure 11a). Eldercare services in some countries seem to have more spare
capacity, as both facilities in Armenia and the one live-in eldercare facility identified in Ukraine and the
majority of facilities in Serbia and the Kyrgyz Republic can accept new clients without a waitlist (Figure
11b). On the other hand, the two identified live-in facilities in Kosovo had a waitlist for new clients.

Note: The graph shows responses to the question “Is this care provider currently accepting new clients?” For childcare, facilities
were included that serve younger children (5 years and under). For eldercare, live-in facilities were included.



28.     Besides sheer coverage and capacity constraints, accessibility of formal care services is
negatively affected by limited service hours and age limits for clients. The compatibility of formal care
services and the needs of households requiring care can affect utilization above and beyond the availability
of vacant spots. For example, if childcare facilities require drop-offs and pick-ups during normal working
hours, their usefulness to parents working full-time diminishes dramatically. The data collected for this

                                                                                                                                                                                                            27
study reveal that while most childcare providers in the selected ECA countries tend to open sufficiently
early (between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., except in Armenia), very few remain open beyond 6 p.m. Moreover,
in most countries in the study, many providers, especially in rural areas, close their doors during the summer
months (July–August), which can send working parents in a search of an alternative mode of childcare
provision. Another aspect that can explain the lower prevalence of formal care in ECA compared to Western
European benchmarks is the lowest age limits for admission in many childcare facilities. According to the
data collected for this study, children under 2 years of age are served by less than half the providers in all
countries in the study except Serbia and Kosovo; indeed, in Ukraine and Armenia, fewer than 5 percent of
the providers cater to these young children. When paid maternity leave ends before children reach the age
of admission to most childcare facilities, mothers face the choice between leaving the labor force altogether
or opting for another form of informal care (such as that provided by grandmothers).

29.      The second channel via which policies can affect utilization of formal and informal care is the
financial demands imposed on households to access and use care services. If we follow Ettner (1995),
the decision to care for an elderly person and the decision to have a child and bear the burden of childcare
are very similar in terms of the time and financial commitment they represent. Many countries in the ECA
region attempt to address some of these constraints by providing a package of leave and financial support
policies related to care duties. Some of these policies, such as care-related leave and family allowances, can
encourage families to provide dependent care by themselves. In the latter case, what matters for families is
how long a household member can sustain full-time caregiving without becoming a burden on the
household’s economic well-being. As can be seen in Figure 12, in many European countries there is a
significant gap between the duration of regulated parental leave and the period of effective leave when
caregivers are compensated for the foregone earnings (at least at 60 percent of their income). Other policies
can stimulate utilization of existing formal care options by providing vouchers or subsidies. The
affordability of formal care, including the net effect of the aforementioned policies, is a key factor in the
balance between formal and informal care. According to the analysis of EU-LFS data in Mills et al. (2014),
more than half of all working-age women in EU-27 who cited care-related reasons for being inactive or
working part-time reportedly blamed the cost of childcare for their inability to work full-time, although cost
figured more prominently (compared to accessibility and quality) in EU-15 countries, such as Ireland (85
percent), United Kingdom (73 percent), and Netherlands (71 percent), and also in Romania (80 percent).

30.     Affordability of care services does not appear to be the major constraint in most countries
selected for special data collection in this study. Indeed, in two countries—Armenia and Ukraine—more
than 60 percent of childcare providers offered full-day childcare for free or for a voluntary donation, as can
be seen in Figure 13. In some countries where free childcare was not available (such as Kosovo and FYR
Macedonia), more than half of childcare providers offered some flexibility with respect to payment for their
services. Eldercare in the few live-in facilities identified in Kosovo and Ukraine was provided free of
charge, while in Serbia all live-in eldercare providers offered payment flexibility. The Kyrgyz Republic
appears to be one country where affordability of care services might be an issue, as more than two-thirds
of childcare providers and 80 percent of live-in eldercare providers were inflexible about payment for care
services.

31.      Concerns about the quality of formal care options figure prominently in households’
calculation of costs and benefits of formal and informal care. Existing data on the quality of formal care
services are very limited. There is wide cross-country variation on the assignment of responsibility,
existence of standards, and other measures of quality. For eldercare, many of these quality control
mechanisms are not present or are in the process of development. An additional challenge is the distance
between the letter of regulation and actual practice. Data from site visits to care facilities was used to
construct quality indexes, focusing on aspects of infrastructure, human resources (that is, training and tenure
of caregivers), activities and materials, and specifically for eldercare, health-related support. In line with
the greater consensus on the quality standards for childcare, there appears to be less variation among
countries in the quality index constructed from field visit questionnaires, compared to that of eldercare. As
can be seen in Figure 14, Armenia appears to have relatively high quality of childcare and eldercare
services, whereas the Kyrgyz Republic is close to the bottom on both. On the other hand, in some countries,
quality appears to be relatively high in one but not the other type of care services: FYR Macedonia has the
highest quality index in childcare and the lowest in eldercare, while Bosnia and Herzegovina is at the bottom
in terms of childcare quality and near the top in terms of quality of eldercare services.

Note: The overall quality of childcare facilities was evaluated using three sub-indices: Materials, Curriculum, and Learning
(composed of 8 binary variables); Infrastructure (composed of 19 binary variables); and Human Resources (composed of 4 binary
variables). Each sub-index is weighted equally in the overall quality assessment. The total childcare index is on a scale from 0
to100, so each sub-index is from 0 to 33.33. The overall quality of eldercare facilities was measured in a similar way. It is
composed of 4 sub-indices: Special needs, Health care, and Support (composed of 14 binary variables); Schedule, Activities, and
Materials (composed of 16 binary variables); Infrastructure and Safety (composed of 24 binary variables); and Human Resources
(composed of 8 binary variables). As with childcare, each sub-index is weighted equally in the overall quality assessment. The
total eldercare index is on a scale from 0 to 100, so each sub-index is from 0 to 25. For childcare, facilities were included that
serve younger children (5 years and under). For eldercare, live-in facilities were included.

32.      Intergenerational co-residence is correlated with the provision of informal care within the
household. Household size and composition, including the number of actual and potential ‘care recipients’
and ‘caregivers’ in the household is an important consideration. Time is a limited resource, and the smaller
the household size, the fewer the individuals to rely on for support in terms of care. The move from
independent living or living with a partner to cohabitation appears to be related with an increased need for
support. Widowhood, for example, is one of the factors that might push women into cohabiting with their
children or other family members, in particular if declining health or need for help with daily activities is
present. Lack of alternative options for elders—such as long term-care facilities or professional support at
home—will increase the prevalence of informal care via intergenerational co-residence (Dykstra et al.
2013). Countries in Eastern Europe, such as Romania, have higher numbers of elderly living with adult
children compared to Western European benchmarks—a trend that can be traced back to the 1990s (De Vos
and Sandefur 2002), but more widely, increases in co-residence can be observed in other countries in the
region. Care from household members is the main form of care for those who cohabit with other family
members. Looking specifically at those elders who report experiencing limitations due to health, care
intensity increases as these limitations become more severe. SHARE data (Figure 15) show that regardless

of the severity of the limitation, for those who live with family members who can act as care providers, care
by a household member is the more frequent form of care.

33.      Households are more likely to choose formal care when other demands on the time of
‘potential caregivers’ take a more prominent role. Regression analysis examining the relationship
between formal care utilization and household-level factors was conducted using GGS and the data
collected from a special study of selected ECA countries, using a sample of female respondents, aged 20–
64 years, who live in a household with at least one child. The analysis identified correlates of using
institutional/paid childcare (that is, either day-care center, nursery or preschool, after-school care center,
self-organized childcare group, or from another institutional or paid arrangement) for households with
children under 14 years and under 7 years.6 As can be observed in Figure 16, the results confirm that the
presence of multiple children in the household and the gainful employment of the respondent, who is likely
the primary caretaker, are positively correlated with utilization of institutional/paid childcare. Finally, the
positive correlation with regular unpaid childcare help suggests that utilization of institutional/paid
childcare is a complement rather than a substitute to informal provision of childcare by people other than
the child’s mother.

Source: Authors’ calculations using GGS (most recent wave for Bulgaria, the Russian Federation, Georgia, Romania, Lithuania,
Poland, the Czech Republic, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, and Belgium) and fieldwork data (2014 data for
Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, the Kyrgyz Republic, FYR Macedonia, Serbia, and Ukraine). The models are estimated
using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions, with the sample constrained to female respondents, aged 20–64 years, in
households with at least one child (either under 14 years or under 7 years). A full set of country dummies were also included in
each regression.


34.     Factors that are associated with a lower likelihood of using institutional care largely speak to
the care capabilities within the home. For example, presence of an elder in the household is negatively
correlated with the use of paid or center-based childcare, confirming that intergenerational co-residence is
correlated with informal care (Figure 16). A similar relationship emerges if the respondent has a spouse,
possibly because of a division of paid and unpaid labor between the man and women in the couple. If the
respondent has not completed tertiary education, the household is less likely to use institutional childcare,
which may speak to the woman’s lower opportunity cost of labor. Not surprisingly, in higher-income
countries with a more developed childcare system, such as Germany, France, and Norway (but also
Hungary, and in some specifications, Armenia and Ukraine), women are more likely to use institutional
childcare. In other countries, the opposite is true. These include some EU-15 countries, such as the
Netherlands and Belgium, some EU-13 countries, including Romania and Poland, as well as Georgia and
Kosovo.

35.     In sum, the choice between formal and informal care for children and elderly depends on the
social norms and the institutional environment as much as household composition and labor market
forces. During the focus group discussions held in countries selected for special data collection, men and
women alike, independent of the country, location, or labor market status, weighed normative, institutional
and household factors when discussing the reasons for choosing informal over formal care or vice versa.
Box 2 provides a sample of their reasoning to illustrate how, depending on context, some factors gain a
more prominent role in relation to others.

                                    Box 2: Different countries, different factors

Men in a small city in FYR Macedonia noted that quality, cost, and accessibility of childcare and eldercare services
were important in their decision making around use of these services. “There was nobody who could take care of my
child. I am employed, my wife is also going to work, and we had to find a solution. After we saw the conditions in
the kindergarten we decided to hire a nanny.” “Finances are the biggest reason [to opt for the use of formal
childcare]. In a situation where there is high employment and better economic standard it would be easier for us to
pay for the services, otherwise there is no income source for such an expense.” “I would send my father-in-law to a
retirement home, but it’s far away, I cannot make that decision, I’m not his daughter. If he were here and went to a
home, it would be different, we would visit him, take him home for the weekend, etc. ”

Employed women from an urban center in Bosnia and Herzegovina also discussed cost as well as quality when it
came to childcare and eldercare: “I wanted to take my children to the kindergarten, but my husband did not want to.
He said that it was wasting money.” “We don’t have finances for the elderly. My mother says that she would like to
go to a nursing home, but the finances don’t allow it.” “I could never imagine myself in a nursing home. Maybe it
would be good if there were good conditions in it, but I would never place my mother in a nursing home.”

For women from rural villages in Ukraine and the Kyrgyz Republic, social norms—and strong sanctioning of other
people’s choices for formal care—played the larger role in their decision making. When asked why they had
reported a low use of the eldercare home, Ukrainian women argued that, “You won’t do that to a relative [place him
in a nursing home]” because of reasons of ‘conscience’ and love. They also noted a specific regulatory challenge:
“It’s not so easy to put someone into the home for elderly people. They don’t take people if they have children.
Children have to sign a refusal (so parent’s pension payments will go to the eldercare home) before their parents can
be considered.” Their views remained equally strong when discussing childcare for infants. “No. A sane mother
won’t take her baby there.” “You don’t need daycare services if you have a grandmother around, grandfather, or
other family. I’d rather starve than give away my baby to a nursery.” However, some signs of change appeared when
observing the lack of adequate quality services: “But there are young couples with children who don’t have par ents
to help.” “You earn social benefits till the child is 3 years old.” “…Maybe if I had a more gainful employment than
my current state work.” “… I wish we had twenty-four-hour kindergarten, like in big cities.”

In rural Kyrgyz Republic, women agreed that no one in their village would leave their parents in the eldercare home.
“On the contrary, such things should be prevented,” with the only acceptable situation under which it would be
acceptable for an elderly person to turn to these services are, “if they live alone and they are unattended, then it is
possible; but if they have children, it is unacceptable.” They saw that opening retirement homes might give the
wrong signal and “Some children may think that now it is only the government’s duty to care fo r elderly. If you
have children, then they should not leave parents in a home for elderly.”

III.    Women are the main informal care providers in ECA

36.      On average, women allocate more time to care-related and home production tasks than men,
and they devote more time to these activities regardless of whether they are working for pay or not.
This pattern of gendered time use is illustrated in Figure 17 and Figure 18, which depict patterns of time
use over the course of a day (from 6 a.m. until midnight), using the most recent available nationally
representative time-use data from Serbia, Moldova, and Estonia. Figure 17 highlights differences in the
percentage of men and women who engage in three different types of activities: paid work, household-
related tasks, and care throughout the day. In both Serbia and Moldova, men are more likely to be engaged
in paid work than women at all times of the day, with the difference peaking in the early afternoon in both
countries (at 14 percentage points and 10 percentage points, respectively). In Estonia, men and women
participate in paid work at nearly identical rates in the morning, but fewer women than men return to paid
work after midday. Clearly reflecting a reallocation of time, a larger share of women in Estonia engage in
household production as the day continues until it peaks just after the end of a typical work day. Women’s
care duties, which are relatively constant during daylight hours, peak in the evening for all countries. The
gender difference on care and household production is consistent. On the former, men and women’s
participation differs by as much as 22 percentage points in Serbia (at 1:30 p.m.); 15 percentage points in
Moldova (at 12:30 p.m.); and 12 percentage points in Estonia (at 6:30 p.m.). Furthermore, for nearly the
entire day in Serbia, a higher percentage of women are engaging in household work than in paid work.

37.      Thus, though women are spending less time working for pay—and presumably, accruing less
income—they spend more time each day engaging in work than men. This is clearly illustrated by
Figure 18, which depicts gender differences in paid work and total work (including unpaid household
production and care). Women are consistently more likely than men to engage in care, and in all three
countries, women are more likely than men to engage in some form of work at every point of the day due
to a much higher percentage of women who engage in unpaid work. This division of tasks repeats in other
countries in Europe, as documented by Aliaga (2006) using a set of National Time Use Surveys from a
larger group of European countries.

38.      The role of women as the main childcare providers of has been well documented, as mothers
are seen as the natural primary childcare providers. Either as sole providers or with support from formal
services, paid help, or other family members, having children increases the opportunity cost for women on
their time. However, motherhood also triggers a set of social norms and expectations about women’s role
as mothers, which are normally mirrored in the support social policies provide to women (Gornick et al.
1997). While the distribution of childcare tasks between partners has become less skewed as female labor
force participation increases and norms change, it has not seen significant changes for the past two decades
in most ECA countries. Data from national Time Use Surveys (Figure 19) show how, on average, married
women perform the majority of care work, with a higher time investment when children are below the age
of 6 years. This inequality remains regardless of women’s employment status (Fisher and Robinson 2009).
The demand for maternal care is more intense before children enter the school system, either primary or
pre-primary education, and more so for women whose children are younger than the age of three years.

39.       Women’s care provider role extends well beyond caring for their own children, to care for
other family members. Within a household, women will be expected to provide care for those in need,
such as elders, small children, and others (Becker 1981, 1985; Akerlof and Kranton 2000).7 This process is
replicated throughout women’s life cycles. Among elderly couples, women are more likely to care for their
partners. Daughters will provide care for their elderly parents, and grandmothers will provide care for their
grandchildren. A good number of women are likely to be engaged in caregiving at different stages of their
life, and this care will go in one or multiple directions at the same time (Figure 20), with different intensities
in terms of time and frequency (Agree et al. 2003; Dykstra et al. 2013).

    Indeed, Becker suggests women choose to specialize in family care and devote more time to household tasks.

                                                                                                                                37
40.      Aging societies increase the demand for upward care flows besides the traditional downward
care. Women will give more time to intergenerational support, from social support and practical assistance
to direct caring for a parent or grandchild or helping in the household (Glaser et al. 2010). As longevity
increases and the number of children decreases, women who have had breaks in their careers due to
childcare and are already out of the labor force, have lower education (and expected lower returns in the
market to their skills), and/or have reached a point when some of their care responsibilities have ended (that
is, have adult children) are more likely to become eldercare providers if the need arises (Carmichael et al.
[2010] find this is the case in England). Even when households have the capacity to pay for care, income
cannot completely substitute for social norms around filial obligation and women are more likely to be the
household member expected to become a care provider (Mentzakis et al. 2009), as besides opportunity
costs, deciding to become a caregiver is related both with earlier experiences of care of any sort and
proximity to the person that requires care. In all five ECA countries participating in SHARE, more social
support is provided upward (from children of SHARE respondents to their parents) than from parents to
children, but downward flows in the form of grandparental childcare are not meaningless.

41.     Associated with the intensity patterns of care observed above, co-residence with an elderly
person is more frequent in Southern Europe and some of the ECA countries included in SHARE
(Figure 22). More than half of Polish and Slovenian respondents aged above 50 years lived with at least
one child, and more than 12 percent lived with at least one parent, compared with less than two percent of
Danish or Swedish respondents who report living with a parent at the time of the survey. This finding is in
line with the documented difference between Southern and Northern European countries, with the former
being more of a ‘familial nature’ (Leitner 2003; Bettio and Plantenga 2004), under which higher levels of
intergenerational reciprocity are expected.

The role of grandparents as childcare providers

42.      Formal care will not completely substitute informal care, and depending on the design of the
service, it might not serve the needs of working parents, who in the absence of regular childcare for
some periods of the day, rely on grandparents as care providers (Settles et al. 2009; Igel and Szydlik
2011; Gray 2005). Intergenerational support with childcare is frequently provided by the mothers of
the child’s parents. Grandmothers are expected to have higher disposable time—because of retirement
and changes in their household composition and care needs—particularly if they live near the grandchild
or in the same household. Buber-Ennser (2014) finds that in 23 countries from Europe and Central Asia
included in SHARE and GGS, 63 percent of grandmothers and 53 percent of grandfathers aged 50–79 years
provided some care for at least one grandchild aged 15 years or younger, with the highest prevalence and
intensity to be found among Russian women, with 81 percent of grandmothers reporting caring for
grandchildren (Figure 23).8 These findings are confirmed in the supply and demand fieldwork in an
additional set of ECA countries, where also grandmothers and mothers-in-law appear as the most frequent
care providers supporting mothers. Participation rate in grandparenting across European countries follows
the distribution between North and South family support divide across Europe.

43.     Sex of the grandparent, age, presence of a competing care demand such as a co-resident
partner, distance from the grandchild, and age of the child are among the factors that will affect the
provision of grandparental care. Drawing on the findings by Buber-Ennser (2014), we can observe that
each of these factors plays a role in the frequency and intensity of grandparental care. The author uses the

most recent available data from SHARE and GGS, focusing on the 50–79 age group. Following Hank and
Buber-Ennser (2009), a logit model is estimated for grandparents who reported to have looked after a
grandchild, including variables on the grandparent characteristics, age of the grandchild, and if available,
information about the parent of the grandchild who is related to the grandparent. Grandparent characteristics
are age (three categories: 50–59, 60–69, and 70–79 years); partnership status (indicating whether the
respondent lives in a union); employment status (working vs. non-working);9 and health (a binary indicator
indicating any ADL limitations or not). The model is estimated for grandmothers and grandfathers and for
two classifications of care: the provision of any help and the intensity of such help, with a focus on regular
help or help provided ‘almost weekly or more often’ compared with ‘any help’ or help provided less
frequently than that. Full tables are in Annex 2, Tables 8–10.

grandchild in the year before the interview. Four out of ten grandparents never looked after a grandchild,
and one out of four helped occasionally. Among grandmothers, only 37 percent never looked after a
grandchild. Grandfathers’ providing childcare is less frequent and for smaller periods. About half of them
report not providing any childcare and 25 percent do so only occasionally. Age is a critical factor for

grandparental care for both men and women. Younger grandparents might be active in the labor market,
and older grandparents’ frailty and health limitations might shift them into the category that needs care.
Before 60 years of age, between 70–60 percent of grandfathers and 60–40 percent of grandmothers were
employed. While younger grandparents have a higher involvement in childcare than those over 70 years of
age, before retirement age (63–65 years depending on the country) involvement is substantially higher
among grandmothers than grandfathers. However, grandmothers in their sixties provide significantly less
frequent childcare as those in their fifties, but higher than grandfathers at all ages.

45.     Grandparents with grandchildren under the age of 6 more often provide care compared to
those with grandchildren at school age. The finding of descriptive analyses revealing that grandparents
with grandchildren below school age more often provide regular care compared to those with grandchildren
at school age is confirmed in the multivariate framework. Intensity of childcare sees almost no variation by
the age of the youngest grandchild, but provision of grandparental childcare is the highest for grandchildren
aged 3–5 years, probably reflecting shortages of formal childcare supply.

46.      Under all circumstances, grandmothers are more likely to provide grandchild care than
grandfathers, and they will do so regardless of the presence of and competing demands on their time.
Employment has no statistically significant effect on the provision of grandparental help among women,
regardless of the intensity of such care. Employment status is significantly associated with provision of
regular care among grandmothers. Employed grandmothers provide care to about the same extent than non-
employed grandmothers, but labor market affects the intensity of their care. Employed grandmothers show
a lower frequency of regular care than non-employed grandmothers; in particular for younger grandmothers
(50–59 years of age), labor force participation is important for providing regular care. The presence of a
co-residing partner (as another factor affecting women’s time availability) will affect the levels of childcare
provision by grandmothers, but they continue to provide more care than grandfathers in the same situation
(67 vs. 58 percent). Distance from grandchildren’s house, as another factor affecting time, reduces the levels
of grandparental care, but the difference between grandmothers and grandfathers remain. Among
grandparents living up to 5 kilometers away, 72 percent of grandmothers and 62 percent of grandfathers
report caring for a grandchild, incidence that goes down to 67 and 58 percent, respectively, as distance
increases between 5–25 kilometers.

47.      Georgia, Austria, Greece, the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Italy, and Romania are the
countries were the highest intensity of grandmothers’ care can be observed. In these countries,
grandmothers help out with grandchildren almost weekly or more often (Figure 24 shows the estimated
country coefficients for the two types of provision of care identified). Nordic countries, France, and Estonia
are at the opposite end in terms of care frequency and intensity.10 In Sweden and Denmark, grandmothers
are more likely to provide sporadic than frequent care. Notably, the Russian Federation has by far the
highest share of grandmothers looking after grandchildren (81 percent), regardless of intensity of the care.
Romania, on the other hand, sees lower frequencies of grandmother’s care but at high intensity when it
happens. Georgia has the highest share of grandparents living with a grandchild (45 percent), and although

  Nordic countries as well as France have a good structure of family-friendly policies, from extended leave to
childcare, and grandparents might be complementing institutional care but not substituting it.

Eldercare and upward generational flows of care


48.     Children’s support to elderly parents is the most frequent informal care flow from younger
to older generations. Most informal care of older people is provided by their partners and children, a
decision determined by filial obligation, the family’s capacity to provide care, and the elder’s own
preferences (Kalwij et al. 2014; Murphy, Martikainen and Pennec 2006; Litwin 1997; Finch and Mason
1990). As with childcare, and mirroring the gender distribution of tasks, women are the most frequent
providers of eldercare—from wives to daughters and daughters-in-law (Bettio et al. 2006; Saraceno and
Keck 2010). Even in the presence of siblings, when elderly parents require support with activities of daily
living or nonprofessional health care, daughters are more likely to be the care provider than sons (Dwyer
and Coward 1991; Lee et al. 1993; Haberkern and Szydlik 2010).

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    42
49.     Of the households surveyed in the supply and demand assessment, respondents (of which two-
thirds were women) were the majority of eldercare providers, and elder mothers were the majority
of eldercare receivers. Even as, on average, we also find that there is more than one person in the household
providing care for the elder relative (the ratio of caregivers per eldercare recipient is 1.61 for the group of
countries), the additional care provider is likely to be a woman. The percentage of female caregivers is 63
percent among respondents and 43 percent among caregiving partners of respondents looking after elder
household members. Respondent and partner caregivers are more likely to fall in the 40–49 year age group
(32 percent). Regarding those who receive eldercare, for 32 percent of households, the care recipient is
female.

50.      Women who are eldercare providers are different from childcare providers in a series of
characteristics, with age being the most noticeable. Following the original life-cycle diagram, eldercare
needs reach women at a later stage in life. Overall, analyses from the supply and demand assessment (Figure
26) are in line with evidence from GGS for a set of countries (Figure 25), indicating that respondents who
provide eldercare fall into older age groups, as parental support starts increasing with age (the reverse of
what happens to care provided to other family members, which tends to decline).

51.      Demographic and household structure also tends to differ between respondents who report
providing elder care to relatives and those who report not providing care (see Figure 26). A larger
percentage of single respondents are elder caregivers (compared to non-caregivers) in our supply and
demand assessment. A smaller percentage of respondents in a union or those in cohabitation with a partner
provide care for an elder relative. Household size and the percentage of elder members are greater among
households with a respondent who provides elder care, confirming that cohabitation increases the likelihood
of care. Households with eldercare provision also have a larger number of adult women in the household
as well as a larger share of employed adults.


                                                                                                                   43
52.     In terms of time allocation, as with childcare, individuals who have fewer competing demands
for their time are more frequently found as eldercare providers. Respondents who are not in the labor
force are more likely to be eldercare providers, and those who also provide childcare are less likely to
provide eldercare.

53.      SHARE allows us to see how, for a different group of countries, eldercare looks from the
perspective of the care recipient and not just the caregiver. Besides sex of the recipient, age, health,
and marital status correlate with higher likelihood of receiving social support and higher intensity of
that support. Women are more likely to receive some care and support (nonfinancial) from their adult
children, so do parents that are older, do not have a partner, and have some limitations with their daily
activities. Recipients’ socioeconomic status is also an important correlate for receiving social support from
children. Parents with lower educational levels and fewer economic resources are more likely to receive
informal care and they also tend to receive more hours of support. Figure 27 and Figure 28 present the

results in terms of characteristics of the respondent for being eldercare receivers from a child and the
intensity of such care.11

54.     Parents in poor health are more likely to receive support across all countries. Country
differences can also be observed, with the Czech Republic having the highest likelihood of receiving care
from children and high intensity of such care. The intensity of care provision is particularly high in Spain
where the median value in the sample is of more than 600 hours of support per year. Poland sees 308 hours
per year, while in Austria, Germany, and France, the median respondent receiving support from children
receives around half of that, with 150 hours in the twelve months before the survey.

55.      While most respondents of SHARE are above 50 years of age, they do provide eldercare
support. Albertini’s (2014) analysis of SHARE finds that among the donor characteristics positively
associated to provide support are sex and income. Daughters are significantly more likely to provide help
to parents than sons, with daughters from lower-income elders being more likely to provide informal care
to their elderly parents. More than one-third of those whose parents are still alive provided some level of
care in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. In France, Switzerland, and Italy this
rate goes down to about one-fourth of the respondents. Among new countries in the last wave of SHARE,
including Estonia, Hungary, and Slovenia, less than 10 percent of respondents provided help to their
parents.

Caught in the middle: Simultaneous intergenerational flows of care

56.       Population aging, and specifically, the combination of increased longevity and delayed onset
of fertility, has given rise to what has been called a ‘sandwich generation’—women who are expected
to provide care simultaneously to multiple generations, normally their parents and their children
and/or grandchildren. The existence of a group of women, normally in their middle age has been
documented for the United Kingdom and the United States (Grundy and Henretta 2006) using data from
1988 for the United Kingdom and 1998 for the United States, and they find that one-third of women between
55 and 69 years reported providing help to members of both generations. Using SHARE data, Buber-Ennser
(2014) shows that multiple tasks are a common feature among many individuals over 50 years of age. In
the age group 50–59 years, eight out of ten grandmothers provide either grandparental childcare, help other
relatives or friends, or even provide both these types of social support. Thirty-three percent of women
between 50 and 59 years provide childcare as well as help to others; a little lesser than two-thirds of those
women are, at the same time, employed and provide additional help to others; and 23 percent of women in
their sixties also provide care to more than one person; while at lower levels, 24 percent of men in their
fifties provide multiple care, and 18 percent of those in their sixties do so (Figure 29).

57.     Across countries, women over 50 years of age providing care in both directions range from
21 percent in Slovenia and Spain for the 50–59-year age group, to over 40 percent in the Netherlands
and Belgium. Albertini (2014), using all waves of SHARE, notes that sandwich care obligations for the
50+ age group are higher in Nordic countries. Even when excluding co-residence, between one-third and
one-fourth of respondents provide intergenerational care up and down in Sweden, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Belgium. In other countries—mostly continental Europe as well as the Czech Republic
and Poland—the size of the sandwich generation is between 10 and 20 percent of those who have at least
one surviving child and parent. However, notably, Figure 30 shows, when focusing on specific age groups,
women in their fifties in the Czech Republic are the most ‘sandwiched’, with 36 percent of them providing
care both ways.

58.      Married women out of the labor force and higher-educated, higher-income women are at the
highest risk of being caught in a care sandwich. Different from the case for other forms of care, those
women who are more educated, have higher market incomes (that is, incomes not from pensions or welfare
transfers), and belong to richer quintiles in terms of income distribution among respondents are at higher
risks of being caught in between intergenerational demands of care from younger and older generations
(Albertini 2014). This finding is particularly relevant since as care demands increase, the cost of devoting
time to other activities increases as well. Reduction in hours of work or labor force dropout might happen,
even more so if caregivers are close to retirement age.

IV.      How does caregiving affect women at different stages of the life cycle?

59.      Given the substantial time demands involved in regular informal provision of childcare and
eldercare, negotiating the balance of care responsibilities and labor force participation is challenging
for most women. Household production theory divides the time of household members into three
categories: market work, household work, and leisure (Becker 1965). Expansion of household-related
responsibilities due to rising childcare and eldercare needs implies less time for the other two activities.
Women bear a disproportionate share of the burden in terms of household-related activities, and since their
leisure time is relatively scarce (in comparison to men), the time for paid market work can decrease to
compensate for the rise in care duties. Fulfilling the expected role of primary caregiver for children and/or
elderly can thus affect women’s ability to be engaged in paid work, both on the extensive and intensive
margins. It can also reduce their productivity due to potential effects on health and human capital
accumulation. Career interruptions and reduction in labor market attachment due to periods of intensive
caregiving can imply significant drops in caregivers’ economic well-being due to lower lifetime earnings
and higher vulnerability to poverty in later years due to lower pension accumulation.12

60.     While childcare and women’s labor supply has been discussed more widely, the specific effect
of eldercare on care provider’s labor market outcomes has been less so. However, the effects on
caregivers’ employment has been documented recently by Geyer and Korfhage (2014) for Germany, where
they report that half of caregivers in 2010 had stopped altogether or reduced their paid work in favor of care
work; by Carmichael and Charles (2003) for the United Kingdom; by Lilly et al. (2010) for Canada; and
Van Houtven et al. (2013) for the United States. All of them, as well as Ettner (1995), observe that women’s
labor supply is the most affected.13

Caregiving and labor force attachment: childcare

61.     The impact of rising care duties on the time women devote to paid work can take the form of
lower labor force participation or lower work intensity. The effect of rising care duties on female labor
supply can take on numerous forms. Women can withdraw from the labor force altogether, thereby being
affected on the extensive margin, or they can reduce working hours (for example, by starting to work part
time or by requesting flexible work arrangements) or switch to jobs that are less time intensive, implying
an intensive margin effect.

62.     There is a well-documented decrease in labor supply for women with young children, and in
some countries, this reduced labor supply of mothers persists for an extended period. Presence of
young children in a household is often associated with a reduction in women’s time spent working for the
market (Browning 1992; Hill et al. 2004; Nakamura and Nakamura 1992). There is evidence of lower labor
force participation rates for young mothers in many contexts around the world, including in ECA. As can
be observed in Figure 31, ECA countries have lower employment probabilities for mothers of young
children compared to Western European countries. Moreover, while overall European mothers’

12
   For example, multiple-generation households may distribute care duties in a way that substitutes paid work of
some female members (for example, grandmothers) for that of others (for example, mothers of young children).
13
   Recent studies also suggest that availability of intergenerational social support (such as grandparental childcare)
can also factor in individuals’ fertility decisions (Aassve et al. 2012a; Harknett et al. 2014; Raymo et al. 2010; Hank
and Kreyenfeld 2002).

                                                                                                                    49
employment rates increase as the age of their youngest child increases, this pattern is far more pronounced
in ECA countries, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary, Georgia, and Romania. Although employment
rates of mothers with young children could be affected by the length of maternity leave available in each
country, mothers’ labor supply does not always bounce back when children graduate from infants to
toddlers. In fact, according to Keck and Saraceno’s (2013) analysis based on EU Statistics on Income and
Living Conditions (SILC) data for mothers whose youngest child is aged 3–12 years, in some European
countries (Austria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Spain, and the United Kingdom), being a mother is correlated both with lower likelihood of being in paid
work as well as with fewer working hours. In other countries, including Nordic countries as well as
Belgium, France, Greece, and Hungary, the reduced labor supply effect related to motherhood is only on
the intensive margin.

63.     The relationship between female labor supply, education, and caregiving is complex and
context-specific. On the one hand, one would expect women with higher earning potential (for example,
those with relatively higher education) to be less likely to trade market work for care duties due to higher
opportunity cost of time (Fong and Lokshin 2000). On the other hand, women with lower education might
not be able to afford to withdraw from the labor market, especially after they have children. For example,
in Turkey, Aran et al. (2008) find, based on Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, that more urban

                                                                                                                             50
high-skilled women drop out of the labor force after giving birth than rural women or low-skilled women
from the same urban areas. Moreover, for the high-skilled women, another significant drop in labor force
participation rate can be observed after the birth of the second child, a substantial increase in the
employment rate of rural women occurs after the birth of each child. Similarly, 2010 Eurostat data shows
most European countries having higher shares of lower-educated women aged 25–49 years who do not stop
work (beyond the mandated maternity leave) to care for their youngest child under 8 years, compared to
higher-educated women. Indeed, women with less than tertiary education are also more likely to experience
extended career interruptions (over 12 months) due to childcare duties (see Figure 32), with the highest rate
of extended work stoppages among three EU-13 countries—Romania, Slovakia, and Estonia.14

64.      Access to formal childcare (or lack thereof) correlates with female labor force participation
in ECA. As can be observed in Figure 33, childcare in ECA is mostly used by mothers who are working
full-time or part-time, although there is considerable variation across countries. On one side of the spectrum,
there is Slovenia, where 75 percent of mothers aged 25–49 years using childcare are working full-time and
another 9 percent are working part-time and FYR Macedonia, where slightly more than 40 percent of
childcare users are working. From the supply and demand assessment data, we can also see strong
differences between Kosovo (where 90 percent of surveyed facilities had at least 80 percent working mother
clientele) and Armenia (where very few facilities had a majority of working mothers as clientele). Whereas
working women tend to use childcare services, some women who are not working or are working part-time
cite childcare-related reasons for their reduced labor supply. Eurostat data demonstrate that mothers in EU-


14
  In their analysis of European countries, Keck and Saraceno (2013) find that in the majority of countries in the
study, lower-educated women do not experience an additional penalty in terms of labor force participation upon
becoming mothers; however, in a few countries (Cyprus, Italy, Portugal, Spain), there was this additional penalty for
the extensive margin and in the Netherlands, for the intensive margin.

                                                                                                                  51
13 countries are more likely to stay out of the labor force due to childcare availability and quality and more
likely to be in part-time employment due to availability and cost compared to EU-15 benchmarks (Figure
34). Availability concerns are especially prominent in Latvia (cited by 6 percent of mothers as the reason
for not working) and the Czech Republic (mentioned by 6 percent of part-time employed mothers); quality
problems are highest in Hungary (reported by 2.5 percent of inactive and unemployed mothers); while cost
issues prevail in Romania (where 11 percent of mothers cannot afford the childcare needed to increase their
labor supply).

65.      There is rich evidence that increased availability of formal childcare options results in
improved labor force participation of women in many different contexts—in Brazil (Deutsch 1998; de
Barros et al. 2011); in rural Colombia (Attanasio and Vera-Hernandez 2004); in urban Argentina (Berlinski
and Galiani 2005); in Japan (Asai et al. 2014); and in Canada (Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008). Closer to the
ECA region, Del Boca and Locatelli (2006) used data from the European Community Household Panel to
show that female labor force participation is affected by the availability, and even more importantly,
affordability of childcare. The issue of childcare cost is especially relevant in former Communist economies
in which this cost has changed dramatically over the preceding decades; indeed, it may be the determining
factor of whether young mothers return to work in these countries (Todd 2013). Fong and Lokshin (2000)
examined the relationship between female labor supply and the cost of paid childcare in Romania between
1989 and 1995 and found that both female labor force participation and the decision to use paid childcare
were sensitive to the price of childcare. In the Russian Federation, Lokshin (1999) used policy simulations
based on panel household survey data to show that providing subsidies for paid childcare increased maternal
employment by almost twice as much as comparable wage subsidies. Besides this extensive margin effect,
childcare subsidies increased the amount of time working mothers spent at work and were more effective
in raising the overall family income than any other policy intervention examined in the study. It is important
to note that access to childcare can affect male labor market outcomes as well as female labor supply.
Calderon (2012) examined the impacts of a Mexican government-provided childcare program and found
that it not only increased female labor employment rates and earnings but also enabled men to spend time
searching for better paid jobs.

66.      Informal childcare support, usually provided by grandmothers, may also enable young
mothers to remain productively employed in the workplace. As shown in the section on care flows,
young mothers may sometimes have an alternative to formal childcare by relying on time transfers from
their family members, most often their mothers. GGS and fieldwork data demonstrate that informal care
provision by relatives and other caregivers for whom childcare is not a job is used mostly by women who
are either working or searching for a job (Figure 35). Moreover, in every country group, mothers with
unpaid informal childcare help have a higher activity and employment rate than those without any (formal
or informal) help. Of course, the challenge in identifying the impact of informal grandparent-provided
childcare on mothers’ labor supply is the endogeneity of childcare provider choice. Many studies attempt
to overcome this issue by using instrumental variables and different estimation strategies, and there is
evidence that grandparent-provided childcare allows young mothers to return to the labor force and to spend
more time in paid work. Posadas and Vidal-Fernández (2012) use instrumental variable analysis to estimate
that grandparent-provided childcare improves mothers’ labor force participation in the United States by 15
percentage points. Dimova and Wolff (2011) use SHARE data to find a strong positive impact of
grandparent-provided childcare on mothers’ labor force participation and propensity for full-time work
across Europe. Unobserved preferences with regard to grandparent-provided childcare make it challenging
to determine a causal relationship between this type of care and mother’s labor force participation, as these
preferences can also be correlated with women’s preferences for engaging in paid work. Aassve et al. (2012)
use instrumental variables to get around the endogeneity problem; based on the GGS, they find that

grandchild care increases young mothers’ labor supply in some countries (Bulgaria, France, Germany, and

67.       However, provision of grandchild care can also affect the labor supply of grandparents, in
particular grandmothers. While grandparent-provided childcare can increase the time allocated to paid
work by young mothers, this can come at the expense of labor supply of grandparents themselves. This is
particularly the case in some countries in the ECA region with an ongoing or only recently completed
fertility transition (implying a still relatively young age at first birth) combined with relatively low statutory
retirement ages for women. These two factors imply that grandmothers in these countries are quite young,
often in their mid-50s. Whether the substitution of their labor supply for that of young mothers is a positive
or a negative phenomenon depends on the relative productivity of the two groups. In the United States
context, Zamarro (2011) finds that grandparents’ labor force participation and grandchild care are
negatively correlated, and Ho (2008) shows that retirement decisions of grandmothers take into account the
needs for grandchild care. Using the European Social Survey and Multilinks database for 22 countries in
Europe, Van Bavel and De Winter (2013) found that becoming a grandparent speeds up retirement,
especially for women aged 55–60 years. Buber-Ennser (2014) compared employment rates of potential
providers of grandparental childcare (that is, individuals with grandchildren under 16 years of age) to people
without young grandchildren, finding employment was higher for the latter group, especially for men aged
50–54 years and for women aged 55–59 years (Figure 36). Focusing on grandparents, she finds a negative

association between the employment of grandfathers aged 60–69 years and their provision of any
grandparental childcare; while employed grandmothers in the 50–59 years age group are less likely to
provide regular (almost weekly or more frequent) care for grandchildren (See Tables 8–10 in the Annex

Caregiving and labor force attachment: eldercare


68.      As with childcare, intensive eldercare duties can reduce female labor supply during the most
productive years. The negative effect on (mostly) middle-aged women’s labor supply starts to predominate
when their parents become frailer and less able to take care of not only grandchildren but also their own
activities of daily living. Indeed, Albertini et al. (2007) document that the largest amount of
intergenerational time transfers are provided by middle-aged (45–65 years old) women to both the younger
and older generations within the family. This peak of inelastic care responsibilities usually coincides with
women’s most productive middle-age years, implying that reduction in labor supply during this time can
leave the biggest dent in lifetime income. In contrast with childcare duties, the lack of predictability in
timing, duration, and intensity of eldercare (Keck and Saraceno 2009) makes it more difficult to negotiate
a combination with paid employment, particularly full-time. There is a substantial body of evidence, from
a variety of contexts, that intensive, time-demanding care, such as that requiring more than 20 hours per
week, has significant negative effect on the likelihood of staying in the labor force (Jacobs et al. 2014a;
Gabriele et al. 2011; OECD 2011; Lilly et al. 2010; Bolin et al. 2008; Heitmueller and Inglis 2007; Henz




                                                                                                                 56
2006; Johnson and Lo Sasso 2000; Sarasa 2006; Carmichael and Charles 1998).15 Focusing on the cohort
effect, Jacobs et al. (2014a) find that the impact of caregiving on labor force participation was statistically
the same for pre-Baby Boomer and Baby Boomer women. Some researchers find that the adverse effect of
informal caregiving on employment is stronger for countries like Sweden and Norway due to a lower
societal acceptance of family care, which in turn reduces the acceptance by employers of a care-work
combination. In Central European countries, caregiving has an impact on the number of hours women work
but not on their labor force attachment (Bolin et al. 2008). Also focusing on the intensive margin and using
European Community Household Panel data, Spiess and Schneider (2003) demonstrate that a negative
effect on work hours for women who start or increase caregiving does not reverse when caregiving is
reduced.

69.      Residential proximity and intensity of care needs mediate the relationship between caregiving
and labor supply. The effect of care demands on women’s labor supply varies depending on co-residence
and proximity as well as the health status of the elder in need. OECD (2011), Crespo and Mira (2010), and
Casado et al. (2011) show that opportunity costs in terms of paid work are higher for women who co-reside
with the elderly than for those who care for someone who does not live with them and changes depending
on the intensity of the care demanded. Casado et al. find more significant impacts in specific combinations
of daughter characteristics and parental disability conditions, such as low education levels of daughters and
mental frailty of the elderly. The extent of the care provided also matters—longer periods of care have
negative results on labor force participation as well as on intervals of starting and stopping care. Jacobs et
al. (2014b) examine the association between informal caregiving and women’s decision to retire in the
United States context; they find no significant relationship for all caregivers but a 3 percentage point higher
retirement propensity for women who provide 20 or more hours of informal care per week.

70.     Greater availability of formal eldercare options can be expected to affect female labor force
participation, although evidence on this topic is so far limited. To date, given the incipient state of
formal eldercare in many countries around the world, there is far less empirical evidence on the
effectiveness of formal eldercare options in raising female labor force participation rate or work intensity.
Heger (2014) uses SHARE data to look at caregivers’ employment and finds caregiving decreases
employment rates in countries with low supply of formal care (or ‘family care countries’) by 34 to 60
percentage points depending on the frequency of care but has no impact on caregivers’ employment
probability in countries with more established care systems. Earlier, Viitanen (2007), using the European
Community Household Panel to simulate the effect of greater public expenditure on formal residential care
and home-help services for the elderly, found a positive effect on the employment rate of 45–59-year-old
women by 9–13 percentage points across Europe. Loken et al. (2014) examine a 1998 expansion of local,
home-based care for the elderly in Norway, which resulted in a significant reduction of extended absences
from work for adult daughters of single elderly. Geyer and Korfhage (2014) examine long-term care support
in Germany and conclude that cash benefits discourage care providers from engaging in paid work, while

  As often is the case, the relationship between caregiving and labor force status is complicated by the simultaneity
problem (with the decision to provide care and to participate in paid work decided jointly) as well as unobserved
individual heterogeneity problem (with individuals selecting into caregiving potentially having different labor-
market profiles compared to individuals selecting into paid work). Indeed, Carmichael et al. (2010) find that
participation in paid work and the level of earnings have a negative impact on the willingness to supply informal
care. Thus, while caregivers are likely to exhibit lower labor force participation compared to non-caregivers, this is
not necessarily due to caregiving per se (Lilly et al. 2007; Heitmueller 2007).

                                                                                                                    57
benefits given in kind (and as such better substituting for the specific time commitment of the informal
caregiver) provide incentives to already caring household members to increase labor supply. These findings
confirm Todd’s (2013) analysis that there are still few acceptable market-based options for eldercare in
developing countries (Todd 2013) compared with childcare.

71.      Across Europe, less than 15 percent of people aged 65 years and above receive home-based
care and less than 7 percent reside in care institutions
72.      Figure 37). Utilization rates of these formal care services are correlated with labor force
participation rates of the population that is most likely to be providing informal caregiving—women aged
40–64 years, with the correlation stronger for home-based care relative to institutionalized care prevalence.
This suggests that there may be a link between access to formal eldercare and female labor force
participation. The fieldwork conducted for this paper was able to collect data on the prevalence of working
daughters in the clientele of eldercare facilities. In contrast with findings on childcare facilities (Figure 35),
working daughters are not the largest client of formal eldercare services, except in two Western Balkan
countries (Serbia and FYR Macedonia), where half of eldercare facilities surveyed reported that at least
four out of five of their clients have working daughters (Figure 38). Indeed, in Kosovo and Ukraine, all
clients in most facilities did not have working daughters; this could mean either that all the elderly were
childless or only had (unmarried) sons or that their daughters were not working.

73.      The double-duty care burden on the ‘sandwich generation’ of women can have significant
implications on their labor supply. The high care burden can leave little time for engaging in paid
work. Indeed, sandwiched women have been found to experience higher levels of work-related stress,
absenteeism as well as a greater mismatch between actual and preferred working hours (Buffardi et al.
1999; Starrels et al. 1997; Couch et al. 1999; Keene and Prokos 2007; Chapman et al. 1994 as cited in
Albertini 2014). These outcomes can push women to reduce their labor supply either on the intensive or
extensive margin. One empirical study finds a more nuanced situation for women in a care sandwich. Pagani
and Marenzi (2008) find that in the context of Italy, being in the sandwich generation has both a positive
and a negative impact on female labor force participation: while eldercare duties hinder female labor supply,
the informal help received by the older relatives alleviate some of the other household responsibilities,
enabling women to engage in paid work. As longevity increases in Europe beyond the delays in fertility
onset, the care duties of the sandwich generation go from caring simultaneously for children and parents to
caring for grandchildren and oldest-old (85+ years) parents. Examining the characteristics of the
sandwiched generation for SHARE respondents aged 50 years and above, Albertini (2014) finds that higher-
educated pre-retirement-age (50–65 years) women are at the highest risk of performing the double care
duties. At the same time, sandwiched individuals are less likely to be in the labor force, which implies that
sandwich responsibilities are associated with early retirement of highly skilled women (See Table 10 in
Annex 2).

74.      Caregivers’ productivity in market work can be affected by health impacts associated with
the provision of informal care. Even when caregivers are participating in paid work, their productivity
can be affected by the toll that intensive caregiving can take on their health. There is extensive literature on
the potential health and well-being consequences of caregiving, or what has been termed the ‘caregiving
effect’ (Bobinac et al. 2010; Brouwer et al. 2006), suggesting that overall, the time demands and physical
and emotional stress caregivers experience can negatively affect their health. Psychological well-being of
women in the sandwiched generation is at a particular risk due to the need to cope with demands of care

                                                                                                                                         59
from both older and younger generations, and the need to combine work and family (Hammer and Neal
2008; Voydanoff and Donnelly 1999; Rubin and White-Means 2009; Opree and Kalmjin 2012 as cited in
Albertini 2014).


Caregiving and income

75.      As population aging increases the value of every working-age adult, ECA countries cannot
afford to underutilize a large share of women whose lifetime productivity in the labor market is
currently reduced by informal care provision. As discussed above, women tend to reduce their labor
supply on either the extensive or intensive margin when market, normative, and institutional forces push
them toward fulfilling their caregiving mandate in the household. Career breaks during the most productive
middle-age years and potential health effects of caregiving can result in decreased productivity upon return
to the workplace, which, in aggregate, can depress output and future growth. As shown above, women are
expected to provide care to younger and older generations throughout their adult lives. Population aging
implies that the peak of these care responsibilities coincide with women’s most productive middle -age
years. Career interruptions or reductions in work hours can have a permanent negative impact on women’s
lifetime income, affecting their households’ current living standards and human capital investments as well
as future well-being due to reduced pension wealth and damaged health.

76.      There is evidence that caregivers obtain lower wages, which can discourage their labor
supply. There is substantial empirical evidence of the ‘motherhood penalty’ in terms of perceived
competence and salary offers. Becker (1985) proposes that this penalty arises due to young mothers’ lower
work effort or productivity as a response to childcare duties. However, Anderson et al. (2003) cast doubt
on this hypothesis by finding a non-monotonic relationship between women’s skill level and the magnitude
of the penalty; the authors posit that the penalty arises more due to working schedule inflexibility.
Moreover, Correll et al. (2007) use a candidate-rating lab experiment that controls for information on past
work performance to demonstrate that, relative to equivalent childless candidates, mothers are perceived to
be less competent and less committed, less likely to be recommended for promotion or for management
roles, and likely to be offered lower starting salaries. Given such prospects, young mothers may
preemptively withdraw from the labor force or reduce their career ambitions until their children grow older.
Informal eldercare providers may also experience a wage penalty. Carmichael and Charles (1998) find that
in the United Kingdom, provision of informal care for more than 20 hours a week reduced the hourly wage
rate by about 10 percent, which is comparable to the wage impact of caring for one dependent child.
Carmichael and Charles (2003) update the previous results and find that the wage penalties are much higher
(18 percent for women and 23 percent for men) who act as main co-resident caregivers. Using wage
decomposition based on data from the British Household Panel Study, Heitmueller and Inglis (2007)
demonstrate that the wage gap between caregivers and non-caregivers increased in the decade from the
early 1990s to 2000s and that this gap cannot be explained by differences in observable characteristics.
Instead, the authors suggest that caregivers may request more flexible working arrangements, which may
be perceived as signals of their lower job commitment or reliability. Thus, the penalties for young mothers




                                                                                                         60
and informal caregivers for the elderly could have similar roots in the necessity for flexible work
arrangements.16

77.     Career breaks or slowdowns due to care duties can be associated with reduced permanent
labor incomes. Women who need to interrupt their employment or reduce their work hours to care for their
children, their parents, or both, are likely to have lower permanent labor incomes than their non-caregiver
peers. This could be, for example, due to lower human capital accumulation and even its depreciation during
prolonged breaks in labor market attachment. In the context of Canada, Phipps et al. (2003) find that
duration of job interruptions explains part of the ‘motherhood penalty’ in terms of labor income; indeed,
the magnitude of this depreciation is fairly large—with one year of inactivity resulting in 37 percent loss of
the marginal effect of an additional year of experience. There is evidence that such income losses due to
breaks in employment are very difficult to regain later on. Jacobsen and Levin (1995) find that U.S. women
who took breaks from employment of 6 months or longer were never able to catch up to their peers in terms
of earnings due to losses in seniority, gaps in on-the-job training, and depreciation of job skills.

78.      Female caregivers can find themselves at a particular risk of poverty, both during caregiving
spells as well as later in life. Reduced incomes from employment and/or higher dependency ratios in
caregiver households can imply a higher poverty incidence, especially for female caregivers.17 An OECD
(2011) examination of data from Australia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Northern Europe,
Central Europe, and Southern Europe finds that being a female caregiver is associated with a significantly
higher poverty risk everywhere except Central and Southern Europe, whereas male caregivers are more
likely to be poor only in Australia and Central Europe. Besides the immediate economic well-being,
caregiving can be associated with a higher poverty risk later in life: Wakabayashi and Donato (2006) use
the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to demonstrate that females who provided informal care to their
parents in 1991 were, by 1999, more likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance; the authors posit
that this enduring decline in economic well-being was intensified by employment interruption and
worsening health. Part of the increased risk of post-retirement poverty faced by female caregivers can stem
from their lower accumulated pension wealth both due to their lower lifetime earnings and also potentially
due to shorter contribution history in the absence of pension credits for caregivers (PCC). For example,
Kingson and O’Grady-LeShane (1993) show that caregiving for children and elderly significantly reduced
U.S. women’s social security benefits, with a stronger effect observed for women in the bottom and middle
of the earnings distribution. While the majority of OECD and EU countries have some type of PCC systems
in place, their coverage, targeting, and generosity has a tremendous degree of variation, with implications
on the programs’ success in keeping female caregivers out of poverty (Fultz 2011; Monticone et al. 2008).
Women’s longer life expectancy exacerbates the disadvantaged economic position during retirement as
they may have to depend on their own pension entitlements and survivor benefits, leading to a significant
deterioration in living standards upon widowhood.



16
   Notably, in their study using SHARE data in Europe, Bolin et al. (2008) do not find any significant wage
differentials between caregivers and non-caregivers. The authors postulate that differences with earlier studies
finding caregiver wage penalty could be explained by different age ranges in the samples (with SHARE only
including respondents aged 50 years and above).
17
   Indeed, there may be a vicious cycle whereby women from lower-income households are more likely to become
informal caregivers, which in turn results in even lower household incomes (Lee et al. 2014).

                                                                                                               61
V.      Policy discussion

79.       From the public policy perspective, the reasons for directing public resources to support child
and eldercare are not the same; however, the focus on the care recipient remains constant. In terms
of policies, there are two sides when it comes to care, those intended at improving the outcomes of the
recipient. For children, early childhood development via education and care to reduce inequalities later in
life; for the elderly, the main focus is to protect them from increased vulnerability after retirement and to
limit the effects of age-related functional limitations on the elderly quality of life, respecting their
preferences. From the care provider side, the main focus is to support them in their care responsibilities and
duties, so these responsibilities do not affect their access to opportunities and do not generate unintended
effects such as reducing fertility levels in already old societies.18

80.      While there is now greater consensus around the set of policies that will increase child well-
being, these policies have not always taken into account their mothers or other care providers’
situation if not in relation to the child.19 However, adaptations such as extended hours for childcare
services to mirror working-day hours show that the role of the parent or other care provider and parental
constraints related to labor market participation are being considered with more frequency. For the case of
eldercare, a more recently developed policy discussion suggests that postponing entry to institutional care—
the idea of aging in place—while providing services that allow for individuals to adapt their current living
situation to support their needs is preferred to institutionalization and long-term care in medical institutions
in order to secure quality of care. As with children, the focus has been the recipient of care (in particular
elderly without family members) and less so the family member providing care or supporting existing
formal care provision.

81.      Very few countries have developed care systems that look at care needs as a whole, including
the needs of the receivers, the formal and informal care providers (services and institutions and the
family members or other people providing care), and the financing aspects of such a system. The
variation across countries in patterns of implementation, age and type of population covered, and financing
arrangements does not only depend on public resources availability but also on a set of normative factors
that will reflect societal preferences and needs. The policies presented below show the array of what is
today available in ECA countries, with a focus on those that would affect informal care providers ’ well-
being, especially women’s economic participation and labor market outcomes.

Providing accessible, affordable, quality formal care services

82.     Households’ decisions about how to meet their eldercare and childcare needs balance
multiple imperatives, constraints, and opportunities, and the outcomes of these choices can have
significant repercussions for societies’ economic trajectories. The projections of future care demand,
presented in Section I, foreshadowed the rising ranks of care dependents in ECA, mostly consisting of
people with moderate ADL limitations. Where will these people receive the non-medical help they need

18
   Greulich and Thevenon (2013) show how fertility trends across OECD countries respond to family policies.
Similar analysis has been carried out for Italy by Del Boca (2002), and Norway by Rindfuss et al. (2008among
others.

with activities such as dressing, bathing, and feeding? As Section II demonstrates, choices on formal and
informal care for children and elderly dependents are embedded in social norms on care obligations, policies
and institutions supporting formal and informal care, as well as household-level factors and market forces.
Norms in ECA emphasize the role of female family members in caring for children and elders, bolstering
the use of informal care and placing a disproportionate burden on women. While these views may
negatively affect the use of formal care, they can also reflect the inadequate formal care options available
to households. The accessibility, affordability, and quality of formal care options are critical elements in
households’ decisions about how to meet their care needs, and in many ECA countries, there is much scope
for improvement in terms of formal childcare, while formal eldercare options, if they exist, are scarce and
poorly regulated. Holding these factors constant, household-level factors, such as the household
composition and size, can influence households’ abilities to meet their care needs informally and thus, also
play an important role. Scant income-earning opportunities outside of the home decrease household
members’ opportunity cost of their time, making them more willing (and thus , more likely) to engage in
informal care. Relative to the Western European comparators, the combination of these factors leads to the
higher prevalence of informal care in ECA. As established in Section III, informal care in ECA, as in other
regions around the world, is primarily undertaken by women: mothers (in the case of childcare) as well as
wives and daughters (in the case of eldercare). Grandparents, especially grandmothers, also play a role in
childcare, and women in the ‘sandwich generation’ may bear the responsibility of caring for both older and
younger generations. Section IV argues that the substantial burden of informal care provision can result in
caregivers’ lowered labor force participation at the extensive and intensive margins as well as d ecreased
productivity, depressed wages, and increased vulnerability to poverty.

83.      Accessible formal care services are needed to boost women’s labor force participation.
According to the Women, Business and the Law database, public provision of childcare for children under
the age of primary education exists in 95 countries, or 66 percent of the 128 countries included in the study.
In almost all EU countries, demand for ECEC outpaces its supply, particularly for younger
children(European Commission/EACEA/Eurydice/Eurostat 2014). Indeed, the gap between adequately
compensated leave20 and the formal childcare coverage for children aged 0–3 years can be very substantial
(Figure 39). This gap places the burden by default on families to provide informal care or to finance formal
care (Figure 39). Increasing the coverage of formal childcare can attenuate the negative impact of young
children on female labor supply and allow mothers to return to work (as noted by Gornick and Meyers
2004; Esping-Andersen 2009). There is rich evidence that increased availability of formal childcare options
results in improved labor force participation of women in many different contexts—in Brazil (Deutsch
1998; de Barros et al. 2011); in rural Colombia (Attanasio and Vera-Hernandez 2004); in urban Argentina
(Berlinski and Galiani 2005); in Japan (Asai et al. 2014); and in Canada (Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008).
Closer to the ECA region, Del Boca and Locatelli (2006) used data from the European Community
Household Panel to show that female labor force participation is affected by the availability, and even more
importantly, affordability of childcare. Though data is thinner on eldercare, a similar argument applies, as
formal eldercare options allow for care providers (often women in their peak productive ages) to reallocate
their time to other activities, largely paid employment, allowing them to remain in labor markets, gain
economic independence and income generation, including pension contributions that will reflect later into
their income as they reach old age themselves.

84.     Formal eldercare systems are generally much less accessible than childcare systems and will
require more investment. In the OECD, public spending on long-term care varies from 0.1 percent of
GDP in Portugal to 3.6 percent of GDP in Sweden (OECD 2011). Long-term formal eldercare is common
across countries, but the level of provision and use vary widely from less than one percent in Poland and
Portugal to around six percent in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands (Source: Multilinks 2009). A
developed formal care market improves the labor market status of the formal caregiver and that of family
members who have more time for other employment. Both the formal caregiver and family members are
paid more for their work, and taxes and social contributions are higher. Additionally, there is more room
for professionalization and increasing quality in care provision (Angermann and Eichhorst 2012). In the
past two decades, elder care in Europe has moved away from institutionalized care and public provision of
care and toward home care and private or mixed services supported by cash transfers. The trend has been
increasing services that complement rather than replace informal care (Bettio and Verashchagina 2010).

85.     Ensuring that families can afford to take advantage of available care services is critical. In a
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) review of 25 OECD countries, 11 had subsidized and regulated
childcare services for 25 percent of children under the age of 3 years.21 Of the 128 countries examined in
Women, Business and the Law, only 15 offer tax deductions for childcare payments. In the EU, only eight
countries—the four Nordic states, Germany, Estonia, Slovenia, and Malta—guarantee a legal right to ECEC

for every child soon after birth, usually immediately following the end of childcare leave. This is usually
full-time care, and while parents are typically expected to contribute financially, the fees are low and means-
tested reductions are possible to obtain for low-income families. In the rest of the EU and in ECA, the costs
of formal childcare vary considerably by country. Within the EU, public funding from the central and local
government usually supports ECEC for older children while families pay a larger share of ECEC for
younger children (Figure 40), and families will only pay if the services provided match their childcare needs
in terms of hours of operation and quality of care. The issue of affordability is especially relevant in former
Communist economies, where this cost has changed dramatically over the preceding decades. Indeed,
childcare costs may be the determining factor of whether young mothers return to work in these countries
(Todd 2013; Fong and Lokshin 2000; Lokshin 1999). The first column of Table 5 exhibits the full range of
government financial support related to care, from extensive in Armenia to virtually no support in Ukraine
except in very particular circumstances.

86.     The quality of formal care services is also a key factor into households’ decisions about how
to meet their care needs, and improving and maintaining quality will require strengthening
regulations and standards. In Table 5, columns (2) and (3) present the wide cross-country variation in the
main features of quality assurance around childcare—registration, guidelines, role of the private sector—
for countries included in the special data collection in this study. In some countries, such as Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Ukraine, there are no requirements for registration and
accreditation for childcare institutions, while other countries, like Serbia, impose specific quality standards,
including on the qualifications of staff providing childcare. On eldercare, even within the EU, there is
substantial variation on the assignment of responsibility, existence of standards, and other measures of
quality of care (Dandi et al. 2012). Some countries, such as Hungary and Austria, have policies on quality
of formal long-term care that focus on monitoring inputs rather than outcomes, whereas Estonia and
Slovakia have policies and indicators on quality of both residential and home-based formal long-term care
that focus on outputs, and Poland and Slovenia lack policies and indicators on quality of care altogether.

87.     An additional challenge is closing the distance between the letter of regulation and actual
practice. Table 6 shows the share of facilities in each selected ECA country that reported being officially
accredited by the appropriate government institution. While accreditation levels in Ukraine and Serbia were
high across the board, none of the three eldercare facilities in Armenia were accredited, although the
majority of childcare facilities were. Overall, it can be observed that for the selected ECA countries
accreditation is more frequent for childcare facilities than for eldercare facilities. Improving regulations and
standards and ensuring that actual practice meets these standards can promote quality formal care options
and make them more appealing to potential consumers.

Acknowledging and improving informal care

8. Policies supporting informal care providers can ensure their well-being during caregiving spells as
well as smooth the transition to (full-time) employment after such spells. As argued in Section II, formal
care and informal care are not perfect substitutes, and families will continue to provide and consume
informal care to some extent even in the presence of optimal supply of formal care options. For both
childcare and eldercare, different policy objectives underlie different priorities in supporting caregivers.
Schemes that aim to alleviate poverty usually target caregivers with low earnings, allow for long periods of
care provision, and permit caregivers to perform other work. Schemes that aim to improve female labor
force attachment provide high replacement rates for short caregiving periods, and those that try to achieve
better gender equity include incentives for a better gender balance of caregiving responsibilities (Fultz
2011). Care systems that support informal care may include policies concerning paid and unpaid care leave,
flexible work arrangements, allowances for care givers and/or care recipients, and tax incentives.

Leave policies

88.      Parental leave supports the family as childcare providers, with policy design potentially
affecting the distribution of childcare duties between parents. Leave can be unpaid or paid (fully or
partially) by the government, employers, or both. According to Women, Business and the Law, almost all
countries (139 of 143) mandate paid or unpaid maternity leave. Much fewer mandate paternity leave (64

                                                                                                             67
countries) or parental leave (47 countries). Well-designed leave policies can help shape the way informal
childcare is distributed within a household both within the first year after birth and beyond. For example,
Iceland offers nine months of parental leave (with 80 percent of wage replacement), whereby the mother
and father must each take three months and decide how to allocate the remaining three months. Women
take most of this additional leave, but overall this policy has resulted in high paternity leave uptake among
men with some promising changes in gender relations at home and in the workplace (World Bank-IFC
2014).

89.      The design of paid care leave can influence labor market outcomes. Slightly less than half of
all OECD countries have mandated paid (elder) care leave. In most cases (except Belgium and Japan), this
leave is of very short duration—less than one month or the final stages of a terminal illness. The generosity
of paid care leave is highest in Nordic countries, where up to 100 percent of the full wage could be provided.
In Germany, the part-time work/part-time paid leave scheme proposed in 2010 provided 75 percent of the
wage (Bettio and Verashchagina 2010). According to the OECD (2011), some studies using longitudinal
data found that flexible hours and family leave are associated with higher retention of female employees
but with potential negative effects on career prospects for women taking advantage of such schemes
(Pavalko and Henderson 2006 cited in Bettio and Verashchagina 2010). There is also a risk that paid care
leave policy can incentivize early retirement, especially if it offers high replacement rates and social
insurance contributions. This has occurred in Belgium with the ‘Crédit temps’ or ‘Time Credit’, which can
last up to five years of partial or full leave.

90.       Unpaid care leave is provided in many countries, including in most OECD countries,
although its uptake may be hindered by low awareness and the financial vulnerability associated with
it. In some countries (for example, Belgium, France, Spain, and Ireland), it can be relatively long (one or
more years), although in the case of Spain and Ireland, it can be refused by the employer on business
grounds, and in the case of France, there is strict eligibility criteria in terms of dependents’ severity of
disability (80 percent autonomy loss). In Anglo-Saxon countries and the Netherlands, only short unpaid
leave is available (up to three months), whereas Austria and Germany lie in the middle (with leave up to 6
months). Austria’s ‘family hospice leave’ was introduced in 2002 for individuals taking care of dying
family members or severely disabled children. The leave lasts up to three months, with the possibility of
extension up to six months. Job protection is provided from the application time to 4 weeks after the
termination of leave. According to Bettio and Verashchagina (2010), the scheme can be expected to
negatively affect female labor force participation due to the gendered division of labor and care, and high
firing risk after the end of the protected period. Very few people take up this leave due to limited awareness
as well as high financial insecurity related to the scheme.

91.     Across Europe, the length of leave and its wage replacement rate vary widely, which affects
how parents decide to use it to provide informal care, with corresponding labor market implications.
Del Boca et al. (2009) show that the length of parental leave has a nonlinear relationship to maternal
employment: availability of maternity leave allows women to remain attached to their jobs, while extended
leave (above 3 years) is associated with a lower probability of returning to work, with the effect being
stronger for less-educated women. Policies to promote female employment therefore need to balance
supporting families with not contributing to labor market detachment for mothers.



                                                                                                           68
92.      In some countries, retirement contributions during care-related career interruptions
continue to be paid. This accrual of social insurance benefits during either eldercare or childcare leave
provides a number of benefits. It is used in the majority of OECD countries to prevent female poverty,
improve gender equality, recognize the value of care-related work, incentivize formal female employment,
and to raise fertility (Fultz 2011). In some countries, pension credits for caregiving can be combined with
other paid work; this has the advantages of supporting current family incomes while addressing a future
source of vulnerability and enhancing labor market attachment (Fultz 2011). Countries use a range of ways
to set the credited amount. Germany and Sweden set the value of pension credits based on the prevailing
average wages, which can imply providing more credit than what would be earned by low-skilled caregivers
had they stayed in the labor market. Alternatively, the United Kingdom and Canada implement it as a
reduction in years required for pension qualification, thus implicitly basing it on each caregivers’ labor
market earnings. Finally, France sets it based on the minimum wage, which can make these schemes less
attractive to highly skilled caregivers.

Flexible work arrangements

93.      Flexible work arrangements are an alternative to unpaid leave, which maintain caregivers’
labor market attachment and sometimes the number of hours worked while allowing them to attend
to their care duties. According to the OECD (2011), flexible working hours were associated with less of
a reduction in hours for caregivers in Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United States, female
employees who began care duties while working in companies with flexible hours had significantly higher
likelihood of remaining employed within the two-year period studied than those who did not have that
flexibility (Pavalko and Henderson 2006). Two examples of regulations that encourage employers to
provide flexible work arrangements are Slovenia’s 2007 law on labor relations and the United Kingdom’s
2007 Flexible Working Regulations. The former required employers in Slovenia to provide justification for
refusing to accommodate a worker’s request for a change in the distribution of working hours to improve
work-family balance (Kanjuo-Mrcela 2010). The latter extended the 2002 Employment Act’s application
of employees’ right to request flexible or reduced working hours from just parents to individuals with care
responsibilities for dependent adults (Bettio and Verashchagina 2010). The U.K. Employment Task force
reported that “in a 2007 CBI survey (Confederation of British Industries) over 95 percent of employers felt
the Right to Request (RTR) legislation had a positive or neutral impact on productivity, recruitment,
retention, employee relations and absence rates” (2008: 4). Yet, while many workers with long-term care
responsibilities would want to take advantage of flexible working hours (Smeaton et al. 2009), the RTR
may have more limited use for these workers due to their adult dependents’ unpredictable needs being
incompatible with request applications, which are only allowed to be made once a year, with any alteration
to hours constituting a permanent change of contract.

94.     Part-time work arrangements can also maintain labor market attachment for women with
care responsibilities, but such jobs are often substandard in terms of hourly wages and job stability
as they are often offered on a temporary contract basis. Using cross-country bivariate probit regressions,
Del Boca et al. (2009) find that for women aged 21–45 years who are married or live with a partner, the
regional availability of part-time employment is negatively associated with the propensity for employment;
however, ‘high quality’ part-time jobs—those that pay as much per hour as full-time jobs—have a positive
association with employment. Additionally, when care duties end, reentering full-time work may present a


                                                                                                        69
challenge. The right to revert to full-time work after a part-time spell exists in less than half of the 14 OECD
countries with part-time work for care rights. According to the European Working Time Survey, in Eastern
European countries and Portugal, it is virtually impossible for a part-timer to move to a comparable full-
time job in the same establishment (OECD 2011).

Allowances and tax incentives

95.      Allowances paid to caregivers try to recognize the hard work that is performed by people
(usually women) who take on informal care duties. Of the 21 EU countries reviewed by Riedel and Kraus
(2011), 18 had some type of cash benefit for informal care providers (Table 7). Within these, variation
exists in who can access these benefits. This reflects the tension between coverage and generosity of these
allowances, with some countries opting for small benefits covering all caregivers (even those who are
formally employed and providing low-intensity care) and other countries providing more generous but
means-tested benefits (OECD 2011). Often benefits are not large enough to be considered remuneration but
rather are considered a sign of support and recognition of the care provider’s efforts (Figure 41). In Nordic
countries, municipalities employ family caregivers directly and provide them with wages that are similar to
those obtained by paid caregivers on the market. This policy recognizes the effort of family caregivers, but
it is relatively expensive and it does not do much to develop a market for professional well-regulated
caregiving industry. Anglo-Saxon countries tend to provide means-tested benefits to high-intensity full-
time family caregivers, who are assumed to be out of the labor force due to care duties. In England, caregiver
cash benefit eligibility requires 35 hours a week of care activities (Riedel and Kraus, 2011). Although more
targeted to protect those who really need assistance, these benefits have the disadvantage of potentially
discouraging caregivers, especially those with low skills, from working outside the house. Indeed, means-
tested allowances in Australia and the United Kingdom generate incentives for caregivers to reduce hours
of non-care-related work (OECD 2011). The impact depends on the skill level, especially for women, and
the availability of formal care options. Low-skilled women are more likely to be recipients of cash transfers
and tend to have less intensive caregiving responsibilities when in-kind benefits are provided instead of
cash transfers (Sarasa 2006). Thus, means-tested allowances for informal caregivers may cement provision
of care as a low-wage, low-status activity.

96.      An allowance provided to the person in need of care, in theory, puts the beneficiary of care
services in charge of his or her care arrangements (OECD 2011). In most OECD countries, care
recipients can use these benefits, often calculated based on care needs, to support their caregivers or to hire
them formally. Such benefits can stimulate home care for the elderly and increase the supply of trained
caregivers for the growing long-term care market. However, they can also inhibit the emergence of a
professional care industry as families continue to rely on intra-household care; worse, as has happened in
Italy, they can depress the quality of care and stimulate a grey market in care services, as family members
substitute low-paid untrained care providers whose quality of care cannot be monitored. Finally, the
exchange of cash for care between family members can have a negative effect on intra-family relationships
and inadvertently trap caregivers in that role; for this reason, Japan has not targeted family caregivers with
assistance. Within benefits for care recipients, the main variations are in the benefit amount (Figure 41),
form of the benefit, restrictions on the use of the benefit, and the eligibility criteria (for example, whether
the benefit is means-tested). In a review of 21 EU member states, Riedel and Kraus (2011) find that 14
countries have benefits for informal care recipients (Table 7). Of these, all but one had a requirement for


                                                                                                             70
an assessment of medical or nursing needs. Benefits in half of the countries were not means-tested. The
research also noted that countries with a stronger tradition of insurance were more likely to have cash
benefits without means-testing. Most countries do not restrict whether the benefits could be used to pay for
formal or informal care.

97.      Countries use child allowances to support family incomes, which can be a way of promoting
fertility; however, these allowances can have a negative effect on maternal employment. Allowances
are often delivered in the form of cash benefits such as periodic child/family allowances, birth grants, tax
allowances, and other benefits targeted to families with children. Such benefits are often featured as part of
pro-natalist policy packages, designed to reduce families’ cost of having children. Regular and/or generous
child-related cash benefits can theoretically decrease maternal employment through the income effect.
Gonzalez (2011) uses a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to evaluate the impact of a new generous
one-time child benefit in Spain and finds a significant effect on women’s postponement of return to work.
According to Del Boca et al. (2009), many studies find a consistent negative effect of cash benefits on
women’s employment.

98.     Higher potential economic vulnerability of caregivers suggests the importance of time-bound
targeted assistance to their households to prevent inefficient coping strategies. As discussed in Section
IV, career interruptions and lower permanent incomes due to caregiving duties can result in caregivers’
disadvantaged position in terms of financial status and economic vulnerability. This implies that public
financial transfers to their families are likely to have an important redistributive effect, assuming both that
their household consumption is low due to the need to support an elderly as well as because of the reduced
earnings brought in by working adults. Fevang et al. (2012), for example, find that adult children of
Norwegian elderly reduce their labor supply and increase dependence on sickness insurance and other social

                                                                                                                71
benefits in the years before parents’ death, but employment and earnings rebound shortly after the parent’s
demise. Thus, public transfers could help households smooth consumption over such caregiving periods
without resorting to inefficient and costly coping strategies such as sales of productive assets or decreases
in health care utilization, which can plunge caregivers into a poverty or vulnerability trap.

99.      Some countries also use tax deductions as well as in-kind transfers and services to support
care providers. For example, Italy’s care allowance is paid either in cash or in the form of tax credit (Bettio
and Verashchagina 2010). Only a few countries have explicit tax incentives aimed to reward caregivers for
their work, although some countries do exempt caregiver allowance from income taxes (for example, the
Czech Republic and Ireland) (OECD 2011). In Canada and the United States, where care-related tax credits
are available, they have quite stringent eligibility criteria (either in terms of income thresholds or in terms
of the severity of dependents’ disability) and high transaction costs in claiming these credits, which limit
their coverage. Moreover, the credit amounts often represent small shares of household income (OECD
2011; Keefe and Fancey 1999). In-kind transfers often include technology to support home self-care such
as for people with limited mobility. Support for caregivers is also provided through respite care, which
relieves caregivers of their role for a period. Countries also provide counseling and information services as
resources for informal care (Riedel and Kraus 2011).

Conclusion

100.    Without appropriate policies to address the expected rise in the care burden, population
aging can reduce women’s access to economic opportunities and decelerate future growth, thereby
threatening the agenda of poverty reduction and shared prosperity in ECA. Moreover, failing to meet
the challenge of rising care burden can undermine the achievement of other policy objectives, such as
increasing women’s investment in human capital, stimulating fertility by promoting mothers’ employment ,
and enabling the combination of family and working life, as well as extending the working life. Based on
the analysis of existing and newly collected quantitative and qualitative data, several key policy
recommendations can be formulated for policymakers’ consideration.

      Improvement of the accessibility, affordability, and quality of formal childcare and eldercare
       options offers a way to address challenges related to excessive reliance on informal care and to
       capitalize on current opportunities. Enhanced formal care options can allow would-be informal
       caregivers (who are mostly women) to reallocate their time to formal labor market activities,
       thereby contributing directly to economic output and providing tax revenues that can ease the fiscal
       burden commonly associated with population aging. Moreover, a well-regulated childcare sector
       can imply improvements in the school readiness for children via better coverage of early childhood
       education; this, in turn, can translate into higher human capital accumulation, which is vital for
       sustaining economic growth in the context of population aging. Finally, quality provision of formal
       eldercare can potentially improve health outcomes of the elderly through prevention, early
       detection, and consistent maintenance of chronic diseases, which may imply long-term cost savings
       in the health care sector.

      The design of future demographic, health, and education policy reforms should take into account
       any potential effects on informal care providers. Formal care and informal care are imperfect
       substitutes, and households will continue to consume and provide informal care to some extent
       even in the presence of optimal formal care supply. Future decisions on social policies may affect,
       intentionally or unintentionally, the balance between formal and informal care, and the potential
       repercussions should be recognized and discussed from the outset. For instance, pro-natalist
       policies in some countries in ECA attempt to stimulate higher birth rates through provision of cash
       or near-cash transfers, without providing the necessary environment for mothers to continue
       participating in the labor market. Such policies, aimed to delay aging, can have serious, unintended
       effects on the ability of the country to sustain economic growth as women withdraw from the labor
       force to become informal caregivers to their children. In the area of health, the projected significant
       increases in fiscal spending on formal long-term care are often interpreted as evidence to
       recommend switching to a less formal or community-based long-term care model. While this may
       be the optimal care model in some contexts, it is important to consider the impacts of such a care
       regime not only on care recipients and the state but also on informal (often, family) care providers
       whose caregiving intensifies when the state steps out, and to ensure that, at the very least, informal
       caregivers are equipped with adequate resources to provide quality care and to transition back to
       their previous roles after the caregiving spell is over.




                                                                                                           73
       Care leave (both paid and unpaid) can shape families’ choices about care and market work . The
        design, duration, and replacement rate of parental leave and care leave can affect uptake rates and
        effectiveness of protection against income shocks associated with caregiving, and prevent sub-
        optimal coping strategies. In a sense, care leave should be sufficiently long and generous to allow
        the caregiver the opportunity to fulfill the care obligations that are expected by the prevailing social
        norm and that are made necessary by the availability of formal care options. However, the duration
        and generosity of the care leave should not provide the caregiver with a disincentive for returning
        to the labor market at the earliest opportunity, as lengthy breaks in the work history can lead to
        human capital depreciation and thus a significant reduction in permanent income. Of course, the
        precise design of care leave policies has to depend on the state priorities and the local context.

       Flexible work arrangements can function as effective alternatives to unpaid leave. Compared to
        Western European benchmarks, the incidence of part-time work and flexible work arrangements is
        relatively low in most ECA countries. In the long run, the ability of caregivers to decrease labor
        supply on the intensive rather than extensive margin can increase the likelihood of transition back
        to full-time work after caregiving responsibilities abate. Policies supporting uptake of flexible work
        can take the form of RTR regulations, or if necessary, temporary subsidization of such
        arrangements in certain circumstances, where they can prevent costly labor market detachment of
        caregivers.

       Care-related allowances (both in-kind and cash) aim to promote quality care for children and
        elders and recognize the work of caregivers but may have negative repercussions on caregivers’
        labor force outcomes. Allowances for informal caregivers recognize the hard work they do but can
        also discourage caregivers from working outside of the home. When allowances are given to the
        person in need of care, it can empower them but may also negatively impact intra-family
        relationships. Child allowances intend to promote fertility but may also depress women’s
        employment. The design of such policies should carefully consider both the explicit and the implicit
        incentives related to the receipt of these allowances.

101.     Increased recognition of the critical role of care in aging societies and careful review of the
policy environment related to formal and informal care provision can help governments to harness
the full potential of demographics, thereby promoting poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Due
to different policy objectives and prevailing social norms, the design of the optimal package of care-related
policies would be context-specific. That said, explicit consideration of objectives surrounding care issues
and prioritization of the needs of caregivers and care recipients can ensure better human development
outcomes for those who need care without sacrificing the current and future well-being of caregivers as
well as remaining on the right trajectory in terms of sustainable economic growth and progress on the twin
goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity.
