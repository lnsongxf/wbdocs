   Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
INTRODUCTION
Universal access to safe water for all,1 as well as equal access to suitable sanitation and hygiene services
for all, with a special focus on women, girls, and people living in vulnerable conditions, are expected to
be achieved by 2030. For the purposes of meeting this huge challenge, a comprehensive approach that
allows designing and executing suitable investments in ecosystem protection and recovery, sanitary
installations, and hygiene practices, is necessary at all levels.
Results from the School Infrastructure Census (2013 CIE) show that most school buildings, mainly
in rural areas, lack the basic conditions, in terms of seismic vulnerability, corrective maintenance,
furniture, equipment, and physical – legal registration, as well as access to quality water, sanitation,
electricity, telecommunications services, and accessibility for the population with disabilities.
With assistance from the World Bank, the Ministry of Education of Peru (MINEDU) takes on the challenge
and formulates the National School Infrastructure Plan (PNIE) as of 2025. As part of the General
Education Law2 and the National Education Project (PEN),3 PNIE offers, for the first time ever in the
national context, a proposal to plan school infrastructure in the long term under a comprehensive focus
that aims at overcoming the current challenges of improving, rehabilitating, and managing the existing
infrastructure, as well as to plan the new offer. PNIE is supported by a set of technical supporting
papers that were prepared based on the 2013 CIE, one of them being the estimation of the water and
sanitation gap for schools.
This technical note has been prepared by the World Bank’s Water and Sanitation Program as part of
the technical assistance Peru School Infrastructure Program (P152216). This work was led by Malva
Baskovich, water supply and sanitation specialist, supported by a consultant team integrated by Doris
Alfaro, Cecilia Montes Jave, Mercy Sandoval, Abel Bellido and Andres Quispe.

ii Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
    PURPOSE OF THE NOTE
    This Technical Note summarizes the process that has been carried out to estimate the school water
    and sanitation gap in Peru. From an integrating view of the system, the process was organized in four
    phases, and was based on the statistical, legal, engineering, and cost analysis results.
    The four phases in this process included: (i) defining indicators, (ii) defining legal standards, (iii)
    identifying the intervention needs, and (iv) estimating the water and sanitation gap for schools. This
    paper describes the main developed activities, offers details on the tools that were used, and offers a
    set of recommendations to guide the design and execution of similar projects in other countries.
    According to the 2014 CIE, out of a total of 40,100 school grounds existing in the country, 20,699 of
    them require some type of intervention to assure access to water service. The connected towns pose the
    greatest intervention needs, as they account for 70 % of such requirement.

    This document constitutes an opportunity for knowledge generation, in terms of the best integration
    of water, sanitation, and hygiene with the national educational policy, in such a way that access to
    suitable and quality services by schools is increased, and its subsequent positive impacts on children’s
    health and cognitive and social development are generated.

PHASES OF THE PROCESS	
The four phases were:
1.	 Defining indicators
2.	 Defining legal standards
3.	 Identifying the intervention needs
4.	 Estimating the water and sanitation gap for schools.
The first three phases give each other feedback on a permanent basis; in this way, they support the
fourth phase and estimate the water and sanitation gap for schools.

2 Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
Phase 1: Defining Indicators
This phase allowed to delimit the water and sanitation water service that is provided in schools, and its
milestone was to determine the Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE.)
A school’s water and sanitation system was first analyzed, both inside and outside the school grounds.
The prioritized spaces inside a school were the school restrooms; their existence, non- existence, or
conditions allow to define if the students have the necessary number of them. This analysis identified 15
SIASE components that were organized in five indicators, one of them outside the school grounds, and
four, inside the school grounds: the first indicator describes the access; the second indicator involves
the water storage and pumping system; the third indicator corresponds to the suitability of the
restrooms; the fourth indicator is linked to the existence or non- existence of water drinking fountains,
and finally, the fifth indicator involves the rainwater drainage network.
Each indicator’s definition was prepared, for the purposes of assuring a uniform conceptual and operative
management. The table below shows the relationship between the indicators, their components, and definition.

The steps taken to build up these indicators included: (i) defining the decision- making rules by means
of flowcharts, (ii) organizing the assumptions for each indicator’s components, and (iii) preparing the
algorithms methodological paperwork for indicator estimations.
Flowcharts for each indicator helped establishing the required intervention type. As an example, the
graph below shows the flowchart for the restroom suitability indicator.

The required intervention types to assure that a school building meets all five SIASE indicators were
established. The table below shows the proposed interventions to meet the access indicator, and Annex
1 describes all remaining four indicators.

 Access to Water and             Interventions for the Water Supply System
 Sanitation
                                 •	 Connection from the school building grounds to the public potable water network is
                                    required as an intervention. This intervention also includes the water meter component.
                                 •	 Rainwater should be used and a compact water treatment plant should be installed. This
                                    system is installed at those schools located in the jungle area and in communities that
                                    lack a potable water supply utility.
                                 •	 Construction of a water well and a chlorination system. This system is proposed for those
                                    schools located in the Coast and the Andes Mountains and in communities that lack that
                                    lack a potable water supply utility.
                                 Interventions for the Sanitation System
                                 •	 Connection from the school building grounds to the public sewerage network, whenever
                                    the school building is located in a community with a public sewerage network.
                                 •	 In situ excreta and wastewater disposal and treatment system. This intervention is
                                    taken into account whenever the school building is located in climatic zones that are not
                                    floodplains and its community lacks the utility.
                                 •	 No defined intervention. This group of schools demands an in situ sanitation system
                                    but such schools are located in a floodplain zone; therefore, an intervention shall be
                                    evaluated for each case.




4 Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
This first phase offered a series of recommendations to CIE:
•	 Information gathering for all 15 SIASE components should be assured.
•	 Questions should be encouraged to address not only those aspects involving availability, but also
  those involving operativity and maintenance status, for the purposes of measuring the service quality.
•	 Information should be gathered on the sanitation fixtures, and their use should be differentiated upon
  the basis of gender and educational level, as the demand for use and the availability of these fixtures,
  are directly related to both aspects.
•	 CIE’s focus on gathering information on the internal (inside school) water and sewage network
  and the availability of both services at local level, and how the internal (inside school) network is
  connected to the external (outside school) network should be kept. This is a critical point, as there is
  a significant number of schools that are not connected to the public network, although they have an
  internal (inside school) water or sewage network.


Phase 2: Defining Legal Standards
This phase was decisive to guide the identification of school water and sanitation intervention needs,
based on the analysis of the existing sectoral and national policies and standards Its milestone was
estimating the needs to update the national legislation with regard to the Latin American standards.
The route for this phase was based on three aspects: input, process, and outcome. The input was
focused on revising the institutional framework and preparing an inventory of the national and sectoral
regulations; the process analyzed the legislation and compared it with international regulations, and
the indicators were supported in the paper on gaps; finally, the outcome provided legal and intersectoral
interaction recommendations.

                                                   indicators supported


The legislation framework analysis,4 with regard to water and sanitation at schools brought to light the
very scattered existence of budget and sectoral laws issued by the Ministry of Education (MINEDU) and
other sectoral bodies, such as the Ministry of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation (MVCS) and the
Ministry of the Environment (MINAM.)

The alignment between CIE’s school water and sanitation components and the regulations in force
showed that 8 out of all 15 components have not been taken into account in the CIE; this motivated a
search for supplementary information on the technical rules and papers.

6 Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
Legislation was thoroughly revised, upon the basis of each one of the questions in CIE, for the purposes
of identifying the existence or non- existence of any national or sectoral regulations. Annex 2 shows an
example of an analysis of the regulations, upon the basis of the CIE questions.
When analyzing the international regulations, two studies that evaluate the regulations on infrastructure
at Latin American level in the last few years were taken into account;5,6 likewise, regulations were
successfully directly revised and evaluated. The first study offers a comparative analysis of the legislation
and infrastructure in Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Brasil, with regard to Peru, although Peru is not
included as one of the analyzed countries in such study. The IDB study7 explores the infrastructure
conditions in the basic education schools around the region, by using the SERCE database, and analyzes
the connections between the school infrastructure conditions and the school performance in grammar
and mathematics tests of third and sixth grade students.
The main findings include: (i) the development of certification systems for school infrastructure, issued by
infrastructure- specialized institutions, (ii) the progress made in the decentralized infrastructure policy
and management by Mexico and Colombia, (iii) the connection between the design and construction
processes of public buildings, such as schools, and land use (spatial) planning processes that has been
developed in Colombia, and (iv) the decision- making based on evidence research studies.
The legislation analysis of different countries generated a matrix on the supply of toilets, urinals,
sinks, drinking fountains, and water availability that will provide guidance to PNIE. Annex 3 shows the
minimum requirements, in terms of sanitation fixtures, per country.
As a result of this second phase, the following recommendations were made:
•	 The role played by various stakeholders in water and sanitation infrastructure planning and design
  should be identified and defined, and direct interaction between MINEDU and MVCS, the Regional and
  Local Governments should be strengthened.
•	 Aspects, such as operativity, maintenance, and design of all of SIASE’s 15 components should be
  standardized.
•	 A research component for decision- making, from evidence, that measures the investment’s impact on
  infrastructure and learning accomplishments should be structured.
•	 The public investment system should be strengthened so that the locally managed infrastructure
  investment projects respond to the existing legislation and the previously defined quality standards.

Phase 3: Identifying the Intervention Needs
Identifying or quantifying school water and sanitation service access and quality demand reached the
milestone of showing the magnitude of the intervention needs.
Analysis criteria in this phase included:
•	 Each school’s assessment includes the status of each one of SIASE’s 15 components.
•	 Each component’s analysis starts with the minimum unit that is reported in the CIE, and it is then
  consolidated at school level. The analysis units can be any of four types: (i) environment, (ii)
  construction, (iii) grounds, and (iv) school building, as shown in Graph 5.
•	 Methodology for each one of SIASE’s 15 components describes (i) the basic assessment unit, (ii)
  identified questions and information sources, (iii) decision- making rules, (iv) operative definitions
  for the decision- making rules, (v) the algorithm to identify the intervention type per school, (vi)
  elements that need to be taken into account to estimate the gap, and (vii) the component assumptions
  that were made, given the lack of information.

For the purposes of quantifying the interventions for each one of all of SIASE’s five indicators,
a measurement unit was agreed with the MINEDU technical team. Annex 4 shows a table with the
measurement units per intervention component.
The statistical analysis of the information defined the intervention needs for each one of SIASE’s 15
components per scenario and climatic zone.8 Table 4 shows the results of the indicators per required
intervention type, based on some examples per scenario and climatic zone.




8	 In coordination with MINEDU, the criteria for data grouping that could help to estimate different magnitudes of needs
   were defined. For example, the grouping per scenario (Lima and Callao, capital cities, urban centers, connected towns,
   and scattered communities), as well as the grouping per climatic zones (coastal desert, desert, low inter Andean, meso-
   Andean, high Andean, snowy, sub- tropical, humid sub- tropical, and humid tropical) were used. For the purposes of
   estimating the gap, an analysis per department (the country’s political division) was also included.

This third phase generated the following recommendations:
•	 CIE should gather information on the total number of sanitation fixtures (sinks, toilets) that allows
  differentiating the use of these fixtures, based on gender and educational level, as these conditions
  determine the demand for their use and availability.
•	 Information on the number of toilets for students, teachers, and staff should be differentiated, for the
  purposes of distinguishing their use, and prevent underestimating any unmet demands.
•	 Information on the number of faucets in the sinks should be gathered, for the purposes of establishing
  if the number of available faucets is sufficient to meet the demand.


Phase 4: Estimating the Water and Sanitation Gap
Based on the defined intervention needs and the legislation analysis, the cost units for the SIASE
components were defined, as follows: (i) cost unit for the Access indicator was Peruvian Nuevos Soles
per grounds, (ii) cost unit for the storage and pumping system was Peruvian Nuevos Soles per m3 and
cost unit for the water pumping equipment was Peruvian Nuevos Soles per grounds, (iii) cost unit for
the Suitability indicator was Peruvian Nuevos Soles per student, (iv) cost unit for the Drinking fountains
indicator was Peruvian Nuevos Soles per unit, whereas (v) cost unit for the rainwater drainage was
Peruvian Nuevos Soles per linear meter.




10 Evaluation to the Water and Sanitation System in Schools: Comprehensive School Water and Sanitation System (SIASE)
Consultation to multiple sources included NGO and public entity projects, for the purposes of revising
and contrasting referential unit cost information on water and sanitation, as well as school infrastructure.
For cost estimation, descriptive reports and a sample of approved detailed design studies provided
by the DIGEDIE (the General Directorate of School Development) were reviewed, with an emphasis on
restroom specialty. Supplementary, profiles and projects under execution in the National Investment
System were reviewed, for the purposes of defining referential added costs to cost estimation that
support or refine the preliminary findings in the studies.9
A set of cost coefficients were calculated for some interventions: for replacement (an additional 10
%), for elevated tank moderate (30 %) and mild (20 %) rehabilitation costs; for sanitation fixture
maintenance costs (30 %); for chute maintenance costs (30 %), and for rainwater drainage network
downspout maintenance costs (30 %.)
The SIASE costs were combined with costs from other specialties, such as structures (dirt moving,
as- built, ditch digging, etc.), architecture (design, houses, doors, windows, paint, etc.), and electrical
installations (grids, control panels, wiring, etc.) Unit cost database from MINEDU’s executing agency
was used. This generated a cost increase, given the high effect of the structure costs (between 30 %
and 90 % in some cases.)
Transportation costs (placed- at- worksite costs) were included. Annex 5 shows the cost methodology
per indicators and components.
The statistical analysis of the unit cost matrix and the investment need database per indicator provided
the following information:
•	 Total investment required to close the current school water and maintenance infrastructure gap is PEN
  1.936 billion, with the departments of Lima, Cajamarca, Piura, Junin, Hunacavelica, Cusco, Huanuco,
  and Puno being a priority, as they require 50 % of the investment.
•	 PEN 1.173 billion (61 %) should be invested to close the water and sanitation infrastructure gap in
  the rural area.
•	 The evaluation per indicator points out the following:
  −− Closing the school water and sanitation access gap requires an investment of PEN 422 million; this
      represents 22 % of the total investment.
  −− Closing the school water storage and pumping system gap requires an investment of PEN 512
      million; this represents 26 % of the total investment.
  −− Closing the school restroom suitability gap requires an investment of PEN 444 million; this
      represents 23 % of the total investment.
  −− Closing the school water drinking fountain gap requires an investment of PEN 417 million; this
      represents 22 % of the total investment.
  −− Closing the rainwater drainage network gap requires an investment of PEN 139 million; this
      represents 7 % of the total investment.




9	 A relevant piece of information is that in both cases, the proportion of land set apart for restrooms ranges between 3 %
   and 8 % of the project total cost, with this percentage being the highest when a tank and an elevated tank are included.

As a result of having carried out this phase, the following recommendations were generated:
•	 With regard to the cost structure, the preparation of a Referential Database of School Infrastructure
 Construction Unit Costs (structure, architecture, restrooms, and electrical installations) requires to
 be promoted by the PRONIED (the National School Infrastructure Program) cost area; such unit costs
 should be officially approved and regularly updated on an annual basis, and their use should be
 mandatory, for the purposes of formulating investment projects. This concerns not only the Education
 sector but other sectors as well, such as the Ministry of Housing, Construction, and Sanitation.
•	 The cost estimation methodology for the sanitary components needs to be improved and extended
 on an ongoing basis, by compiling more information, in terms of quantity, quality, and diversity, from
 various public and private sources.

CONCLUSIONS
The process carried out to estimate the water and sanitation infrastructure gap has allowed to draw
some conclusions about the view on school infrastructure, the school infrastructure census, and the
intersectoral and multi- sectoral interaction:
•	 The school infrastructure and carrying out the interventions: (i) The school water and sanitation
    infrastructure and its sustainability involves its construction, operation, and maintenance by the
    service personnel, teachers, and students, as well as the hygiene measures adopted by the users.
    In this sense, the school syllabus and management are required to have programs included in
    them that promote behavioral hygiene changes and capacity building for the service’s operation
    and maintenance; (ii) the legislation framework should be supplemented with guidelines that
    include the design, operation, and maintenance of the school infrastructure’s external and internal
    components, for the purposes of assuring a sustainable quality service; (iii) awareness raising and
    promotion processes with the regional governments need to be established in the country for the
    school infrastructure to cause an impact on the learning and development processes at local level.
•	 The school infrastructure census: (i) CIE has taken a great first step towards establishing a view
    on school infrastructure in the country; however, for the purposes of gathering accurate information
    on SIASE, a census sheet should include all 15 proposed components organized under the five
    indicators, (ii) operativity and maintenance status that allow to establish the service quality or
    define maintenance requirements should be incorporated, and (iii) CIE should gather information
    on SIASE’s operation and maintenance capacities from the service personnel, for the purposes of
    establishing the capacity gap, and establish capacity building strengthening actions.
•	 The intersectoral and multi- sectoral interaction: Although there are coordination levels between
    MINEDU and MVCS, mechanisms need to be institutionalized that favor progress towards (i)
    sharing information on the infrastructure gaps and unanimous decision- making, (ii) promoting the
    involvement of the private sector and the civil society in funding and implementing infrastructure, its
    management and maintenance, (iii) identifying common mechanisms and strategies and prioritized
    scopes for the enforcement of regulations, and (iv) coordinating the investment priorities with the
    sub- national authorities and their investment plans by 2025.
