         What is at risk in Nicaragua?
         Economic assets such as residential
         and non-residential buildings are at risk.
         These assets that are exposed to natural
         disasters are referred to as a country’s                                                 Legend

        What are the potential losses in Nicaragua?
        These charts show the estimated potential future losses to Nicaragua that could be caused by earthquakes and
        hurricanes that could occur within a given return period. In 1972, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck Nicaragua. If this
        historical event were to happen in 2015, it would cause losses of US$ 550M amounting to 5% of GDP.
