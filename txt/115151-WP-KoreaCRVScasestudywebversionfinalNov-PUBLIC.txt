EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


C
        ivil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) refers to a universal, continuous,
         permanent, and mandatory recording and documentation of the occur-
         rences and characteristics of vital events, including births, deaths, marriag-
es, divorces and annulments, adoptions, and legitimations in accordance with the
legal and regulatory requirements of each country (United Nations Department
of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), 2015). The system contributes to the
socioeconomic development in each country by recording the critical events of each
country’s population. International organizations, including the United Nations
(UN) Secretariat and Regional Commissions, the World Bank Group, the World
Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF), and nongovernmental organizations increasingly urge governments to
establish a CRVS system that provides baseline data for shaping and implementing
socioeconomic policies.
        This case study on Korea’s experience with its CRVS system is based on
wide-ranging activities such as literature review, interviews with officials and staffs
involved with the system, and international workshops. The content of the report
will play a role as a guideline for developing countries that are striving to imple-
ment and enhance their respective CRVS systems.
        Since the implementation of the Resident Registration Act and the Statistics
Act in 1962, Korea has continuously improved its CRVS system. The CRVS system
of Korea has evolved since the 1960s, relying largely on two basic tools: one is legal
and institutional rearrangements, and the other is digitization and e-government.
CRVS services, which originally were paper-based and required visits in person to
public service centers, have been transformed into an Internet-based service with
diverse channels of transactions for the convenience of citizens. Nowadays, the
main objectives of a CRVS system are to support the government provision of
various services to citizens and to capture and track people’s family relations and
residential information.
        Korea’s CRVS consists of two major parts, Civil Registration (CR) and Vital
Statistics (VS). CR in turn consists of the two distinct but closely related compo-
nents, Family Relationship Registration (FRR) and Resident` Registration (RR).
Based on the objective of recording registration and verification of occurrences

and changes in family relationships, including births,        Projects (NBIS) for computerizing five national key
deaths, and marriages, FRR builds a dual structure of         networks, including administration, defense, public
information on both a per individual and a per fam-           security, finance and banking, and education and re-
ily basis. The goal of RR is to carry out appropriate         search. The administration network covers six databas-
administrative activities and to deliver public services,     es closely related to CRVS: RR, real estate registration,
including employment, public welfare services, and            automobile registration, population statistics, employ-
social security, through the assessment of residential        ment, and customs. The MOI’s RR information sys-
relationships and other indicators of population move-        tem (Government for Citizens project, G4C) was de-
ment. Meanwhile, the Resident Identification Number           veloped in 2002, and its portal website (Minwon24)
(RIN), which is a ‘personally unique registration num-        in 2013. Minwon24 now meets the expectation that

are recorded on the RR Certificate Card, which is the         izens. The Supreme Court developed its FRR informa-
national identity card (NID) for the verification of the      tion system in 2007, and linked it with the national
cardholders’ residency.                                       system of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) in 2008 and
        The VS reflects a country’s fundamental demo-         with the MOI’s RR system in 2011. In addition, the

        The Korean government has transformed its             tronic Government Act and the Personal Information

1       INTRODUCTION


Background

Korea is a peninsular country located in Northeast Asia at the triangular point of
contact between China, Japan, and Russia. The country had spread its cultural her-
itage over Japan from early times to the middle ages, but became its colony in the
early 20th century due to its failures in industrialization. The aftermath of World
War II beginning in 1945, the division of Korea into South and North in 1948,
and the Korean War in 1950 combined to leave the country in the 1950s one of the
world’s most poverty-stricken countries.
        In the 1960s, when the Korean government faced similar challenges that
developing countries are encountering today, including social needs for rapid in-
dustrialization, it began to institutionalize its resident registration (RR) system and
population trend survey. Historically, Korean dynasties have carried out property
assessments and basic censuses for tax collection, military drafts, and public proj-
ects since as early as the 7th century. However, the introduction of the RR system
in 1962 was a political and administrative response to the impoverished economic
situation of the time, which pressured the government to initiate economic devel-
opment (Table 1.1).
        The main goals of the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system
of Korea are to help the government capture and track people’s family relations
and residential information as well as to provide various public services, including
welfare services, child vaccinations, and education. The RR Act and the Statistics
Act were enacted in 1962 to manage the residency and migration of the entire
population and labor force in conjunction with the country’s first Five-Year Eco-
nomic Development Plan (1962–1966). The Korean government recognized the
demand for a comprehensive CRVS system that would serve as the administrative
base for rapid urbanization and industrialization. In 1987, the government began
to develop databases for RR and population statistics as a part of National Basic
Information System (NBIS) projects. The RR database development project aimed
to provide computerized front-office services to citizens throughout the country.

2          THE FRAMEWORK OF
           CRVS


Governance Structure

Korea’s civil registration (CR) system consists of the two distinct but closely related
components of FRR and RR. FRR builds institutional structure both per individ-
ual and per family for the purpose of registration and verification of occurrences
and changes in family relationships such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces,
and adoptions. RR assesses residential relationships and population movements
to enable the carrying out of appropriate administrative activities and the delivery
of public services such as employment, public welfare services, and social security.
The Population Change Survey (PCS), a key component of Vital Statistics (VS),
is a national statistical survey based on the individual FRR system. Statistics Korea
integrates the batch data of the PCS collected by local governments and makes the
data public on a monthly basis. FRR, RR and PCS inter-relate with each other in
terms of subject of registration, overseeing authority, registration address, and regis-
ter book (Table 2.1). FRR is a medium for displaying a permanent address to verify
family relationships based on bloodline and kinship, whereas RR is a policy tool for
managing the residency of citizens. Citizens and public servants are legally obliged
to register any changes and the entire processes related to the FRR and the RR, or
they have to pay a fine. This requirement helps offices in charge, collect, and update
CRVS information in databases in a timely and precise manner.
        In terms of CRVS governance, Korea has in place a hybrid system of CR
operation and maintenance where both central and local governments exercise
their own roles and responsibilities. (See Table 2.2) The Supreme Court, the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI), and Statistics Korea, respectively, assume FRR,
RR, and VS policy domains, and are responsible for planning, developing, and
managing the national database system, and for monitoring and evaluating the
national systems as a whole. At the local government level, actual registration

              INFORMATION
              SYSTEM


Overview

The Korean government started to institutionalize the CRVS system (RR, FRR and
PCS) in the 1960s based on paper work processes. In the 1980s, however, it began
to build the civil management information system (CMIS) to achieve efficient work
processes and effective service delivery of the CRVS.10 Clear goal-setting and proper
strategic prioritization of master plans became the main factor for the success of the
CMIS. In Figure 3.1, the left side of the horizontal axis indicates the back office
management (supply side), the right side indicates the front office service (demand
side), and the vertical axis indicates the top-down approach initiated by presidents
and/or prime ministers and the bottom-up approach by departments. The history
of Korea’s CMIS shows a typical N-type growth model. The Korean government
started with the enactment of the RR Act and a paper-based CRVS service at the
first stage (localized automation within each agency in the 1960s and the 1970s).
The second stage was to develop the RR database and other national key database
developments from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, followed by the third stage,
which was to build an Internet-based e-government service in the late 1990s. The
final stage is to build G4C (the prototype system of Minwon24), AISS, and the
National Computing and Information Service (NCIS) Center for integrated ser-
vice of FRR, RR, and VS.

10	   The term “Civil Management Information System” in this report is used widely to mean
      e-government systems, necessary for implementing CRVS system, consisting of the key
      components including databases, digitized work processes, portal websites, government
      intra-network, and the Internet.

                REGULATIONS


Governance Structure

The CRVS statutes of Korea consist of four levels: the constitution and acts
(National Assembly); enforcement decrees (presidential decrees); enforcement
rules or regulations (ministerial decrees); and municipal ordinances and rules (local
governments). This chapter primarily addresses crucial act-level stipulations that
describe the structure, functions, and work processes of organizations in relation
to the development, operation, and maintenance of CRVS and CMIS systems.13
        Acts related to CRVS and CMIS largely consist of three areas. First, acts
related to the institutionalization of CRVS that were enacted in the 1960s and
subsequently amended several times stipulate institutions, processes, and processes
of CRVS as a key tool for building national fundamentals of social and econom-
ic development. They are the Family Relationship Registration Act, the Resident
Registration Act, and the Statistics Act. Second, several acts were enacted after the
1980s to promote CMIS development and utilization as a critical part of national
informatization and electronic government. They are the Framework Act on Na-
tional Informatization, the Electronic Government Act, the Software Industry Pro-
motion Act, and the Official Information Disclosure Act. In addition, in order to
exploit emerging technologies for government innovation, the Korean government
in 2014 put into force the Act on Promotion of the Provision, and in 2015, the Use
of Public Data and Act on the Development of Cloud Computing and Protection
of its Users. Third, the Korean government enacted two basic acts related to privacy
protection and cybersecurity. This third area of legislation helped lead to increased
social awareness and concerns. They are the Personal Information Protection Act

5          CRITICAL SUCCESS
           FACTORS


Strong Political Will and Leadership

In a presidential system where the president, as the head of government, leads an
executive branch in policy formulation as well as policy implementation and service
delivery, strong political will and continued engagement of the president are the
most important factors for the success of a CRVS agenda. In Korea, the enactment
of the RR Act and the development projects of the RR database, online service
(G4C and Minwon24), AISS, and NCIS, have all been undertaken as part of pres-
idential agendas since the 1960s.
       Presidents of Korea have mobilized organizational, human, and financial
resources throughout the entire government in order to attain administrative goals
related to CRVS. They have institutionalized various advisory committees under
their jurisdiction to facilitate their agenda by exploiting skilled expertise in the
private sector. For example, in 1987 the Chief of Staff to the President became the
Chairman of the Computer Network Steering Committee for the RR database de-
velopment project, one of six Administrative Networks projects. Presidential com-
mittees have become a common organizational design for e-government projects
since the 2000s (Table 5.1). Since 2014, the Government 3.0 Committee, which is
in charge of developing personalized services to citizens as part of the presidential
agenda, has been undertaking the task of innovating CMIS depending on easy
accessible applications loaded onto mobile phones. One important rule worthy of
note for organizing these high-level committees is that more than half of the com-
mittee members conventionally consisted of private sector actors, such as university
professors, researchers, and business consultants, in order to utilize their profession-
alism and technical expertise.

6          LESSONS AND POLICY
           IMPLICATIONS


Legal and Institutional Arrangements

Korea has enacted several laws on CRVS and CMIS in order to meet the expecta-
tions of citizens as well as to keep up with institutional and technological changes
occurring since the 1960s. The enactment of the RR Act and the Statistics Act in
1962, along with the launch of the first Economic Development Plan, was a start-
ing point. Thus, the present legal system is made up of the historical accumulations
of developments during the past half century. These laws and regulations enhance
the accuracy and consistency of CRVS data and promote the efficient and inte-
grated management of CMIS. Developing countries, however, do not necessarily
have to follow this legal system of Korea. Rather, an enforceable single law that
identifies the key elements of CRVS, CMIS, and personal information protection
and that stipulates them together into a harmonized manner may suffice. In cir-
cumstances where developing countries have a weak legislative capacity due to an
unstable political environment, it is recommended that they design a framework of
CRVS and CMIS into an integrated format. In this case, a draft of civil registration
law can include four crucial parts as below:

  1.	 Civil registration: births, deaths, marriages, divorces, residency and migration;
      national identity management (registration record card, identification num-
      ber, identification card) and population change survey
  2.	 Database development and e-government services: digitization of CRVS data,
      development and operation of e-government service of CRVS, information
      sharing among public agencies
  3.	 Personal information protection and cybersecurity: collection and use of CR,
      restrictions on collection, use, and transfer of CR, restriction on management
      of identification numbers

7          CONCLUDING
           REMARKS


A
         civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system draws on many sectors of
          government, including statistics, health, civil registry, finance, and plan-
          ning. This system plays a significant role in public administration not only
by providing individuals with legal identity and civil status, but also by generating
information that can be used for planning, monitoring, and developing diverse
government services. The data is also essential for identifying and monitoring key
health issues in the population. However, in developing countries, citizens usually
have a low awareness of the significance of the CRVS system, so that the usage and
participation rates of CRVS systems remain very low despite the government’s ef-
forts to promote CRVS systems. A key challenge is how to overcome practices, tra-
dition, or customs that seemingly reject the very act of registration of a vital event,
such as in the case of indigenous peoples’ preferences to have babies delivered at
home or to make arrangements for their deceased based on religious reasons. Most
low- and middle-income countries with paper-based records of birth and death
events have difficult in retrieving and sharing information between government
agencies for better policy-making.
        The CRVS case study of Korea shows a number of important implications
for developing countries that are striving to develop their own CRVS system.
        First, The Korean government may not have designed an ideal type of CRVS
at the outset, but it has transformed and continuously upgraded the system to make
it more efficient and customer-oriented.. Even today, the government is making
efforts to provide customized CRVS service using state-of-the-art technologies such
as mobile devices, Internet of Things, and cloud computing. The government is
also trying to make the legal and institutional rearrangements timely and consistent
with these technological advances. An example of a key success factor is that politi-
cal and administrative leadership play key roles in the establishment, consolidation,
and management of a CRVS system for national goals aimed at economic develop-
