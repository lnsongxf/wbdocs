affordable child care and long-term efforts to
shift norms to make opportunities more equal
are important countervailing policies. Message
10 discusses these barriers that keep youth from
entering the labor market.

The 10 messages demonstrate that many factors
disproportionately affect jobless youth. Often
young people bear the brunt of the structural
and cyclical vulnerabilities that are embedded
in the functioning of labor markets in the
region. But the challenges faced by cyclically
unemployed and structurally jobless young
people in SEE6 differ, and so do the policy
responses to address them. For the former,
it is vital to keep youth engaged in the labor
market during recessions and build their
human capital while the labor market recovers.
For the latter, the policy agenda is deeper; it is
necessary to address the disincentives to work
and hire youth embedded in exclusionary labor
regulations and labor taxation; equip new labor
entrants with the skills the market needs; and
improve their access to productive inputs, such
as land, finance, and professional connections.

Policy measures to combat joblessness could
often have much more importance for youth
than other age groups. But the SEE6 policy
agenda to address youth unemployment
and inactivity is not an isolated agenda; it
is an agenda for higher overall employment
with specific elements for youth. Therefore,
measures promoting overall job creation should
be complemented, not replaced, by measures
focused on youth.

Gender gaps in employment among youth
exist, mostly driven by gaps in participation.
While gender gaps in youth unemployment
rates are not large in SEE6 (Figure 9), substantial
differences remain in the labor market activity
rates of young men and young women. On
average, a difference of about 20 percentage
points separates the activity rates of young
men and women, but the difference is as high
as 40 percentage points in Kosovo. Differences
are even larger when taking into account
ethnicity. For example, in Serbia, young Roma

  Box 1 Economic Cost of Gender Gaps in SEE6

  Gender gaps in the labor market at any age mean that an important pool of potential workers
  is underutilized, limiting growth potential. Cuberes and Teignier 2015 estimate that “lost” income
  per capita due to gender differences in SEE6 averages about 18 percent, with the loss highest in
  Kosovo at over 28 percent (Figure B1.1). Poor labor market outcomes for groups aged 15–24
  account, on average, for 11 percent of the total potential income loss, reaching 33 percent when the
  next cohort (25–35) is included (Figure B1.2). About a third of the estimated lost income is due to
  distortions in the occupational choices for women and men, the rest to costs associated with gender
  inequalities in labor force participation. Put differently, in SEE6 income per capita could rise both
  from eliminating gender gaps among youth in labor force participation and in entrepreneurship, as
  well as from more equal participation in traditionally male-dominated occupations, which pay more.

Box 2 Youth Unemployment and the Crisis in Spain: A Tale of Two Labor Markets

In past decades, reform of employment protection legislation (EPL) in Europe was mostly
partial or two-tier. In the mid-1980s, several European countries with considerable EPL, introduced
temporary contracts to increase labor market flexibility; many countries deregulated the use of
temporary contracts substantially but maintained strict protection for permanent ones. Spain is a
good example of this labor market dualism, having the highest incidence of temporary contracts.
After 1984, when a two-tier EPL reform liberalized the use of temporary contracts, temporary jobs
more than tripled, from 11 percent of total employment in 1983 to about 35 percent in 1995 (Guell
and Petrongolo 2007).

The duality of the Spanish labor market has often been held responsible for Spain’s persistently
high unemployment. A large share of the workforce had precarious fixed-term labor contracts, unlike
workers who had open-ended, usually full-time, contracts. Among those with fixed-term contracts,
young workers were exorbitantly overrepresented: In 2010, 56 percent of contracts for workers aged
15–24 were temporary, and it was they who disproportionately suffered job losses when the crisis
hit Spain. The differences in employment protection between the two types of workers give rise to
insider-outsider dynamics in wage formation mechanisms, with temporary workers as the outsiders
(see Bentolila, Dolado, and Jimeno 2011). The minimal moderation of wages in Spain at the outset
of the crisis has also been attributed to the asymmetry of employment protection and bargaining
power.

Temporary contracts have both good and bad effects. Because they can help firms to evaluate
worker suitability for jobs, temporary jobs could act as a stepping-stone to more stable jobs. Temporary
contracts might also function as a shock absorber, protecting firms from temporary demand
fluctuations by avoiding costly adjustments to their core labor force. Boeri and Garibaldi 2007 and
Boeri 2011 show that the “flexibility at the margin” provided by temporary contracts increases both
hiring and firing rates for newly created jobs as firms try to restrict firing costs through reduced
conversion. Despite helping to create labor market dynamism and employment, however, temporary
contracts can also adversely affect investment in skills, and higher turnover and low conversion
rates can reduce incentives to invest in firm-specific human capital (Dolado, Garcia-Serrano, and
Jimeno 2002; Bentolila et al. 2008). Guell and Petrongolo (2007) argue that the negative impact of
temporary work on vocational training depends on whether temporary contracts are used mainly to
lower wage costs or to screen for entry-level jobs.

In short, by reducing the commitment employers must make, fixed-term contracts can help low-
skilled youth find a first job. However, the long-term impact of such contracts on these workers’
careers may be negative. Spain’s inability to tackle the dual characteristics in past labor market reforms,
in fact, partly explains the poor labor market outcomes of young people during the crisis years.
Using Spanish social security data, Garcia Perez, Marinescu, and Vall-Castello (2016) have rigorously
analyzed the impact of the 1984 liberalization of fixed-term contracts in Spain. They found that the
reform raised the likelihood of male high-school dropouts working before age 19 by 9 percent, but
in the longer run it reduced the number of days worked by 4.5 percent and earnings by 9 percent.
The difficulties Spain has had over the past years in reducing youth unemployment exemplifies the
long-lasting effect that incomplete labor market reforms can have in response to large output shocks.
