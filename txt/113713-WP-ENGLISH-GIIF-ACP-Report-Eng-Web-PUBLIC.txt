According to a recent report published by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction,
natural disasters have cost the global economy $2.5 trillion since 2000 and have adversely affected
millions of people. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 1 in 8 people on the planet
go hungry every day. As climate change threatens the productivity and reliability of agriculture, it
is critical that we recognize the risks and take action to mitigate the developmental challenges of
agricultural and food security.
As discussions of agriculture, climate change and related risk-management tools intensify, the role
of the Finance and Markets Global Practice—one of the 19 Global Practices of the World Bank
Group—has become more important and relevant than ever. Not only do we support our clients and
shareholders to develop financial systems that are deep, diversified, inclusive, efficient and stable, we
also support innovative financial solutions that help combat and mitigate risks associated with climate
change.
The particular role of insurance is very important for the work of the Finance and Markets Global
Practice because it helps us work toward achieving the World Bank Group’s twin goals of ending
extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. First, it builds deep and diversified financial
markets, of which the insurance sector is a major component. Second, it is an effective way to protect
the most vulnerable and to promote inclusiveness. As we know from experience, climate change
and natural disasters affect the poorest most heavily and, as a result, disaster risk insurance and
agricultural insurance have become significant tools to protect the livelihoods of the poor.
On this front, index insurance is one of many instruments that we have in our toolkit that help farmers
and micro-entrepreneurs gain better access to finance and manage financial losses arising from
more frequent and more severe weather events due to climate change. With the combination of
financial, knowledge and advisory services, we are proud to support the development and growth of
local markets that enable access to finance and build index-insurance markets through the Global
Index Insurance Facility (GIIF). Not only has the program helped more than 1.3 million farmers and
micro-entrepreneurs in the Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Asia-
Pacific regions gain valuable access to credit and finance, and thus be able to repay their loans after
a weather shock, its work has also supported additional development objectives of the World Bank
Group, such as empowering women farmers to make financial decisions in Sri Lanka and enabling
better financial guarantees at the regional level in the CFA franc zone (the CIMA region). The program
has also generated a great deal of enthusiasm and willingness to contribute within the institution,
among our donors, and among international and regional development partners like ILO, GIZ/BMZ,
USAID, IADB, BOAD, to name just a few.
On behalf of the World Bank Group, and of the GIIF Program in particular, I would like to extend
my gratitude to the GIIF’s donors including the ACP Secretariat/the EU, the Government of the
Netherlands and the Government of Japan. Without this support, GIIF’s work of building farmers’
financial resilience worldwide, and of providing them with a means to access finance and credit, would
not have been possible. We highly value your trust, and we are committed to working closely with you
to ensure that you receive full visibility and recognition for your support.

Executive Summary
This report was prepared for the donors of the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) Program, mainly,
the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States/the European Union, the Netherlands
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japan Ministry of Finance to keep them updated on the program’s
achievements and on the progress of project implementation. These achievements and lessons
learned are the result of joint efforts, hard work and commitment with our implementing partners on
the ground. We are grateful to all of these partners, and the enclosed report aims to clearly highlight
their role and details of their projects.
Prepared collaboratively by the GIIF team across the globe, this report also offers a snapshot of past
and future activities, including GIIF’s roles in capacity-building, outreach and communications efforts.
The team gratefully acknowledges our partners and stakeholders for their valuable contribution of data
and information.
As an example of the synergies between the public and private sectors, the GIIF Program has
been working to deliver access to finance to the most vulnerable since 2009 by supporting the
development and growth of local markets for agricultural and parametric insurance in developing
countries, mainly in the Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia-Pacific
regions. Because the world is experiencing increasing risks associated with climate change and
natural disasters, it is our priority to work to mitigate these risks before they move individuals back into
the poverty cycle and endanger their economic and social survival. Against this backdrop, we look
forward to continued collaboration with our donors, and we remain committed to provide access to
finance to our clients in the years to come.

             Index insurance is a relatively new but innovative
             approach to insurance provision that pays out
             benefits on the basis of a predetermined index (e.g.,

One of the unique elements of the project is the usage of mobile technologies to provide
insurance services to smallholder farmers. Farmers can “try out insurance” by insuring as little
as one bag of seed. Insuring one acre of maize against drought costs a farmer ≈ 37 USD, or 10%
of harvest value. Any payout is transferred to the farmer’s mobile phone wallet at the end of the
season.

for the initial uptake of the Index-based livestock
insurance (IBLI) products. The target clients were
individual pastoralists, both large and small scale.
Since the pastoral livestock depends on the pastures
as the only source of food, an index-based livestock
insurance that monitors the forage availability
through satellites and relates this to livestock deaths
was picked as the best option. The support from
GIIF was aimed to enable to maintain the contract at
a reasonable price so that farmers in the Marsabit
region can afford insurance.
The project provided the best practices in satellite-
based livestock insurance. At project close in June
2013, more than 3,600 contracts had been sold.
Since project close, the Government of Kenya has
based its large scale livestock insurance program on
the IBLI product developed by ILRI.

             between 2011 and 2014. During the project period,
             10 new index insurance products were designed

             on index based insurance carried out across project

Pacific   Papua New Guinea
          Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a lower middle
          income country located in the Asian-Pacific region.
          Agriculture is the predominant source of livelihood in
          the country, with the agricultural sector accounting
          for 67% of the total labor force in 2010. PNG has
          a very high exposure to earthquakes, tsunamis and
          volcanoes as well as being affected by climatic perils
          including tropical cyclones and the influence of the El
          Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle which brings
          with it extremes of drought and excess rain and
          flooding.

          the backbone of the PNG economy by providing food,
          income, and employment to the vast majority of the
          rural population, the Government of PNG requested
          technical assistance from the World Bank for an
