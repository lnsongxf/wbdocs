THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        for Project Designs, Construction and Real Estate Modification
        and Order for Commissioning Completed Building the Kyrgyz
        Republic” approved by Government of KR on May 30, 2008, by
        Resolution # 252, the issuance of Architectural Planning
        Conditions (APU) shall be conducted according to One-Stop-
        Shop principle. The list of documents required for issuance of
        APU was reduced. In particular, a business is only expected to
        complete an established application form which contains
        information on the type of upcoming construction and submit it
        along with the following documents: copy of the land title that
        verifies that a land plot was purchased or leased, letter of
        attorney, and invoice on advanced payment (advance payment is
   1    required while obtaining an APU, the remainder is paid after a           28 days               KGS 18,500
        business receives the APU).

        A territorial architecture and construction body, within 3 business
        days, performs the check for compliance of an application form
        with requirements set by urban planning documentation. In case
        of non-compliance, the territorial architecture and construction
        body issues a Report on Non-compliance of Construction and
        returns the application without approval. In each case the body is
        obliged to indicate the established types of permitted land use
        pursuant to the urban planning documentation.

        In case the territorial architecture and construction body
        approves the application, it submits the application for further
        approval to the sanitary and epidemiology body, fire authority,
        and environmental authority. After that, the application is
        forwarded to the utilities companies by the main coordinating
        agency - State Construction Department - for obtaining technical
        terms to install utility systems using One-Stop-Shop principle

      without participation of the applicant.

      As of February 12, 2009, Government Resolution #121
      introduced amendments to the Regulation “On Order for Issuing
      Permits for Project Designs, Construction and Real Estate
      Modification and Order for Commissioning Completed Building
      the Kyrgyz Republic” approved by Government of KR on May 30,
      2008, by Resolution #252. There are now only two technical
      conditions that must be obtained in a compulsory manner --
      water/ sewage and electricity. The remaining communications
      can be obtained on a voluntary basis by applicants and are not
      linked to obtaining the architectural planning conditions.
      Meanwhile, if the applicant suggests alternative solutions to
      connecting to engineering facilities, then requests for technical
      conditions are not filed at all. Based on the functional purpose of
      the building, approvals from sanitary and fire authorities are
      applied using a risk-based system. Simple objects would not
      require approvals from these authorities.

      Additionally, requirements for documents to be submitted along
      with the application have been clarified. These administrative
      simplifications made the process of issuance of architectural
      planning conditions faster and possible to comply within the
      time-limit of 20 working days (28 calendar days).

      Despite reforms in disclosing the information on fee schedules,
      the process of cost calculation for this procedure remains
      nontransparent.

      The payment can be made at the counter of State Architecture
      Department of Bishkek City. Then the shares of each respective
      utility provider are transferred without BuildCo visiting each
      separately.

      APU is executed in two copies - one is issued to the applicant
      and the other is filed with the architecture and construction
      body.

      parts of the city that can be considered to have the proper
      geological study. In that case BuildCo would have to request a

      Request approval of project, expertise of project documents
      and obtain building permit

      This procedure consists of three stages: approval of project
      documents, expertise of documents and issuance of building
      permit. All three stages are done under the one-stop shop
      principle. A single application is filed by the applicant to obtain
      all these approvals.

      The approval of project documents consists of two stages: initial
      review of drawings and plans and other relevant chapters of the
      projects is done by the territorial branch of State Architecture
      Department. BuildCo submits at this stage its application along
      with the following documents:
      • Project documents (drawings, plans); private projects are not
      required to submit any financial segment of the project
      (abolished by the Resolution #252)
      • Engineer-geological study (for expertise)
      • Copies of letters authorizing persons responsible for
      construction works: technical supervision, author supervision;
      and for contractor (for construction permit)
      • Copies of licenses for construction works (for construction
      permit)

      State Agency of Architecture and Construction and other
      licensed agencies which have the right to provide an engineering
      assessment of objects no lower than two stories, stating the
      possibility of reconstructing, re-profiling or re-planning of
      objects (for construction permit). Any other documents are
      considered illegal.

      The authority must issue its approval within 10 working days.

      Following that it will send two copies of all documents for review
      by the State Expertise Authority. According to Resolution #252
      (30.05.2008), and Government Resolution #75 as of February 4,
      2009, the expertise can be conducted by private companies, but
      until now there has not been a single license issued for expertise
      works.

      The nature of the expert assessment has been changed as well.
      In the past, the expert assessment was focused on the cost
      estimate of the project, which is prohibited by the above-
      mentioned regulation.

      The expert assessment of the project design documents is
      conducted by the State Expertise Authority and its territorial
      bodies or privately licensed companies to check the following
      aspects:
Doing Business 2016                     Kyrgyz Republic                                                  29

      • Compliance of the object with requirements set by the
      architectural planning conditions, project design terms and city
      planning documentation
      • Justification of space-planning and construction decisions,
      construction materials and equipment, solidity and durability of
      the bearing structure of buildings
      • Checking the results of the geotechnical survey

      Based on the results of the conducted expert assessment, the
      State Expertise Authority prepares a report on compliance of the
      project design documents with normative requirements. In case
      of any irregularities, the State Expertise Authority prepares
      another report on bringing the project design documentation in
      compliance which identifies the irregularities or a report on
      refusal of approving the project design.

      Under current legislation there are categories of objects that do
      not require state expert assessment. There are notions of
      mandatory and voluntary expert assessment and possibility for
      expert assessment of project documentation by private experts
      or organizations. BuildCo’s case would qualify for the expert
      assessment.

      No later than one day following the approval date, which is 20
      working days for projects higher than 1000 sq. m., the report
      with the positive expert assessment is submitted to State
      Architecture and Construction Supervision for issuing a
      construction permit.

      The State Architecture and Construction Supervision has to issue
      the building permit within 10 working days. Otherwise, the
      silence-is-consent principle applies. However, in practice the
      State Architecture and Construction Supervision does not accept
      silence as consent rule. Amendments regarding construction
      supervision process were made to Law “On Changes to Law of
      the Kyrgyz Republic” #101 as of March 30, 2009, “On City
      Construction and Architecture of the Kyrgyz Republic” Article 40,
      and Government Resolution #95 “On approving the Order on
      Classification of Construction Object Characteristics and Order of
      Conducting State Architecture-Construction Supervision,
      Reconstruction and Other Real Estate Objects in the Kyrgyz
      Republic.” According to these reforms the building supervision
      process is now based on a risk-based approach. Compulsory
      state control over the building process is applied for buildings
      that fall into high-risk category. Low-risk categories (i.e.,
      buildings less than 1,350 sq. m.) are now subject to author and
      technical supervision and do not require state supervision. Thus,
      it removes the need for signing a special contract with State
      Architecture and Construction Supervision and paying the
      respective fees. Both author and technical supervision can be
      done by BuildCo staff.

      At the time of issuing the building permit, BuildCo will receive a
      schedule of inspections to be carried out by State Architecture
      and Construction Supervision. The inspections will take place
      three times: foundation works, structure and a final inspection.

      requirement has been eliminated under the general
4     administrative simplification process. The authority responsible     5 days       no charge
      for issuing this document is now the City Road Department
      under Municipality of Bishkek, formed in August 2008, and
      replaced the Authority of District Administrations. Under the new
      provision there is no fee related to this procedure.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
