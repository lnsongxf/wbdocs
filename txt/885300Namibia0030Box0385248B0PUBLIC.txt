I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Namibia
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Namibia regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Namibia;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Namibia;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Namibia; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Namibia.
       Use data to help inform Namibia country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In April and May 2013, 314 stakeholders of the World Bank in Namibia were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations/firms; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs;
community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade
unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A
total of 90 stakeholders participated in the country survey (29% response rate).
Respondents either completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency (via
face-to-face or telephone interviews) or they received the questionnaire via email and returned it
accordingly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Namibia; their overall
attitudes toward the World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s
knowledge work and activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in
Namibia; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Namibia.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Namibia: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Namibia is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Namibia.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Namibia, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Namibia solve its development challenges, the extent to which the Bank should seek to
   influence the global development agenda, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most
   productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest
   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to reduce poverty in
   Namibia, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Namibia, the extent to which the Bank
   meets Namibia’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s
   level of effectiveness across thirty-two development areas, such as economic growth.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and
   quality of the Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a
   contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as working with the World
   Bank increasing Namibia’s institutional capacity.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Namibia: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Namibia’s development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Namibia. Respondents
   were also given a list of priorities from the National Development Plan IV and asked to
   indicate which would benefit from the World Bank playing a leading role, which should
   receive little support from the Bank, and which should be left for the Government to manage.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s websites and Development Information Centre. Respondents were asked about their
   awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy, past information requests from the
   Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result
   of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement
   that they know how to find information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Namibia, and their geographic location.

III. Demographics of the Sample

Current Position

       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of the President/
        Prime Minister were combined with respondents from the office of a Minister;
        respondents from bilateral and multilateral agencies were combined; and the few
        consultants/contractors working on Bank-supported projects and respondents from the
        office of a Parliamentarian, local government, PMUs, the media, and trade unions were
        included in the “Other” category.

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Respondents across all stakeholder groups indicated statistically similar levels of
        familiarity with the World Bank. However, it should be noted that respondents’ ratings
        of familiarity with the Bank were significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions
        of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Namibia as well as significantly, moderately
        correlated with perceptions of the Bank’s relevance to Namibia’s development and the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Namibia.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Namibia, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results inc rease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Namibia. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at international trade competitiveness.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Namibia, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at international trade competitiveness; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at energy.

development in Namibia. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
