                               Why SUSTAIN?

                               How can businesses achieve and SUSTAIN stronger
                               performance? How can they maximize profitability
                               while contributing to positive long-term impact
                               on society and the environment? How do
                               companies across the world, large and small, tackle
                               sustainability challenges and how can they learn
                               from each other?
                               Moreover, how can IFC leverage its unique
                               vantage point at the intersection of business and
                               development to highlight fresh perspectives from
                               pioneers and thought leaders from the private
                               sector, as well as from governments, international
                               organizations, and academia?
                               These are some of the questions that have guided
                               the creation of SUSTAIN, IFC’s print and electronic
                               platform for sharing cutting-edge business
                               solutions with companies and partners across
