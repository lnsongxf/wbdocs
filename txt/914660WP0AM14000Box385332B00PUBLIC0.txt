   A REFORM AGENDA FOR
   EUROPE’S LEADERS
   Sponsored by the IMF’s European Department

  E
          urope’s new leaders are taking the policymaking reins as the acute phase of the euro
          area crisis is subsiding, but with serious challenges remaining and many voters having
          signaled their discontent. Despite improving economic prospects, the obstacles to strong
   and sustained growth remain significant, unemployment is stubbornly high, reform fatigue is
   setting in, and financial market fragmentation persists. The seminar will bring together a set
   of panelists from the public and private sectors and academia to discuss the merits of further
   economic and financial integration following European elections: whether more integration
   is necessary and feasible to ensure the long-term viability of the euro area; what types of
   integration are likely to command support and whether this would be sufficient to generate
   enough growth to reduce very high unemployment; and whether partial integration is a
   sustainable outcome.

    This paper attempts to determine the impact of
    community participation projects on the management
    of solid waste in some selected areas of Faisalabad,
    Pakistan. The government of the Punjab province
    initiated a project to upgrade the environment and
    solid waste management system in Faisalabad in dif-
    ferent phases. This project was thought to be successful
    because it created a great sense of ownership among
    the residents of that particular society. With the help
    of questionnaire techniques, 800 households and shops
    in commercial areas were surveyed. The results have
    shown that the awareness campaign had a highly sig-
    nificant impact on the mindset of people. The behavior
    of people toward solid waste management has also
    been changed.

   A
            n uneven global recovery continues but growth has weakened in 2014—reflecting
            a surprisingly weak first quarter in the United States and a less optimistic outlook
            for several large emerging market economies. Global growth is expected to
   rebound but downside risks remain a concern. Market conditions have noticeably eased
   alongside disappointing growth, but risks to financial stability are a key concern from an
   extended period of low rates and from a possible reversal of recent risk spread and volatility
   compression. Geopolitical risks have risen in some corners. Looking ahead, global growth
   could be weaker for longer. Robust demand momentum in advanced economies has yet
   to emerge, and supply-side constraints and tighter financial conditions over the past year
   in some major emerging market economies weigh on growth. Amid these economic and
   financial worries, there is renewed interest on exchange rates and reform of an international
   monetary system with de facto dollar dominance. The debate will focus on how policymakers
   could collaborate globally to better manage the risks and durably boost jobs and growth.

      n the wake of the crisis, we are witnessing a depletion of trust and a loss of faith in
      markets—with evident implications for financial stability, economic growth, and social
      cohesion. As a result, economists and policymakers are increasingly coming to the view that
   economic concerns cannot be divorced from ethical concerns. This seminar would facilitate a
   discussion of these issues, bringing together leading policymakers and other thinkers on the
   topic from a broad range of fields including the financial sector, academia, and religion. The
   discussion will reflect upon the continued tendency of the financial sector to prize short-term
   personal gain over longer-term social purpose; it will also explore implications of the idea that
   financial markets (and capitalism in general) are only sustainable if there is trust in the system,
   which in turn requires minimal standards of ethics and integrity.

   FINANCING ASIA’S
   NEW GROWTH MODELS
   Sponsored by the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department

   A
             sia is transforming from a manufacturing hub to a group of vibrant, diverse, and
             interconnected markets with a rising middle-class population. The financial sector
             needs to serve Asia’s transformation to its new growth models—growth that is
   more consumption driven and more inclusive, with the private sector playing an increasingly
   important role. Such a transformation in the region would also have far-reaching effects for the
   rest of the world. Some key questions for discussion in this session include (1) how can Asia
   develop a long-term investor base (for example, pension funds and life insurance) to provide a
   stable source of finance for infrastructure and companies? (2) how can Asia’s financial systems
   better support small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups, and the region’s service sectors?
   and (3) what are the appropriate roles for the private and public sectors in the process of
   financial development?

   Sponsored by the World Bank Group’s Office of the

   T
          he upcoming Post-2015 development agenda will be more ambitious than its
          predecessor, the Millennium Development Goals. The new agenda embraces concepts of
          environmental, social and economic sustainability. Achieving these transformational goals
   will require financing that goes beyond current resources, while focusing on being innovative
   and inclusive. The event will explore how to facilitate an effective launch of the post-2015
   agenda with all partners. It will familiarize Ministries of Finance and Development with
   the emerging goals, discuss the pillars of a financing approach, and draw upon lessons from
   case studies that apply a proposed financing framework to countries in diverse circumstances.
   Hosted jointly with the Multilateral Development Banks as part of the process of preparing a
   joint paper on issues of financing development, this event will engage high-level representatives
   of Ministries, the United Nations, the private sector, bilateral agencies, foundations, CSOs, and
   other development partners.

   O
             ur ability to feed a growing planet and achieve food security in uncertain and
             extreme climatic conditions will depend in large part on how we manage already
             strained natural resources for agriculture and aquaculture. This event will provide
   a better understanding of the environment-water-food nexus and the role that climate
   smart agriculture, sustainably managed landscapes and seascapes, and modern monitoring
   technologies can play in meeting food security and environmental needs. Speakers will
   represent business, civil society and public sector perspectives on political actions and
   investment priorities to maintain virtuous cycles that preserve natural capital, build resilience
   and sustain food security for all.

   GROWTH AND REFORM
   CHALLENGES
   Sponsored by the IMF’s Strategy, Policy, and Review
   Department and Research Department

  D
            rawing on the themes and lessons from the previous sessions, this concluding session
            will bring together policymakers and others with practical experience in the reform
            process to discuss the important dilemmas with which countries must inherently
   grapple as they seek to implement reforms to deliver job-rich and inclusive growth. Countries
   recognize that structural reforms are needed to raise medium-term growth prospects, but some
   reforms may be difficult to sell politically given winners and losers in the short run. A further
   balance needs to be struck between the scaling up of public infrastructure investment and the
   accompanying increase in public debt, which exacerbates the already-high debt trajectories in
   many countries. Similarly, there is concern about the pace and sustainability of global growth
   and growing concerns about the rise in inequality, yet a balance is needed to ensure that policy
   measures help reduce inequality without harming growth. Some key questions for discussion
   in this session include (1) are there better ways to design structural reforms that are both
   politically and socially more palatable, and that would also achieve the best possible impact in
   achieving sustained growth? (2) how do countries ensure that the gains from public investment
   offset the risks flowing from a further debt buildup? and (3) what lessons can we draw from
   cross-country experience about the impact of reforms on income distribution and growth in the
   short and medium terms?

   Endangers Our Future. New York, New York: W. W.

   This work examines how the wealthy classes have
   contributed to growing inequality in society and
   explains how the quest to increase wealth has hindered
   the country’s economic growth as well as its efforts to
   solve its most pressing economic problems. The author
   argues against America’s vicious circle of growing
   inequality. America currently has the most inequal-
   ity, and the least equality of opportunity, among the
   advanced countries. While market forces play a role
   in this stark picture, politics has shaped those market
   forces. Here the author exposes the efforts of well-
   heeled interests to compound their wealth in ways that
   have stifled true, dynamic capitalism.

          Mozambique, iron ore in Guinea, copper in Mongolia, gas and gold in Latin America,
   oil, gas, bauxite and gold in Central Asia. If managed well, these can contribute to sustainable
   development, but when poorly handled they can present long-term challenges for governments,
   communities and the environment. How can governments capture and channel revenues from
   this resource wealth into smart investments? How can they unlock this wealth to make it work
   for the poor? What can we learn from past experience?

    2014.
    “Business and Development: Changing Discourses
    in the Extractive Industries.” Resources Policy 40
    (6):4–16.

    This paper analyzes development agency policy doc-
    uments and corporate reports to identify converging
    and diverging discourses and changing “institutional
    logics” by key actors in extractive industries. For ex-
    ample, attempts by the United Nations Development
    Programme and other international organizations
    to manage the outcomes of market-driven develop-
    ment in extractive industries have given rise to a logic
    seeking good governance, while a parallel “logic” of
    partnership for development drives that of the private
    companies in the extractive industries sector. These
    coinciding trends may lead to fragmentation in the
    sector, or prompt a move toward greater convergence
    and restructuring.

   PUBLIC DEBT, PUBLIC
   INVESTMENT, AND GROWTH
   Sponsored by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department
   and Research Department

   T
          he global financial crisis has left a legacy of very high public debt across advanced
          economies, which has elicited calls to gradually decrease public debt to reduce risks of
          sovereign debt crises and to reestablish buffers. Public infrastructure in many countries
   has also deteriorated and consequently affected growth trajectories, prompting calls for scaling
   up public investment, given the still very low real costs of public borrowing. Some key questions
   for discussion in this session include the following: First, is a further debt buildup warranted
   to meet public investment goals? How can the efficiency of public investment be improved?
   Second, Is the legacy of high public debt a problem, or should countries simply live with higher
   public debt in the future? Third, what normative guidelines are appropriate for countries as
   they try to manage the multiple challenges associated with high public debt, deficient public
   infrastructure, and lackluster medium-term growth prospects?

   T
         he global economy has been transformed by changes in trade and investment. Business
         processes that once took place only within national borders have been broken down into
         ever-smaller components, spread across many countries in the form of Global Value
   Chains (GVCs). GVCs offer developing countries the potential to grow faster, import skills and
   technology, and boost employment and productivity. Opening borders and attracting investment
   are important, but governments must also invest in education, boost infrastructure connectivity,
   and set the right labor market policies. Panelists will discuss these issues from the perspective of
   multilateral organizations, the private sector, and individual, developing-country governments.

    Global value chains are playing an increasingly im-
    portant role in business strategies, which has pro-
    foundly changed international trade and development
    paradigms. Global value chains now represent a new
    path for development by helping developing countries
    accelerate industrialization and the “servicification”
    of the economy. Global value chains can create new
    opportunities on the labor demand side, but supply
    and demand cannot meet if the supply is missing. This
    potential gap illustrates the importance of embedding
    national global value chain policies into a broader
    portfolio of policies aimed at upgrading skills and
    physical and regulatory infrastructure, and enhancing
    social cohesion.
