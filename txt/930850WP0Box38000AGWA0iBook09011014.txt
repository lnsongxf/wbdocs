“In grappling with long-term climate change, it is natural to turn to climate modeling for guidance …
The models, which are essential for elucidating the global climate system, have been informative in
some applications related to agriculture or water development over large regions. But for many
planning and design applications, especially when applied to smaller areas, to precipitation, and to
extreme events, models often give too wide a dispersion of readings to provide useful guidance. A
review of the application of these models…found that they are often used as a backdrop for urging the
adoption of ‘no-regret’ actions, and rarely for quantitative decision-making on options.”

Limitations of bottom-up assessments
     The bottom-up approach relies on top-down informa-
tion to inform the likelihoods of future climate conditions;
this is essential. The scientiﬁc understanding of physical cli-
mate mechanisms (and speciﬁcally, response to changes in
forcing) informs the experiments performed using bottom-
up techniques. Without these inputs from the physical cli-
mate modeling community, the bottom-up approach would
lack a basis for selecting the range over which to test the
vulnerability of the system. The vulnerability exploration
would be imprecise and unbounded, and of limited
decision-making value.

Concluding remarks on bottom-up approaches
     For most risk-assessment applications in water re-
sources management, bottom-up approaches are more rele-
vant than top-down approaches since climate impacts are
difﬁcult to untangle or correlate with hydrologic changes
(Matthews and Wickel 2009, Parmesan et al. 2011). How-
ever, both top-down and bottom-up approaches can poten-
tially provide complementary information (Le Quesne et al.
2010). The selection of an approach, alone or in combina-
tion, should be guided by the level of speciﬁcity and conﬁ-
dence necessary: local scales, operations decisions, and the

tem) performs poorly, the RDM procedure makes modiﬁca-
tions to the strategy (or system) that hedge against vulner-
abilities. Finally, the trade-offs involved in the choice
among the hedging options are explored.

      Because RDM samples from all combinations of uncer-
tain system parameters, it explores futures both more be-
nign and more dire than the present. In a full RDM analy-
sis, various aspects of candidate strategies would be succes-
sively altered and resubmitted to the RDM process until a
suitably robust strategy was identiﬁed. A particular
strength of RDM is its ability to model complex systems; its
framework enables it to analyze very large numbers of sce-
narios in which any or all system and design parameters
are altered in any number of conﬁgurations (RAND 2013).

     Using an approach similar to decision scaling, RDM
characterizes uncertainty in the context of a particular deci-
sion. However, RDM applies equal probability to all consid-
ered climate futures and identiﬁes adaptation strategies
that perform well across as wide a range of those potential
futures as possible. This type of approach thus makes it
very difﬁcult to weight extreme scenarios to which the ad-
aptation strategy is vulnerable in proportion to the many
less extreme scenarios to which it is robust. Importantly,
RDM also includes iterative and adaptive decision strate-
