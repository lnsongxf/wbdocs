SUMMARY


       This note has been prepared as part of the work program on multi-dimensional poverty in
the Kyrgyz Republic to raise awareness of poverty dimensions, which in turn should help
accelerate the development of water supply and sanitation services, and necessary reforms in the
Kyrgyz Republic. The note analyzes the quality and reliability of the Integrated Households
Survey (KIHS) data to measure access to water supply and sanitation services.
        The household survey was conducted by the National Statistics Committee (NSC) of the
Kyrgyz Republic. It is representative at the national, rural/urban, and oblast levels. Using survey
data we analyze the consumption of water supply and sanitation services at the household level
with a focus on access, quality, and expenditures.
         Evidence from the KIHS suggests that water supply and sanitation services are unequally
distributed in urban and rural areas and for poor and non-poor. Households with higher incomes
are better off. Low availability of water supply and poor water quality combined with poor
sanitation lead to high morbidity of the population and lower productivity in rural areas, therefore,
of poor people. The analysis shows that the KIHS is a rich source of information that can be
actively used for monitoring progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS); however, the official
statistics on WSS services need to be improved.

INTRODUCTION
1.      The importance of ensuring the population’s access to clean water and sanitation is
seen by the inclusion of a specific target in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
seventh goal “ensuring environmental sustainability” adopts a target of halving, by 2015, “the
proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic
sanitation”. Access to clean water and sanitation services are a basic necessity for ensuring healthy
living conditions. Globally, about 750 million persons lack access to improved sources of drinking
water, whereas 2.5 billion still lack access to improved sanitation facilities.1

2.      Analyzing of the water supply and sanitation sector with focus on the poor is
important for two reasons. First, it is important for understanding poverty dimensions by
showing how people are poor not just in monetary terms but in access to water and sanitation
services. A recent study for the Kyrgyz Republic shows that water and sanitation currently are two
of the key areas where nonmonetary deprivation is among the highest of key public service
delivery areas. Second, understanding the differences in access to water supply and sanitation
services of the poor is important to determine unique constraints and potential solutions. If the
sector is going to target mainly the bottom 40 percent in service delivery, it needs to better
understand their characteristics, the constraints to serve them, and opportunities to reach them.

3.      The MDG targets on access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities seem to be
on track in the Kyrgyz Republic; however, aggregated numbers hide regional disparities,
differences in quality and access. According to the WHO and UNICEF Joint Monitoring
Program (JMP) 88 percent of population in 2012 had access to safe drinking water from improved
sources, while remaining 12 percent use unimproved drinking water sources2. An "improved"
drinking-water source is defined by JMP as one that adequately protects the source from outside
contamination, particularly fecal matter3. About 92 percent of population have access to improved
sanitation facilities, defined as facility that hygienically separates human excreta from human
contact4. These high numbers in access to basic services  drinking water and sanitation facilities
 hide huge differences in access to WSS services between regions, income groups as well as
differences in quality of WSS services and facilities.

4.      Water supply and sanitation services are highly fragmented in the Kyrgyz Republic
making it difficult to adopt system-wide changes. At the institutional level, water supply and
sanitation services are provided and delivered by municipal utilities (“vodokanals”) in urban areas
and by village administrations (ayl okmotu) and Community Drinking Water Users Union
(CDWUUs) in rural areas5. The lack of adequate equipment, human capital, and funding for

5CD WUUs were initiated in 2002 in the framework of the World Bank project on Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSP –1). They are the
community based democratic institutions responsible for water supply management on the level of villages. The CDWUUs are registered as legal


                                                                    vi
maintenance and expansion of these services makes it difficult for municipal authorities to sustain
and increase access to quality services.

5.     The importance of the WSS sector in understanding of poverty demands reliable data
source to monitor progress. The Kyrgyz Integrated Households Survey (KIHS) is the main
source of information on poverty and welfare in the republic because it has comprehensive
information on living conditions, including access to WSS services. The KIHS has been conducted
since 2003, which allows comparing results and progress the country made between years. It is the
only one continuous households survey, that is representative on national, rural and urban, and
regional (oblast) level. The household data give the following basic information on WSS services
from the demand side: differences (i) between urban and rural areas, (ii) among regions; (iii) poor
and non-poor; (iv) in infrastructure from consumers’ prospective. However, it has not been widely
used for policymaking.

6.      This note analyzes developments in access to clean drinking water and basic
sanitation for the Kyrgyz Republic from 2005 to 2012 and recommends how to improve the
statistics to monitor progress. The note looks at differences in access between urban and rural
dwellers – and between nonpoor and poor. We analyze the annual Kyrgyz Integrated Household
Survey (KIHS), which reflects national, urban and rural sectors, and oblast levels. We also analyze
the consumption of water supply and sanitation services at the household level with a focus on
access, quality, and expenditures. The note attempts to show existing disparities in access to safe
drinking water and sanitation facilities using available household’s data and to understand why the
KIHS is not actively used for decision-making purposes on WSS infrastructure investment issues.

7.      The analyses suggests that the KIHS is informative and reliable source of information
on Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services in the country. However, the questionnaire on
WSS services needs to be improved in order to be used actively in monitoring and decision-making
purposes. Combining of household survey and administrative data will provide evidence base for
monitoring and policy-making especially for construction of water supply and sanitation services
infrastructure.

8.      Evidences from the KIHS suggest that water supply and sanitation services are
unequally distributed for the people in urban and rural areas and for poor and nonpoor.
Households with higher incomes are better off. Low availability of water supply and poor water
quality combined with poor sanitation conditions create a solid basis for high morbidity of the
population and lower productivity in rural areas, therefore, of poor people.

sanitation services, respectively. The limitations of the KIHS to monitoring purposes are

1. WHAT THE KIHS SHOWS ABOUT WATER SUPPLY SERVICES DEVELOPMENTS

1.1     Although the population’s access to safe drinking water6 improved significantly from
84 to 93 percent between 2005 and 2012 according to national official statistics, there are
huge disparities among regions7. Full coverage by a piped system exists only in Bishkek.
Though as a whole Bishkek has a better developed water supply system, in some semi-formal
residential districts infrastructure for clean drinking water does not exist at all or does not meet the
standards (UNDP, 2013). Many people in semi-formal residential districts moved to Bishkek
seeking jobs and have low incomes. In some regions  Chui, Issyk-Kul, Talas and Jalal-Abad
oblasts  there is high coverage (more than 90 percent in 2012). But in others, there are low
levels of access: in Batken (71 percent in 2012), Osh (89 percent) and Naryn (89 percent) oblasts8.
Small towns and rural settlements in particular have inefficient and irregular services and poor
water supply infrastructure (World Bank, 2013).

1.2     Households are supplied with access to water by different systems. These include a
connection to piped running water (in urban centers and villages with rehabilitated network,
individual well with pump, springs and other natural bodies of water). The KIHS collects
information on households’ access to water by source.9 The KIHS defines the availability of water
supply for the household if the household reports that it has piped water supply. In this note, we
define a “safe” drinking water /an “improved” drinking-water source is one that, when well
constructed and properly used, adequately protects the source from outside contamination,
particularly of fecal matter. For the Kyrgyz Republic those sources are identified as follows10:

       Piped water into dwelling, also called a household connection, is defined as a water service
pipe connected with in-house plumbing to one or more taps (e.g. in the kitchen and bathroom).
       Piped water to yard/plot, also called a yard connection. This is a piped water connection to
a tap placed in the yard or plot outside the house.
       Public tap or standpipe. This is a public water point from which people can collect water.
A standpipe is also known as a public fountain or public tap. Public standpipes can have one or
more taps and are typically made of brickwork, masonry or concrete.
       Protected spring. The spring is typically protected from runoff, bird droppings and animals
by a “spring box”, which is constructed of brick, masonry, or concrete and is built around the

   Safe drinking sources according to the national official statistics include: Running water pipeline at home
(apartment); well; artesian well; private water tap; public (communal) water tap

  The question in the KIHS is “What is the main water source used by your household? 1 . Running water pipeline at
home (apartment); 2. Well; 3. Artesian well; 4. Private water tap; 5. Public (communal) water tap; 6. Storage
reservoir, river, lake, pond, aryk; 7. Imported water (water-cart); 8. Spring.”

spring so that water flows directly out of the box into a pipe or cistern, without being exposed to
outside pollution.
       Protected boreholes. These are typically are connected to a piped network.
Unsafe sources of drinking water include shallow wells, tanker water, cisterns, unprotected
wells, springs and boreholes.

1.3     An increasing share of the population uses communal water taps as their main water
source. Concurrently there is a decline of water pipelines to homes (apartments), especially
in urban areas, which may be indicative of deterioration of the water supply infrastructure in
urban areas. The use of communal water taps as a main source of water increased from 25 percent
in 2005 to 32 percent in 2012 in urban areas, whereas share of running water pipeline at
home(apartment) reduced to 55 percent in 2012 from 60 percent in 2005 (Figure 1.1) indicating
worsening of the proper access to clean drinking water. This change in the structure of main water
sources reported by households might be driven by deteriorating of water supply infrastructure in
small towns and growing population in big cities – Bishkek and Osh.

1.4     Half of rural residents rely on communal water taps as their main source of water
and less people use unsafe open drinking water sources than in earlier years. The use/or
consumption of water directly from open reservoirs, rivers, lakes, ponds, or irrigation ditches
(aryk)11 in rural areas has been reduced from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2012 probably due
to the wide donors support in construction and reconstruction of water infrastructure in rural. At
the same share of rural population having communal water taps has been increased by almost 13
percentage points over period of 2005-2012 (Figure 1.1).

1.5     .Large disparities exist between urban and rural residents in availability of piped
water supply indicating differences in access to safe drinking water. In 2012 availability of
pipe-borne water supply in urban households improved by 2 percentage points in comparison to
2005, and it has not changed significantly for rural residents. Since the poor households do not
have enough income for construction and purchase of a water pipeline by themselves, availability
of water utilities for the poor in average across a country is significantly lower (14 percent in 2012)
than for the non-poor (35 percent in 2012). However, mainly the urban poor gained access to
improved water sources between 2005 and 2012, probably, due to an increase of communal water
taps (Figure 1.2.). At the same time it seems that in rural areas share of poor population having
water utilities has been reduced from 5 percent to 3.5 percent indicating that access for this group
of people has been worsened (Figure 1.2).

Note: “Availability of water supply” is defined as an existence of a household connection to the pipe-borne water
supply system. If it is reported by a household that it has connection, it is assumed that water supply is available for
a household.

1.6     Distance from household’s home to the nearest water source is much larger for rural and
poor households than for urban and non-poor, which implies relatively lower access to water and
greater time spent by households on transporting water for their basic needs. About 14 percent of
rural population and 17 percent of poor households have to travel 200-500 meters to the nearest
water source in 2012 (Figure 1.3). This is supported by the fact that about 68 percent of rural
residents and about 61 percent of the poor have to use water sources that are not on their premise.
The time spent on water gathering could be spent more productively in the labor market or for
other households needs. The proportion of urban residents having the nearest water sources less
than 100 meters have been slightly increasing over time from 66 percent in 2005 to 67 percent in
2012.12

1.7     Regression analyses confirms that residence urban/rural and region impact availability of
piped water in households along with attitude and consumption. Households in high attitude areas
have less access to water supply, which might be explained by challenges to construct water supply
infrastructure in high mountain areas. Households with higher consumption per capita tend to have
higher probability to access the water supply, confirming disparities in access to different income
groups. (Annex 2).

1.8     The population in rural areas and the poor not only suffer from low access to piped water
but also from more often interruptions, suggesting disparities in services quality. More than 80
percent of rural population had water interruptions in 2012 (from which 7 percent were interrupted
once a month). This might indicate about poor reliability of water utility maintenance. The ratio

of interruptions is twice lower (even though high) in cities – about 40 percent of population were
interrupted at least once a year. The poor population had significantly higher frequency of
interruptions in comparison with the non-poor. The share of the poor having unsatisfactory water
supply services has been increasing over the years: in 2012 the poor having interruptions several
times a year increased by 5 percentage points in comparison to 2005.

1.9     Rural households are more likely to have to travel to their water source off of their
premise. The KIHS does not collect information on the time spent by members in water transport
(though it could be estimated broadly from the distance information). However, the recent
Demographic and Health Survey (2012) collects information on time spent in obtaining drinking
water (roundtrip). Based upon the DHS sample, about 68 percent of households have water on
their premise (92 and 54 percent in urban and rural areas respectively). In rural areas, though 46
percent do not have water on their premise, only 5 percent of rural households spend 30 minutes
or more to obtain drinking water.

1.10 Despite the fact that expenditures of households on cold water13 in 2012 were slightly
higher than in 2005, water facilities are significantly under-financed. In 2012 a household paid
annually in average 1050 soms in urban areas and 730 soms in rural. In real terms expenditures in
2012 on cold water were 3 times higher than in 2005 (Figure 1.4). However, collection of cold
water payments continuously has not been covering 100 percent in regions with significant under-
collection in Talas, Osh, Jalal Abad and Issyk-Kul oblasts (Figure 1.5). Vodokanals are not able
to provide high quality services due to lack of resources and deteriorating of water supply
infrastructure. Expenditures on water services from the state budget are also low, amounted 0.1
percent of total state budget expenditures (135 mln. KGS) in 2012. The revenue/cost ratio for

  There are two types of water supplied in the Kyrgyz Republic: cold and hot water. Hot water in centrally supplied in
big cities such as Bishkek and Osh. Payments for cold and hot water supply services are collected separately. Cold water
payments collected by Vodokanals, while hot water payments as a part of bill for heating.

water delivery varies from 0.32 to 1, which indicates insufficient revenues to cover costs of
providing water services (Regallet, 2011). Financing from budget sources and revenues from
water services covers operational costs only, and it is insufficient to maintain needed investment
in infrastructure. Available BOOST data for 2010 shows that only 0.004 percent of total state
budget expenditures spent on water supply. Lack of resources leads to worsening of service
provision and further aggravates quantity and quality problems.

1.11 Metering coverage is very limited in urban and rural areas alike according to the
KIHS. Only 1.6 percent of population had cold water meters in their households in 2012. Meters
are more often installed in urban areas (2.8 percent of urban population) than in rural (1 percent of
rural population). Generally meters are not shared with other households. Sporadic usage of
meters leads to strong incentives to under-report volumes population uses, which further lead to
insufficient payments for water supply and low revenues of “vodokanals”.

1.12 The centralized hot water supply system covers mainly the population living in
apartments in Bishkek and Osh. In the Kyrgyz Republic, as part of the Soviet legacy, selected
areas (mostly urban) had hot water piped into the homes of the population. However, the hot water
infrastructure has deteriorated over the years and not kept up with population growth or new
construction. Over the past seven years, an estimated 11 percent of the population receives piped
hot water. In rural areas only 1 percent of rural population had hot water in comparison to 28
percent of urban population in 2012. Nevertheless, hot water is an important necessity for personal
hygiene of population, especially in winter. The low availability of hot water (and the high expense
associated with personal hot water heaters) may help to explain why the use of public bath/shower
rooms is common (by about half of the urban and rural population).

Construction Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic on sufficient access by rayons shows that Toguz-
Toro, Ak-Syi, Toktogul and Ala Buka rayons in Jalal-Abad oblast have relatively higher poverty
rates and low access to water supply (Figure I.6), while rayons in Chui oblast have high water
access and relatively lower poverty rates. In Issyk-Kul oblast – Jeti-Oguz, Tup and Ton rayons –
access to water supply is propoor.

1.14 Urban and rural households experience large differences in availability of showers.
Availability of personal bath or shower facilities for rural areas is minimal (3 percent in 2012) in
comparison to the urban population (37 percent). More than 95 percent of the rural population
have outdoor bathrooms and do not have one indoors. Low availability of baths and showers for
households implies that 64 percent of rural population and about 50 percent of urban population
have to use public bath and shower rooms. The situation is even more severe for poor households:
only about 8 percent of poor population has bath or shower in 2012, implying that 74 percent of
poor population use public bath and shower rooms.

2. WHAT THE KIHS SHOWS ABOUT SANITATION SERVICES DEVELOPMENTS

2.1     Sanitation is a good indicator of the state of living conditions in a community and
more generally in a country. Sanitation services refer to the disposal of human waste (excreta).
The lack of proper sanitation impacts child survival, education levels, and malnutrition—with
implications for childhood cognitive development and future economic productivity. It has
significant impact on adults human potential as well, because directly affects their health.
According to the World Bank, “The economic losses are mainly driven by premature deaths, the
cost of health care treatment, lost time and productivity seeking treatment, and finding access to
sanitation facilities. Pollution resulting from improper disposal and treatment of wastewater and
domestic fecal sludge also affects both water resources and ecosystems. 14

2.2      “Improved sanitation” ensures hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact,
proper sludge15 disposal, and a clean and healthful living environment both at home and in the
neighborhood of users.16 Facilities that ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human
contact include: (i) flush or pour-flush toilet/latrine to a piped sewer system, a septic tank or a pit
latrine, (ii) ventilated improved pit latrine, (iii) pit latrine with slab, and (iv) composting toilet.17

2.3     Sewage and water treatment systems were constructed mostly in the 1960-80s, and this
infrastructure has undergone significant decapitalization. Currently only 6-17 percent of total
housing stock in the republic has sewage and water treatment system (Korotenko, Kirilenko, &
Prigoda, 2013). Even in big cities water disposal system serves only half of the population, for
instance in Kara-Balta city – 25 percent, in Jalal-Abad city – 30 percent and in Naryn – 13 percent
(UNDP, BIOM, 2014). Many villages and small towns do not have sewage systems and
functioning wastewater treatment systems at all, and 83 percent18 of population has to use toilets
with a cesspool, the upkeep of which is expensive. The poor quality and low access to sanitation
services might be explained by the fact that sanitation and construction of sewage systems has not
been seen as a priority by the Government (WHO, 2012). Currently the situation seems to be
changed.

2.4     Availability of approved sanitation facilities is low and vary significantly across
regions, urban and rural. Even in the capital is the access to the approved sanitation facilities
does not exceed 85 percent of population. Generally sanitation facilities are available marginally
for households in all regions (Figure 2.1). About 4 percent of population has a toilets with central
sewage system or septic in Batken oblast, 6 percent - in Naryn oblast, 8 percent – in Osh and Talas
oblasts, indicating strong difference of sewage infrastructure between the capital and other regions.

across the country at the level of 45 percent.

2.5    Improvement in access to public sanitation services, which include sewerage and septics,
has been improved slightly by 3 percentage points between 2005 and 2012 mainly due to an
increase of services to the urban population, in particular, to the poor. The share of urban poor
households having access to the sewage system has been increased from 27 to 35 percent of urban
population (Figure 2.2). While the poor urban residents gained access to basic sanitation services,
the proportion of rural poor having sewerage is only 3.5 percent and has not been changed over
time.

2.6     The quality of sanitation services for urban residents has been worsening recent
years. Only 37 percent of population have a connection to the central sewerage system in urban
areas (Figure 2.3) and the ratio has been decreasing over time (41 percent in 2005). This might be
explained by breakdowns of the central sewerage infrastructure due to the wear and tear of the
system and increasing pressure on the central sewage system from growing population, especially
in Bishkek and Osh.

2.7     Access to sanitation facilities such as central sewage system is extremely low in rural
areas. Only 2 and 1.3 percent of rural population use water closet connected to the central sewage
system and to septic tanks, respectively. Those households have been living near the cities and
having connections to the centralized sewage system of cities. Majority (96 percent) of rural
residents use toilets with a cesspool (pit latrine) (Figure 2.3). A recent study (Bakashova,
Jorritsma, Choitonbaeva, & Wendland, 2013) shows that “the toilets are difficult to use at night
and during winter because of the absence of light and cold temperatures”, which leads to associated
health problems such as urinary tract infections, especially for women.

2.8     Administrative data from the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation Development on
access to water disposal system confirms low access in many rayons. An overall average access
does not exceed 5 percent of total residents, while only one rayon – Panfilov in Chui oblast has 40
percent sufficient access. Tup, Toguz-Toro, Ton, Alai, Kochkor have poverty rates higher than 60
percent and very low access to water disposal system (Figure 2.4).

2.9     Low availability of sanitation facilities has been causing unsanitary conditions at
schools. According to the survey conducted under the UNICEF project (UNICEF, November-
December, 2013) in 76 percent of schools in Naryn, Issyk-Kul, Talas oblasts do not have
centralized sewage system. Flush toilets available mainly in Bishkek (Figure 2.5) and lacking in
rural areas. Shortage of sewage systems in rural areas leads to lack of toilets inside rural schools
and reflects badly on children’s health. Majority of rural schools have only toilets with septic
located nearby schools, which do not satisfy hygienic and sanitary requirements (UNICEF, 2011).
In many cases existing toilets at schools are old and dirty, constructed from planks, cinder block
or bricks, never treated with disinfectants (UNICEF, 2011). Maintenance of sanitation facilities
are constantly under-financed in local scanty budgets leading to inadequate sanitary conditions.

2.10 Insufficient availability and quality of water and sanitation services have significant impact
on health of population and worsen quality of life. Oblasts with the worst conditions of access and
provision of clean drinking water have higher levels of mortality of children under one year-old
from parasitic and infectious diseases (UNKyrgyzstan, 2013). According to the data of the NSC
this indicator per 10000 born children was the highest– 11.6 and 16.5 – for Batken and Osh oblasts
in 2012, respectively, in comparison to the average national level of 9.4 children per 10000 born
children (NSC, 2013).

2.11 Yet, despite this under-investment in sanitation infrastructure, the Kyrgyz Republic’s
population follows ideal hygiene habits in terms of hand washing —which is a key action in
limiting the spread of diseases diarrhea, anemia, stunting, and wasting. According to the DHS, 98
percent of surveyed households had a place for washing hands and 87 percent had water and soap

available (Figure 2.6). There was significant variation across oblasts and only small variation
across wealth groups19.

2.12 Poor water supply and sanitation infrastructure supports continuously high level of
intestinal infections incidence in the republic. Among the acute intestinal infections the most
widespread infections are bacillary dysentery, paratyphoid fever, typhoid fever, and viral hepatitis
A, which are related to unsanitary conditions and water quality. Average intestinal infections
incidence in the country has been increased from 332.4 (in 2001) to 490.2 (in 2010), reaching the
highest registered level in Batken oblast - 4161 (980,0), and Jalal Abad oblast - 5400 (552,8)
(UNDP, BIOM, 2014).

2.13 Low revenues or even chronicle budget deficits of local budgets, weak human and
equipment capacity significantly limit the sustainability of the water supply and sanitation systems
in the long-term prospective. Low coverage by water supply and sanitation services and poor
water supply and sanitation infrastructure trigger reduction of services quality. In long-term
prospective lack of attention from government policy might lead to most lamentable consequences
for human capital of the country.

3. LIMITATIONS OF THE KIHS TO MONITOR WSS IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

3.1    The sample survey nature of the KIHS creates limitations for its use in monitoring
of the WSS sector. Following important for policy-making issues are difficult to monitor using
KIHS: (i) WSS infrastructure, (ii) quality of WSS services; (iii) access to WSS in small
administrative level such as town and ayil okmotu; (iv) intrahousehold effects.

3.2     The KIHS cannot provide information on WSS infrastructure (e.g., length of pipelines,
quality of pipeline, and etc.), correspondence of water to technical and health quality standards,
coverage by particular water supply company (how many houses are covered), qualitative
estimations of water consumption. This is because households usually do not know technical
issues, connections details, etc.

3.3     The KIHS is difficult to use for quality of services because it does not measure quality in
terms of quantity, accessibility, safety, reliability or continuity of services. For example, it is
difficult to understand the main reason for interruption: was it because a households did not pay
for water services, or due to poor services quality of water supplier. Improving the KIHS for
monitoring purposes will require questions on such dimensions of accessibility of as time to
source, and whether the facility is shared.

3.4    The KIHS is limited in estimating WSS for small administrative areas such as ayil
okmotu and towns. However, data at subregional/provincial levels are needed to inform decision
making on where to target inventions. A population census and KIHS combined with
administrative data could be used to visualize poverty and access to WSS down to small
administrative areas.

3.5     The KIHS is limited in understanding intrahousehold effects of accessing WSS
services. It is difficult to analyze differences in important dimensions of WSS access and use
including, for example, gender equity, age, and disability. National household surveys provide
data on a) whether a household is headed by a male or female, b) the number of male and female
household members, and c) the number of people with disabilities in a household, none of this
enables analysis of intrahousehold inequalities. However, analysis by the gender of the head of
household is fraught with methodological issues including that female households may be
receiving remittances from migrant male members or that culturally the eldest living member (who
may be female) may be considered the head of household.

3.6      The KIHS is an informative and reliable source of information on WSS services; however,
it gives information on WSS services only from households’ perspective. The household data give
information on differences in access to WSS services between urban and rural areas, among
regions; poor and non-poor. It is representative at national, oblast, rural and urban levels. The
KIHS can be used as a good source of information for policy-making and for evidence based
investment decisions. This will help to understand service-delivery constraints and potential
solutions to improve services for the poor and bottom 40 percent.

4. HOW TO MAKE THE KIHS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR MONITORING

4.1    Following recommendations to improve use of the KIHS in monitoring purposes can be
given:

    Combining household survey data with additional layers of administrative data

    Visualization of WSS access data down to the lowest administrative levels

    Strengthening questions on WSS in the KIHS toward incorporation WSS sector needs for
     monitoring and evaluation

    Strengthening capacity in government agencies to work with microdata

4.2     Complementing household survey data with additional layers of administrative data will
potentially improve monitoring of access and quality of WSS to the poor and the bottom 40
percent. In this case the KIHS will be used as a source of information on welfare and characteristics
of the bottom 40 percent, and a new database of the Department of Water Supply and Sanitation
Development, State Construction Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic will provide information
regarding different dimensions of WSS quality. Administrative data often subject of to over- or
underreporting, because water suppliers have only information about those who connected to their
networks. This is in particularly relevant to sanitation services, because the poor and many
nonpoor households use on-site and will not be captured by administrative data.

4.3     Combining NSC’s and administrative datasets on WSS should be used as a basis for
multidimensional policy responses. Because the KIHS has extensive health module, it can be
more actively used for monitoring in health, nutrition, and social safety net programs. This
potentially may improve service delivery by highlighting linkages with health outcomes. Targeting
public investment for WSS to poor communities creates positive externalities for household health,
and is an investment in human capital.

4.4     Visualization of WSS access data down to the lowest administrative levels, using combined
administrative and the KIHS data, will be useful for policy making to enable pro-poor targeting.
This will help understanding how services are geographically distributed throughout a country
with a focus on the poor and bottom 40 percent. The poverty maps prepared by the World Bank in
collaboration with the National Statistical Committee can be used as the first step for this purpose
(Annex II).

4.5     The combining the datasets should be done by the statistical agency, while analyses and
policy decision should be made by the implementing WSS reform government agency. This will
require use of the same coding in both agencies to ensure possible integration of datasets as well
as more close cooperation between agencies. It can help highlight linkages between other sectors
as well to foster cross-sectoral collaboration to enhance poverty-reduction efforts. Creation of
poverty -WSS profiles based on two datasets will specify where services are failing the poor as
well as successful cases.


                                                 15
4.6     Questions related to water supply and sanitation should be strengthened toward
incorporation WSS sector needs for monitoring and evaluation in consultations with water supply
and sanitation specialists. Following components might be added to the questionnaire: (i)
information on reasons of interruptions of water services (problems with maintaining of the water
supply system, debt on water services and etc.); (ii) willingness to pay higher portion of incomes
for better quality; (iii) quality of water supply (satisfactory, not-satisfactory); (iv) questions on
such dimensions of accessibility of water WSS as time to source and etc.

4.7     Strengthening capacity in government agencies to work with microdata in particular
with the KIHS. Currently government agencies generally work with cross tables prepared by the
National Statistic Committee. Targeting the bottom 40 percent in the water supply sector reform
require skills to analyze household data and connect given rich information with other related
sectors such as health, social protection and investment policies.
