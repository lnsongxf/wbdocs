Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office and receives editorial and strategic
          guidance from an editorial board chaired by Rodrigo Chaves, Country Director for Indonesia.
          The report is compiled by the Macroeconomics and Fiscal Management Global Practice team,
          under the guidance of Shubham Chaudhuri, Practice Manager, and Ndiame Diop, Lead
          Economist. Led by Alex Sienaert, Country Economist, and with responsibility for Part A, editing
          and production, the core project team comprises Arsianti, Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin,
          Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Elitza Mileva (Part A lead) and Violeta Vulovic, with additional editing
          and input from Edgar Janz, Yue Man Lee, Peter Milne, Bede Moore, Arvind Nair and Ririn
          Purnamasari. Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto. Dissemination is organized by
          Surya Ningnagara, Kurie Suditmo, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Desy Mutialim and Nugroho

   Executive summary: Slower gains




Progress towards        Midway through 2015, Indonesia remains confronted with an uncertain external
Indonesia’s             environment, and domestic economic policy challenges have intensified. GDP
development goals       decelerated to below 5 percent in the first quarter and private consumption
has slowed due to       expenditure, Indonesia’s engine of growth in recent years, is also slowing. Weaker
uncertain external      growth has resulted in slower job creation, with recent employment rising only just
conditions, weaker      enough to absorb the increase in working age population. While the commodity
growth, and policy      downturn since 2012 and policy responses have affected output growth the most in
challenges…             resource-rich provinces, employment creation has come under pressure across
                        Indonesia. Yet the scope for policy stimulus is limited and monetary policy in
                        particular is constrained due to sticky inflation and persistent external vulnerabilities.

…and responding         To achieve a sustainable return to higher economic growth, much depends on the
effectively will        success of the government’s ambitious infrastructure development plans, and on
require careful         further improvement of the business environment to reignite private investment.
prioritization and      Support to the economy from the fiscal sector, however, is being impeded by weak
follow-through of       revenues and very low capital spending year-to-date. In response, on the
key reforms,            expenditure side, allocations to priority infrastructure projects should be
especially to           safeguarded so that these can move ahead. This requires a fiscal deficit that is higher
strengthen the fiscal   than the 1.9 percent of GDP planned in the 2015 revised Budget, while still within
sector and unlock       the 3 percent of GDP legal limit. On the revenue side, the government has already
more investment         introduced important measures, such as electronic tax return submission and
                        improvements in the income tax audit strategy. There is also scope to further
                        optimize the tax regime, improve corporate income taxation, and revise value-added
                        tax (VAT) exemptions to increase equity. On the other hand, improving the
                        business environment hinges on greater consistency of regulations that define the
                        functioning of markets, including firm entry, competition, trade and investment.1

In many developing      Despite gradually improving global economic conditions, the balance of
countries,              international risks to Indonesia’s outlook remains on the downside. Although the
particularly in         recovery in high income economies is picking up speed, many emerging market
commodity               economies are experiencing a slowdown, growing at rates considerably below their
exporters, growth is    recent ten-year trends. Furthermore, persistently low global commodity prices mean
slowing down and        that, in the near term, net commodity-exporting countries are likely to face both
fiscal positions are    weaker economic activity and deteriorating fiscal balances relative to the period
weakening               before 2012, when global commodity prices were rising. In addition to growth and
                        fiscal risks, commodity-dependent economies, especially those with limited official
                        reserve buffers and relatively large external financing exposures, may need to
                        manage risks arising from further currency depreciation.

GDP growth in           Real output grew by 4.7 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the first quarter of 2015, the
Indonesia declined      slowest pace since 2009. Nevertheless, growth in Indonesia has remained resilient in
to 4.7 percent yoy in   comparison with growth in other countries which depend on Chinese demand for
Q1 2015, driven         commodities (e.g. Brazil and South Africa). Lower fixed investment growth
mainly by fixed         continues to drive Indonesia’s slowdown, contributing only 1.4 percentage points
investment but also     yoy to GDP growth in the first quarter, which is about half of the average quarterly
by private              growth contribution in 2010-2012. However, private consumption expenditure
consumption…            growth, which had previously remained resilient, is also moderating, to 4.7 percent
                        yoy in the first quarter. Since its share in total GDP expenditures is about 55
                        percent, weakening private consumption is likely to weigh heavily on overall growth.
                        In addition, the sizable decline in nominal consumption growth to 7.6 percent yoy
                        in the first quarter, from 9.4 percent in the previous quarter and from 12.3 percent a
                        year ago, has had a negative impact on the government’s VAT receipts.

…contributing,          The continuing growth slowdown, as well as lower global oil prices, helped narrow
together with the       the current account deficit to 1.8 percent of GDP in the first quarter. Goods
drop in global oil      imports contracted by 14.4 percent yoy in the first quarter, as domestic demand
prices, to a            moderated. Trade data for April and May show a further decline in imports, which
somewhat narrower       is unusual for the months before Ramadan and suggestive of a further deceleration
current account         in domestic demand. Goods exports fell by 13.9 percent yoy, mainly due to lower
deficit                 commodity-related exports but also weak manufacturing exports. The latter was
                        driven partly by subdued demand from China and Southeast Asian neighbors, both
                        for intermediate inputs used in production chains and for final goods. Finally, the
                        oil trade deficit declined by over 40 percent, to USD 3.2 billion, as the Indonesian
                        Crude Price dropped from an average of USD 73 in Q4 2014 to USD 51 in Q1
                        2015. The decrease in the oil deficit was closer to 50 percent when compared to its
                        level a year ago. Nevertheless, the current account deficit in Q1 2015 was only 0.1
                        percent of GDP narrower relative to its seasonally-comparable year-ago level,
                        indicating that external adjustment has so far remained sluggish.

The current account     The government’s ambitious plans to ramp up infrastructure spending will, if
deficit is partly       successful, push up overall investment and increase Indonesia’s current account
structural and          deficit in the short-term. While such an investment-driven increase could enable the
appears sustainable,    economy to achieve a higher sustainable growth path, it could also place the risk of
but merits policy       external imbalances in renewed focus, particularly if global financial market
steps to increase       conditions become more challenging, as last occurred during the 2013 “taper
competitiveness and     tantrum”. Since then, the current account deficit has narrowed only modestly,
reduce external         despite significant import compression. While this owes mainly to continuing
financing risks         downward pressures on exports, a range of longer-term, structural factors also mean

                        early stages of economic convergence to higher-income trading partners, implying a
                        faster growth rate, a higher domestic return on capital, and an excess of investment
                        spending over domestic saving. Running moderately-sized current account deficits
                        appears sustainable for Indonesia, especially if supported by policy measures to
                        boost international competitiveness and to raise the efficiency of given levels of
                        investment in generating growth, jobs and incomes. Securing a resilient mix of

growth in 2015…        (excluding the crisis years of 2008 and 2009) (Figure 1). At the same time, many
                       developing economies are experiencing a slowdown this year. The expected 2015
                       and 2016 growth rates in many emerging markets are considerably lower than their
                       long-term average. However, the slowdown in economic activity in Asia, excluding

                              too. In the first quarter of 2015, private consumption, whose share in total GDP is
                              about 55 percent, grew at a more moderate 4.7 percent yoy, contributing to the
                              overall growth slowdown. Accounting for the Q1 2015 national accounts data

                              conditions, the baseline forecast for annual GDP growth in 2015 has been revised

                              12.3 percent a year ago. The implicit private consumption deflator, calculated as the
                              ratio of nominal to real private consumption expenditure, grew at 2.8 percent yoy in
                              the first quarter, compared with a corresponding quarterly increase in the consumer
                              price index (CPI) of 6.5 percent yoy. This discrepancy suggests that consumers
                              substituted from goods whose prices are rising to goods whose prices are stable or
                              falling. Since the CPI basket is fixed in a particular year (currently 2012), the CPI

                               further weakening of exports, mainly of commodities, has fed through into slower
                               growth via the deterioration in the terms of trade and lower incomes. Evidence of

                        small negative output gap (according to World Bank estimates). At the same time,
                        core inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy prices, has
                        remained stable at around 5.0 percent yoy.

Inflation momentum      The World Bank expects an annual average CPI inflation rate of 6.8 percent in 2015,
is expected to stay     which reflects a small upward revision from the March 2015 IEQ based on recent
moderate, capping       monthly data. Inflation is projected to decline to an average rate of 5.3 percent in
headline inflation at   2016. The risks to the inflation outlook remain balanced. Lower than projected
an average of 6.8       GDP growth, and consequently a larger negative output gap, could pull inflation
percent for 2015        lower. Conversely, further Rupiah depreciation and future fuel price increases may
                        raise inflationary pressures. In addition, the lack of transparency regarding the
                        adjustment of fuel prices (see Section B.2), in particular as oil prices rose by 15
                        percent between March and May, may adversely affect inflation expectations.
                        Finally, according to Indonesia’s National Meteorology, Climatology and
                        Geophysics Agency (Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi dan Geofisika, BMKG), this year’s
                        El Niño is expected to moderately affect parts of Indonesia until November, raising
                        temperatures by 1-2 degrees Celsius, though with relatively low risks for economic
                        activity, including in the agriculture sector. BPS estimates rice paddy production in
                        2015 at 75.5 million tons, up 6.6 percent from 70.9 million tons in 2014.4
                 4. The current account balance narrowed further on account of low oil prices
                    and weak imports
The current account     The current account deficit narrowed further in Q1 2015, mainly as a result of the
deficit narrowed to     decrease in imports driven by continuing growth moderation (Figure 8). Exports
1.8 percent of GDP      declined too, albeit by less than imports, contributing to the smaller current account
in Q1 2015…             deficit. However, when compared to its year-ago level, the current account deficit
                        was broadly unchanged, indicating that external adjustment has remained sluggish.
                        On the financing side, overall inflows were weaker due to lower FDI and foreign
                        deposits. Portfolio inflows, on the other hand, have remained strong, helped by the
                        frontloading of government bond issuance in the first quarter of the year. Looking
                        ahead, the key external risks to Indonesia’s balance of payments are lower
                        commodity prices or a rise in the demand for imported capital goods stemming
                        from the expected increase in infrastructure investment, and a tightening in global
                        financial conditions.

… mainly owing to a     The current account deficit narrowed to 1.8 percent of GDP or USD 3.9 billion in
lower oil deficit       Q1 2015 (from 2.6 percent in Q4 2014) due to a combination of an increase in the
                        goods trade surplus of USD 0.6 billion, and decreases in the services trade and
                        income deficits by USD 0.7 billion and USD 0.5 billion, respectively. The trade
                        surplus expanded to USD 3.1 billion, from USD 2.4 billion in the last quarter of
                        2014, mainly on account of a significantly lower oil deficit (Figure 9). The oil trade
                        deficit dropped by over 40 percent to USD 3.2 billion, as the Indonesian Crude
                        Price (ICP)5 declined from an average of USD 73 in the last three months of 2014
                        to USD 51 in the first quarter of this year. Despite the strong decline in the oil
                        deficit, and looking beyond any seasonal effects, the current account deficit in Q1
                        2015 was only 0.1 percent of GDP narrower than in the first quarter of last year.

decline…                       by 3.3 percent yoy, partly on account of lower demand from China and Southeast
                               Asian neighbors. These countries import chemicals, electronics, and machinery parts
                               and components, which together comprise around 30 percent of Indonesia’s
                               manufacturing exports and are used both as intermediate inputs in production
                               chains and as final goods. The recent negative trend in manufacturing export growth
                               is not unique to Indonesia – the country’s ASEAN partners have experienced a
                               similar slowdown (Figure 10). Finally, monthly trade data for April and May show
                               no improvement in manufacturing and commodity exports, the latter despite small
                               increases in copper and liquefied natural gas prices.

…as did the imports            Goods imports contracted significantly, by 14.4 percent yoy in the first quarter, and
of raw, capital and            monthly data for April and May indicate a further decrease (Figure 11). In Q1 2015,
consumer goods                 raw, capital and consumer goods imports fell by 16.2, 10.2 and 14.3 percent yoy,
                               respectively. In addition to lower oil prices, the continuing weakness in imports was
                               due to the slowdown in domestic demand. Another factor contributing to the
                               decline in imports may be subdued external demand for Indonesia’s manufacturing
                               exports which use imported inputs. Low imports in April and May, which is unusual
                               for the months before Ramadan, coupled with weak monthly sales data, is
                               consistent with domestic demand continuing to slow in the second quarter (see
                               Section 2).

 Box 1: Indonesia’s new CPO export levy may affect global CPO prices, but not necessarily positively
  According to regulations passed on May 25, 20151, the government plans to impose a new export levy on crude palm oil
  (CPO) in order to fund an increase in biodiesel subsidies. In April, the new administration mandated an increase in
  biofuel blending in diesel from 10 percent to 15 percent. The rest of the funds collected through the new CPO export
  levy will go to a Palm Oil Plantation Fund (Dana Perkebunan Kelapa Sawit) that will be used for replanting, research and
  development, marketing, facilities and infrastructure, as well as human resource development in the palm oil sector.
  With a 48-percent share in global CPO exports, Indonesia is the world’s largest palm oil exporter, having overtaken
  Malaysia in 2012 (Figure 12). This means that a re-allocation of CPO production from exports to domestic biofuel
  production, due to the new export levy, could have a global impact on palm oil supply, prices, and demand. To quantify
  the impact of the new levy on the demand for and supply of Indonesia’s CPO exports, a simultaneous supply-demand
  regression analysis is run.2 The demand equation controls for global demand using a monthly proxy of economic
  activity growth in China3, and for the price of the key substitute product, soybean oil. The supply equation controls for
  current and lagged temperature and rainfall, as well as for the effects of El Niño and La Niña weather events.
  The results show that a one-percent increase in the CPO price results in a 0.7 percent decrease in Indonesia’s palm oil
  exports.4 Furthermore, a one-percent decline in the price of soybean oil results in a 0.5 percent decrease in exports as
  demand shifts to the cheaper substitute. A one-percentage point decline in China’s economic activity (in year-on-year
  terms) results in a 3.3 percent decrease in the export
  demand for Indonesia’s CPO. Supply side estimates             Figure 12: Indonesia is the world’s leading palm oil
  show that a one-percent decrease in export supply results producer
  in a 5.5 percent rise in the Rupiah price of CPO.             (share of global CPO export market, percent)
  These estimates suggest that Indonesia can affect the                                  Indonesia            Malaysia            Others
  world price of CPO in the short term as a price-maker
                                                                           90
  with a high share of the global CPO market. However,
  the initial price increase after the export levy is imposed              80
  may lead to a subsequent decline in the demand for palm                  70
  oil (e.g. from China), including as imports shift to                     60
  soybean oil. As a result, prices in the medium run may
                                                                           50
  actually decline because of lower demand relative to
  supply.                                                                  40
                                                               30
  Other factors may also work against the export levy
  increasing global CPO prices. If palm oil producers          20
  reduce export volumes as a result of the export levy, and,   10
  for example, at the same time China’s demand for palm          0
  oil declines because of weaker GDP growth (which is              1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012
  not an unreasonable near-term assumption as China’s
  economy is currently slowing down), then the initial       Source: COMTRADE; World Bank staff calculations
  price increase expected by the government may be neutralized. In sum, the overall impact of imposing the export levy
  on palm oil would depends on several factors affecting producer profits in different directions, and these should be
  evaluated carefully and comprehensively in weighing its overall impacts.

Tight financing                Credit growth slowed down further in the first four months of 2015 and, as
conditions, among              discussed in Section 2, domestic demand conditions have softened. In addition,
other factors, have            since the end of March 2015, equity and bond prices have declined, and the Rupiah
prompted Bank                  has continued to depreciate against the US Dollar. In response to this challenging
Indonesia to loosen            macro-financial environment, combining tighter financing conditions, moderating
macro-prudential               GDP growth, sticky inflation, and currency depreciation pressures, Bank Indonesia

                               accomodative macro-prudential measures.

Equity and bond                After a strong first three months of the year, the Jakarta Composite Index (JCI) of
markets declined as            equity prices decreased sharply, by 11.0 percent, between the end of March and June

less in Indonesian             in Q1 2015, but became net sellers of equities worth USD 112.9 million in Q2
assets                         (Figure 13). Between March 31 and June 30, domestic government bond yields
                               increased by between 55 and 103 basis points across the maturity range. Although
                               net foreign purchases of Indonesian government bonds (SUN) were resilient in the
                               first quarter (see Section 4), they decreased significantly in April and May, before
                               picking up again sharply in June. At the same time, on May 21, 2015, ratings agency
                               Standard and Poor’s revised up its outlook for Indonesia from stable to positive on

The Rupiah                     The Rupiah weakened by 2.0 percent against the US Dollar between March 31 and
maintained an                  June 30, after depreciating by 5.6 percent in the first quarter. Currency volatility, as
orderly depreciation           measured by the standard deviation of Rupiah returns, has remained generally stable
trend against the US           since June 2014, after four quarters of heightened volatility following the “taper
Dollar                         tantrum” emerging market asset sell-off in 2013 (Figure 14). The relatively low
                               volatility of the Rupiah likely reflects in part BI’s interventions to smooth currency

                        pressures, BI issued a new regulation on March 31, effective on July 1, requiring the
                        use of Rupiah for all domestic cash and non-cash transactions.6 As of June 1, BI
                        also revised regulations on foreign exchange transactions7 and on the net open
                        positions of commercial banks8, including allowing cross-currency swaps. The
                        revisions also shorten the time needed to settle derivative transactions for foreigners
                        from one week to three days and allow banks to meet the maximum net open
                        position requirement of 20 percent of capital at the end of the day (as opposed to
                        every 30 minutes, as required previously).9 The latter change is expected to enable
                        banks with lower capital to participate in the foreign exchange market.

BI has not changed      With respect to local currency liquidity conditions, BI has kept the key policy rate at
the key interest rate   7.5 percent and the deposit facility rate at 5.5 percent since February 2015, and the
for four months but     lending facility rate at 8.0 percent since November 2014. At the same time, BI has
has loosened macro-     introduced several accommodative macro-prudential measures. At its April policy
prudential policy       meeting, the central bank lowered bank loan-to-deposit ratios (LDR) by including
                        securities in the definition of deposits and relaxed the LDR upper threshold for
                        banks that meet minimum required lending levels for small and medium-sized
                        enterprises.10 In May, BI increased the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages from 70
                        percent to a maximum of 80 percent and lowered the minimum downpayment for
                        car and motorcycle loans.11 Overall, BI has employed a mix of maintaining the
                        monetary policy stance unchanged while loosening macro-prudential policy in
                        response to a challenging economic environment. On the one hand, GDP growth
                        has moderated considerably (see Section 2) and credit growth slowed down (see
                        below). On the other hand, inflation has remained sticky and external balances
                        relatively weak (see Sections 3 and 4), and the Rupiah has continued to depreciate.

The credit growth       Although deposit growth has steadily increased in the last four quarters, reaching
slowdown appears to     14.5 percent in April, credit growth has not yet shown signs of a pick-up (Figure
have been driven        15). Credit growth, at 10.2 percent yoy in April (and only 3.2 percent yoy in real
increasingly by         terms), has been on a continuous downward trend since mid-2012. Consequently,
reduced credit          the aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio for commercial banks fell to 87.6 percent in
demand                  March, from 89.4 percent in December 2014. Non-performing loans, however,
                        increased somewhat to 2.5 percent of total loans in April, from 2.2 percent in
                        December. Overall, recent banking sector developments point to weaker demand
                        driving the continued credit growth slowdown rather than credit supply conditions.
                        The World Bank’s measure of financial conditions12 indicates that financing has

                           seaport and airport services (e.g. container loading and unloading, airplane parking at airport), will
                           now have to be quoted and paid in Rupiah, which may drive transaction costs up. In addition, there
                           may be ways of circumventing the regulation by, for example, using offshore bank accounts.

                     6. The implementation of the 2015 revised Budget is proving challenging
The execution of the            The key features of the 2015 revised Budget, passed in February 2015, include: i) an
revised 2015 Budget             ambitious target for total revenues to increase by 14.6 percent (of which tax
is proving difficult            revenues are expected to increase by 30 percent); (ii) a 60 percent reduction of
                                energy subsidies (from IDR 342 to 138 trillion); (iii) a doubling of capital spending
                                (from IDR 135 to 276 trillion); and (iv) a decrease in the fiscal deficit from 2.2 to 1.9
                                percent of GDP. However, budget implementation in the first five months shows
                                significant challenges, with weak revenue outturns severely limiting the fiscal space
                                for the government’s ambitious infrastructure development plan. In view of
                                Indonesia’s sound debt position, an increase in the fiscal deficit to the legal limit (3
                                percent of GDP for the general government) would allow for an increase in
                                investment spending, supporting economic growth.

Revenue realization             Weak revenue realization in the first five months of 2015 is a strong signal that the
in the first five               revised 2015 Budget target may not be met. By the end of May, total revenues
months of 2015 was              reached IDR 533.4 trillion, a nominal decline of 6.4 percent yoy (Figure 17). The
lower than in the               revenue outturns represent only 30.3 percent of the annual target, compared with an
same period in 2014             average of 35.3 percent in the last five years. Nominal tax revenue declined by 1.3
                                percent yoy in January-May 2015, in sharp contrast to the targeted increase of 30
                                percent for the full year in the 2015 revised Budget. Revenues from all major tax
                                categories contracted, with the exception of non-oil and gas income taxes, which
                                contributed a positive 3.5 percentage points to the nominal year-on-year growth of
                                total revenues. Non-tax revenue also declined by 24 percent yoy in nominal terms.

Weaker revenues are            In the base case, the World Bank assumes that the government would spend 2

expenditure                    shortfall.23 The revised 2015 total expenditure projection is broadly flat in nominal
increases                      terms compared with 2014 but with a markedly different composition. Social and
                               grants expenditures, as well as the main regional transfer categories are projected to
                               be disbursed as stated in the 2015 revised Budget. Personnel and other expenditure
                               categories are forecasted to be disbursed at the 2011-2014 average disbursement
                               rates of 95 percent and 25 percent, respectively.24 The remaining revenue sharing
                               balance, energy subsidies, and interest payments are driven by macroeconomic
                               assumptions. For the other expenditure categories, projections assume that the

                                23   In a scenario of full budget execution the fiscal deficit for 2015 would reach 4.6 percent of GDP.
                                24   The projection for personnel expenditure for 2015 is slightly higher than in the March 2015 IEQ,
                                     which assumed that efficiency measures will be taken and a second round of Budget revisions, both

                        government will prioritize capital spending by constraining material and non-energy
                        subsidy spending to 2014 nominal levels. This would yield sufficient fiscal space for
                        capital spending to reach IDR 160 trillion in 2015, an 18-percent nominal increase
                        from 2014 levels but significantly less than the targeted IDR 276 trillion in the 2015
                        revised Budget.

Gross financing         Gross government financing needs for 2015 could reach IDR 576 trillion (5.0

exceed those in 2014,   of GDP); ii) non-debt financing needs of IDR 62 trillion (0.5 percent of GDP)
but risks are           primarily from SOE recapitalization; and iii) a fiscal deficit of IDR 291 trillion (2.5
mitigated by front-     percent of GDP). These projected 2015 financing needs are higher than those in
loading securities      2014 (4.6 percent of GDP), but associated risks are mitigated by the strong pace and
issuance and the        foreign take-up of domestic bond issuance so far on 2015. As of June 30, nearly 65
deployment of new       percent of the current gross annual securities issuance target, the source of 89
multilateral            percent of the intended total annual financing, was already met. This generates some

                        which gross securities issuance is tapered down over the remainder of 2015,
                        assuming that market conditions, including global appetite for Rupiah-denominated
                        bonds, remain conducive. There is also ample scope to increase bi-lateral and multi-

                        threshold for each level of government is determined each year in a regulation by
                        the Ministry of Finance. The maximum threshold for the sub-national government
                        was set at 0.3 percent of GDP and for the central government at 2.7 percent of
                        GDP for 2015.25 If the central government deficit were increased to 2.7 percent of
                        GDP, then capital expenditure could be raised by an additional IDR 23 trillion (0.2
                        percent of GDP), pushing it up by a significant 35 percent from the 2014 level.

                         across Indonesia, except in Nusa Tenggara. In Java and Bali, an average of 1.4
                         million new jobs were created annually between 2012 and 2014, compared with an
                         average increase in the working-age population of 1.6 million people. The

issues, which have       the largest employers, and low productivity sectors (e.g. social and personal services
become more              and wholesale and retail trade) create the most jobs. Second, the informal sector is
prominent with           still large. According to World Bank estimates, over 60 percent of workers are either

                         temporary workers among the rest of the workforce, only around 35 percent of
                         employees have written contracts. Third, investment in higher productivity sectors is
                         constrained by the limited availability of skilled workers, as less than 9 percent of the
                         workforce has tertiary education. The new government has prioritized reforms, such
                         as increasing infrastructure spending and reducing the barriers to starting and
                         running a business, which address some of the above challenges by enhancing
                         competitiveness.

                    economy
Indonesia faces          The balance of risks to the World Bank’s economic outlook for Indonesia is on the
persistent               downside. In terms of the international environment, there is uncertainty around the
international risks in   trajectory of public and external financing costs and availability in the context of the
the context of tighter   normalization of US monetary policy (with Indonesian domestic government bond
financing conditions     yields having already increased significantly in 2015). International financial market
and weaker               dislocations may induce more currency and external financing pressures, constrain
commodity prices…        policy options, and further weaken domestic demand growth. There are also
                         ongoing risks to external demand, given lower trend output growth in developing
                         countries (including some of Indonesia’s major trading partners), which has
                         contributed to the decline in global commodity demand and prices. A key risk to the
                         global outlook is a setback in the still-fragile Euro Area recovery, including perhaps
                         because of concerns about Greece's financial strains.

… whereas on the         Turning to domestic macroeconomic conditions, GDP growth decelerated to below

…in addition to       Revenue-improving measures should take account of the risk of potential
measures aimed at     counterproductive long-term effects. For example, the government’s planned tax
sustainably raising   amnesty for offshore assets and income that would provide exemptions from all
revenue collection    charges of financial crimes – including corruption, money laundering, and tax
                      evasion – in exchange for repatriating assets to Indonesia, may provide tax revenue
                      gains when implemented. However, it also carries the risk of lowering tax morale,
                      and hence impeding revenue mobilization, in the future.27 The implications for
                      governance and efforts to combat corruption of the planned waiver of legal charges
                      for financial crimes should also be carefully evaluated.

Reforms to improve    Apart from the challenging external environment, long-standing structural issues,
revenue performance   such as poor tax compliance rates, are among the reasons for Indonesia’s weak
over the medium-      revenue performance. Therefore, the government could also focus on measures to
and long-term need    sustainably improve revenue collection over the longer term. Some tax
to be implemented     administration measures which the government has already introduced, such as
in parallel           electronic tax return submission and improvements in the income tax audit strategy,
                      fall into this category (as discussed in Section 6). Additional reforms that could be
                      considered relate to optimizing the tax regime, including revisions to sales and
                      excise taxes for vehicles, fuels and tobacco. These measures would reduce market
                      distortions and negative externalities (e.g. pollution, congestion), improve public
                      health, and, at the same time, raise revenues. There is also scope to improve
                      corporate income taxation to reduce firms’ incentives to remain small. Finally, some
                      other measures have the added advantage of increasing equity, such as the revision
                      of VAT exemptions for the electricity consumption of households with 2,200-
                      6,600VA power supply, which was announced as part of the revised Budget.

                   a. A major trade shock has dominated current account dynamics in recent years

Since 2011, the         The stand-out recent feature of Indonesia’s current account is the sharp contraction

compounded              been due to a moderation of growth in China, as well as generally sluggish global
through 2014 by         growth. It has been a major trade shock, cutting Indonesia’s commodities export
rising net oil          revenues by approximately one-sixth over 2011-2014, amidst an approximate
imports…                halving in its terms of trade for major commodities. A large and, until 2014 growing,
                        oil and gas trade deficit also contributed. All told, the narrower non-oil and gas
                        goods trade surplus accounts for about half (49 percent) of the USD 30.5 billion
                        deterioration in the current account balance from 2010 to 2014, oil and gas trade
                        somewhat under a third (29 percent), and higher income outflows about a quarter
                        (23 percent, most of which occurred in 2010).

…resulting in           Monetary and exchange rate policy reacted decisively after mid-2013 to the trade
significant monetary    shock, after external financing conditions deteriorated markedly for Indonesia and
policy and exchange     many other EMEs. Bank Indonesia (BI) tightened monetary policy through interest
rate adjustments…       rate increases and macroprudential measures, aiming to moderate domestic demand
                        growth and compress imports. Flexible exchange rate management since mid-2013
                        has also contributed to macroeconomic stability. The Rupiah has fallen by 33
                        percent against the US Dollar since July 2013, when BI adopted a more hands-off
                        approach to the currency. Depreciation in real effective (i.e. trade-weighted) terms
                        has been a more moderate 10 percent, and an initially sharp adjustment in H2 2013
                        has been followed by a generally orderly depreciation trend. This has helped to
                        cushion the trade shock by reducing export price falls in Rupiah terms, improved
                        currency market liquidity, and supported a recovery in gross foreign reserves.

…with energy            Large energy subsidies, especially for fuel, contributed through 2014 to the increase
subsidy reform also     in the current account deficit. They did so directly by keeping retail fuel prices
expected to alleviate   artificially cheap, which increased fuel demand and imports, and indirectly by
additional pressures    placing upward pressure on the fiscal deficit (hence contributing to a shortfall of
that were being         national saving relative to investment). Recent reforms have cut budgeted fuel
placed on               subsidies to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2015, reducing budgeted energy subsidies (for
Indonesia’s external    fuels and electricity) to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015, down from an average of 3.3
balance                 percent in 2011-2014 (see Section B.2). This should contribute to the future
                        sustainability of Indonesia’s external position and reduce fiscal risks from, and
                        increase the expenditure-switching power of, any further Rupiah depreciation.

Despite these           The effects of lower commodity prices and demand, and of the needed policy
changes, Indonesia’s    responses to facilitate Indonesia’s adjustment to these shifts, have continued to filter
current account         into the economy. Domestic demand growth has slowed markedly (see Part A). Yet
deficit has remained    despite this, and the sharp fall in global oil prices since mid-2014, the current

weak commodity          2015 the deficit stood at 1.8 percent of GDP, but this reflected favorable seasonal

Indonesia’s                      domestic policies, international integration, and stage of development and

                        of domestic government debt. Consequently, most of the total increase in
                        Indonesia’s foreign liabilities has been Rupiah-denominated. Currency depreciation
                        reduces the value of these liabilities in foreign currency terms, strengthening the
                        mechanism for currency depreciation to facilitate external adjustment, as has been
                        occurring since 2013. The IMF’s latest assessment is that the NIIP remains “…at
                        moderate levels and [is] projected to remain stable”.30
                     c. …and appropriate policy responses are also longer-term in nature

Indonesia can, and      Indonesia’s current account deficit is due to a complex mix of factors, many of
most likely will,       which are structural and long-term in nature. Indonesia is still in the relatively early
continue to run         stages of economic convergence to higher-income trading partners, implying a faster
current account         growth rate, a higher domestic return on capital, and an excess of investment
deficits…               spending over domestic saving, tending to push the current account towards
                        deficits. Policy measures to force the current account back into surplus, for example
                        by suppressing imports directly through regulatory measures or through fiscal
                        contraction, would push the economy far off its trend path, at a cost to growth.
                        Fortunately, Indonesia does not have to pay such a price. Assuming no short-term
                        financing difficulties (liquidity constraints), moderately-sized current account deficits
                        can be run indefinitely (sustainably), so long as these deficits contribute to a rapid
                        enough pace of economic expansion relative to the growth, and servicing costs, of
                        accumulated foreign liabilities.

…but policy actions     Although powerful structural factors are reflected in the current account, there is
can play an             still a role for policies to help maintain the external balance of the economy. These
important role to       include the need for measures to increase integration in global markets, and high
strengthen the          quality spending to address infrastructure and skills gaps. Such steps can boost
external balance and    international competitiveness (helping Indonesian exports gain global market share
ensure continued        and reducing import penetration by making domestic production of import
sustainability…         substitutes more competitive), and raise the efficiency of given levels of investment
                        in generating growth, jobs and incomes. Addressing the regulatory uncertainties and
                        costs facing both domestic and international investors could help Indonesia achieve
                        its potential as a regional production and export hub in Asia and support foreign
                        direct investment, a large and relatively stable source of external financing.

                        regulated price was a little higher outside Java, Madura and Bali, to account for
                        higher transportation costs. A subsidy for diesel was maintained, but at a much
                        reduced level compared to that of recent years, and consisting of a fixed amount per
                        liter, capped at IDR 1,000 per liter. Prices of gasoline and diesel would be
                        announced every month, or more than once a month if deemed necessary, by the

effectiveness and       fiscal risks. By 2014, fuel subsidies had swollen to about a fifth of central
fairness of public      government spending, or 2.3 percent of GDP. In addition to crowding out
spending                allocations for more productive purposes such as infrastructure, education and
                        healthcare, this spending was highly regressive, since fuel consumption is correlated
                        with income; the richest (poorest) 10 percent of households captured 33 percent (2
                        percent) of gasoline and diesel subsidy spending.32 Finally, not only did fuel subsidy
                        spending trend higher over the years due to rapidly increasing domestic demand as a
                        result of solid economic growth, but fluctuating global oil prices and exchange rates

                                2014, fuel subsidy spending averaged 2.2 percent of GDP per year, and exceeded
                                initially budgeted costs by an average of 0.5 percent of GDP (Figure 30). Fuel
                                subsidy costs drove about half (0.75 percent points) of the 1.5 percent of GDP

…after the move to      Why the need for more transparent, consistent implementation, especially given that

system, which           percent of GDP in subsidy costs, despite the uneven implementation of the new
benefited initially     system? The reason is that the government has made bold moves to slash subsidies,
from lower global oil   but it has done so in the context of a sharp fall in global oil prices, making it
prices…                 possible to cut subsidies with only a relatively modest increase in retail fuel prices.
                        Gasoline and diesel prices are up 12 percent and 25 percent compared with their
                        levels before the November 2014 once-off price increase, yet fuel subsidy spending
                        is expected to be almost three-quarters lower in 2015. A number of other
                        developing countries have also taken the opportunity to improve their fuel pricing
                        systems, strengthen their budgets, and provide better support to vulnerable
                        households for energy costs (Box 2).

…and adding to          Global fuel prices are most unlikely to remain at the current level for long. Brent
uncertainty over the    crude, the global oil price benchmark, is already up 34 percent since January in US
durability of the       Dollar terms, and 40 percent in Rupiah terms. If and when global fuel costs do
reform, especially      climb further, there is a risk that subsidy costs will accumulate again too, without
when fuel prices        more progress to embed regular fuel price adjustments based on market prices. The
begin to rise again     lack of clarity about how binding the new regulations are makes it difficult to know

                            burdened by future rises in global oil prices or currency depreciation, against the

Box 2: Moving to market-based fuels pricing and raising government revenue while protecting the poor: recent
examples from around the world
Developing countries across the world have seized the opportunity afforded by the fall in global oil prices since mid-
2014 to move towards more optimal fuel pricing and strengthen their budgets by increasing fuel taxes. From May 2015,
Vietnam tripled its environmental protection tax on gasoline to the equivalent of IDR 1850, that on diesel to IDR 925,
and that on kerosene to IDR 185 per liter. China in three successive steps between November 2014 and January 2015
increased the excise tax on gasoline by a total of 52 percent and diesel by 50 percent, to about IDR 3,200 and 2,500 per
liter, respectively. India similarly nearly doubled the excise tax on regular gasoline and tripled the tax on diesel over three
successive months in 2014 to IDR 3,700 and 2,100 per liter, respectively. Mexico turned its negative taxes (that is,
subsidies) on gasoline and diesel in 2014 to positive taxes in 2015. For example, the tax on regular gasoline in March
2014 was IDR -930 per liter, but by February 2015 the tax was IDR +3,425 per liter. Similarly, the corresponding taxes
on diesel were IDR -900 and IDR +3,765 per liter, respectively.
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices are important where LPG is the primary cooking fuel for many vulnerable
households. Indonesia has implemented a large-scale program converting households from kerosene to cleaner LPG,
and subsidizing the price of smaller (3kg) LPG canisters. LPG subsidy costs have consequently increased significantly, to
a budgeted 0.25 percent of GDP in 2015.
A number of developing countries that have also historically subsidized LPG have taken steps to minimize distortions in
the market and wasteful spending due to weak targeting of the poor households who most need support for their energy
costs. India in February 2015 stopped price subsidies for LPG for cooking, historically intended for household use but
exploited for decades by restaurants, hotels, and other commercial consumers of LPG, who managed to obtain
residential LPG cylinders illegally. Under the new system, price subsidies are no longer provided at the point of sale,
arguably making illegal diversion to commercial establishments much more difficult. Instead, consumers wishing to
receive cash assistance are required to sign up for the Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG and receive deposits in their
bank accounts. Those without bank accounts are provided one free of charge. The bank account is also linked to the
consumer’s LPG customer identification number and the national 12-digit individual identification number being rolled
out by the government, which contains each resident’s biometric information. Cash transfers are provided up to 12 times
a year to refill 14.2-kg cylinders. Peru in 2013 created a fund, financed by surcharges on energy consumers, to help poor
households consume LPG. The eligibility criteria are strict to ensure that better-off households do not benefit from the
assistance. Recipients of the program receive a voucher that provides a discount of 16 soles (approximately IDR 67,000)
on the first refill of a 10-kg LPG cylinder each month. The refill price in June 2015 was about IDR 150,000.

                         solution is to revert to the past system of absorbing market fuel price volatility in
                         the fiscal sector by fixing retail fuel prices, especially at an artificially low level. This
                         suppresses retail fuel price volatility, but at a high cost to fiscal planning, generating
                         fiscal risks and macroeconomic management risks from sporadic large price
                         adjustments, and distorting the economy (for example by blunting consumers’

                         could even be automated through the use of agreed trigger prices, based for

…and building on         Finally, while the elimination of gasoline subsidies is a major step forward,

                         households better and more efficiently (see Box 2). Electricity also remains
                         subsidized at a cost of approximately 0.6 percent of GDP, with mixed progress in
                         reforming electricity tariffs. Effective in January 2015, tariff adjustments for ten
                         non-subsidized customer categories (out of twelve customer categories for which a

                         and macroeconomic developments (e.g. inflation, oil prices, and the exchange rate).3
                         However, the application of a similar floating tariff system for two large household
                         customer categories, those with 1,300 volt-ampere (VA) and 2,200VA power

                        drive turbines and so produce electricity. Geothermal energy is clean and renewable,
                        and can also act as a natural hedge against volatile global fossil fuel prices. Despite
                        these advantages, Indonesia has not yet harnessed much of its large geothermal

                        megawatts (MW) of electricity.37 Consequently, Indonesia remains heavily reliant on
                        gas, oil and (especially) coal for its electricity, with geothermal energy contributing
                        only 3 percent of electric power in 2014.38

                      intensive sector, with long lead times from exploration through to power
                      generation. For instance, indicatively, 30 percent of equity financing is required for
                      geothermal projects, which means that achieving an additional 3,000 MW of
                      geothermal capacity would require USD 4 billion in equity, and USD 9.5 billion in
                      debt financing.40 The high levels of upfront investment involved make the level and
                      certainty as to pricing—that is, tariffs—critically important. Tariffs must be set at an
                      adequate level, and periodically reviewed over the project implementation cycle,
                      otherwise capital-intensive exploration and exploitation of geothermal resources will
                      continue to be perceived as uneconomical, or overly risky. The regulated returns
                      from the electricity sector are currently too low to cover the risks inherent in
                      geothermal exploration and exploitation.

stakeholders…            government entities, so that the required resources and incentives are in place to
                         develop the sector.

…including multiple      The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) is the primary promoter of
ministries and state-    the geothermal sector and is responsible for implementing the Geothermal Law and
owned enterprises        for tariff-setting. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is responsible for the USD 200
                         million Geothermal Fund, but, naturally given its different mandate, lacks in-house
                         technical expertise around the planning, implementation, supervision and review of
                         drilling activities. The MOF is concerned with minimizing the fiscal burden of
                         electricity subsidies paid to the state-owned electricity company (Perusahaan Listrik
                         Negara, PLN). The Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, in contrast, has a mandate
                         to ensure the sound commercial performance of both PLN and Pertamina, the
                         state-owned oil company. Pertamina has had little incentive to allocate scarce capital
                         to PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE)—its division responsible for
                         geothermal energy—given that it can generate far higher returns from its numerous
                         oil and gas interests. Finally, there are overlapping roles amongst PGE, PT Geo
                         Dipa Energi, another state-owned enterprise for geothermal development set up in
                         2002, and PLN Geothermal, which focuses on geothermal power generation. More
                         cooperation amongst all these key government stakeholders is clearly needed, to
                         mobilize geothermal financing and investment.

can be strengthened      geothermal energy resources, with the aim of encouraging efficient and
to ensure that           transparently-allocated investments. Previously, winning bids for geothermal
projects are awarded     projects often had unrealistically low prices and bidders may have lacked adequate
to committed and         technical knowledge and financial capacity. Purported weaknesses of the system
adequately-              have included poor technical knowledge of the selection committee at the local
resourced bidders…       government level, inadequate bid bonds (some as low as USD 100,000), and
                         performance bond requirements that were not imposed (bid and performance
                         bonds aim to ensure that only committed contenders participate in the tender
                         process). Hence, there is a need for improved tendering processes, including by
                         applying international best practice principles. For instance, the minimum bid bond
                         size could be increased substantially and calculated as a percentage of total project
                         cost, rather than the first year’s exploration cost. Winners’ bid bonds could then be
                         converted into performance bonds that would only be released upon evidence of
                         tangible exploration drilling, reducing speculative activity by uncommitted or under-
                         resourced bidders.

…backed by higher        International experience also shows that the quality of information on available
quality geological       resources is crucial in improving the quality of tender processes. In view of this,
information              concession areas in Indonesia should be put out to tender only with a complete and
                         independently certified package of geology, geophysics and geochemistry (“3Gs”)
                         information, ideally based on analysis from a minimum of three exploration wells.

                         Currently, tenders often lack any subsurface geological information, making it
                         difficult for bidders to reliably estimate costs.
                    d. …a strengthening of the tariff system…

Appropriate tariff       Appropriate tariffs have proved to be a major impediment to private investment in
levels and structures,   Indonesia’s geothermal sector. In 2012, the government made a major attempt to
including flexibility,   unblock the sector by introducing a feed-in tariff (FIT), providing fixed tariffs for
can be critical          developers. However, perhaps due to insufficient stakeholder consultations, the FIT
factors…                 failed to break the deadlock over pricing between electricity buyers and prospective
                         sellers. In addition, the FIT system was flawed because it relied on fixed tariffs. This
                         turned the selection process for investment bids into a “beauty contest”, based on
                         hard-to-measure non-price qualifications. International best practice suggests that
                         allowing competitively determined bids is a more effective way of conducting the
                         bid process, guided by a maximum (“ceiling”) price. This provides information on
                         the maximum acceptable tariff (which is vital should competition for licenses prove
                         limited), while maintaining flexibility for competition to drive winning bids down,
                         and for gauging efficiency and competitiveness gains over time. In Indonesia’s case,
                         a ceiling price of USD 9.7 cents/kWh was originally set in 2009, and this was
                         updated in 2014 through MEMR Decree no 17/2014. The new regulation sets the
                         ceiling prices by region (3 alternatives, based on main generation sources), and target
                         commercial operation date (COD) year. While this is a promising start, international
                         experience also demonstrates that tariff-setting should be seen as part of a process
                         that will change over time. Indeed, most countries conduct regular tariff reviews
                         based on full stakeholder consultation and a published methodology. Such an
                         approach recognizes that a tariff ceiling set today may have little relevance when
                         commercial operations start 7-9 years in the future and that for tariffs to be
                         acceptable and de-risked they need to involve some degree of flexibility.

…and could be            One approach for achieving more flexible tariffs that may be appropriate for
informed by ceiling      Indonesia is to set ceiling prices on the basis of the estimated benefits of geothermal
prices reflecting the    energy to the country. “Avoided-cost” approaches have been used for these sorts of
benefits to Indonesia    estimates, based on a transparent methodology for forecasting a reasonable price for
of geothermal power      projects whose commercial operation is 7-9 years away. While there are many
                         benefits to Indonesia of using geothermal energy, the most important is the
                         potential avoided costs for PLN of having to invest in other sorts of costly power
                         plants. Another major benefit relates to local economic development, given that one
                         of the main goals of the government is to encourage economic development in the
                         eastern islands, for which geothermal energy holds great promise. Finally, there are
                         also benefits in terms of avoided externality costs of thermal generation, notably
                         avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The government would need to decide
                         on the value it should place on avoided GHG emissions and whether this should be
                         higher than the current price in global carbon markets.
                    e. …and making power purchase agreements work

Power purchase           Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are the contracts that need to be agreed
agreements are the       between geothermal project developers and PLN, as the state-owned electricity
cornerstone of           company and distributor of electricity. To date, a stumbling block in concluding
private investment in    PPAs has been the time-consuming and ad hoc negotiation of tariff escalation terms
the sector…              after tenders have been issued. An alternative could be to use a single tariff
                         escalation formula, consistent with international best practice for renewable energy
                         projects, agreed at the time of tender.

…and, to be             The comprehensiveness of PPAs is also important. For example, PPAs should
effective, should be    specify in advance how the new geothermal power source will be connected to the
comprehensive           grid (transmission connection). One option is to call for the developer to build a
                        transmission line to the nearest PLN substation and then recover the costs through
                        a non-escalating tariff ladder. These costs would be relatively small and hence not
                        relevant in selecting a developer. PLN would later take over the line at the time of
                        commercial operation and be responsible for maintenance thereafter.

There is a need to      One immediate problem concerning PPAs is how to resolve projects that are
address the backlog     currently stalled due to factors including: low tariffs (resulting in the license-owner
of stalled projects…    not having an incentive to exploit the resource), unresolved land acquisition or
                        access issues, or a lack of technical and financial capability on the part of license-
                        owners. In these stalled cases, PPA renegotiation may be required. For instance,
                        under the 2014 ceiling tariff decree, geothermal license holders were required to sign
                        PPAs by December 2014. PPA renegotiation is allowed when the developers
                        completing the exploration program find that the proven resource is less than
                        expected. In addition, for PGE to conclude private partnerships, prices that were set
                        up a decade ago and are now obsolete would need to be reset. New projects, by
                        contrast, should be helped by the declassification of geothermal exploitation as a
                        mining activity in an amendment to the Geothermal Law, allowing the Ministry of
                        Forestry and the Environment to issue permits to developers within national
                        forests.

…including the          To mitigate uncertainties generated by the possibility of PPA renegotiations, the
possibility of          scope for this to occur could be guided by clearly communicating principles,
renegotiating stalled   including the circumstance under which a renegotiation could be considered and the
projects’ PPAs,         process that would be applied. For example, renegotiations could be limited to three
subject to clear        situations: (i) delays attributable to government error; (ii) projects where drilling
principles              after tender reveals significantly larger or smaller potential than was estimated in the
                        tender; and (iii) projects where developer capacity was set at the time of tender, but
                        where the developer subsequently wishes to install larger units and not risk incurring
                        a penalty.

                 2. Ten years of Indonesia’s school grants program (BOS) – successes and
                    challenges41
Indonesia’s school      Indonesia’s school grants program (Bantuan Operasional Sekolah, BOS) is central to
grants program          the country’s strategy to expand access to good quality basic education. In 2012, the
(BOS) provides          program accounted for 8 percent of all government education spending and
operational funding     provided IDR 24 trillion (USD 2.5 billion) of operational funding to 220 thousand
to 220 thousand         primary and junior secondary schools and madrassahs. This section provides a brief
schools and             assessment of the program and its contribution to the education sector. An
madrassahs…             assessment is timely since the program has now reached its tenth year of operation
                        and efforts are underway to expand the program beyond basic education.

...joining many other   Education policymakers around the world have increasingly recognized the
countries in granting   importance of empowering schools to make their own decisions in the quest to
schools more            improve education outcomes. This has led many countries to grant schools greater
management and          autonomy by introducing school-based management reforms. This has included
spending autonomy,      increasing the participation of parents and communities in school governance, in
often with positive     order to improve the accountability and performance of schools. The increasing
results when            focus on school-based management has usually gone hand-in-hand with direct
accompanied by          funding to schools to support various improvements. This kind of funding differs
effective               from regular public funding as it provides schools with some discretion on how
implementation          funds are spent. Such funding can provide a more predictable income stream,
                        allowing schools to plan quality improvement activities more effectively. School-
                        based management and school grant programs have shown some success in
                        improving education access and raising education outcomes, as well as reducing
                        education inequality.42 However, programs can take time to yield results and their
                        success depends critically on political support and effective implementation.

students’ costs, and    parents and increase enrolment and participation particularly for poor households.
strengthen school       Second, financial assistance for poor students: school grants can provide direct
management              support to poor students to cover transportation, stationery, uniform and clothing
                        expenses. Third, strengthened school-based management: grants are intended to
                        lead to greater school autonomy by providing resources to finance activities which
                        schools themselves feel will raise local enrolment rates and education quality. The
                        management of funds within schools is expected to increase transparency,
                        strengthen school accountability and lead to improved education outcomes.

                         compared to the size of the per-student grants given to schools through the BOS
                         program.43 Initial drops in household spending were concentrated amongst poorer
                         households and for children attending government schools. Immediately after the

                              its effect. A second-best approach is adopted which uses available data to look at trends before and
                              after the program was introduced and also simple regression analysis to control for other factors (e.g.
                              household income). This approach cannot provide definitive conclusions on the effect of the BOS
                              program but can provide some insights into its overall effect.

                        remained relatively stable but increased 26 percentage points between 2005 and
                        2013. There is tentative evidence that the BOS program contributed to
                        approximately 5 percentage points of this strong increase, especially amongst poor
                        households. Like the apparent impact on household costs, however, this effect
                        seems to have also been temporary, with enrolment rates settling back onto a long
                        term trend that did not fluctuate with subsequent increases in the per-student
                        amount of the BOS grant. Further support for these findings comes from the
                        different rate at which poor households closed the participation gap in junior and
                        senior secondary schools; the period since BOS was introduced has seen the senior
                        secondary enrolment gap narrow but at a slower rate compared to junior secondary

                        not associated with jumps in transition rates.

                        strengthen accountability between schools and parents. The BOS program
                        supported these reforms by providing resources to fund school improvement plans
                        and by making use of established school-based management structures and
                        processes to govern the use of its funds.

School committees       Most schools in Indonesia have the institutions and processes required for school-

                        of the BOS program in opening up school decision-making to the broader school
                        community.

                   e. There is scope to significantly strengthen the impact of BOS spending

Steps can be taken      These findings suggest a number of key policy directions that could strengthen the
that could strengthen   existing BOS program. First, BOS could have an enhanced focus on improving
BOS’ positive           education quality. BOS funding could be linked more directly to education
impact, by linking      standards. Establishing a more formal link between BOS funding and education
funds to making         standards has the potential to signal to schools the importance of using BOS
education quality       resources to fulfil these standards. BOS funding could also be tied to quality
gains…                  assurance systems by providing an incentive for schools to obtain and maintain
                        accreditation status. The list of eligible items under BOS could also be reviewed, to

                          give schools the flexibility to invest in quality-enhancing inputs, for example
                          teaching and learning materials such as audio-visual equipment.

...by increasing the      Second, BOS could have an increased focus on reducing poverty. The value of BOS
focus on poverty          could be adjusted periodically to account for regional price differences and inflation,
reduction…                to ensure that all schools can meet operating standards and to recognize that
                          education costs per-student vary greatly across Indonesia. The BOS formula could
                          also be adjusted to provide more funding to schools serving poor and vulnerable
                          children. Schools serving poor and disadvantaged students need additional support
                          to ensure that they are able to provide a quality of schooling similar to schools in
                          wealthier areas of Indonesia. In addition, it would likely be effective to phase out the
                          use of BOS resources to cover “out of pocket” expenses of poor students, because
                          large cash transfer programs (e.g. Kartu Indonesia Pintar) already exist. While these
                          programs require strengthening, they should be the principal way of reducing the
                          direct costs of schooling.

…by improving the         Third, the coordination between BOS and other sources of school funding could be
coordination of BOS       strengthened. Fees and charges remain a significant proportion of out-of-pocket
with other school         expenses, despite efforts to clarify the rules governing voluntary contributions to
funding…                  schools. Alongside continuing these efforts, consideration should be given to
                          strengthening the role of school committees in managing the level of contributions.
                          Regulations should also be clearly communicated to parents and other stakeholders.
                          There is also a need to coordinate more closely with local governments, as many
                          local governments also run school grant programs to support school operating
                          expenses beyond basic BOS funding. It is important that these funds are used to
                          raise overall school standards beyond the level provided by BOS.

…and through              Finally, there is scope to revitalize the role of the BOS program in empowering
strengthening the         schools and local communities. School-level management of the funds could be

committees…               school committee, by transferring the responsibilities of the BOS team to the

more, but better, on      of school funding in an effort to promote more efficient spending, which other
Indonesia’s schools       studies have shown is also an urgent priority for Indonesia. Consolidating a larger
                          share of budgetary resources, and in particular teacher remuneration, into a BOS-
                          type formula has the potential to improve the quality of education spending. For
                          example, linking teacher resources for schools to student numbers could create
                          incentives for local governments to reduce the large number of small schools
                          currently in operation in many parts of the country. The challenge now is to build
                          on the initial successes of the BOS program, and explore how it and the
                          mechanisms it has introduced for allocating and managing resources can be adapted
                          to make an even bigger contribution to improving education outcomes in Indonesia.
