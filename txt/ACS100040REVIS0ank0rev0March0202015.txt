                                  Acknowledgments

This joint World Bank-IFC report was prepared by C. Mark Blackden and Maxie
Makambo Dominic (consultants), under the overall leadership and guidance of Anuja
Utz (World Bank) and Amy Luinstra (IFC) (co-task team leaders).

The team benefited from the valuable support of Franz Drees-Gross (Country Director
for Timor-Leste, Papua New Guinea, and the Pacific Islands, World Bank), Tania
Lozanky (Senior Manager, East Asia and Pacific Advisory Management, IFC), Gavin
Murray (Regional Manager, IFC ) and Steffi Stallmeister (Country Manager for
Papua New Guinea, World Bank). Helpful guidance provided by Laura Bailey
(former World Bank Country Manager, Papua New Guinea) and Carolyn Blacklock
(IFC Resident Representative, Papua New Guinea) is especially appreciated.

The team is grateful for the valuable support and insights provided by the staff of the
World Bank and IFC in Port Moresby, especially Liam Grealish (IFC) and Allan
Oliver (World Bank). Nicole Jenner, Erik Caldwell Johnson, Kofi Nouve, and James
Reichert (World Bank), and Deepak Adhikary, Charles Lor, Serah Sipani, and
Rahmad Syakib (IFC) provided useful inputs throughout the drafting process.

The report endeavors to reflect the ideas and perspectives of stakeholders met during
the in-country consultations in January-February 2014, and of the participants at the
stakeholder workshop that was held in Port Moresby in April 2014. This workshop
brought together some sixty participants — from government, the private sector,
think tanks, research institutes, NGOs, women’s groups, and the donor community —
who are actively engaged in the supply chains for coffee, cocoa and fresh produce in
Papua New Guinea. The workshop was facilitated by Deepak Adhikary, IFC. The
team appreciates the valuable time given by many people in the provinces (listed in
Annex 2), and especially the women (and men) farmers in Lae, Rabaul, Goroka, and
Mt. Hagen, who gave generously of their insights and experience.

The draft report was discussed at a joint World Bank-IFC decision meeting in June
2014. The team is grateful to Mona Sur (World Bank) and Roy Murray-Prior (Curtin
University) who served as peer reviewers for this report.

Finally, the team would like acknowledge the excellent support provided by Tasha
Sinai, Summerville Kave and Jeffrey Mavu from the World Bank and IFC offices in
Port Moresby in arranging the field visits and associated logistics in Papua New
Guinea, and to Craig Stemp for his help and advice on security issues. We also thank
Kirsten Bartlett, IFC for her help on the overall design of the report.

            The Fruit of her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable
                    Agribusiness in Papua New Guinea

                                        Overview
I       Background and Context

A       Objective of the Report

The overall goal of this report is to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) to achieve
greater impact for women from its current activities in agribusiness in Papua New
Guinea (PNG), and to provide clear recommendations on additional interventions
aimed at improving outcomes for women. The report focuses on the supply chains for
coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products (fresh produce), as there is a wealth of
knowledge on these supply chains and on gender issues, and these provide the best
opportunity to identify entry points for follow-up activities. Given the importance of
smallholders in PNG, and the need to understand gender dynamics in farming, this
report pays particular attention to the roles and constraints faced by smallholders,
without in so doing wishing to diminish the importance of the roles played by other
actors in these supply chains.

An earlier draft of this report was discussed at a Stakeholder Workshop in Port Moresby
on April 15, 2014. This provided participants with an opportunity to review the findings
presented in this report, to identify the major problems affecting women's participation
in these supply chains, and to propose solutions that can be implemented with the
support of the WBG and other partners. Key outcomes of workshop deliberations are
presented in Annex 6.

B       Supply Chains

A study of the fresh produce sector in PNG outlines a useful approach to analysis of
supply chains (Martin and Jagadish 2006). Key elements of a supply chain, in this
view, are that: (i) chains create value for all participants along the chain through
operations (product transformation or enhancement), integration of processes, quality
control, and logistics; (ii) firms are the key players, and "chain leaders" play a critical
role; (iii) relationships are critical for the functioning of the chain, as are the information
flows that support value-creation; (iv) such relationships are usually driven by "product
characteristics and market segments"; and (v) chain leaders "internalize" critical chain
functions through vertical integration of key processes to create competitive advantage.
Conceptually, therefore, behind the idea of a supply chain is the notion that processes
are linked, and that actors in the chain have both interest and power to make the chain
work for all involved.

It should be noted, however, that a purely business-focused view of supply chains
assumes a degree of economic rationality and operational coherence that may not
always be present in PNG. Consequently, it is also important to look at the wider socio-
economic context in which these chains operate, and which continues to exert a
                       The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


powerful influence on economic activity in general, and on the ways in which these
chains perform in particular.

C      Importance of Agriculture

Agriculture accounts for approximately one-third of GDP, and the sector is dominated
by smallholder farming systems. Along with oil palm, coffee and cocoa are the main
cash crops, with respectively over 30 percent and 20 percent of the total labor force
involved in their production, processing and sale. The coffee industry in PNG is a major
contributor to national income and employment. Almost 3.0 million people depend
directly or indirectly on coffee for their livelihoods. The industry is made up of about
400,000 households, 680 blocks ranging from 1-30 hectares, 7 plantations, 17
registered exporters, 59 registered processors, and over 6,000 roadside buyers.
Productivity is low, with yields on average 30-50 percent of their potential, and quality
has also been deteriorating. Cocoa is one of the major agricultural export crops for PNG
with an estimated 151,000 households, or about 1.0 million people, involved in the
industry. The cocoa sector has been devastated by the emergence of cocoa pod borer
(CPB). To-date, nine cocoa growing provinces have been confirmed to have CPB. In
East New Britain, which was once the leading cocoa producing region, production is
estimated to have declined by 80% as a result of CPB. The fresh produce (horticulture)
industry has great potential in PNG. A recent study looking at the feasibility of a
wholesale market for fresh produce in Port Moresby (POM) indicated that the total
demand for fresh produce in POM alone is now estimated to be 167,000 tonnes/annum,
compared to 140,500 tonnes/annum in 2008. Market demand for fresh produce is likely
to remain high in years to come, due largely to resource-led development, increased
urbanization, and a general rise in standards of living, with a doubling of demand in
POM alone projected over the next 20 years (Bonney et al 2012). Large quantities of
fresh produce can be grown in the Highlands provinces of PNG, while the major
markets are situated in the more highly populated coastal areas around POM, Lae and
Madang. Virtually all farmers in PNG grow food crops, mostly for subsistence needs,
with an increasing number producing surpluses for sale.

D      Country Gender Assessment

The World Bank undertook a Country Gender Assessment (CGA) in 2012, which
identified key gender issues in PNG. It specifically addressed issues related to the
challenge of providing gender-inclusive access to employment and economic resources.
The main CGA findings relating to economic opportunity are:

 There are inequalities in men's and women's economic opportunities in the
  agriculture sector that lead to inefficient use of the country's labour resources.
 Women farmers do not receive the level and type of training and extension support
  that they need to contribute their full potential to the agricultural economy.
 Women traders are more disadvantaged than men by unsafe and insanitary markets,
  and poor transport infrastructure.
 There are continuing differences and inequality between women and men in formal
  labour force participation, occupations and wages.
 In general, women and girls work longer hours than men and boys.
 Women are more negatively affected by the social impacts of, and receive fewer
  benefits from, resource extraction industries. Some good models exist for giving


                                                                                         viii

     women a share of the benefits from extractive industries, but these are not applied
     across all sites and industries (World Bank 2012a).

fresh produce in PNG. Data from the PPAP baseline survey show the importance of
harvesting and post-harvest processing in the overall labor allocation for coffee. These
are tasks predominantly carried out by women. Clearly, many factors determine the
quality of the cocoa and coffee that is exported, and the fresh produce that is sold in
both local and more distant markets. As pointed out at the Stakeholder Workshop,
improving road infrastructure, establishing cold storage facilities for fresh produce,
promoting the direct sale of red ripe cherry (coffee) where feasible, expanding
certification, and strengthening marketing systems and market linkages for farmers are
all key drivers of quality. All of these factors, alongside strengthening women's key
role, need to be in place if PNG is to maximize the quality of its agricultural products.

Women are directly engaged at critical stages of coffee and cocoa production and
processing; in coffee: picking (often strip picking) cherry, pulping, fermenting, and
drying; in cocoa: harvesting, breaking the pods, sorting of beans, transport of wet beans
for fermenting, putting wet beans in the fermentary, and managing the drying. All of
these are time-critical tasks: they must be undertaken promptly in relation to harvesting,
and for a specific amount of time. In both sectors, these tasks substantially determine
the quality of the coffee and cocoa delivered to the exporter.

The recent IFC baseline study for the coffee growing areas supported by the PPAP
(Murray-Prior 2014) shows men's and women's perceptions of their role in various
coffee-related and other tasks (Table 1). Of note is that women see themselves as having
more of a role than men in weeding, picking, milling, and drying, and that they also see
themselves as being involved in selling, albeit not to the same extent as men, and as
having a substantial role in land clearing. These perceptions also bear out the
disproportionate burden of domestic work that falls on women. The labor and time
requirements for cocoa harvesting differ in significant ways, as are the earnings that
can be obtained (Table 2).

If PNG wants to improve the quality of its coffee and cocoa on world markets, and
obtain corresponding premiums for better quality product, it must necessarily enable
women to fulfill these roles effectively. Doing so will have both "push" (operational
efficiency) and "pull" (market responsiveness) effects on the performance of the coffee
and cocoa supply chains. It should also be noted that while improvements in production

essential to ensure that there is adequate road and transport infrastructure, so as to
ensure that the best quality product can reach exporters in a timely manner. Investing
in road infrastructure aligned with production potential for these crops is an essential
input into delivering better quality.

In the case of fresh produce, women's role in determining quality is just as important.
Women dominate production, harvesting, sorting, packaging, transport to local
markets, and, in some instances, the first stages of transport to the roadside or to more
distant markets. When and how these tasks
are undertaken has a bearing on the quality Table 2: Key Characteristics of Wet and Dry

to afford, recommended appropriate
packaging materials for various crops; (c) lack of cool storage on the farm site, and of
cool storage facilities at markets, depots, and ports; (d) the use of inappropriate types
of transport (including PMVs) on poor roads; and (e) weak communications and
alignment of key actors along the supply chain, effectively contributing to greater
losses. As a result, the quality of fresh produce starts to diminish right on the farm, and,
as women attempt to move their produce from the farm to the nearest market, the
loss/waste in fresh produce increases. Moreover, larger issues of poor infrastructure
(including lack of cool chain and storage, and the poor condition of roads), compounded
by persistent violence and insecurity along transport routes, are further factors that
reduce quality substantially.

Three inter-related issues affect the ability of women in PNG to contribute to the
maximum extent to improving the quality of coffee, cocoa, and fresh produce. These
are:

 Incentives. The economic incentives for women either to allocate sufficient labor to
  these tasks, or, equally importantly, to do them well, are low. There is a substantial
  gap between the work done by women in the coffee and cocoa sectors and the benefit
  they obtain, since women do much (if not most) of the work, but have much less
  access to, or control of, the resulting income. Conflicting incentives among men and
  women are a major factor in low coffee productivity in PNG. Until women have the
  same motivation as men to engage fully in coffee and cocoa production, or have more
  of an opportunity to share in the income, the critical quality-enhancing tasks for
  which women are responsible will not be done adequately, and quality will suffer.


                                                                                            x

As one study notes, although average returns to labor were found to be higher for coffee than in food
production, women persevered with the heavy and less rewarding work of planting, harvesting, and
carrying food crops because the incentives were better. They exercised more personal control over
production, could intentionally produce a surplus over subsistence requirements for sale, and were able
to control and spend most of cash earned from selling food crops. Source: World Bank n.d.(3).

 Knowledge and Information. Women's access to the knowledge and skills required
  to carry out these tasks is extremely limited, as important gaps in education, literacy,
  skills, and participation in extension and training activities persist. Key issues are: (i)
  extension services and training reach a very small number of farmers, despite
  considerable effort by private sector players; (ii) discussions in the field suggest that
  about 75% of the extension effort/messages relate to "social" issues not "agronomy;"
  (iii) women are substantially less likely to benefit from extension and training than
  men; and (iv) it appears likely that neither men nor women fully appreciate the need
  for women to receive, and then be able to apply, the agronomic extension messages
  specifically related to the tasks for which they are primarily responsible. Moreover,
  generally low levels of education and literacy among women constitute a systemic
  barrier to unleashing women's productive potential in these sectors.

There are important gender differences in access to resources and knowledge. In the areas surveyed by
the IFC baseline study, education and literacy levels were found to be very low, with 25% of men and
75% of women not being able to read and write in Tok Pisin. Source: Murray-Prior 2014.

 Socio-Cultural Dynamics. There are important gender-specific dynamics at work
  in PNG society that differentially affect men's and women's capacity to exercise
  economic agency. PNG society is largely patriarchal, and the literature suggests that,
  even in matrilineal regions, men are seen as household heads and primary decision-
  makers. As a result, women have less access to, and control of, the resources needed
  to function economically, notably land and capital (financial services). While the
  PPAP baseline survey indicates that 56 percent of women perceive themselves as
  primary receivers of income from coffee, what is less clear is the extent to which
  women have control over the use of that income. Consequently, it will be important
  to analyze further the dynamics of household decision-making in PNG, and the extent
  to which women have an effective say in how income is used by smallholder
  households.

Men face many of the same issues confronting women in the agricultural sectors, including poorly
developed infrastructure, access to markets, pressure on land from population increases, and new pest
and disease threats. However, women's lack of access to land, assets, and extension services, their lack
of financial autonomy, the absence of collective action and entrepreneurial opportunities, create, as one
study notes, significant additional barriers, which are legal, cultural and situational, this latter pointing
to the fact that women are more likely to be victims of law and order issues. The systemic and consistent
discrimination experienced by women belies their potential and significantly hinders agricultural
productivity and development opportunities. Source: WIA 2014.



B        Broader Labor Dynamics Affect Outcomes

Labor issues cut across all the sectors, and have far-reaching implications for the
performance of these agribusiness supply chains. Of particular importance are gender
differences in labor allocation and in rewards to labor, and the ways in which social and


                                                                                                          xi
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


economic factors intersect in determining labor use. The importance of focusing on
labor activities undertaken by women to improve quality needs to be set against the
broader socio-cultural dynamics of labor use in PNG, which are key to understanding
the performance of these agribusiness supply chains. This is the case for five principal
reasons, outlined below.

 Smallholders do not view their activity as a "business." In coffee, where earnings
  are seasonal, farmers see coffee as a "mechanism to facilitate livelihoods," and not
  as an enterprise seeking maximum output and return (in some instances leading
  smallholders to replace coffee with fresh produce). The different stages of cocoa
  cultivation, reflecting the age and potential of the cocoa trees, are what gives rise to
  the distinction between "farming" and "foraging." This distinction reflects very
  different mind-sets on the part of farmers as to how to approach cocoa cultivation
  (Figure 1), where farmers tend to see their older blocks more as an "ATM" from
  which to obtain cash as and when needed.

 A lot of labor is allocated for social Figure 1: "Farming" vs. "Foraging"
  purposes. Social factors and
  obligations are at least as important
  as economic ones, if not more so, in
  determining what gets done. Church
  and community work absorbs a lot
  of people's time. Consequently,
  relationships along supply chains
  can be seen to have at least as much
  to do with clan and culture as with
  product characteristics and market
  dynamics. At the same time,
  decisions about what to cultivate,
  and what labor to allocate to it, are Source: Curry et al. 2007:97.
  made largely without reference to
  market drivers, and linkages with markets are weak. Notwithstanding, recent changes
  in labor dynamics, notably the evolution from a cooperative model (wok bung
  wantaim) to a more commercially-oriented model (makim mun), suggest that
  economic signals and market drivers are beginning to have an ever more important
  role in decisions about labor use (Curry and Koczberski 2009a).

 Farmers experience labor shortages. Table 3: Labor Allocation by Task and
  Households do not have enough labor to Sex, 1993 (hours/worker unit/day)
  do all the things they need to do, or to do      Task        Male Female      M=1;

  production, this directly affects their
  ability to allocate either sufficient or timely labor to key tree crop production and
  processing stages. Data from the 1990s suggest that rural labor is occupied for around
  4.25 hours/day, and it might be tempting to interpret this as indicating that labor is


                                                                                           xii
                            The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


    abundant. Overfield (1998) warns against this interpretation by pointing out that the
    division of labor is unequal: these data indicate that women work more than 3 times
    as much as men, especially when household work is included. Even in the area where
    there is the greatest parity between men and women in their labor allocation, namely
    the coffee sector, women still allocate nearly half as much time again as men do in
    this sector (Table 3). Moreover, seasonal peaks, and the time-critical nature of key
    tasks, further exacerbate labor constraints in all three sectors.

Even before the advent of CPB, which is estimated to have reduced cocoa yields by 80% in East New
Britain Province, labor shortages were identified as a critical issue in the cocoa sector. CPB exacerbates
the labor constraint by requiring an even more labor-intensive approach to cocoa block management and
cultivation, while simultaneously reducing the output from these blocks. It is estimated that it takes 2-3
times as much labor to manage cocoa blocks effectively since the advent of CPB. However, as pointed
out at the Stakeholder Workshop, this is a temporary situation, and, once CPB is under control, labor
allocation to cocoa cultivation can return to normal, pre-CPB, levels. Source: Curry et al. 2007.

 Farming systems are highly diversified. With perhaps few exceptions, smallholder
  farmers are very diversified, producing a range of fresh produce/food crops,
  alongside their cash crops. Diversification makes sense, in that it is a risk
  management strategy, reducing dependence on one crop for cash income. However,
  it is also possible that some smallholder farmers are trying to do too much with the
  limited labor they have, further contributing to labor shortages, especially at peak
  seasonal times for particular crops.

 Women are mostly confined to, and can only benefit from, short supply chains.
  Lack of mobility−through being more restricted to the homestead and not having
  access to transport services, compounded by persistent insecurity−means that women
  are largely excluded from key downstream activities along the supply chains, where
  cocoa and coffee is sold to exporters (done by men, who, according to many women
  interviewed, then pocket the cash). This, alongside heavy workloads and cultural
  constraints, contributes to women being confined to, and largely only being able to
  benefit from, shorter supply chains in the fresh produce sector, where produce is sold
  in local markets close to the homestead.

C        Provision of Key Support Services is Limited

Several key services are either absent or insufficient. In addition to the limited reach,
and focus, of extension services, other key services are often not available to
smallholders. Input supply is weak and inconsistent. New varieties are not readily
available to farmers, and need to be developed to take account of PNG's specific climate
and agricultural requirements. This is especially important in the fresh produce sectors,
and in further developing cocoa clonal varieties that are resistant to cocoa pod borer
(CPB). The importance of having a consistent supply of reliable, quality and affordable
agricultural inputs, in particular, vegetable seeds for the fresh produce sectors, was
highlighted among smallholder farmers.

There is limited access to financial services. The inability of smallholder farmers to
meet the lending criteria of microcredit and financial institutions, particularly collateral,
is hindering their ability to access credit when needed. There are also important gender-
specific barriers to accessing finance, as women tend not to own the land, fixed assets,
or other resources that are needed to meet collateral requirements.


                                                                                                     xiii

It is estimated that around 5 percent of PNG coffee exports are "specialty" coffees, including organic,
Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, and Utz certified. Certification schemes pursue a range of social and
environmental sustainability goals. For the most part, gender issues are not especially prominent in
certification schemes, though opportunities exist to promote more gender-responsive schemes. The
PPAP baseline survey indicates that 13% of households claim to have any knowledge of certification
(2% "strong" knowledge). This is highly concentrated in provinces where exporters work. Around 8%
reported having certification for their coffee, and, of these, 1/2 expressed little or no interest in
continuing. Half of the households surveyed were not interested in paying for certification, a finding
which suggests, according to the baseline survey, that the benefits of certification are not sufficient to
justify paying for it. Source: Murray-Prior and Padarath 2013.

D        Systemic Issues Persist and Affect Supply Chain Performance

Insecurity (especially for women) is pervasive and remains a significant issue.
Crime and violence remain at high levels in PNG, especially along transport corridors.
It affects women's ability to serve in the field as researchers and extension agents. It
has direct implications for extension services, in that key players indicate that pervasive
insecurity essentially precludes them from deploying women to areas or communities
unknown to them. Insecurity directly affects the transport of goods, especially on the
Highland highway, where transporters face losses from crime and violence, or are
reluctant to provide the full range of services that might be needed. Moreover,
insecurity is a major concern for those women selling produce in open urban markets.
Improving security at Port Moresby's principal food markets is the subject of an
interesting project supported by UN Women, and priority needs to be given to projects
of this kind to make market spaces better places for women to work.

Poor infrastructure limits the performance of all supply chains and substantially
raises the cost of doing business in PNG. Key infrastructure issues include: (i)
transport links are poor and costs are high; (ii) the absence of a cold chain and cold
storage facilities is a significant problem for the fresh produce sectors, and leads to high
product losses and waste; (iii) lack of electricity, and frequent power cuts, add to the
operating costs for actors along the supply chains; and (iv) poor communication
infrastructure and high costs are an obstacle limiting information flows throughout the
chains. These infrastructure barriers, coupled with insecurity, lead to delays in transport
of goods to markets and ports, non-use of refrigerated trucks along key highways, lack
of communication between farmers, buyers, and exporters as to volumes of produce to
ship, and timing of ship arrivals and departures, all of which lead to high levels of delay,
uncertainty, and waste of product.

Lack of information, knowledge, communications, and services (including
education and health) more generally, is a further systemic barrier to gender-
equitable agribusiness, as cogently articulated by the participants at the Stakeholder
Workshop (see Annex 6). Specifically, stakeholders pointed out weaknesses in
communications and information services throughout the supply chains, which result
in insufficient knowledge of market dynamics and requirements, poor coordination
with transport and other services, lower productivity, and persistence of subsistence-
focused, as opposed to business-oriented, farming. At the same time, poor education
and health services, and lack of public expenditure prioritization and accountability also
affect the performance of these supply chains.




                                                                                                      xiv
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


An issue common to all three agribusiness sectors is the lack of business orientation by
smallholder farmers, while the need for farmers to treat these activities as a business is
perhaps at the core of developing successful supply chains in these sectors. Indeed, one
of the critical challenges facing these sectors in PNG is to shift smallholders toward a
more business-oriented view of their work. Yet, as the fresh produce sector aptly
illustrates, market linkages are weak, so much so that the feasibility study for a POM
wholesale market begins with a question: "Yu Tokim Mi Long Planim Kai kai Na
Maket We"? -- You ask me to plant vegetables, but where is the market? (Bonney et al.
2012). If farmers are to become more business-focused, there need to be the business
opportunities and market linkages to support the change.

Enabling women to be at least as much a part of these shifts as men is perhaps one of
the critical avenues available to PNG to improve performance and incomes throughout
these chains, and especially in the fresh produce sector, where, as noted, women are
confined to, and can only benefit from, very short supply chains, i.e., such markets as
exist in the immediate vicinity of their production sites. This in turn requires not only
better linkages between farmers in general and the markets they serve, but also, and
especially, better access by women to these markets and to the opportunities they
present. Bringing markets closer to women, or enabling women to have access to more
distant markets, might well be key contributors to shifting farmers (men and women)
to a more business-focused approach to their work. As this report discusses elsewhere,
it will not be possible to improve the "business" orientation of farmers, whether men or
women, if market linkages are weak or non-existent.

III    Principal Recommendations

The recommendations below reflect, in part, the deliberations of the Stakeholder
Workshop held in Port Moresby on April 15, 2014, which gave a wide range of
stakeholders in these sectors an opportunity to discuss the findings of this report, to
identify key issues and challenges, and to propose solutions, based on their own
experience and priorities. The principal results of the Stakeholder Workshop, and the
sector-specific recommendations are summarized in Annex 6, and the
recommendations below should be read in conjunction with that summary.

A      Focus on Women as Key to Quality

Incentives

 Improve the capacity of women to benefit directly from the income earned in the
  cocoa, coffee, and fresh produce sectors, through a series of interconnected measures:
  (i) facilitate the establishment of direct payment systems, where women are
  supported in opening bank accounts, accessing financial services, and obtaining
  electronic payment for their produce directly from the buyer, or, in the case of fresh
  produce, the aggregator; (ii) support the aggregation of production by cooperatives
  or associations and groups in which women are represented, thereby taking decision-
  making outside the household, and promoting greater transparency between men and
  women in the income received and how it is used; and (iii) support training and
  sensitization efforts (including through PV training) aimed at shifting cultural norms
  and mind-sets relating to women's economic contribution.



                                                                                           xv
                       The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


 Examine the extent to which certification schemes in the coffee and cocoa sectors
  (Rainforest Alliance, 4C, UTZ, Fair Trade, Organic) include gender equality
  provisions in capturing "social" co-benefits, how these provisions are being
  implemented, and how compliance is monitored. Strengthen the gender focus of these
  certification schemes, notably as they relate to narrowing the gap between work done
  and benefit obtained, and how they support or facilitate greater female participation
  in family decision-making over use of income. As this issue goes beyond PNG and
  these agribusiness supply chains, the WBG, and notably the IFC, could play a
  catalytic role in promoting a global gender equality standard in certification criteria
  and validation processes.
 Use planned data collection and analysis, notably in the coffee and cocoa sectors,
  including farmer profiling, time use surveys, and analysis of economic opportunity
  in these sectors, to strengthen the business case for women's involvement in these
  supply chains. This in turn should help to underpin prioritization of critical
  infrastructure investments (roads, transport, storage, cold chain) aimed at raising
  quality and production in these sectors.
 In parallel, support measures to ease women's overall labor burdens in the household,
  and measures to facilitate direct sale by women of produce to buyers, and direct
  payment (non-cash) to women for produce sold.

Knowledge and Information

 Support commodity exporters and others in their initiatives to structure the design
  and delivery of extension and training services in ways that maximize women's
  inclusion. Consider adoption of a specific target (of 30% or 40%) of female
  participation in extension and training programs. Stakeholders suggested establishing
  farmer field schools in cocoa and coffee areas, setting up a coffee college for women
  extension agents, and developing women-friendly curricula, and using new
  technologies (example: "digital green") to communicate knowledge and to facilitate
  women's access to training opportunities.
 Re-focus extension and training messages specifically toward the quality-enhancing
  tasks for which women are responsible. In coffee, this may mean making sure that
  the importance of not strip picking coffee cherries from the trees, and of properly
  drying the coffee beans (to green bean stage), is sufficiently internalized by the
  women who actually have to do this work. In cocoa, this may mean focusing on
  timely processing after harvest, including sorting, pod opening, fermentation, and
  drying. In fresh produce, this may involve focusing on post-harvest practices, product
  enhancement, and transport/storage issues.
 In the cocoa sector, focus on developing women's technical skills and capacities to
  work in nurseries and bud gardens, and develop this as a possible career path for
  women toward training and employment as extension agents in the sector.
  Concurrently, it is important to focus on the economic viability of cocoa nurseries.
 Assess the impact and effectiveness of the "social" components of extension
  messages to provide a baseline and targets against which to measure changes in the
  "socio-cultural" factors that affect agricultural performance and productivity. Key
  areas to explore would be changes in the benefits women obtain for work done (i.e.,
  having a larger share of income from farming activities) and changes in burden-
  sharing (division of labor) for domestic tasks within the household.
 Put in place measures to enable more female extension agents to be deployed in the
  field. This could be undertaken through: (i) improving the overall climate of security

  and safety, by reducing community violence, and violence against women
  specifically; (ii) expanding the numbers of female extension agents and technicians,
  including through support to a scholarship/training scheme to build the pipeline of
  female graduates in the agricultural sciences for careers in both extension and
  research; and (iii) designing extension schemes in ways that enable people (especially
  women) to serve as extension agents in their own communities, where, it is argued,
  they are more likely to be safe from random violence.
 Consider strengthening the use of quality protocols at each step of the three supply
  chains, outlining the critical steps (and who does them) involved in maximizing
  quality. This can build on the work already done by coffee and cocoa exporters, and
  by the FPDA in developing quality standards for selected crops. Concurrently, it is
  essential to ensure that these protocols are integrated into extension and training
  packages, to improve farmer knowledge of quality issues at all stages of production
  and processing, and of the impact of quality on the prices they obtain for their
  produce.

Socio-Cultural Dynamics

 Assess the impact of personal viability (PV) training, specifically as this relates to
  improving women's income-earning/sharing and participation in decision-making. If
  warranted, support continued personal viability (PV), or related forms of training,
  aimed at strengthening women's voice in the household and the community. Related
  to this is the importance of conducting training for the "whole family," as stressed
  during the Stakeholder Workshop (Annex 6), and ensuring that both men and women
  participate jointly in training activities, thereby improving spousal communication
  and partnership.
 Identify, and work with, existing rural-based networks, such the PV network, or other
  farmer cooperatives and associations who, in one way or another, have advocated for
  women's greater participation in the development process, and support ways
  (including through PV training) to facilitate greater burden-sharing between men and
  women of domestic work.
 Support measures aimed at reducing family and sexual violence (FSV) in agricultural
  communities. Specifically, develop and put in place relevant measures (e.g., phone
  banking) that allow women and girls not to have to carry cash. Other measures
  include fostering and maintaining strong partnerships with concerned parties such as
  village councillors, village magistrates, the police and the churches, to work jointly
  to put in place prevention, treatment, social, and justice services aimed at reducing
  FSV incidence and risk in the community.



B      Tackle Gender Differences in Labor Dynamics

 Gather baseline data on women's and men's involvement in each stage of the
  agricultural cycle, as called for in the PPAP baseline. This should include shared and
  separate tasks, and provide a basis for examining changes over time in the division
  of labor for agricultural and other tasks between males and females.
 Implement a program to analyze the dynamics of labor allocation at the smallholder
  level, and in different regions of the country, including addressing evolving market-



                                                                                        xvii
                       The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


  based and paid vs. community and family mutual support mechanisms of labor
  mobilization.
   Commission time use surveys and research to generate new and updated data on
    the gender division of labor in each of these sectors to inform policy-making and
    program design. Such surveys need to include data collection and analysis of all
    tasks undertaken by men and women, including domestic work, so that a more
    complete picture of the labor uses of men and women can be obtained.
   Identify, and incorporate into program design, crop-, task-, and season-specific
    labor shortages and constraints, disaggregated by sex, in each of these sectors.
   Identify, and incorporate into program design, region- and farming-system specific
    differences in the dynamics of labor allocation.
 Address what a Stakeholder Workshop participant described as "absurd demands on
  women's time" through support to programs aimed at providing key household-level
  infrastructure services (this applies especially to improving water supply and
  sanitation, and expanding access to energy at the household level, especially for
  cooking), and labor-saving technologies to women to alleviate women's domestic
  workloads.

C      Improve Gender-Responsiveness of Key Services

 Build and strengthen market analysis and research capacity in key institutions
  (notably CCI, CIC, FPDA).
   Establish market research capacity to identify specific market opportunities for
    PNG in the three sectors.
   Identify, and develop, market opportunities of particular interest for, and benefit
    to, women. In this respect, identify economically productive activities that women
    could engage in, where priors about male control are either absent or much weaker.
    These could include: apiculture, floriculture, spices and essential oils, coconuts
    (not just copra), poultry, pig-farming, peanuts, and generating further value-added
    along the supply chain in cocoa, for example by producing chocolate in PNG
    (Paradise Foods).
 Improve the supply of agricultural inputs (notably seeds, fertilizer, pesticides), in a
  manner that is consistent and reliable, and that incorporates the development of new
  varieties of key products. Develop further the recommendation made at the
  Stakeholder Workshop to establish seed production, storage, and distribution
  facilities in the fresh produce sector in key provincial and regional centers. Put in
  place measures to enable NARI and FPDA to work collaboratively with the private
  sector in both identifying and meeting the needs of farmers for seeds and inputs that
  are appropriate and accessible. One option to consider, discussed at the Stakeholder
  Workshop, was to explore agribusiness dealer approaches, which would bring retail
  outlets for inputs closer to farmers.
 Assess the current organizational capacities of Women’s Groups (including PNG
  Women in Agriculture, PNG Women in Coffee, and other NGOs/CBOs, who are
  directly involved in promoting gender-inclusive agricultural development). On the
  basis of the assessment, develop and implement relevant strategies to improve the
  overall capacities of these women’s groups to lead and assist women farmers in
  producing, processing, and marketing of coffee, cocoa, and fresh produce.

D      Address Systemic Barriers Affecting Supply Chain Performance



                                                                                        xviii
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


Transport system/roads need building/upgrading

 Of particular importance for the fresh produce sectors will be upgrading and
  maintaining the Highlands Highway, and other major roads, and giving consideration
  to building new roads such as the proposed Jimi–Madang Highway or the Kerema-
  POM Highway.
 Bring infrastructure development and prioritization into greater alignment with the
  productive potential in these three agribusiness sectors. To do this will require: (i)
  better data collection and analysis of farming activities, including tree counts, farmer
  profiling, and production possibilities; (ii) using these data to strengthen the business
  case for farming and for building associated infrastructure, as a means of expanding
  the productive potential of these sectors; and (iii) prioritizing infrastructure, notably
  road construction and maintenance, transport services, and establishment of cold
  chain and storage facilities, in ways that support and strengthen the productive
  potential of these sectors.

Cold chain/storage facilities accessible to small-scale producers

 In the fresh produce sector, participants at the Stakeholder Workshop recommended
  the establishment of cool storage facilities at key provincial and central locations,
  which would be managed by a private sector company. This company would provide
  key support services to farmers, and would be responsible for managing the cool
  storage facilities and managing all transportation and distribution requirements, thus
  enabling farmers to sell their produce at the farm gate. This approach would have the
  additional advantage of shortening the supply chain, from the farmer's perspective,
  considerably, thus enabling women farmers to reap direct benefits from their
  production.

Improved security along transport corridors and in markets

 Strengthen existing initiatives that are currently in place to address insecurity, for
  instance, working with the UN Women in addressing insecurity among women in the
  open urban markets throughout the city of Port Moresby. Key measures to consider
  include provision of banking and financial access services within market spaces;
  providing toilet and child care facilities for women inside markets; substantially
  strengthening market security through adequate policing and provision of security
  services; and facilitating women's greater participation in market management,
  oversight, and decision-making.
 Coordinate transporting and marketing activities on behalf of women – working with
  established groups including cooperatives or associations, coordinate the marketing
  and transporting of women’s produce. This will allow women to remain where they
  are – in their homes or village – but still sell their produce and earn cash incomes.
  Women would not have to travel to market their produce where they are more
  exposed to danger.
 Work with existing networks to reduce family and sexual violence experienced by
  women in rural communities. To this effect, work closely with relevant parties (the
  police, elected Village Councillors, Magistrates and Churches) to reduce men’s
  access to alcohol and drugs.
 Strengthen community-level capacity to deal with theft of coffee and cocoa, as this
  was identified as a significant issue in the Stakeholder Workshop. Specifically,


                                                                                          xix
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


  ensure that communities and local-level government agencies take ownership of this
  issue, and implement locally-appropriate solutions, including strengthening village
  courts, building community-level government, and providing sufficient manpower
  and resources (policing) commensurate with the need in the communities concerned.

Broader knowledge and information systems need strengthening

Modern communications technology (notably internet and mobile telephony) can be
used pro-actively to improve women's access to critical information and services. Based
on the recommendations of the Stakeholder Workshop, two key initiatives could be
prioritized.

 Establish a Communications Initiative in each of the three supply chains, in
  partnership: (a) with private sector providers of mobile phone and internet services;
  and (b) with input suppliers traders, aggregators, shippers, and buyers, to facilitate
  information flows between producers and these other actors in the supply chains on
  input requirements, production schedules, weather and related issues, security
  conditions, prices, market conditions, transport links, shipping schedules, and
  emerging market opportunities (for example food provisioning for LNG and other
  mining sites), to strengthen both the operating efficiency ("push" factors) and market
  responsiveness ("pull" factors) of the supply chain. In so doing, pro-actively facilitate
  the access of women farmers, groups, and associations to these communications
  services, and provide training and capacity-building in their use. This could involve
  building further on existing collaboration with Digicel in the context of the IFC
  Agribusiness Project.

 Support banks and other financial service providers, and work in collaboration with
  buyers and traders, to develop products and services which enable women: (i) to open
  bank accounts in their own name, and/or to do so jointly with their husbands; (ii) to
  obtain non-cash payment for products sold to buyers; (iii) to access financial services
  in markets where fresh produce is sold; and (iv) to access a broader range of financial
  services, including credit and insurance.

 The Fruit of her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness
                       in Papua New Guinea

1      Introduction: Background, Context, and Approach
1.1    Background

The World Bank Group (WBG) has been active in supporting agriculture in Papua New
Guinea (PNG) since 1969, before independence in 1975. In 2009, the Bank undertook
to support a Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP), which has been
under implementation since 2010. The project focuses on the cocoa and coffee sectors.
The PPAP aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholder cocoa and coffee producers
through improvement of the performance and sustainability of value chains in cocoa-
and coffee-producing areas. The project has three components:

 Institutional strengthening and industry coordination. The objective of this
  component is to improve the performance of sector institutions and to enhance
  industry coordination in the coffee and cocoa sectors. Existing stakeholder platforms
  for industry coordination will be consolidated to address short- and long-term issues
  such as sector governance, skills development in the industry, improvement in
  extension services, industry strategy on threats to quality and quality promotion,
  information within the industry, market development and crop diversification.
 Productive partnerships. The objective of this component is to increase the
  integration of smallholder producers in performing and remunerative value chains by
  developing and implementing productive alliances between smallholders and the
  private sector aiming at improving market linkages in the project areas.
 Market access infrastructure. The objective of this component is to improve market
  access for smallholder cocoa and coffee growers in the areas targeted in the project.

To-date, 25 partnerships (between smallholder farmers and lead partners including
exporters, processors, knowledge and service providers) have been approved and about
18,000 farmers are directly benefiting from the project in six provinces of PNG.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides Investment and Advisory
Services in the Agribusiness Sector in PNG. Taking an investment-led approach, IFC's
Agribusiness-PNG project aims to enable 4,500 lead firm-linked coffee and cocoa
farmers, including 1,485 women farmers, to graduate into more productive and
sustainable enterprises through the adoption of better farming practices, application of
higher quality inputs, such as seeds and tools, as well as increased use of market
information in managing farm operations. IFC is also currently providing support to the
National Catering Service (NCS), one of the key providers of food services to the
country's large mining sector operations.

1.2    Context: Strengthening the Focus on Gender Issues

The WBG has been actively engaged in addressing gender issues in PNG. Starting in
2006, the Bank has supported a Women in Mining program in PNG, aimed at enabling
women to contribute to, and benefit from, investments in the mining sector (see
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


Popoitai and Ofosu-Amaah 2013). More recently, and notably since the publication of
the World Bank's flagship 2012 World Development Report (WDR) on Gender
Equality and Development (see World Bank 2011b), the WBG has been keen to address
gender more systematically in its operational work. In 2011-12, the Bank, in close
collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB), other key partners, and the
Government of PNG (GoPNG), undertook a Country Gender Assessment (CGA),
which outlined key issues and recommendations for the WBG to address gender in its
work. Key findings of the CGA are summarized in Box 2.1 in Chapter 2. The WBG's
2013-16 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) explicitly focuses on achievement of
development outcomes that are gender-responsive (World Bank 2012b). Following on
the publication of the gender WDR, the WBG has supported further work specifically
in PNG on women's voice and agency (Andrew 2013), as well as work to tackle crime
and violence in the country, which led to a pioneering set of stakeholder consultations
on the subject in March 2014. This work includes focus on "family and sexual
violence," which is widely regarded as a major issue in PNG (see discussion in Section
2.4 below).

The WBG is undertaking a joint program on Gender Empowerment in the Pacific,
which includes activities to help improve equality for women in the Pacific. The
objectives of this program are to:

   Promote women’s migration to formal sector employment;
   Improve women’s access to public services and financial services;
   Enhance women’s security and safety, in private and public spaces; and
   Increase the number of women in positions of leadership in business and society.

The program is now in its pre-implementation phase, and is aiming to establish the
baseline and analytical diagnostics needed to design effective advisory services to
enhance gender empowerment in the Pacific, including the conduct of "gender audits"
for key businesses.

These various gender-related activities provide the foundation for deepening the focus
on gender in the WBG's operational work in PNG in the coming years. In fact, the WB
PPAP and IFC Agribusiness projects have been notably pro-active in both analyzing
the relevance of gender issues for these operations (see notably World Bank n.d.(3);
Agrifood Consulting International 2009; Giovannucci and Hunt 2009; Murray-Prior
and Padarath 2013; and Murray-Prior 2014), and in addressing the issues raised in the
design and implementation of projects. These extensive analyses constitute a valuable
platform for deepening the understanding of gender issues in these agribusiness supply
chains, from which this report seeks to draw.

1.3      Purpose of this Report

The overall goal of this report is to assist the WBG in achieving greater impact for
women from its current activities in agribusiness and the associated supply chains in
PNG, and to provide clear recommendations on additional interventions aimed at
improving outcomes for women in agribusiness supply chains. As noted in the task
TORs (Annex 7), agribusiness and related supply chains include crop production,
agricultural extension services, seed supply, agrichemicals, farm machinery,
distribution, transport, processing, marketing, and retail sales and food services.


                                                                                            2
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG




The study focuses on the supply chains for coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products
(fresh produce). These have been chosen, as organized supply chains exist for these
three commodities. There is also a wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated on
the supply chains for these products and on gender aspects by the World Bank and the
IFC, as well as by other partners (see bibliography in Annex 1). Working in these supply
chains therefore provides the best opportunity to identify entry points for follow-up
activities. Given the importance of smallholders in PNG, and the need to understand
gender dynamics in farming, this report pays particular attention to the roles and
constraints faced by smallholders, without in so doing wishing to diminish the
importance of the roles played by other actors in these supply chains.

Based on this analysis, the report aims to identify both short- and longer-term
interventions that the WBG can implement to address obstacles and to strengthen
opportunities for women in these sectors. To this end, an earlier draft of this report
helped to inform the deliberations at a Stakeholder Workshop held in Port Moresby on
April 15, 2014, which led to identification of key issues in each sector, and to
articulation of key action points. The principal outcomes of this workshop are
summarized in Annex 6.

1.4    Approach and Methodology

This report is based on: (i) a review of available literature aimed at facilitating a better
understanding of the key agribusiness sectors in the country and the principal gender
issues facing the country, including social and cultural factors as these affect
agriculture−the literature reviewed, and other relevant materials consulted are listed in
Annex 1; (ii) in-country consultations and field visits, to meet with key stakeholders
throughout the relevant supply chains, as well as with researchers, practitioners, and
NGOs−the list of people met during the January-February 2014 consultations in PNG
is in Annex 2; (iii) review of WBG activities (projects and analytical work) in these
sectors that support identifying and acting on gender issues in the WBG's operational
programs in PNG; and (iv) conduct of a Stakeholder Workshop and an internal WBG
planning workshop in April 2014, allowing key stakeholders to review an earlier draft
of this report and to present their own ideas and recommendations to address the issues
identified.

It is important to bear in mind that, as discussed further in Annex 3, there are significant
limitations with respect to the data available in PNG for the kind of gender-focused
analysis that is needed. Specifically, data on the allocation of men's and women's labor
to the range of tasks along the supply chain, notably with respect to production and
post-harvest processing, are virtually non-existent, as the only study to provide
estimates of men's and women's time use dates from the late 1990s, and relies on data
collected in 1992-93 (Overfield 1998). Moreover, this study relates only to the coffee
sector, and knowledge gaps with respect to the gender division of labor in cocoa are
greater. Recent analyses, including the PPAP baseline survey (UniQuest 2013) and the
IFC Coffee baseline (Murray-Prior 2014), do not provide data from time-use surveys,
but they do provide valuable information on perceptions by farmers as to who plays
dominant (main worker) and subordinate roles at different points in the production and
processing cycle, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. In the absence of detailed sex-
disaggregated data on labor use, it is also not possible to attribute to men or to women


                                                                                            3
                       The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


their respective contributions to value-addition in these supply chains, nor to determine
the specific distribution of income or other benefits from chain activities between men
and women. In this respect, the report relies on findings from the extensive, though
often qualitative, literature in PNG. Moreover, while the PPAP baseline survey does
provide information on the share of women receiving income from coffee, it does not
address the underlying dynamics of intra-household decision-making, and this is clearly
an area about which little is known and where more research needs to be done.

1.5    Organization of this Report

Following this introduction, Chapter 2 presents a summary of key gender issues in
PNG, with particular reference to how these affect the agribusiness sectors. Chapters
3-5 discuss the key characteristics, and associated gender issues, in the coffee, cocoa,
and fresh produce sectors, respectively. Chapter 6 presents the main findings and
recommendations. Annex 1 contains the bibliography of literature reviewed and other
references, and the people consulted in Port Moresby, and in Lae, Rabaul, Kerevat,
Goroka, and Mt. Hagen, are listed in Annex 2. Additional conceptual and background
information on supply chains in general, and their gender dimensions in particular, is
in Annex 3. More detailed background material on the coffee and cocoa sectors is in
Annex 4, while a more extensive treatment of the fresh produce sector is in Annex 5.
The main results of the April 2014 Stakeholder Workshop are summarized in Annex 6,
and task terms of reference are in Annex 7.

2       Gender Issues in Papua New Guinea
2.1     Country Overview

The World Bank's 2011-12 Country Gender Assessment (CGA) provides critical
insights into gender disparities and issues in PNG (World Bank 2012a). Key findings
are summarized in Box 2.1.

 Box 2.1: Principal Findings from the PNG Country Gender Assessment

  Legal Status and Rights. The constitution provides for gender equity and equality, but customary
   law, recognised by the constitution, discriminates against women in relation to rights and property.
  Voice and Representation. Papua New Guinea remains close to the bottom of the world's scale
   for women's parliamentary representation and participation. As of November 2012, only 3 of
   PNG's 111 parliamentarians are women (2.7%).
  Education. There is a persistent gap in the percentage of girls and boys of eligible age enrolled in
   secondary school, tertiary education and training institutions. At primary school level, the gender
   gap has narrowed in the last 15 years. Concerns for girls' safety are a significant barrier to their
   school attendance. There are persistent rural-urban gaps, with urban respondents 30 percent more
   likely to   report being literate than rural respondents. Significant regional variations also exist;
   for example, women are quite close to parity   in literacy in the Islands region but very far behind
   in the Highlands region.
  Health. There has been little improvement in key health indicators (e.g., maternal mortality, access
   to reproductive health care, malnutrition among women and children) especially for the majority
   rural population. Health services have declined in rural areas, and the impact of this is larger for
   women who face greater obstacles to accessing such care than men. For example, when women
   need to travel to health care centres they face greater security risks and bear greater opportunity
   costs than men. Gender inequality at home (decision making and control over resources) hinders
   women's health seeking behaviour, for instance, causing delays in seeking medical help during
   delivery and decisions on the use of family planning methods.
  HIV/AIDS. Gender relations and gender inequality are significant drivers of the HIV and AIDS
   epidemic in Papua New Guinea. Women and girls are more vulnerable to HIV infection and other
   STIs. Women's lack of power and rights in sexual relations and the high risk of gender-based
   violence increase the likelihood of HIV transmission.

2.2     Men and Women in the PNG Economy

The CGA addressed the key issues related to the development challenge of providing
gender-inclusive access to employment and economic resources. Its main findings
were:

 There are inequalities in men's and women's economic opportunities in the
  agriculture sector that lead to inefficient use of the country's labour resources.
 Women farmers do not receive the level and type of training and extension support
  that they need to contribute their full potential to the agricultural economy.
 Women traders are more disadvantaged than men by unsafe and insanitary markets,
  and poor transport infrastructure.
 There are continuing differences and inequality between women and men in formal
  labour force participation, occupations and wages.
 In general, women and girls work longer hours than men and boys.
 Women are more negatively affected by the social impacts of, and receive fewer


                                                                                                           5
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


  benefits from, resource extraction industries. Some good models exist for giving
  women a share of the benefits from extractive   industries, but these are not applied
  across all sites and industries (World Bank 2012a:xvii).

The findings of this report, discussed in the chapters that follow, confirm that each of
these key points directly relates to the agriculture sector, namely inequality in access to
economic opportunity, differences in access to training and extension support, traders
disadvantaged by poor market conditions and infrastructure, and the wider problem of
longer working hours (see Section 2.3 below).

2.3    Non-Market Work and Time Use

There is very little information available on the ways in which men and women use
their time, nor of the division of tasks between men and women and the balance
between domestic and economic work. Murray-Prior and Padarath (2013) state that
many rural women in PNG work long hours for the wellbeing of their households and
engage in a variety of livelihood strategies to support their families, their communities
and themselves. Caring for children, the elderly and the ill; collecting water and fuel
for cooking and heat; planting food gardens; and maintaining households and preparing
food are largely women’s responsibilities. They note that the PPAP Baseline Study (see
box 3.1 below) found that only 14% of households surveyed had drinking water
available at the house. They conclude that the unequal division of labor within the
household creates a heavy time burden for rural women, which is exacerbated by
inadequate or inaccessible social and health infrastructure, and a lack of facilities and
institutional support.

The study undertaken by Overfield (1998) is focused on the coffee sector, but his data
set includes the labor allocated by men and women for food production and for
household tasks. As Table 3.1 below shows, men allocate relatively little time to
household tasks (0.41 hrs/day) compared with an allocation of 2.69 hrs/day by women,
i.e., women devote more than 6 times as many hours to household work as do men.
When the full range of tasks carried out by men and women is taken into account, it is
apparent that women's workloads are considerably greater than those of men, and that
their time use is much more constrained than is the case for men. As will be seen notably
in the coffee and cocoa supply chains, this has implications for labor use for time-
critical agricultural tasks.

One positive aspect to emerge from consultations undertaken for this report and in the
research literature is that men acknowledge that women do more work than they do,
even though men do not then think about or devise ways to share the workload with
women. As expressed by a community leader in the Baiyer Valley of the Western
Highlands Province, ‘women work more than men in those activities they listed down.
They do more than men. Women in our community work harder than men’ (Pamphilon
et al. 2013:108). This acknowledgement by men that women do more work is a good
entry point for developing specific strategies aimed at promoting greater sharing of the
workload between men and women.


2.4    Gender-Based Violence



                                                                                            6
                          The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


The CGA indicates that gender-based violence in PNG appears to be widely accepted
and culturally condoned (World Bank 2012a:xviii). It suggests that violence against
women is common throughout the country, and it makes the point that such violence,
and the threat or fear of it, significantly reduces the range of actions a women can
undertake to support her family (World Bank 2012a:xvi). Many of the family and
sexual violence offences committed in agricultural communities are related to the
consumption of alcohol and drugs, such as marijuana, by men and boys. When they
need money to buy beer and drugs, they beat up their wives, mothers, and sisters for
money to go and drink. This climate of violence and insecurity has important
implications for women's mobility (access to transport services and markets for
agricultural produce), and limits their capacity to serve as field workers and extension
agents, thus restricting outreach by key agricultural services to women farmers.

Murray-Prior and Padarath (2013) confirm that "family and sexual violence" (FSV) is
an "extremely serious problem" throughout PNG, noting that "endemic levels of
violence have implications for public health and social policy, economic development,
and justice and law enforcement" (Murray-Prior and Padarath, 2013:11).

2.5    Gender Dynamics and Economic Opportunity in PNG

2.5.1 Household Dynamics and Subordination of Women

The CGA (World Bank 2012a) discusses the frequent identification of the household
as the productive unit, with the assumption that members of the household share
economic interests and production incentives. Overfield emphasizes that the "unitary"
household, prevalent in economic theory, is not applicable in PNG.

       In many ways the household as a single economic unit does not appear to exist in the fashion
       portrayed by many writings in neoclassical theory ... . Even if the household does exist and
       could be collapsed into a single unit following unified goals, resource allocation would still
       probably not reach an efficiency position due to high levels of market failure. The basis of this
       market failure is the social subordination of women; female labour is in relatively short supply
       yet the price of this labour (hourly cash returns) is extremely low compared to that of men whose
       labour is in relative abundance. The price, and therefore supply, of different types of labour is
       not economically, but socially, determined. Models using the price of labour to explain its
       allocation are flawed in this context. Markets cannot produce efficient allocation of resources
       where major sections of the labour force are heavily discriminated against. This exerts
       considerable influence on household performance in coffee production ... (Overfield 1998:61).

Overfield links these social drivers of economic opportunity to a broader discussion of
the importance of patriarchy in PNG. He outlines a model that seeks to explain patterns
of resource allocation, and the distribution of benefits, within PNG households, where
labor is allocated and rewards are determined according to criteria that have little or
nothing to do with economic signals.

It is necessary to keep in mind that gender inequalities in PNG are "systemic" in nature
(World Bank 2012a:106, see also WIA 2010:4), which do not lend themselves to easy
solutions and which in any case are beyond the purview of any one sector. As argued
in the WIA report (2010:4), this systemic discrimination "belies women's potential and
significantly hinders agricultural productivity and development opportunities." It is
why an initiative launched by one lead firm in the coffee export business seeks to apply
a "women's empowerment framework" to the task of enabling women to participate


                                                                                                      7

more fully in the sector (see discussion in Chapter 3, and Box 3.2 below). Consequently,
it is essential to act on these issues, alongside those directly related to improving the
functioning of the supply chains, if durable gender-inclusive improvements in
performance are to be obtained.

One of the ways in which PNG has been addressing these deeper systemic gender biases
is through personal viability (PV) training, supported by the PPAP (Box 2.2).

 Box 2.2: Personal Viability Training

 PV aims to change the mindsets of rural people, including smallholder farmers, by addressing the
 human being in a holistic way and by providing skills and knowledge in mental, emotional, physical,
 spiritual, and financial dimensions. Both men and women, who have graduated from this training
 program, for example, from the Polga Club House in the Western Highlands Province, have
 expressed that their lives have been transformed after this training. This change process is not
 manifested in terms of immediate economic gains for families or communities, but has more to do
 with changes in people’s perspectives, beliefs, norms about life and society, and, in particular, the
 treatment of women by men. Strengthening existing networks of this kind at the smallholder level
 has the potential to promote women’s effecti ve participation in economic development and to
 increase women participation in all levels of decision making.

2.5.2 Labor Dynamics

As will be argued throughout this report, labor issues, and especially gender differences
in labor allocation and rewards to labor, and the intersection of social and economic
factors in determining labor use, cut across all the sectors, and have far-reaching
implications for the performance of these agribusiness supply chains. It is therefore
important to place labor dynamics in PNG in a wider context.

Labor mobilization strategies have evolved over time, in response both to changing
social norms and expectations, generational differences, and commercial dynamics
associated with wage or paid labor. A study in PNG has outlined the evolution of labor
mobilization strategies from a cooperative model (wok bung wantaim) to a more
commercially-oriented model (makim mun), with implications for labor availability and
productivity that are far-reaching. While this study was undertaken for the oil palm
sector, it has wider application to labor issues across sectors and regions (Box 2.3).
These shifts suggest that economic signals (incentives) are gaining traction in PNG as
a driver of labor allocation, leaving open the possibility that market-focused
instruments (bank accounts, payment mechanisms, incentives) can play a role in
addressing labor use in these sectors. Moreover, to the extent that it will be essential to
mobilize youth to remain in (or to return to) farming, economic incentives will be
paramount, as will ensuring the economic viability of farming activity altogether.

Box 2.3: Evolving Labor Mobilization Practices

The wok bung wantaim production strategy used in oil palm production emerged from the labour
strategies underpinning subsistence production. Generally, for heavy, labour-intensive subsistence
tasks such as the cutting, clearing, and fencing of new food gardens, the planting and harvesting of
root crops, house building or the preparation of communal feasts, the lineage and often other members
of the broader kinship group contribute labour. These large co-operative work groups in which the
labour of the extended family and kinship group is mobilised to perform intensive agricultural or
community work are commonly used by rural households in PNG. These same indigenous strategies
for mobilising labour for subsistence production have been carried over into cash crop production to
ensure an adequate labour supply for harvesting, which is particularly important during high crop
periods. ...

Labour contributions to subsistence production both structure and are structured by kinship and social
relationships. They can be on a balanced reciprocal basis where a labour contribution is later
reciprocated with a similar gift of labour as often happens amongst agnatic individuals and groups in
patrilineal societies. Some are based on relationships of inequality where there is no obligation to
reciprocate the labour contribution with a similar gift of labour. Relationships based on inequality
often characterise those between wife-giving and wife-taking groups in which the latter can give
labour without the expectation of a later reciprocation of labour. While relationships of inequality
can lead to one party contributing labour without a material return, the other party, if giving labour,
may receive a return in labour, cash, or wealth items that vastly exceeds the market value of the
original labor contribution. ... An important aspect of the co-operative wok bung wantaim strategy is
that the ‘payment’ of labour does not necessarily reflect labour input but instead is governed more by
gender, age, and kinship status, as well as by the perceived financial needs of individual family
members in much the same way as labour is deployed and valued in the non-market subsistence
economy. ...

[C]hanging and contested notions of labour value are undermining cooperative oil palm production
strategies among migrant households on the LSS. Beginning in the early to mid 1990s on the Hoskins
LSS, second generation co-resident married sons increasingly began challenging the wok bung
wantaim cooperative production strategy, which started to give way to a new production strategy
where harvesting and the associated income were rotated on a monthly schedule amongst individual
co-resident households. This new production strategy, known locally as makim mun (literally marked
month), coincides with the milling company’s monthly payments to smallholders. Under the makim
mun production strategy, labour is drawn predominantly from the household whose month it is to
harvest, with occasional recruitment of additional labour from co-resident or off-block households.
There is less inter-household cooperation in harvesting, and typically, work groups are smaller than
those following the cooperative, wok bung wantaim production strategy.

The wok bung wantaim production strategy that had dominated smallholder production came under
pressure on several fronts, not least by the demands and aspirations of a generation of younger men
who began challenging the foundations upon which this production strategy relied: centralised
control over labour and income, and indigenous norms and values, particularly those relating to the
indigenous concepts of labour value. In the contest between generations, between leaseholder and
ordinary block resident, between the individual and the group, between modernity and tradition, and
between market and indigenous economic relations and values, social stresses were heightened and
the makim mun production strategy was born.

Ironically, the transition to a more market based value of labour through adoption of the makim mun
strategy is associated with lower productivity. This is because the capacity to mobilise labour under
this strategy is reduced, particularly if the makim mun strategy  emerged in response to prolonged
conflict between co-resident households. When co-resident households adopt the makim mun strategy
and act more autonomously, typically the family whose month it is to harvest is unable to call on co-
resident households for labour. With less inter-household cooperation, harvesting work groups are
usually smaller and therefore less of the crop is harvested in the three-day harvesting window,
especially during high crop periods. The total income and production for the block is therefore less
than it would be under a wok bung wantaim strategy.

3       The Coffee Supply Chain
Agriculture accounts for approximately one-third of GDP, and the sector is dominated
by smallholder farming systems. Together with oil palm, coffee and cocoa are the main
cash crops, with respectively over 30 percent and 20 percent of the total labor force
involved in their production, processing and sale (World Bank 2010:1). Further
background information on the coffee sector in PNG is in Annex 4.

3.1     Gender Issues in the Coffee Supply Chain

Key gender-relevant data for the coffee sector from the PPAP baseline survey are
summarized in Box 3.1.

3.1.1 Gender Roles and Responsibilities

Coffee production is heavily determined by labour inputs, where women exert a
substantial influence−a simple reflection of the fact that they do more of the work
(Overfield 1998). There would appear to be no reason to believe that the data in Table
3.1, and the differential labor burdens they indicate, have changed in any substantive
manner, notwithstanding that the data are now more than 20 years old. Overfield
indicates that the data show that people on average work only 4.25 hours/day; it is
therefore tempting to conclude that there is no labor constraint, and that people in rural
areas are under-employed.

Overfield warns against this interpretation by pointing out that the division of labor is
unequal: these data indicate that women work more than 3 times as much as men,
especially when household work is included. Even in the area where there is the greatest
parity between men and women in their labor allocation, namely the coffee sector,
women still allocate nearly half as much time again as men do in this sector. Moreover,
it is specifically during the "flush" period from April to August, when coffee is
harvested, that the female labor constraint is most apparent (Overfield 1998:55).

Data from the PPAP baseline survey (UniQuest 2013), though not sex-disaggregated,
show the importance of harvesting and post-harvest processing in the overall labor
allocation for coffee (Table 3.3). These are tasks predominantly carried out by women.

extent as men, and as having a substantial role in land clearing. These perceptions also
bear out the disproportionate burden of domestic work that falls on women.

3.1.2 Gender-Based Constraints and Implications for the Supply Chain

Labor. Labor shortages are a major issue for the coffee sector, but the problem of labor
cuts across all sectors. As reported by Murray-Prior and Padarath (2013), in a study in
the Lufa District in the Eastern Highlands Province where coffee production is high,
women interviewed found it difficult to do all the labour necessary to tend food crops
and coffee (West 2012). In this area women often discussed their unequal burden in
terms of horticultural labour and the need to weigh the time and returns they get from
garden work against the time and returns they get from coffee garden work. They talked
about labour-saving techniques like multigenerational and multi-lineage weeding
parties, where women from several lineages weed each other’s coffee gardens in
rotation so that the work can be done more quickly and efficiently (Murray-Prior and
Padarath 2013:9). Though their analysis is not sex-disaggregated, Batt et al. (2009:35)
point out that at the farm level lack of labor affects the ability to harvest cherry at the
correct time.

Specifically in relation to coffee, already in the early 1990s Overfield (1998) grappled
with the issue of the ways in which lower returns to women from their labor in coffee,
coupled with their larger overall work burdens, might affect the economic welfare of
coffee-growing households. Overfield's principal insight is that explanations for what
he characterizes as the "underdevelopment" of the highlands in PNG have not
considered the "influence of intra-household factors and specifically gender" (Overfield
1998:56). Women's lack of bargaining power, the lower returns to their labor, and the
overall high labor burdens women face, all contribute to the inability of the PNG
highlands to maximize their development potential.

It is perhaps with respect to choices about labor allocation that the issue of not regarding
the cash crop as a "business" has the most traction. This is well captured in the
distinction between "foraging" and "farming" that is made in one of the seminal works
of the literature on cocoa (see Curry et al. 2007 and the discussion in Section 4.1.1
below). The essence of the distinction is that tree crop plantings are not regarded as
sources of income to be managed systematically (i.e., these holdings are farmed) but
are instead occasional, if unreliable, sources of cash when needed (i.e., holdings are
foraged). As Murray-Prior and Padarath point out (2013:10), socio-cultural factors
influence farming decisions as much as economic ones, but there is little understanding
of these factors.

Resources and Knowledge. There are important gender differences in access to
resources and knowledge to carry out coffee operations (Table 3.5). In the areas
surveyed by the IFC baseline study, education and literacy levels were found to be very
low, with 25% of men and 75% of women not being able to read and write in Tok Pisin.
(Murray-Prior 2014:iv). Murray-Prior and Padarath (2013) point out that rural women
in PNG are constrained by unequal access to productive resources and services,
including coffee extension services. While extension can help in improving
productivity and overall wellbeing, rural women tend to make less use of, or have less
access to, extension services. Women are allocated fewer resources and attention than
men, and extension and training in rural livelihoods has focused on the needs of men,

training cover a broad spectrum:
training is offered in areas such as: Business Acumen/Financial Management, Business
Registration, HIVAIDS, Healthy Community Living, Rural Housing, Eco-tourism,
Gender Equality in Development, Livelihood Strategies, Climate Change, Resource
Boom and 'Dutch Disease,' Law and Order, Spiritual or Faith-based Training,
Awareness on Drugs and Alcohol, and Human Development. This kind of training is
often undertaken in conjunction with Personal Viability (PV) training (see Box 2.2
above).

Land. Land access differs for men and women, and this in turn is linked with their
capacity to make decisions. Murray-Prior and Padarath indicate that land tenure in the
Highlands, and many other areas in PNG, is predominantly patrilineal, and a woman
accesses land by activating use rights to her husband's land. Coffee is therefore seen as
belonging to men and women are considered to hold only secondary use rights
(Overfield 1998). SPC (2012:9), citing the PNG’s 2009 CEDAW Report, states that
women are often excluded from owning registered land, and they cannot enforce rights
to land and property nor claim income from cash crops or land leases such as for mining,
logging, and infrastructure construction.

Decision-Making. It is often men who are the major decision-makers and who control
the marketing of ‘formal sector’ crops such as coffee, cocoa, and oil palm (Cahn and
Liu 2008). This is substantiated by the PPAP Baseline, which found that men are
considered to be the primary decision-makers for coffee production and management
(95%) (UniQuest 2013). Furthermore, in PNG’s male-dominated society, there is a
deep-rooted social belief that women are subordinate to men (father, husband or
brother) and are expected to obey men (Cahn and Liu 2008). Differences in decision-
making mean that, even when women are able to participate in extension training, they
are often unable to apply their learning to coffee gardens, as decisions over inputs are
largely made by men (Murray-Prior and Padarath 2013:10). The IFC Coffee baseline
finds that women appear to have an important role in decision-making about coffee and
household management, with many decisions made jointly, although their spouses do
not always acknowledge this (Murray-Prior 2014:25). The IFC baseline distinguishes
between "primary" and "equal primary" decision-makers in the coffee sector, finding
that around half of women perceive themselves as equal primary decision-makers with
their spouses. However, this finding is difficult to interpret, as it is not clear exactly
what this distinction captures, and more research is needed on the dynamics of intra-
household decision-making.

                          The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


Income. Income streams from coffee largely belong to men. Notwithstanding the fact
that women do more of the work in coffee cultivation than men, income from cash
crops, including coffee, is generally considered as belonging to the man of the
household. He in turn may have considerations other than those of his wife and other
family members when it comes to deciding on how income is spent, and this is a source
of intra-household conflict (Murray-Prior and Padarath 2013:11). Evidence indicates
that cash incomes are not distributed evenly in households; on average, women receive
approximately one-third the income of their male counterparts (Overfield 1998:58).
Overfield noted that this became more extreme as coffee prices increased, suggesting
that men held onto most of the price increases with only small benefits being passed on
to women. The finding from the PPAP baseline survey, namely that 85% of accounts
are primarily operated exclusively by men (2% by women) and that selling of coffee is
largely done by men (90%), demonstrates men’s control over income from coffee
(UniQuest 2013:30). Several interlocutors in Mount Hagen, associated with a PPAP-
funded project, affirmed in a recent interview (on February 13, 2014) that men have
greater control over income from coffee because it (coffee) is a man’s crop. Another
group in Goroka, representatives of PNG Women in Coffee, also shared the same
sentiments, saying that men have greater control over income from coffee, and the main
reason is that, up in the Highlands region, coffee is very much accepted as a man’s crop.
However, it is also important to bear in mind that behavior in this respect can differ
substantially from one household to another, and that it is not appropriate to generalize
behavior patterns across communities or the country as a whole.

Incentives. Because of these limited benefits, the incentives to be involved in coffee
production differ for men and women. This is so in large part because the rewards to
labor differ: there is a persistent disconnect between the work done by women and the
benefit they obtain. This has been well documented in the coffee sector by Overfield
(1998).

       The relative incentives for women to be involved in coffee production are not as great as for
       men. It is also apparent that they have much greater control (and responsibility) for food
       production than they do for coffee. ... [I]n coffee with respect to planting, harvesting and selling
       it was the male head of household having control with women having very little influence.
       However, when it came to the planting and sale of food, women exerted far greater influence.
       This provides women with both the incentive and opportunity to move into an alternative source
       of income. (Overfield, 1998:58).

The background paper on gender issues in coffee and cocoa production prepared for
the PPAP (see World Bank n.d.(3)) reiterates that conflicting incentives among men
and women are a major factor in low coffee productivity in PNG, and makes the
important point, confirming Overfield's observation above, that, "although average
returns to labor were found to be higher for coffee than in food production, women
persevered with the heavy and less rewarding work of planting, harvesting, and carrying
food crops because the incentives were better. They exercised more personal control
over production, could intentionally produce a surplus over subsistence requirements
for sale, and were able to control and spend most of cash earned from selling food
crops" (World Bank n.d.(3):2).

It is widely acknowledged that men face many of the same issues confronting women
in the agricultural sectors, including poorly developed infrastructure, access to markets,
pressure on land from population increases, and new pest and disease threats (WIA


                                                                                                       17
                          The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


2010:4). However, the report emphasizes that women's lack of access to land, assets,
and extension services, their lack of financial autonomy, the absence of collective
action and entrepreneurial opportunities, create "significant additional barriers, which
are legal, cultural and situational," this latter pointing to the fact that women are more
likely to be victims of law and order issues. The report concludes that the "systemic
and consistent discrimination experienced by women belies their potential and
significantly hinders agricultural productivity and development opportunities" (WIA
2010:4).

3.2       Certification

It is estimated that around 5 percent of PNG coffee exports are "specialty" coffees,
including organic, Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, and Utz (Murray-Prior and Padarath
2013:7). Sustainable certification labels now come in many forms, but there are four
main agencies (ITC 2011:53):

         Fair Trade; www.fairtrade.net
         Rainforest Alliance; www.rainforest-alliance.org
         Utz Certified; www.utzcertified.org
         The Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C Association) www.4c-
          coffeeassociation.org
         "Organic" Certification: for PNG see:

In addition, there is a broader category of certification that determines whether a crop
is produced in a way that can be considered "organic." In PNG, more than 2,600 coffee
growers       are     registered    with     Coffee       Connections      Ltd.,    (see:
http://www.coffeeconnections.biz/organic_certification.htm), and certification is
obtained through the National Association of Sustainable Agriculture, Australia
(NASAA), which is recognized worldwide through the International Federation of
Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM). These various initiatives are rapidly
gaining market share and by 2010 it was estimated that they represented around 5% of
the total world trade in coffee (ITC 2011:53). Batt et al. (2009:119-131) provide a
useful summary of the principal certification schemes operating in PNG.

Certification is essentially concerned with sustainability. How sustainability is defined,
and what elements thereof are prioritized, determine the focus of certification schemes.
Certification schemes pursue a range of goals. Briefly, Fair Trade aims to enable
organizations of smallholder producers to improve their conditions of trade, i.e., to
obtain more equitable and more stable prices. The Rainforest Alliance certification
scheme focuses on environmental sustainability, and incorporates the social and
environmental principles of the Sustainable Agricultural Network, including one
requiring fair treatment and good conditions for workers. The UTZ sustainability
program is centered on the UTZ CERTIFIED Code of Conduct, which is based on
international production standards and contains a set of strict product specific criteria
for socially and environmentally appropriate coffee growing practices and
economically efficient farm management. The Common Code for the Coffee
Community (4C Association) is an inclusive, membership driven organization of coffee
farmers, trade and industry, and civil society. Members work jointly towards improving
economic, social and environmental conditions in the coffee chain through the
promotion of more sustainable and transparent practices for all who make a living in

                           The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


the coffee sector. According to IFOAM, organic certification is based on four principles,
namely, health, ecology, fairness, and care, and one of its key provisions relates to
social justice, including equal opportunity, fair treatment of workers, and non-
discrimination (IFOAM 2012). This brief outline shows that, for the most part, gender
issues are not especially prominent, and rarely explicit, in certification schemes, though
opportunities exist to promote certification schemes that are more gender-inclusive.

The PPAP baseline survey indicates that 13% of households claim to have any
knowledge of certification (2% "strong" knowledge). This is highly concentrated in
provinces where exporters work. Around 8% reported having certification for their
coffee, and, of these, 1/2 expressed little or no interest in continuing. Half of the
households surveyed were not interested in paying for certification, a finding which
suggests, according to the baseline survey, that the benefits of certification are not
sufficient to justify paying for it (UniQuest 2013:51-53).

        the coffee industry (Murray-Prior and Padarath 2013:12).

In the coffee subsector, some initiatives are currently underway to address the twin
problems of supporting a greater "business" focus by smallholder farmers and,
concurrently, strengthening women's ability to contribute to, and benefit from,
engagement in the sector. Cooperatives are currently being formed and used to mobilize
farmers to grow and sell coffee. At present, there are two coffee cooperatives working
in the Eastern Highlands and Morobe Provinces. The cooperatives are unique in how
they are set up, in that income generated through the cooperative is directed toward
meeting the ‘tangible or physical and real time’ needs of cooperative members,
including school fees, building permanent houses, or buying solar units. However, these
efforts remain at a micro or community level and are still in the early stages of
development.

Cooperative societies or commodity-specific cooperatives are not new to PNG, though,
historically, there have been many failures, and caution is needed in promoting
cooperative arrangements. The success of a cooperative society depends on many
factors including good leadership. Cooperatives can support a greater business
orientation by smallholders, and facilitate greater participation by women in the sector,
through the following key actions:

      work through cooperatives or established groups (at the village/tribe level);
      target the family unit but involve the whole community;
      undertake marketing of coffee and cocoa through the cooperative in a way that
       removes decision-making as to income earned and how it is distributed out of
       the (male-controlled) household while increasing transparency and
       accountability for all household members;
      establish and manage a savings and loan society/mechanism for cooperative
       members, with particular focus on ensuring that women have their own bank
       accounts, payment cards, and other mechanisms for capturing more of the
       income from the labor they provide;
      show smallholder farmers a clear ‘road map’ of where they are now and where
       they can be in 2, or 5, or 7 years if they continue to save their money;
      identify the ‘individual’ needs (school fees, a permanent house, tractor) of
       cooperative members and plan together with them how these needs can be
       met;
      identify training needs of cooperative members and facilitate training, for both
       men and women;
      offer incentives and reward good performance.

4         The Cocoa Supply Chain
Cocoa is one of the major agricultural export crops for PNG with an estimated 1.0
million people involved in the industry (Cocoa Board 2013). Further background
information on the cocoa sector in PNG is in Annex 4. A summary of the key steps,
tasks, and indicative gender division of labor in the cocoa supply chain is presented in
Table 4.2 below. The table also synthesizes key systemic issues affecting the
performance of the chain, along with the main gender issues and opportunities
identified in this report. The following paragraphs discuss these points in more detail.
Key gender-relevant data for the coffee sector from the PPAP baseline survey are
summarized in Box 4.1.

    Box 4.1: Key Gender-Relevant Data from the PPAP Baseline Survey : Cocoa Areas

       Household (HH) headship: Male (M) =94%; Female (F) =6%.
       Participation in cooperatives: M=27%; F=14%.
       Variability in ease of access to water: 15% of all households had to walk more than 20 minutes to water
        source; 63% had access in the household or within 5 minutes walk.
       High variability in men's and women's participation in training: HH member participation in cocoa
        processing training; ENB M=20%; F=3%; ARB M=8%; F=0%.
       Schooling (no grade completed): M=19%; F=19%.
       Bank Accounts: M=62%; F=10%; Joint = 28%.
       Men primary sellers of cocoa for 78% of households. Income receivers: M=68%; F=32%.
       Information/Training (Production): M=80%; F=20%. Prices M=67%; F=33%.
       Most important coffee price information source: M=Other farmers; F=Buyers.
       Production: Households with operating fermentaries: 20%.
       Households reporting cocoa affected by CPB: ENB=99%; ARB=50%.
       Decision-making: Primary decision-maker: M=86%; F=14%.

transporting the dry bean to the nearest town for sale, and women's involvement in
processing is minimal (Curry et al. 2007:51). The labor and time requirements for
cocoa harvesting and processing differ in significant ways, as are the earnings that can
be obtained (Table 4.1).

the advent of the cocoa pod
borer (CPB) in the cocoa-growing areas of PNG. Indeed, while there are references to
pests and diseases, and to the importance of sound block management practices to
combat them, there is little to suggest how important these issues were to become, as
the full implications of the impact of CPB, which has led to an 80% decline in yields
since 2008, become apparent.

4.1.2 Gender-Based Constraints and Implications for the Supply Chain

Labor. Even before the advent of CPB, labor shortages were identified as a problem
for cocoa growers in ENB province (Curry et al. 2007:26). Farmers relied extensively
on unpaid family labor for cocoa production. Shortages arise for various reasons,

including, according to one source cited by Curry et al., lack of cooperation among
family members, illness and death disrupting work schedules, reduced access to
extended family labor, increase in the size of holdings leading to insufficient labor for
the area planted, and the rising cost of hired labor (Curry et al. 2007:26). Labor
shortages were identified in the Curry et al. study as one of four main constraints to
cocoa production:

     theft of cocoa pods (in some cases, an indication of under-harvesting) (27%);
     poor block condition (overgrown cocoa trees, over-shading and high levels of
      pests and diseases) (26%);
     labor shortages (19%);
     limited knowledge of proper block management practices (especially
        regarding the new hybrid cocoa clones) (9%).

Curry and Koczberski argue that labor shortages do not necessarily reflect a lack of
available labor, but rather a low level of cooperation of family members in production,
and a reluctance of farmers to use hired labor. They suggest that labor constraints may
be temporary (e.g., illness or the diversion of labor to other activities), or they may be
more enduring because of household demographic factors, such as an elderly household
head without co-resident sons. Sometimes family members are discouraged from
providing labor when they feel they are not being adequately remunerated for their
labor. They specifically suggest that women often divert their labor away from export
crop production when they, or their family as a whole, are not benefiting from the
income earned (Curry and Koczberski 2009a, in Agrifood Consulting International
2009:43).

CPB exacerbates the labor constraint by requiring an even more labor-intensive
approach to cocoa block management/cultivation, while simultaneously reducing the
output from these blocks. Curry et al. (2009) specifically articulate the view that "the
survival of the cocoa industry in ENBP depends on smallholder farmers moving to a
higher labor-input system of production" (Curry et al. 2009:xi). Discussions held with
the representatives from CCI and the PNG Women in Agriculture Association (on the
28th January 2014 at Kerevat) indicate that it takes 2-3 times as much labor to manage
cocoa blocks since the advent of CPB. However, as pointed out at the Stakeholder
Workshop (Annex 6), this is a temporary situation, and, once CPB has been controlled,
labor allocation to cocoa cultivation can return to more normal levels.

Curry et al. point out that understanding why some households are unwilling or unable
to overcome labor shortages and how labor availability influences a household’s cocoa
harvesting strategy (wet bean or dry bean) requires further attention in cocoa research
(Curry et al., 2007:65). Of course, as they also point out, labor issues are not the only
determinants of cocoa production strategies, since the age and condition of the cocoa
blocks also play an important part in determining whether dry or wet bean production
strategies are adopted. Specifically, they argue:

       Although other variables, such as labor supply, price and access to a fermentary are important
       for explaining smallholder harvesting strategies, the quantity of accessible healthy ripe pods is
       critically important and must be above some minimum threshold quantity for smallholders to
       invest time and labor in their cocoa blocks. If the quantity of ripe pods falls below this threshold
       level, smallholders will switch to strategies of lower labor inputs and will not invest labor in
       grass slashing. On the other hand, when the quantity of healthy ripe crop is above this threshold



                                                                                                       27

       level (e.g., during flush periods or on high-yielding younger blocks), growers are motivated to
       spend more time on their blocks, both grass slashing and harvesting for dry bean production.
       Indeed, farmers with both young and old cocoa blocks invest more harvesting and maintenance
       labor in their higher producing younger blocks where access is easier and where pest and disease
       levels are lower (Curry et al., 2007:68).

In essence, to borrow these terms from Curry et al., the impact of CPB has been to bring
the quantity of healthy ripe pods below this minimum threshold, with major
implications for labor allocation and returns to investment in the cocoa sector. This is
why it is argued that, if the industry is to survive, smallholders must adopt a much more
(labor) intensive production strategy. It is also why that is so difficult to achieve.
Consequently, this analysis takes the view that labor availability is the binding
constraint, as, with adequate labor, more work could be put into block maintenance and,
as needed, replanting old cocoa stock.

The non-adoption of good cocoa farming practices leads to a mutually reinforcing set
of negative outcomes: low productivity, low quality, greater vulnerability to pests and
disease, little investment in replanting or rehabilitating existing gardens, low income-
earning and labor absorption, a missed opportunity to reduce poverty, and inefficient
use of land and waste of resources (Agrifood Consulting International 2009:63-65).
However, it is the gender-specific dynamic of labor allocation and the disconnect with
benefits obtained that is, perhaps, the most important single driver of labor constraint
in the cocoa production and processing cycles. In a "farming" approach to cocoa
cultivation, substantial labor (male and female) is mobilized, whereas under a
"foraging" approach, minimum labor is deployed (mostly female, as males have "lost
interest" in the cocoa blocks), with attendant implications for yields and returns.

Resources and Knowledge. As mentioned above, Curry et al. (2007) identified limited
knowledge of proper block management practices (especially regarding the new hybrid
cocoa clones) as one of the four major constraints to cocoa production, though it was
the one mentioned least, by 9% of farmers. A case study of the Integrated Agriculture
Training Program (IATP) in East New Britain examined the Program’s attempts to
ensure the integration of the interests of rural women. It found that in spite of success
in implementing training appropriate for women, meeting their needs and having
positive impact on women’s livelihoods, the Program’s success in responding to gender
concerns was limited by constraints that were themselves due to gender inequality.
These included low participation of women in the courses, the lower educational levels
of women, and difficulties women have in implementing changes to their livelihoods
after training. Another factor was cultural limitations that make contact between
unrelated men and women unacceptable in many areas. Extension and training for
women is thus made even more difficult if the trainers and extension staff are men.
Furthermore, only a limited number of women have the education and qualifications to
enable them to become trainers and/or agricultural extension staff (Cahn and Liu 2008).

Training venues present another potential barrier for women’s participation, as travel
to training courses can be difficult for women in the context of remote villages, limited
transport, and fears about safety, as well as the heavy workloads associated with
women’s roles. This is exacerbated if the courses are held all day over several days
and/or husbands disapprove of their participation (Cahn and Liu 2008).

Land. Gender roles in PNG agriculture might best be understood in relation to authority
over land and fixed assets in systems of traditional tenure, in which rights of control
generally reside with men, regardless of whether the social system of descent and
inheritance is matrilineal or patrilineal (World Bank n.d.(3):1-2).

       Gardens planted with annual food crops do not secure long-term usufructuary rights over land,
       as do small plantations of perennial crops such as cocoa, coffee and coconuts. Food gardens are
       generally transient, whereas plantations of perennials are semi-permanent markers of property
       rights and confer status on the men who control them. The primary objective in planting
       perennial tree crops such as cocoa, coffee and coconuts may be to establish long-term rights to
       land in traditional tenure systems, rather than to establish an agricultural business. It is common
       for smallholdings to receive minimum maintenance and for harvesting to occur when cash is
       needed, rather than to be operated on a business-like basis (World Bank n.d.(3):1-2).

Income. Income from cocoa and coffee is usually considered to belong to the man who
controls the smallholding (World Bank n.d.(3):2). Disputes over allocation of income
are a major source of conflict in PNG households. Incomes from cocoa have diminished
dramatically since the advent of CPB, and livelihoods in the cocoa-growing areas are
threatened. With men's primary income source largely removed, shifts are occurring in
household strategies and labor allocation. One perhaps unintended benefit of CPB is
reduced expenditure on beer, with women reporting less crime associated with
drunkenness, such as domestic violence (Curry et al. 2009:52).

Incentives. Gender differences in incentives to contribute labor to cocoa cultivation,
as noted in several studies, also play a part. They suggest not only that it is important,
in the cocoa sector, as elsewhere, to mobilize female labor, but that, to succeed with
such mobilization, it will be essential to address these incentive differences and to
ensure that the benefit women obtain from their labor is commensurate with the work
they do. The gender analysis conducted for the PPAP Project Implementation Manual
(PIM) notes that, while smallholders recognize that labor shortages are a significant
constraint to improving cultivation and processing practices, it was unlikely that women
would increase their allocation of time to cocoa management and production because
the incentives were less attractive than other means of earning income (World Bank
n.d.(3):2). Differences in incentives are not only relevant for women's labor allocation
and choices. These studies point out that younger males (sons of household heads) also
resist allocating their labor to cocoa cultivation if they feel that they are not being
sufficiently compensated for the work undertaken. This view was affirmed by the
members of the PNG Women in Agriculture Association (who are mostly mothers),
during the field consultations held in late January 2014 in Kerevat, who stated that the
youth (young men) were not particularly interested in cocoa, so the Association was
looking at various options, such as fish farming, to integrate the young men into the
economic life of their communities.

Moreover, improvement of cocoa cultivation practices, for example by doing away with
the stage 3 (foraging) period, would have the perhaps unintended effect of removing a
modest income-earning opportunity for women. Through foraging in stage 3 blocks,
women have the opportunity to generate a small amount of cash (kwik moni), because
men no longer have any interest in the stage 3 block, and have directed their energy
elsewhere. While it is true that benefits of this kind are necessarily short-lived and
would gradually disappear altogether, the loss of this income source does mean that
women may need even more of an incentive than is perhaps currently the case to


                                                                                                      29
                        The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable Agribusiness in PNG


provide their labor to the task of engaging fully in the much more labor-intensive stage
1 and 2 cocoa cultivation that is needed if CBP is to be tackled effectively.

4.2    Certification

Certification has been less of a concern in the cocoa sector than for coffee (see
discussion of certification in Chapter 3). According to the Cocoa Board, certification is
now becoming a much more important subject in the cocoa trade as well. It is widely
believed that by 2020 all cocoa bean products will be marketable only if they are
certified under any of the certification labels currently known, such as Fair Trade,
Rainforest Alliance, and UTZ Certified (Cocoa Board 2013). This provides an
important opening not only to promote certification among cocoa growers and
throughout the supply chain, but also, and importantly, to do so in a way that is gender-
inclusive, i.e., that certification schemes, where they are focused on "social" co-benefits,
emphasize benefits accruing to women from cocoa cultivation and marketing.

4.3    Concluding Observations

The cocoa sector has been devastated by CPB, leading to an 80% drop in yields. This
has radically changed the labor dynamics operating in the sector. To combat CPB
effectively requires 2-3 times as much labor for block cultivation and management than
was the case before. However, as pointed out at the Stakeholder Workshop (see Annex
6), this situation is temporary, and once CPB is under control, labor allocation can
return to pre-CPB levels. At the same time, CPB means that there are fewer healthy
beans to harvest, and, consequently, less revenue. Consequently, there is little
investment in renewing cocoa plantations, and many blocks are in stage 3 production.
This in turn leads to adoption of a "foraging" rather than "farming" approach to cocoa
cultivation, and the residual work on these blocks is largely undertaken by women, for
whom this is a source, albeit gradually declining, of modest income.

One of the ways to mobilize sufficient labor for cocoa cultivation will be to enable
women to obtain more of the benefit from stage 1 and 2 cocoa cultivation, and to have
the incentive to allocate more labor to these tasks. It is equally important in the PNG
context to mobilize youth to remain in (or return to) agriculture, and to address the
incentives required for youth to re-engage in cocoa production. As indicated elsewhere,
a mechanism to support farmers in adopting a more business-focused approach to cocoa
cultivation, and to enable women to contribute more to, and benefit more from, the
sector, is through the use of cooperative associations. The Cocoa Board of PNG is
encouraging farmers to form cooperatives through which they can process and market
their cocoa.

5      The Fresh Produce Supply Chain
Despite lack of recent data, it is widely accepted that the fresh produce (horticulture)
industry has great potential to contribute to the country’s development. This is reflected
in several of the key strategic documents of the GoPNG, such as the PNGSDP 2010-
2030. A more detailed treatment of the structure and characteristics of PNG's fresh
produce sector is in Annex 5.

A summary of the key steps, tasks, and indicative gender division of labor in the fresh
produce supply chain is presented in Table 5.1 below. The table also synthesizes key
systemic issues affecting the performance of the chain, along with the main gender
issues and opportunities identified in this report. The following paragraphs discuss
these points in more detail.

5.1    Gender Issues in the Fresh Produce Supply Chain

5.1.1 Gender Roles and Responsibilities

In PNG, it is well established that women are the primary producers of food crops
(Pamphilon et al. 2013:103; Spriggs et al, 2004:1). The role of women as primary
producers of food crops was offered as a justification for a recent baseline study
undertaken to improve the business knowledge and practices of women smallholder
farmers in two communities in the Western Highlands and the East New Britain
Provinces. The justification offered for this study also succinctly summarizes the role
that women play along the supply chain of fresh produce, i.e., that women are the
primary producers and sellers of food crops, as well as taking an increasing role in cash
cropping, which pays for education, health and family obligations (Pamphilon et al.
2013:103).

Consultations were held with a wide range of people and organizations associated with
the fresh produce industry in an effort to understand the constraints that women
encounter and to identify opportunities that might be available to women. These
consultations revealed that women face great difficulties along the fresh produce supply
chain. They confirm many of the findings of other studies (notably Bonney et al. 2012;
Martin & Jagadish 2006): (i) many different markets exist with varying needs; (ii)
complex relationships exist among players; (iii) individuals and organizations adopt
widely varying strategies to respond to the needs of the market; (iv) there is massive
product waste, due to lack of proper post-harvest management practices, poor
communication among players, and lack of consistent supply of quality agricultural
inputs. Beyond these, poor or non-existent infrastructure (notably storage, cold chains,
and transport), and persistent insecurity have particularly detrimental effects on the
fresh produce sector. All of these affect value creation along the fresh produce supply
chain.

Along the supply chain, women undertake most of the tasks associated with the
cultivation of fresh produce. Traditionally, the role of women is perceived as providing
food for the family’s sustenance. Hence, the tasks involved in producing fresh produce
come naturally as a woman’s role. However, as smallholders venture more into farming
crops for cash incomes, men play a pivotal role in both the production and marketing
of fresh produce. Two tomato farmers from the

transportation, cool storage, and freighting to

women. However, men are usually tasked with
the responsibility of providing transportation/handling and security for women, while
women carry the cash and do the actual purchasing of produce. At present, there are
two active female aggregators at the Mount Hagen market (see sidebar). These women
aggregate fresh produce on a daily basis and ship it out to their clients in distant markets
in Lae and Port Moresby.

Sweet potato cultivation provides a useful example of gender roles in this sector.
According to ACIAR research, overall, 55% and 28% of male household members are
engaged in sweet potato production and marketing, respectively. By contrast, 68% and
62% of female household members are engaged in sweet potato production and
marketing, respectively. The analysis shows that women play a greater role in decision-
making in this sector (Box 5.1). These figures are consistent across groups, and
highlight the importance and role of women in the sweet potato supply chain in the
PNG highlands, and the need to focus research and training activities for post-harvest
and marketing on women (Chang, Irving, and Villano 2013:52). Interestingly, the
analysis of the choice of sweet potato varieties that are grown shows that most farmers
do not grow sweet potato specifically for the market, instead they sell what they are
growing—an indication of production/supply orientation, as opposed to


                                                                                           36
customer/market orientation (Chang, Irving, and Villano 2013:53). This further
corroborates the argument that women's understanding of what it takes to obtain
maximum quality of the product concerned, and their ability to act on that
understanding, goes a long way to determining the ultimate quality of the product.

5.1.2 Gender-Based Constraints and Implications for the Supply Chain

In participatory research by ACIAR, the following physical constraints to women’s full
participation in the fresh produce industry, especially marketing, were identified:

       Poor conditions of the city market in Goroka: variable gate fees, roaming pigs,
        no adequate toilet facilities or shelter, let alone safe child-care facilities, were
        identified as problems women faced in selling fresh produce.
       Inadequate and unsafe transportation: this constraint affected participation in
        local and formal markets. Women often had to walk several kilometres to the
        main road to catch a bus into town. Buses were overcrowded and overheated,
        damaging fragile produce. Transport to larger centres for more formal markets
        posed a physical risk to women of robbery from gangs, assault and, at the
        extreme, sexual assault. As a consequence, formal marketing was left to men.

 Box 5.1: The Roles of Husbands and Wives in Sweet Potato Production and Marketing

 Women played greater roles in many decisions, especially those regarding varietal selection and
 marketing of sweet potato, with overall gender role scores of 4.0 and 3.8, respectively (Table). A
 number close to 4.0 means that the decision is made mainly by the wife. By comparison, numbers
 close to 2.0, such as borrowing/credit and training and extension for Group 3, mean that those
 decisions are made mainly by the husband.

 Table: Gender roles in various activities by survey groupa




 Overall, an average gender role score of 3.6 was obtained, with groups 1, 2 and 4 attaining 4.0, 3.7
 and 3.5, respectively. By contrast, groups 3 and 5 scored 2.8 and 2.9, respectively. This means that,
 for the former groups, household decisions are made mainly by women, while for the latter groups,
 they are made jointly by husband and wife. ... However, the results indicate that a gender-sensitive
 extension and training strategy is needed, as women are major contributors of labor for sweet potato
 production and important decision-makers in agricultural production and marketing. To the extent
 that some activities are gendered, targeting extension advice by gender would be a rational strategy.

                                            there for me?’
Resources and Knowledge. Access
to credit was highlighted as a major
constraint among fresh produce
farmers. Most of the farmers consulted during the mission indicated that the inability
to access credit when needed limited their capacity. In a meeting with FPDA’s contact
farmers in Goroka, the farmers (the majority of whom were women) rated ‘access to
credit’ as their number one priority after being asked to list, in order of preference, the
kind of support they wanted from external partners such as the World Bank. The
members of PNG Women in Agriculture, both at the Lae and Rabaul branches,
expressed similar sentiments, stressing that lack of credit was hindering their ability to
improve their fresh produce businesses along the supply chain. The farmers indicated
that funds were needed to assist them with the transportation of their produce,
mechanizing their farming operations, and in the overall enhancement of the product to
meet customer requirements. However, in conjunction with improving access to credit,
women also need capacity-building support to improve their skills in financial
management, as, for example, some collectors of fresh produce operating within the
Mount Hagen market indicated that they were currently operating on a credit basis, but
they were facing severe financial constrains in their ability to sustain their operations.

Rural women and men face the same constraints in accessing finance. However, rural
women are far more disadvantaged than men because: (1) women do not own land and
fixed assets, resulting in lack of collateral; (2) women are mostly illiterate in many key
aspects of business acumen (business planning, business management, financial
literary, recording keeping, accounting); (3) they have greater difficulties with


                                                                                                 38
communication (many rural women cannot speak in English); and (4) rural women lack
self confidence (shying away) when interacting with outsiders, which hinders their
ability to articulate their business ideas clearly or even to negotiate confidently for win-
win outcomes with financial institutions.

The information needs of farmers and the ability to access to such information varies
between regions and even within segments of a group or region. Some groups, given
their specific focus on a crop, expressed that there were information gaps that needed
filling in order to maximize their operations. Members of Women in Agriculture in
Rabaul, for example, indicated that they required additional information on marketing
of taro. But, in general, the need for information and the subsequent desire to access
such information did not feature highly as a constraint among fresh produce farmers.

The PPAP gender report (World Bank n.d.(3)) indicated that a review of the village
extension worker program for the FPDA found that extension workers visited more
male contact farmers than female farmers, except in the Western Highlands province
(where 55% of visits were to women contact farmers). The difference was not very
great, however, with 59% of visits to male farmers and 41% to female farmers.
Significantly more women than men were found to be additional participants in
extension visits. The interest among women in commercial fresh produce production
undoubtedly reflects the greater incentives it offers them, over and above women's
traditional responsibilities for food production (World Bank n.d.(3):3).

Mobility. Lack of mobility−through being more restricted to the homestead and not
having access to transport services, compounded by persistent insecurity−means that
women are largely excluded from key downstream activities along the supply chain
where cocoa and coffee is sold to exporters (done by men). The same is true for fresh
produce, where marketing of "hardy" crops (cabbage, sweet potato, carrots, English
potato) requires transport to Lae and Port Moresby; transport is provided by men, who
then, the women say, pocket the money. Small-scale fresh produce ("informal sector")
is marketed by women in local markets close to home. Consequently, it can be said that
women are largely confined, in the fresh produce sector, to "short" supply chains.

Land. Approximately 90% of PNG’s land mass is under customary ownership. Whilst
women have rights to access the land, they have limited control over the land. Men
determine most, if not all, decisions pertaining to its use (SPC 2012). In some
communities, land is inherited through the maternal line, but even there, most of the
decisions regarding the use of land is made by the males such as husbands, brothers and
other male relatives of the women (JICA 2010). Women are often excluded from
owning registered land in patrilineal societies (SPC 2012) and, as established in a recent
study undertaken to improve the business knowledge and practices of women food crop
farmers in the WHP and ENBP, in a patrilineal society, male inheritance rights are
taken for granted as part of PNG culture (Pamphilon et al. 2013:104).

In some parts of PNG, a trend is developing where women are accessing land, both at
the family and business levels, and are making decisions on how to maximize the
economic use of the land. In the Tambul area of the Western Highlands Province, for
example, a female farmer has been successfully growing seed potatoes using rented
land. Her seed potato business has been successful in that she has now diversified into

starting to make a breakthrough in this
largely male-dominated arena. In the
Western Highlands, Jiwaka, and East
New Britain provinces, there are very clear examples of female role models, who are
taking the leading in the production and marketing of fresh produce and taking control
of the income generated from it.

Income. Findings from a 2008 survey of commercial fresh food producers in PNG
indicate that, where women are solely or jointly engaged in selling the product, they
may retain more cash in their own hands. (World Bank n.d.(3)). In the Integrated
Agriculture Training Program (IATP), the savings, credit, and book-keeping modules
proved to be popular with women, who reasoned that this would provide them with the
means to control cash income (Cahn and Liu 2008), though the extent to which this is
the case in practice is less clear, suggesting a need for more focused research on
decision-making dynamics in PNG households. In the ACIAR research, women
indicated that they obtained an insufficient share of income: women did not have an
equal share of income from fresh produce, and what they did earn went to support their
families. Women complained that when men sold produce at formal markets, instead
of buying reliable replacement seeds, they tended to gamble profit (Spriggs and
Chambers, 2007:43).

5.2    Other Sectors

While this report focuses on the three principal agribusiness sectors, it is evident from
meetings throughout the country that other agricultural sub-sectors merit some attention,
even if these do not, or do not yet, generate employment or revenues anywhere near
those of the cocoa, coffee, or fresh produce sectors. Addressing these other sectors is a
way of capturing the considerable diversity in agricultural activities in PNG, as the mix
of crops on which communities rely for their livelihoods is itself often highly diverse
and specific to the agronomic and climatic conditions in each locality. This diversity is


                                                                                              40
an important element of risk management, where reliance on one crop for cash can be
problematic, as the case of cocoa in East New Britain (ENB) Province illustrates, in the
aftermath of the CPB infestation.

Two issues are of particular importance in looking at opportunities in other agricultural
sub-sectors. The first concerns labor allocation, in view of the issues of labor shortage
and lack of timely labor inputs into critical tasks alluded to in the coffee and cocoa
sectors. While it may be inappropriate to argue that farmers are "too diversified," a case
can be made that farmers are already trying to do too much with the labor that is
available to them, and that some rationalization or consolidation of labor use, including
perhaps greater use of mechanization, may be necessary going forward, if farmers are
to accomplish all the tasks they set out to accomplish in a manner that is efficient and
timely.

The second issue relates to the question of control over income resulting from
undertaking agricultural activities in these other sectors. While it is clear that, in the
PNG socio-cultural environment, the major tree crops are considered as "men's crops,"
this is much less the case in the fresh produce sectors, where women have more direct
control over income earned from these crops. This suggests that, beyond finding ways
for women to obtain a greater share of tree crop income, commensurate with the labor
they provide, it would also be appropriate in the PNG context to develop agricultural
activities in crops where priors about male control are either absent or much weaker.
These include: apiculture, floriculture, spices and essential oils, coconuts (not just
copra), poultry, pig-farming, peanuts, and generating further value-added along the
supply chain in cocoa, say by producing chocolate in PNG.

Moreover, viewing these sectors as supply chains indicates that there are potential entry
points along the supply chain in processing and marketing, where the potential to add
value, and to capture that added value for the benefit of the farming communities that
produce the crops, is considerable.

5.3    Concluding Observations

Martin and Jagadish (2006:5) point out that value creation in the fresh produce supply
chain takes place both through vertical integration and through relationship
management along the chain (see also Annex 3, Box 1). However, this and other studies
indicate that relationships along the chain are opportunistic, and supply chains in the
fresh produce sectors are fragmented. Poor logistics and infrastructure raise costs and
reduce the efficiency of supply chains in the fresh produce sectors. Women's lack of
mobility, and their greater domestic workloads, mean that women are essentially
confined to "shorter" supply chains in the fresh produce sectors, where production and
markets remain close by.

Poor communications and lack of timely delivery of inputs and supplies also affect the
performance of the fresh produce supply chain. Martin and Jagadish note that in a
number of the fresh produce chains they studied, there was an information breakdown
between input suppliers and smallholders with respect to seed supply. This lack of
alignment among players along the chain, exemplified by the lack of timely and quality
seed supply, diminishes the creation of value-added throughout the chain.

6.1      Key Findings and Conclusions

One could spend vast resources trying to unravel the mysteries of complex PNG smallholder farmers.
Most farmers grow multiple crops, or mixtures of trees and crops, and often on the same parcel of land.
Apart from biophysical complexity, there is the added dimension of PNG farmer goals and aspirations.
It was recognized that these are multifaceted, and often go beyond income-related parameters to
encompass more psychic and cultural benefits (e.g., acceding to clan or family obligations). The sharing
aspect that pervades PNG society is a dimension that can inhibit productivity improvements at the
individual level.

6.1.1 Women are key to quality

Women provide substantial labor in both coffee and cocoa cultivation, and they
predominate in the fresh produce sectors. This alone suggests that, in situations of labor
scarcity and the need, for example, to adopt more labor-intensive cultivation practices
in cocoa to combat CPB in the short term, it is essential not only to mobilize women's
labor but also to ensure that women have both the capacity and the incentive to carry
out the work they do effectively.

More important than the amount of labor women provide, our analysis of the supply
chains indicates that the specific tasks women undertake have a substantial bearing on
the quality of the final product: women are key to improving the quality of coffee,
cocoa, and fresh produce, in PNG. Women are directly engaged at critical stages of
coffee and cocoa production and processing; in coffee: picking (often strip picking)
cherries, pulping, fermenting, and drying; in cocoa: harvesting, breaking the pods,
sorting of beans, transport of wet beans for fermenting, putting wet beans in the
fermentary, and managing the drying. All of these are time-critical tasks: they must be
undertaken promptly in relation to harvesting, and for a specific amount of time. In both
sectors, these tasks substantially determine the quality of the coffee and cocoa delivered
to the exporter. If PNG wants to improve the quality of its coffee and cocoa on world
markets, and obtain corresponding premiums for better quality product, it must
necessarily enable women to fulfill these roles effectively. Doing so will have both
"push" (operational efficiency) and "pull" (market responsiveness) effects on the
performance of the coffee and cocoa supply chains.

In the case of fresh produce, women's role in determining quality is just as significant.
Women dominate production, harvesting, sorting, packaging, transport to local
markets, and, in some instances, the first stages of transport to the roadside or to more
distant markets. When and how these tasks are undertaken has a bearing on the quality
of the fresh produce that reaches the market, and has an impact on the extent of product
loss and waste. The product enhancement process (washing, sorting, grading, trimming,
packing) begins on the farm with the women once the produce is harvested. However,
several factors contribute to product loss and diminished quality. These include: (a)
lack of knowledge and skills in post-harvest management practices among women; (b)
inability on the part of women to access, or to afford, recommended appropriate
packaging materials for various crops; (c) lack of cool storage on the farm site, and of
cool storage facilities at markets, depots, and ports; (d) the use of inappropriate types


                                                                                                    42
of transport (including PMVs) on poor roads; and (e) weak communications and
alignment of key actors along the supply chain, effectively contributing to greater
losses. As a result, the quality of fresh produce starts to diminish right on the farm, and,
as women attempt to move their produce from the farm to the nearest market, the
loss/waste in fresh produce increases. Moreover, larger issues of poor infrastructure
(including lack of cool chain and storage, and the poor condition of roads), compounded
by persistent violence and insecurity along transport routes, are compounding factors
that reduce quality substantially.

It is necessary to keep in mind that many factors determine the quality of the cocoa and
coffee that is exported, and the fresh produce that is sold in both local and more distant
markets. As pointed out at the Stakeholder Workshop, improving road infrastructure,
establishing cold storage facilities for fresh produce, promoting the direct sale of red
ripe cherry (coffee) where feasible, expanding certification, and strengthening
marketing systems and market linkages for farmers are all key drivers of quality. All of
these factors, alongside recognizing and strengthening women's key role, need to be in
place if PNG is to maximize the quality of its agricultural products.

To enable women to contribute to the maximum extent to quality, however, PNG will
need to tackle, in the colorful words of John Spriggs, not just the "tame" problems
(physical and technical) but also, and importantly, the "wicked" problems (human and
social) affecting the performance of these supply chains. Three inter-connected issues
require particular attention.

 Incentives. The economic incentives for women either to allocate sufficient labor to
  these tasks, or, equally importantly, to do them well, are low. There is a substantial
  gap between the work done by women in the coffee and cocoa sectors and the benefit
  they obtain, since women do much (if not most) of the work, but have much less
  access to, or control of, the resulting income. As is frequently pointed out, tree crops
  and their income streams belong to men. Consequently, it is logical, and
  economically rational, that women often prefer to engage in less remunerative food
  and fresh produce cultivation, where they have greater control over the resulting
  income, or that women seek to engage in cultivation activities where the priors
  relating to male control over the resulting income are either weak or absent. Until
  women have the same motivation as men to engage fully in coffee and cocoa
  production, or have more of an opportunity to share in the income, the critical quality-
  enhancing tasks for which women are responsible will not be done adequately, and
  quality will suffer. Similar incentive issues affect the participation of youth in
  farming activities in PNG.

 Knowledge and Information. Women's access to the knowledge and skills required
  to carry out these tasks is extremely limited, as important gaps in education, literacy,
  skills, and participation in extension and training activities persist. Four issues are
  relevant in this respect. First, extension services and training reach a very small
  number of farmers, despite considerable effort by private sector players (coffee and
  cocoa exporters) and others (NGOs, CIC, CCI, NARI) to fill gaps. Second,
  discussions with CIC in Goroka suggest that about 75% of the extension
  effort/messages relate to "social" issues not "agronomy," though more detailed
  analysis of the content of training would be needed to obtain a more accurate picture
  of the precise or most appropriate balance among the various topics covered. Social


                                                                                         43
  dimensions of extension training cover a broad spectrum: training is offered in areas
  such as: Business Acumen/Financial Management, Business Registration,
  HIVAIDS, Healthy Community Living, Rural Housing, Eco-tourism, Gender
  Equality in Development, Livelihood Strategies, Climate Change, Resource Boom
  and 'Dutch Disease,' Law and Order, Spiritual or Faith-based Training, Awareness
  on Drugs and Alcohol, and Human Development. This kind of training is often
  undertaken in conjunction with Personal Viability (PV) training. This approach to
  training undoubtedly reflects the needs of the community, but it may also reflect a
  view that farmers already understand and "know" the agronomic side, so it is
  appropriate to focus on the social/community issues. Third, women are substantially
  less likely to benefit from extension and training than men − cf. 50% men vs. 10-
  15% women receiving training, according to the IFC baseline (Muray-Prior 2014).
  Fourth, it appears likely that neither men nor women (whether farmers or in extension
  agencies) fully appreciate the need for women to receive, and then be able to apply,
  the agronomic extension messages specifically related to the tasks for which they are
  primarily responsible.

 Socio-Cultural Dynamics. There are important gender-specific dynamics at work
  in PNG society that differentially affect men's and women's capacity to exercise
  economic agency. PNG society is largely patriarchal, and the literature suggests that,
  even in matrilineal regions, men are seen as household heads and primary decision-
  makers. As a result, women have less access to, and control of, the resources needed
  to function economically, notably land and capital (financial services). While some
  socio-cultural factors affect both men and women (as discussed below), others have
  a disproportionate effect on women. In particular, gender-based differences in
  domestic responsibilities and in mobility combine to limit women's capacity to
  engage in downstream activities along the supply chains (marketing/sale of
  cocoa/coffee, longer distance marketing of fresh produce). As one study notes, the
  "systemic and consistent discrimination experienced by women belies their potential
  and significantly hinders agricultural productivity and development opportunities"
  (WIA 2010:4).

Giovannucci and Hunt argue that the underlying social and economic constraints facing
the coffee sector, as outlined above, appear unlikely to change in the near future, and
that, consequently, the emphasis needs to be on "better coffee rather than more coffee."
They argue that this focus will have two distinct benefits. First, it will help position
PNG coffee as a quality origin that will likely offer more permanent competitive
benefits than the fleeting economic benefits of more production, particularly when
periodic global market saturations occur. Second, it can give producers greater
remuneration with the same land area and reduce the need for physical expansion
(Giovannucci and Hunt 2009:9).

One of the key drivers of better quality coffee, according to interviews with coffee
exporters, is the way coffee is picked. Since this is a task largely undertaken by women,
the manner in which this task is accomplished can be said to have a direct impact on
the quality of the final product. The practice of strip picking coffee, which is directly
detrimental to quality, causes the additional problem of limiting any later harvest of
ripe cherries, and is driven in no small part by the fact that it is a time- and labor-saving
measure. As pointed out by some stakeholders, however, other factors contribute to
strip picking, including a rising incidence of theft, where red and green cherries are


                                                                                          44
mixed in the bag, and where roadside traders and wet mills continue to buy inferior
quality cherry, with detrimental effects on PNG's reputation as a producer of high
quality coffee. At the same time, inattention to drying also has a negative impact on
quality (Box 6.1). Women have neither the time, nor the incentive, since they do not
receive or control the resulting income, to do a better job, and the end-result is that most
PNG smallholder coffee is of a low grade (Y). Though the focus here is on picking and
drying, it should be borne in mind that
pulping and fermentation also play a Box 6.1: Keys to Coffee Quality: Selective

6.1.2 Broader labor dynamics
affect outcomes

As this report makes clear, labor issues cut across all the sectors, and have far-reaching
implications for the performance of these agribusiness supply chains. Moreover, a
gender perspective requires that non-market labor, and the differential burdens borne
by women through their domestic workloads, be factored into any discussion of labor
availability and use, as mentioned in Section 2.3 of this report. Consequently, it is
appropriate to consider the complex issues of labor as going beyond any one, or even
all three, of the supply chains.

There are divergent views as to how to reconcile labor and income requirements in the
tree crop sectors. Some argue that smallholders should determine how much income
they want from their agricultural activities, say in their cocoa blocks, i.e., how many
trees they will plant, maintain, and harvest, and then allocate labor to meet these
requirements, so that their income goals can be attained. Others argue that labor is the
binding constraint, and that smallholders need to plant, maintain, and harvest only the
number of trees that the available labor can handle. The importance of focusing on
labor activities undertaken by women to improve quality needs to be set against the
broader socio-cultural dynamics of labor use in PNG, which are key to understanding



                                                                                                45
the performance (strengths and limitations) of these agribusiness supply chains. This is
the case for five principal reasons, outlined below.

 Smallholders do not view their activity as a "business." In coffee, where earnings
  are seasonal, farmers see coffee as a "mechanism to facilitate livelihoods," and not
  as an enterprise seeking maximum output and return (in some instances leading
  smallholders to replace coffee trees with fresh produce). In cocoa, farmers tend to
  see their older blocks more as an "ATM" from which to obtain cash as and when
  needed (Curry et al. 2007:107). As discussed in Chapter 4, this is well captured in
  the distinction between "farming" and "foraging" in cocoa. In both cases, a certain
  economic rationality underlies this, as the tree crop alone will not suffice to meet
  family cash needs, so undertaking other cash-earning activities is essential. In fresh
  produce, it is mostly subsistence farmers selling a surplus, and product varieties are
  not necessarily chosen for characteristics relating to their marketability or durability.
  The expectation is that farmers can and will shift their "mindset" toward more of a
  business orientation, though the timeframe for this to occur is unclear. As Murray-
  Prior points out in commenting on this report, given farmers' lack of knowledge about
  the potential returns to different crops and what is required to achieve these returns,
  it is not surprising that there is a lack of business orientation and inappropriate
  allocation of labor resources.

 A lot of labor is allocated for social purposes. Social factors and obligations are at
  least as important as economic ones, if not more so, in determining what gets done.
  Church and community work absorbs a lot of people's time. Consequently,
  relationships along supply chains can be seen to have at least as much to do with clan
  and culture as with product characteristics and market dynamics. At the same time,
  decisions about what to cultivate, and what labor to allocate to it, are made largely
  without reference to market drivers, and linkages with markets are weak. As much
  of the literature points out, socio-cultural factors influence farming decisions as much
  as economic ones, but there is little understanding of these factors. This means both
  that conventional supply chain analysis has important limitations in PNG, if social
  and cultural factors are not addressed, and that technical solutions alone will not
  improve the performance of these supply chains.

 Farmers experience labor shortages. Households do not have enough labor to do
  all the things they need to do, or to do the things at the right time and in the right
  way. In Lae, for example, members of the Necnasi Coffee Cooperative indicated that
  the "average" family cannot manage more than 1 ha of coffee. Community labor
  sharing schemes appear to be giving way to more market-based (cash payment)
  mechanisms of labor allocation, resulting in reduced labor access at critical peak
  times, and, therefore, lower harvests of key crops. Effectively combating CPB
  requires a massively expanded labor-intensive approach to cocoa cultivation ("every
  pod, every tree, every week"), but farmers are often reluctant or unable to commit
  the labor required. Alongside social obligations, food production requirements are
  seen as more important than tree crop cultivation in determining labor allocation
  priorities. Given women's dominant role in food production, this directly affects their
  ability to allocate either sufficient or timely labor to key tree crop production and
  processing stages.




                                                                                        46
 Farming systems are highly diversified. With perhaps few exceptions, smallholder
  farmers are very diversified, producing a range of fresh produce/food crops,
  alongside their cash crops. Diversification makes sense, in that it is a risk
  management strategy, reducing dependence on one crop for cash income. The
  devastation caused by CPB to livelihoods in ENB Province has shown the costs of
  dependence on cocoa. However, it is also possible that some smallholder farmers are
  trying to do too much with the limited labor they have, further contributing to labor
  shortages, especially at peak seasonal times for particular crops.

 Women are mostly confined to, and can only benefit from, short supply chains.
  Lack of mobility−through being more restricted to the homestead and not having
  access to transport services, compounded by persistent insecurity−means that women
  are largely excluded from key downstream activities along the supply chains where
  cocoa and coffee is sold to exporters (done by men). The same is true for fresh
  produce, where marketing of "hardy" crops (cabbage, sweet potato, carrots, English
  potato) requires transport to Lae and Port Moresby, which is done by men. In the
  process, women lose control over the income stream, which remains with men. This,
  alongside heavy workloads and cultural constraints, contributes to women being
  confined to, and largely only being able to benefit from, shorter supply chains in the
  fresh produce sector, where produce is sold in local markets close to the homestead.

6.1.3 Provision of key support services is limited

Several key services are either absent or insufficient. In addition to the limited reach,
and focus, of extension services, alluded to earlier, other key services are often not
available to smallholders. Input supply is weak and inconsistent. New varieties are not
readily available to farmers, and need to be developed to take account of PNG's specific
climate and agricultural requirements. This is especially important in the fresh produce
sectors. The need to have a consistent supply of reliable, quality and affordable
agricultural inputs, in particular, vegetable seeds for the fresh produce sectors, was
highlighted among smallholder farmers in a recent study to assess the feasibility of a
new wholesale fresh produce market in POM (Bonney et al. 2012:20).

There is limited access to financial services. Access to credit, is a major constraint to
smallholder farmers involved in coffee, cocoa and fresh produce, despite the wide range
of products and services offered by many of the microcredit and financial institutions
currently operating in the country. The inability of smallholder farmers to meet the
lending criteria of microcredit and financial institutions, particularly collateral, is
hindering their ability to access credit when needed. There are also important gender-
specific barriers to accessing finance, as women tend not to own the land, fixed assets,
or other resources that are needed to meet collateral requirements. Another gender-
specific barrier to accessing finance is that, over and above general education and
literacy disparities, women often have little financial literacy, and have little knowledge
of many key aspects of business planning, management, record-keeping, or accounting,
and many women also lack self confidence when interacting with outsiders. This in turn
hinders their ability clearly to articulate their business ideas or even to negotiate with
confidence mutually beneficial arrangements with financial institutions.

The IFC baseline study notes that ignoring women's role in coffee would be
counterproductive, and extension and training strategies must focus on involving them


                                                                                        47
more. The study proposes that a target be set requiring that 40% of all participants be
women (Murray-Prior 2014:iv). Recognizing that training needs to be more gender-
inclusive, the study makes recommendations to achieve this, including through changes
in management and training of extension services and in the content and design of
training and extension activities (Box 6.2).


 Box 6.2: Structuring Training and Extension to Include Women

 To overcome the obvious gender bias in training and delivery of extension materials to women in the
 coffee chain, the lead firm needs to develop strategies and subsequently materials for improving
 access of women to training and other opportunities in the coffee chain. Such strategies and materials
 will need to be consistent with the low level of literacy and numeracy of women including the fact
 than many are not fluent in Tok Pisin. This program should:

    Adopt a target for percentages of women at all professional levels of the coffee trade.
    Examine and adopt strategies to deal with issues that will affect the employment and the daily
     work activities of female extension officers, e.g., safety and security.
    If this has not occurred already, all staff, in particular extension staff, should receive gender
     training.
    Adapt training to be more gender inclusive including:
      Implement a policy to target 40% of people trained to be women.
      Conduct training on gender awareness for both genders as part of the coffee training,
          including using the results from this survey.
      Use learning methods that ensure active participation by women in the process.
      Use audio-visual media where possible and demonstrations, games and role play to make
          the information easier to absorb.
      Conduct the training during the times indicated in this survey, but ensure to consult with
          particular locations to confirm that these times are suitable.
      Encourage management and budgeting training to be done as couples.
      Develop women-only training and deliver them at appropriate locations and times.
      Deliver appropriate training in same-sex groups (all women or all men) or for husband-wife
          couples, as well as the normal mixed-sex groups.

6.1.4 Systemic issues persist in PNG and affect outcomes

Insecurity (especially for women) is pervasive and remains a significant issue.
Crime and violence remain at high levels in PNG, especially along transport corridors.
This means, as one interlocutor put it, that women, for the most part, are confined to
very short supply chains, where both production and marketing/sale remain close to
their homestead. Insecurity affects every aspect of the performance of these supply
chains. It affects women's ability to serve in the field as researchers and extension
agents. It has direct implications for extension services, in that key players (CIC, CCI,
FPDA, and private sector operators) indicate that, while they're willing to train women
as extension agents, the pervasive insecurity essentially precludes them from deploying
women to areas or communities unknown to them. This in turn calls into question the
prevailing model of extension services, where people are trained centrally and then
deployed to all parts of the country depending on need. Instead, a security-conscious
approach to extension delivery would focus on ensuring that extension agents
(especially females) would be drawn from within the communities they serve. This
would provide a much greater measure of security for women, where everyone is
known, and where people would look out for each other.


                                                                                                     48
Insecurity directly affects the transport of goods, especially on the Highland highway,
where transporters face losses from crime and violence, or are reluctant to provide the
full range of services that might be needed. Moreover, insecurity is a major concern for
those women selling produce in open urban markets, such as Gordons and Koki in Port
Moresby, and the Mount Hagen market. The presence of police personnel and the
establishment of a police station inside markets, in particular, Gordons market in Port
Moresby, reflects the level of danger that prevails within these markets. This affects the
ability and willingness of women to engage in marketing activities, where the fear of
crime and violence, the lack of banking or other facilities to safeguard the cash used in
market transactions, and the lack of policing and other support services, limit their
capacity and willingness to sell produce in open markets. Improving security at Port
Moresby's principal food markets is the subject of an interesting project supported by
UN Women, and priority needs to be given to projects of this kind to make market
spaces better places for women to work.

Poor infrastructure limits the performance of all supply chains and substantially
raises the cost of doing business in PNG. Key infrastructure issues include: (i)
transport links are poor and costs are high; (ii) the absence of a cold chain and cold
storage facilities is a significant problem for the fresh produce sectors, and leads to high
product losses and waste; (iii) lack of electricity, and frequent power cuts, add to the
operating costs for actors along the supply chains; and (iv) poor communication
infrastructure and high costs are an obstacle limiting information flows throughout the
chains. These infrastructure barriers, coupled with insecurity, lead to delays in
transport of goods to markets and ports, non-use of refrigerated trucks along key
highways, lack of communication between farmers, buyers, and exporters as to volumes
of produce to ship, and timing of ship arrivals and departures, all of which lead to high
levels of delay, uncertainty, and waste of product.

Lack of information, knowledge, communications, and services (including
education and health) more generally, is a further systemic barrier to gender-
equitable agribusiness, as cogently articulated by the participants at the Stakeholder
Workshop (see Annex 6). Specifically, stakeholders pointed out weaknesses in
communications and information services throughout the supply chains, which results
in insufficient knowledge of market dynamics and requirements, poor coordination
with transport and other services, lower productivity, and persistence of subsistence-
focused, as opposed to business-oriented, farming. At the same time, poor education
and health services, and lack of public expenditure prioritization and accountability,
also affect the performance of these supply chains.

6.1.5 There are different views about tackling gender inequality in PNG

Views differ as to how best to address systemic gender inequalities in PNG.
Tackling systemic issues is interpreted by people interviewed during the preparation of
this report as focusing on women's lack of access to and control of economically
productive resources−including land and income−and lack of participation in decision-
making within the family as to how family income is used Interviewees (men and
women) subscribe to two very different approaches to tackling these issues, while
recognizing that different approaches, and combinations of these approaches, would
most likely be needed in different parts of the country.


                                                                                         49
    o Parallel track. In this approach, the focus is to support activities that are
      specifically women-focused, and exclusively involve women, where control of
      resulting income resides with women or is less unequal vis-a-vis men (the fresh
      produce sectors can be seen as an example of this approach, in that these are seen
      as "women's crops" where women earn and control the resulting income).

    o Integrated family unit. In this approach, the focus is on the family as the
      productive unit, and the aim is to sensitize men principally to recognize the vital
      contributions of women and to move toward greater sharing of income and
      decision-making (family budgeting, financial awareness/management, personal
      viability training).

Associations: A promising approach has been developed by women's groups,
associations, and cooperatives, operating in the cocoa and coffee sectors. These groups
are putting mechanisms in place that enable women to capture more of the income
received from these crops for the labor they provide. This is done where cooperatives
collect the crops on behalf of their members, and distribute the income, transparently,
to their members when sale is completed. This essentially takes the decision-making
process outside the exclusive domain of the (male-controlled) household. In the coffee
subsector, some initiatives are currently underway to address the twin problems of
supporting a greater "business" focus by smallholder farmers and, concurrently,
strengthening women's ability to contribute to, and benefit from, engagement in the
sector.

An issue common to all three agribusiness sectors, as this report has pointed out, is the
lack of business orientation by smallholder farmers, while the need for farmers to treat
these activities as a business is perhaps at the core of developing successful supply
chains in these sectors. Indeed, one of the critical challenges facing these sectors in
PNG is to shift smallholders toward a more business-oriented view of their work. Yet,
as the fresh produce sector aptly illustrates, market linkages are weak, so much so that
the feasibility study for a POM wholesale market begins with a question: "Yu Tokim
Mi Long Planim Kai kai Na Maket We"? -- You ask me to plant vegetables, but where
is the market? (Bonney et al. 2012). If farmers are to become more business-focused,
there need to be the business opportunities and market linkages to support the change.

Enabling women to be at least as much a part of these shifts as men is perhaps one of
the critical avenues available to PNG to improve performance and incomes throughout
these chains, and especially in the fresh produce sector, where, as noted, women are
confined to, and can only benefit from, very short supply chains, i.e., such markets as
exist in the immediate vicinity of their production sites. This in turn requires not only
better linkages between farmers in general and the markets they serve, but also, and
especially, better access by women to these markets and to the opportunities they
present. Bringing markets closer to women, or enabling women to have access to more
distant markets, might well be key contributors to shifting farmers (men and women)
to a more business-focused approach to their work. As this report discusses elsewhere,
it will not be possible to improve the "business" orientation of farmers, whether men or
women, if market linkages are weak or non-existent.

6.2    Principal Recommendations

The recommendations below reflect, in part, the deliberations of the Stakeholder
Workshop held in Port Moresby on April 15, 2014, which gave a wide range of
stakeholders in these sectors an opportunity to discuss the findings of this report, to
identify key issues and challenges, and to propose solutions, based on their own
experience and priorities. The principal results of the Stakeholder Workshop, and the
sector-specific recommendations are summarized in Annex 6, and the
recommendations below should be read in conjunction with that summary.

6.2.1 Women are key to quality

Incentives

 Improve the capacity of women to benefit directly from the income earned in the
  cocoa, coffee, and fresh produce sectors, through a series of interconnected measures:
  (i) facilitate the establishment of direct payment systems, where women are
  supported in opening bank accounts, accessing financial services, and obtaining
  electronic payment for their produce directly from the buyer, or, in the case of fresh
  produce, the aggregator; (ii) support the aggregation of production by cooperatives
  or associations and groups in which women are represented, thereby taking decision-
  making outside the household, and promoting greater transparency between men and
  women in the income received and how it is used; and (iii) support training and
  sensitization efforts (including through PV training) aimed at shifting cultural norms
  and mind-sets relating to women's economic contribution.
 Examine the extent to which certification schemes in the coffee and cocoa sectors
  (Rainforest Alliance, 4C, UTZ, Fair Trade, "Organic") include gender equality
  provisions in capturing "social" co-benefits, how these provisions are being
  implemented, and how compliance is monitored. Strengthen the gender focus of these
  certification schemes, notably as they relate to narrowing the gap between work done
  and benefit obtained, and how they support or facilitate greater female participation
  in family decision-making over use of income. As this issue goes beyond PNG and
  these agribusiness supply chains, the WBG, and notably the IFC, could play a
  catalytic role in promoting a global gender equality standard in certification criteria
  and validation processes.
 Use planned data collection and analysis, notably in the coffee and cocoa sectors,
  including farmer profiling, time use surveys, and analysis of economic opportunity
  in these sectors, to strengthen the business case for women's involvement in these
  supply chains. This in turn should help to underpin prioritization of critical
  infrastructure investments (roads, transport, storage, cold chain) aimed at raising
  quality and production in these sectors.
 Undertake research into the gender dynamics of decision-making within PNG
  smallholder households, with a view to understanding how men and women
  contribute to decisions on the uses of income, and what factors determine how
  decisions are made.
 In parallel, support measures to ease women's overall labor burdens in the household
  (see Section 6.2.2 below), and measures to facilitate direct sale by women of produce
  to buyers, and direct payment (non-cash) to women for produce sold.

Knowledge and Information


                                                                                      51
 Support commodity exporters and others in their initiatives to structure the design
  and delivery of extension and training services in ways that maximize women's
  inclusion (see Box 6.2 above). Consider adoption of a specific target (of 30% or 40%)
  of female participation in extension and training programs. Stakeholders suggested
  establishing farmer field schools in cocoa and coffee areas, setting up a coffee college
  for women extension agents, and developing women-friendly curricula, and using
  new technologies (example: "digital green") to communicate knowledge and to
  facilitate women's access to training opportunities.
 Re-focus extension and training messages specifically toward the quality-enhancing
  tasks for which women are responsible. In coffee, this may mean making sure that
  the importance of not strip picking coffee cherries from the trees, and of properly
  drying the coffee beans (to green bean stage), is sufficiently internalized by the
  women who actually have to do this work. In cocoa, this may mean focusing on
  timely processing after harvest, including sorting, pod opening, fermentation, and
  drying. In fresh produce, this may involve focusing on post-harvest practices, product
  enhancement, and transport/storage issues.
 In the cocoa sector, focus on developing women's technical skills and capacities to
  work in nurseries and bud gardens, and develop this as a possible career path for
  women toward training and employment as extension agents in the sector.
  Concurrently, it is important to focus on the economic viability of cocoa nurseries.
 Assess the impact and effectiveness of the "social" components of extension
  messages to provide a baseline and targets against which to measure changes in the
  "socio-cultural" factors that affect agricultural performance and productivity. Key
  areas to explore would be changes in the benefits women obtain for work done (i.e.,
  having a larger share of income from farming activities) and changes in burden-
  sharing (division of labor) for domestic tasks within the household.
 Put in place measures to enable more female extension agents to be deployed in the
  field. This could be undertaken through: (i) improving the overall climate of security
  and safety, by reducing community violence, and violence against women
  specifically; (ii) expanding the numbers of female extension agents and technicians,
  including through support to a scholarship/training scheme to build the pipeline of
  female graduates in the agricultural sciences for careers in both extension and
  research; and (iii) designing extension schemes in ways that enable people (especially
  women) to serve as extension agents in their own communities, where, it is argued,
  they are more likely to be safe from random violence.
 Consider strengthening the use of quality protocols at each step of the three supply
  chains, outlining the critical steps (and who does them) involved in maximizing
  quality. This can build on the work already done by coffee and cocoa exporters, and
  by the FPDA in developing quality standards for selected fresh produce crops.
  Concurrently, it is essential to ensure that these protocols are integrated into
  extension and training packages, to improve farmer knowledge of the drivers of
  quality at all stages of production and processing, and their knowledge of the impact
  of quality differentials on the prices they obtain for their produce.


Socio-Cultural Dynamics

 Assess the impact of personal viability (PV) training, specifically as this relates to
  improving women's income-earning/sharing and participation in decision-making. If


                                                                                       52
  warranted, support continued personal viability (PV), or related forms of training,
  aimed at strengthening women's voice in the household and the community. Related
  to this is the importance of conducting training for the "whole family," as stressed
  during the Stakeholder Workshop (Annex 6), and ensuring that both men and women
  participate jointly in training activities, thereby improving spousal communication
  and partnership.
 Identify, and work with, existing rural-based networks, such the PV network, or other
  farmer cooperatives and associations who, in one way or another, have advocated for
  women's greater participation in the development process, and support ways
  (including through PV training) to facilitate greater burden-sharing between men and
  women of domestic work.
 Support measures aimed at reducing family and sexual violence (FSV) in agricultural
  communities. Specifically, develop and put in place relevant measures (e.g., phone
  banking) that allow women and girls not to have to carry cash. Other measures
  include fostering and maintaining strong partnerships with concerned parties such as
  village councillors, village magistrates, the police and the churches, to work jointly
  to put in place prevention, treatment, social, and justice services aimed at reducing
  FSV incidence and risk in the community.

6.2.2 Tackle the broader gender dynamics of labor allocation

 Gather baseline data on women's and men's involvement in each stage of the
  agricultural cycle, as called for in the PPAP baseline. This should include shared and
  separate tasks, and provide a basis for examining changes over time in the division
  of labor for agricultural and other tasks between males and females.
 Implement a program to analyze the dynamics of labor allocation at the smallholder
  level, and in different regions of the country, including addressing evolving market-
  based and paid vs. community and family mutual support mechanisms of labor
  mobilization.
   Commission time use surveys and research to generate new and updated data on
    the gender division of labor in each of these sectors to inform policy-making and
    program design. Such surveys need to include data collection and analysis of all
    tasks undertaken by men and women, including domestic work, so that a more
    complete picture of the labor uses of men and women can be obtained.
   Identify, and incorporate into program design, crop-, task-, and season-specific
    labor shortages and constraints, disaggregated by sex, in each of these sectors.
   Identify, and incorporate into program design, region- and farming-system specific
    differences in the dynamics of labor allocation.
 Address what a Stakeholder Workshop participant described as "absurd demands on
  women's time" through support to programs aimed at providing key household-level
  infrastructure services (water supply, energy, especially for cooking), and labor-
  saving technologies to women to alleviate women's domestic workloads.



6.2.3 Strengthen key services

 Build and strengthen market analysis and research capacity in key institutions
  (notably NARI and FPDA), with particular focus on the fresh produce sectors.



                                                                                     53
   Establish market research capacity to identify specific market opportunities for
    PNG, notably in the fresh produce sectors.
   Identify, and develop, market opportunities of particular interest for, and benefit
    to, women. In this respect, identify economically productive activities that women
    could engage in, where priors about male control are either absent or much weaker.
    These could include: apiculture, floriculture, spices and essential oils, coconuts
    (not just copra), poultry, pig-farming, peanuts, and generating further value-added
    along the supply chain in cocoa, for example by producing chocolate in PNG
    (Paradise Foods).
 Improve the supply of agricultural inputs (notably seeds, fertilizer, pesticides), in a
  manner that is consistent, and that incorporates the development of new varieties of
  key products. Develop further the recommendation made at the Stakeholder
  Workshop to establish seed production, storage, and distribution facilities in the fresh
  produce sector in key provincial and regional centers. Put in place measures to enable
  NARI and FPDA to work collaboratively with the private sector in both identifying
  and meeting the needs of farmers for seeds and inputs that are appropriate and
  accessible. One option to consider, discussed at the Stakeholder Workshop, was to
  explore agribusiness dealer approaches, which would bring retail outlets for inputs
  closer to farmers.
 Assess the current organizational capacities of Women’s Groups (including PNG
  Women in Agriculture, PNG Women in Coffee, and other NGOs/CBOs, who are
  directly involved in promoting gender-inclusive agricultural development). On the
  basis of the assessment, develop and implement relevant strategies to improve the
  overall capacities of these women’s groups to lead and assist women farmers in
  producing, processing, and marketing of coffee, cocoa, and fresh produce.
 In the fresh produce sector, participants at the Stakeholder Workshop recommended
  the establishment of cool storage facilities at key provincial and central locations,
  which would be managed by a private sector company. This company would provide
  key support services to farmers, and would be responsible for managing the cool
  storage facilities and managing all transportation and distribution requirements, thus
  enabling farmers to sell their produce at the farm gate. This approach would have the
  additional advantage of shortening the supply chain, from the farmer's perspective,
  considerably, thus enabling women farmers. to reap direct benefits from their
  production.

6.2.4 Address systemic barriers affecting all supply chains

Transport system/roads need building/upgrading

Better road and transport infrastructure is an essential part of improving the functioning
of these agribusiness supply chains. It will be important for GoPNG to work with
partners to upgrade and improve the road system in PNG. Of particular importance for
the fresh produce sectors will be upgrading and maintaining the Highlands Highway,
and other major roads, and giving consideration to building new roads such as the
proposed Jimi–Madang Highway or the Kerema-POM Highway. Improved road
systems in the country will benefit almost everyone, including smallholder farmers by:
(1) reducing costs of business, (2) increasing participation among smallholder farmers
in economic activities, thereby resulting in increased incomes to the family unit, and
(3) increased savings by customers due to reduced prices for fruit and vegetables.



                                                                                       54
It will be important to bring infrastructure development and prioritization into greater
alignment with the productive potential in these three agribusiness sectors. To do this
will require: (i) better data collection and analysis of farming activities, including tree
counts, farmer profiling, and production possibilities; (ii) using these data to strengthen
the business case for farming and for building associated infrastructure, as a means of
expanding the productive potential of these sectors; and (iii) prioritizing infrastructure,
notably road construction and maintenance, transport services, and establishment of
cold chain and storage facilities, in ways that support and strengthen the productive
potential of these sectors.

Cold chain/storage facilities accessible to small-scale producers

There is a wide consensus among many players associated, both directly and indirectly,
with the fresh produce industry that, for the fresh produce supply chain to function
properly and to deliver the expected outcome, the immediate development of a cold
chain and storage facilities is paramount. Recent analysis of the feasibility of
establishing a wholesale fresh produce market in Port Moresby concluded that a
wholesale facility should be established soon to cater for the growing demand for fresh
produce among residents in Port Moresby and elsewhere. The need for a cold chain and
better storage facilities along the supply chain of fresh produce was highlighted
frequently during consultations, and has been recommended in the literature, and in
policy declarations, for many years. It will be important to work in close consultation
with other interested parties to explore avenues to set up cold chain /storage facilities
for fresh produce. In view of increased demand from the LNG project, and other mining
sites, a partnership involving fresh produce suppliers to these sites could help to
establish cold chain and storage facilities specifically to benefit this market segment.

Improved security along transport corridors and in markets

Given the impact of insecurity and violence on women in PNG, and the implications
for their mobility and capacity to engage in economic activity, it is essential to focus
on measures that reduce security risks for women:

 Strengthen existing initiatives that are currently in place to address insecurity, for
  instance, working with UN Women in addressing insecurity among women in the
  open urban markets throughout the city of Port Moresby. Key measures to consider
  include provision of banking and financial access services within market spaces;
  providing toilet and child care facilities for women inside markets; substantially
  strengthening market security through adequate policing and provision of security
  services; and facilitating women's greater participation in market management,
  oversight, and decision-making.
 Coordinate transport and marketing activities on behalf of women – working with
  established groups including cooperatives or associations, coordinate the marketing
  and transporting of women’s produce. This will allow women to remain where they
  are – in their homes or villages – but still sell their produce and earn cash incomes.
  Women would not have to travel to market their produce where they are more
  exposed to danger.
 Work with existing networks to reduce family and sexual violence experienced by
  women in rural communities. To this effect, work closely with relevant parties (the



                                                                                        55
  Police, elected Village Councillors, Magistrates and Churches) to reduce men’s
  access to alcohol and drugs.
 Strengthen community-level capacity to deal with theft of coffee and cocoa, as this
  was identified as a significant issue in the Stakeholder Workshop. Specifically,
  ensure that communities and local-level government agencies take ownership of this
  issue, and implement locally-appropriate solutions, including strengthening village
  courts, building community level government, and providing sufficient manpower
  and resources (policing) commensurate with the need in the communities concerned.

Broader knowledge and information systems need strengthening

Modern communications technology (notably internet and mobile telephony) can be
used pro-actively to improve women's access to critical information and services. Based
on the recommendations of the Stakeholder workshop, two key initiatives could be
prioritized.

 Establish a Communications Initiative in each of the three supply chains, in
  partnership: (a) with private sector providers of mobile phone and internet services;
  and (b) with input suppliers traders, aggregators, shippers, and buyers, to facilitate
  information flows between producers and these other actors in the supply chains on
  input requirements, production schedules, weather and related issues, security
  conditions, prices, market conditions, transport links, shipping schedules, and
  emerging market opportunities (for example food provisioning for LNG and other
  mining sites), to strengthen both the operating efficiency ("push" factors) and market
  responsiveness ("pull" factors) of the supply chain. In so doing pro-actively facilitate
  the access of women farmers, groups, and associations to these communications
  services, and provide training and capacity-building in their use. This could involve
  building further on existing collaboration with Digicel in the context of the IFC
  Agribusiness Project.

 Support banks and other financial service providers, and work in collaboration with
  buyers and traders, to develop products and services which enable women: (i) to open
  bank accounts in their own name, and/or to do so jointly with their husbands; (ii) to
  obtain non-cash payment for products sold to buyers; (iii) to access financial services
  in markets where fresh produce is sold; and (iv) to access a broader range of financial
  services, including credit and insurance.

Annex 3            Conceptualizing Supply Chains
A         Conceptual Framework

This report endeavors to analyze the gender issues in the three agribusiness sectors
through a gender-focused understanding of the supply chains operating in these sectors.
There is an extensive literature on supply chains1 and an emerging literature both on
the gender dimensions of supply chains and how best to integrate gender analysis into
supply chain development and upgrading (see notably Chan 2010; Coles and Mitchell
2011; M4P 2008; Mayoux and Mackie 2007; Rubin et al. n.d.).

A useful approach to supply chains is outlined in Annex 3, Box 1, which, appropriately
perhaps, is from a study specifically focused on analysis of supply chains in the fresh
produce sector in PNG (Martin and Jagadish 2006).

    Annex 3, Box 1: Conceptualizing Supply Chains

    [A] chain is envisaged as a value-creation process, whereby all firms in a chain link and align with
    each other to create value for the chain as a whole. It is argued that value creation occurs through
    firm operations, integration of processes, and logistics and quality control (product maintenance). It
    is further argued that value creation throughout the chain is supported by information flows, and
    achieved through vertical integration and relationship management.

    Value creation occurs primarily through operations. This is achieved through product transformation
    (processing) or product enhancement (cleaning, grading, packaging or presentation). Value is also
    created through the integration of processes along the chain; that is, the seamless meshing of
    processes as the product moves from one point in the chain to the next. Value is further created
    through logistics (where product is transported from one point in the chain to the next in a cost and
    time effective manner) and quality control (where the quality of the product is maintained through
    packing, transporting and cool or cold chain procedures).

    Value creation along a chain (and the information flows that support this) is achieved through chain
    relationships. These relationships underpin the functioning of the chain, and therefore, chain
    functions such as value creation, quality management and information flows, cannot be considered
    in isolation of chain relationships.

    The types of relationships that characterise a chain will usually be driven by product characteristics
    and market segments. By their nature, urban markets are opportunistic, and this opportunism will
    then permeate relationships along the rest of the chain.

    Usually, chain leaders will internalise critical chain functions through vertical integration of key
    processes that create competitive advantage for them. While there was some evidence that this was
    occurring, by and large, vertical integration of functions was not a feature of the fresh produce chains
    observed in this study. This is a reflection of the relatively opportunistic orientation of most of these
    chains, which in turn, reflects the characteristics of the market segments.

      Sometimes the terms "supply chain" and "value chain" are used interchangeably, though a useful
      distinction is that the concept of a supply chain focuses on the actors and processes involved in
      taking a product or service from its origins to the final consumer, while the concept of a value chain
      places more emphasis on seeking to establish the value-added provided to the product or service at
      each step along the chain. For purposes of this report, and in keeping with the task TORs (Annex
      7), we use the term "supply chain" here, as this report does not attempt, largely because of data
      limitations, to disaggregate by sex quantitative value-addition along these agribusiness chains.


                                                                                                          67
Conceptually, therefore, behind the idea of a supply chain is the notion that processes
are linked, i.e., that they form a "chain," and that actors in the chain (firms) have both
interest and power to make the chain work for all involved. Indeed, guidance
specifically written to facilitate better integration of poverty reduction goals in supply
chain development makes the point that "a value chain exists when all of the actors in
the chain operate in a way that maximizes the generation of value along the chain"
(M4P 2008:7).

Supply chain analysis requires understanding the key sequential steps in the chain, the
principal actors involved, what tasks or activities these actors are engaged in, the
nature of the relationships among these actors, including power and influence over
chain activities, the distribution of costs and benefits among chain actors, and the
flows of information among the actors along the chain. It also requires clear
articulation of the overall goals of improving, or "upgrading" as it is often referred to
in the literature, the overall performance of the supply chain. The literature identifies
two key orientations for strengthening supply chains: push factors, which focus on
improving operational efficiency along the chain; and pull factors, which focus on
improving the market responsiveness of the chain (see Simchi and Levi, 2013, in
Hickey 2013). Clearly, acting on both dimensions is necessary to improve chain
performance.

B      Gender and Supply Chains

Drawing from this understanding of supply chains, a gender perspective requires, at its
simplest, that, in relation to the identified steps of the chain, the following key elements
of analysis be undertaken:

 actors and their activities: that the presence of men and women operating as
  stakeholders, and that the specific roles and responsibilities undertaken by men and
  women at different points along the chain, are clearly identified (mapped) and
  understood;
 relationships: that the gender dynamics and specificity of relationships among the
  actors in the chain, including with respect to power and decision-making around
  chain activities, are clearly identified;
 costs and benefits: that the ways in which the costs and benefits of chain activities
  differ for men and women, notably with respect to income earned at different points
  along the chain, are clearly identified;
 information: that the ways in which communication, knowledge, and information
  flows required for chain functioning differ for men and for women
 obstacles, opportunities, and implications for the chain: that the obstacles and
  opportunities for men and women arising from the preceding analysis, and their
  implications for the performance of the supply chain, are identified; and
 priority actions: that key measures to be taken to address the identified obstacles,
  and to strengthen the opportunities for both men and women, be articulated and
  integrated into policies and programs aimed at "upgrading" or improving the
  performance of the chain.

The gender-focused literature on supply chains provides valuable pointers for this kind
of work in PNG. A value chain guide (Chan 2010), written to engage international food


                                                                                         68
companies, notably in coffee, cocoa, and horticulture, presents a succinct summary of
a gender-focused situation analysis. As will be discussed in subsequent chapters, the
diagnostic is essentially applicable to the situation that prevails in PNG:

 fewer women that men are members of company contact farmer schemes;
 many companies source from established producer groups, but women are under-
  represented in membership and governance of such groups;
 on male-owned farms women do much of the work, but receive little of the income
  from crop sales and have little say in how that income is spent;
 women are much less likely than men to benefit from technical training and extension
  programs; and
 sustainability certification programs are less likely to benefit women (Chan 2010:8).

The rationale for engagement by international food companies in developing gender-
responsive supply chains is summarized as follows:

   maintaining and improving quality--"upgrading" the chain;
   increasing productivity, including improving incentives for women;
   reducing management and coordination costs;
   growing the supply base;
   strengthening the brand and improving access to premium markets; and
   contributing to broader corporate social responsibility (CSR) and development goals
    (Chan 2010:17-24).

The guidance prepared for USAID on integrating gender into agricultural value chains
points out that value chain programs that support gender-equity goals:

   understand men's and women's roles and relations;
   foster equitable participation;
   address the needs of women;
   support women's economic advancement;
   promote gender-equitable market-driven solutions;
   design gender-equitable benefit-sharing mechanisms; and
   include men in defining the "problem" and the solution (Rubin and Manfre, 2010:12).

C        Data Limitations

There are important limitations with respect to the data available in PNG for the kind
of gender-focused analysis that is needed. Specifically, data on the allocation of men's
and women's labor to the range of tasks along the supply chain, notably with respect to
production and post-harvest processing, are virtually non-existent, as the only study to
provide estimates of men's and women's time use dates from the late 1990s, and relies
on data collected in 1992-93 (Overfield 1998). Recent analyses, including the PPAP
baseline survey (UniQuest 2013) and the IFC Coffee baseline (Murray-Prior 2014) do
not provide data from time-use surveys, but they do provide valuable information on
perceptions by farmers as to who plays dominant (main worker) and subordinate roles
at different points in the production and processing cycle, as discussed in Chapters 3
and 4. In the absence of detailed sex-disaggregated data on labor use in these supply
chains, it is also not possible to attribute to men or to women their respective
contributions to value-addition in these supply chains, nor to determine the specific


                                                                                     69
distribution of income or other benefits from chain activities between men and women.
In this respect, the report relies on findings from the extensive, though largely
qualitative, literature in PNG.

To the extent possible, therefore, and taking account of these data limitations, this report
seeks to provide information on the roles of men and women in these key agribusiness
supply chains, to identify the issues (obstacles and constraints) faced by men and
women, as and where they differ, to spell out the implications of these differences in
roles and obstacles, and to outline measures to address these differences both to
strengthen gender inclusion more generally in chain activities, and, just as importantly,
to improve ("upgrade") the overall performance and functioning of these supply chains.

It should be noted, however, that, for reasons that are explored further in the discussion
of the agribusiness supply chains in Chapters 3-5, this view of supply chains assumes
a degree of economic rationality and operational coherence that may not in fact always
be present in the PNG context. Consequently, while a supply chain approach provides
a useful framework for analyzing performance issues in these sectors in PNG, it is also
important to look at the wider socio-economic context in which these chains operate,
and which continues to exert a powerful influence on economic activity in general, and
on the ways in which these chains perform in particular. For example, it cannot really
be said that, as cited above, "all of the actors in the chain operate in a way that
maximizes the generation of value along the chain" (M4P 2008:7), when value-addition
is not the primary motivation of the great majority of smallholders in PNG, who tend
not to see their farming activities as a "business," as discussed elsewhere. Indeed, one
of the critical challenges facing these sectors in PNG is to shift smallholders toward a
more business-oriented view of their work. Enabling women to be at least as much a
part of these shifts as men is perhaps one of the critical avenues available to PNG to
improve performance and incomes throughout these chains. This in turn requires not
only better linkages between farmers in general and the markets they serve, but also,
and especially, better access by women to these markets and to the opportunities they
present.

Specifically in relation to PNG, and of particular importance given the centrality of the
ways in which socio-cultural factors intersect with economic ones in all of the supply
chains examined in this report, is the colorful language used by John Spriggs et al. to
make the distinction between the physical and technical aspect of supply chains, which
they label as "tame" problems, and the human and social aspect of supply chains, which
they label as "wicked" problems (Spriggs et al. 2013:11). In examining gender issues
in PNG supply chains, this report is necessarily primarily concerned with "wicked"
problems. Importantly, Spriggs et al. go on to make a point with which this report
concurs: "What is critical for dealing with wickedness in problems is to engage with
local stakeholders in a way that encourages consensus and ownership of the problems
(and solutions) by those stakeholders" (Spriggs et al. 2013:11). This in turn provided
both impetus and rationale for the Stakeholder Workshop, which was held in April 2014
to find ways to converge on solutions to address gender issues in these supply chains
(see Annex 6).

Annex 4        Background on Coffee and Cocoa in PNG
Agriculture accounts for approximately 1/3 of GDP, and the sector is dominated by
smallholder farming systems. Along with oil palm, coffee and cocoa are the main cash
crops, with respectively over 30 percent and 20 percent of the total labor force involved
in their production, processing and sale (World Bank 2010:1). Virtually all farmers are
also engaged in food crop production, whether for subsistence, or, increasingly, for sale
in local and distant markets.

A      Background to the Coffee Sector

The coffee industry in Papua New Guinea is a major contributor to national income and
employment. Almost 3.0 million people depend directly or indirectly on coffee for their
livelihoods. The industry is made up of about 400,000 households, 680 blocks ranging
from 1-30 hectares, 7 plantations, 17 registered exporters, and 59 registered processors
and over 6,000 roadside buyers (Sunday Chronicle 2014:17-18). Arabica coffee
comprises more than 95% of production and exports, while robusta accounts for less
than 5%. The bulk of the production is produced by the smallholder sector, accounting
for about 85% of annual production, followed by plantations (10%) and blocks (5%)
(Sunday Chronicle 2014:17-18).

the 2006-08 period, it
averaged 951,000 bags. Source: Bank of PNG, Quarterly Economic Bulletins (2004-12).
This represented a modest
decline from its 10-year average of 1,076,000, and its all-time high of 1.34 million bags
(Giovannucci and Hunt 2009:6). According to data from the Quarterly Economic
Bulletins (QEB) of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, there has been a gradual upward
trend in the value of coffee exports, with some fluctuation and a peak in both volume
and value in 2011 (Annex 4, Figure 1).

The major coffee producing provinces are Eastern Highlands, Western Highlands,
Jiwaka, Morobe, Madang, and Simbu provinces, which account for over 84% of coffee
production, while East Sepik, West Sepik, Oro, Milne Bay, Central, Gulf and East New
Britain produce the balance. In the Highlands region of PNG, coffee forms a substantial

part of household cash income. The PPAP Baseline Survey (UniQuest 2013) found that
it formed about half of households’ cash income in 2011, for the coffee households
interviewed, ranging from a low of 43% in Western Highlands province to 63% in
Eastern Highlands province.

Productivity is low, with yields on average 30-50 percent of their potential, and quality
has also been deteriorating. There is little empirical data available but the reasons
behind low productivity have been documented in recent research: the lack of support
services to promote improved tree husbandry practices; lack of adequate replanting
(most of the trees are over 40 years old and well beyond their optimal production age);
constraints to market access and quality issues that reduce farm-gate prices and
smallholders' incentives to invest in or harvest coffee; and law and order issues (World
Bank 2010:1). As discussed in this report, gender-based differences in labor
availability, allocation, and incentives can also be seen as contributing factors to low
productivity in the sector.

According to Murray-Prior and Padarath (2013), there are three main marketing routes
for smallholder coffee in PNG. The majority of coffee is produced, picked, wet
processed and sold as parchment by smallholder producers. This coffee is mostly sold
as Y grade, although a small percentage ends up a PSC (Premium Smallholder Coffee).
A much smaller percentage is essentially produced in the same way, but because it has
been certified and in some cases has slightly higher quality controls is sold as Fair Trade
or organic or Fair Trade/organic. In locations close to reasonable roads, particularly in
the Western Highlands and Jiwaka provinces, farmers sell cherry to plantations or
commercial wet mills. This coffee is turned into plantation-style coffee and sold at a
premium to Y grade coffee. Smallholders selling cherry obtain a price, in parchment
equivalent terms, around 30% higher than they obtain for the parchment they would
otherwise produce (Murray-Prior and Padarath 2013:7).

Giovannucci and Hunt (2009) point out that coffee holdings have gradually fragmented
from large plantation holdings to large numbers of smallholdings. Over the years, the
numbers of plantations have gradually fallen, in part owing to land disputes, and
smallholders have become increasingly engaged in coffee production. This process has
converted local producers from laborers to producer-owners. Giovannucci and Hunt
note that for many the transition did not come with adequate preparation or training in
the business of coffee farming, and this has introduced considerable inefficiencies,
though not, as they point out, a significant decrease in production (Giovannucci and
Hunt 2009:9). Importantly, they note that non-economic factors play a significant role
in determining the behavior of farmers, who are not necessarily motivated by the desire
to expand output or quality.

       Smallholder culture in the coffee growing areas is not necessarily responsive to purely economic
       or market demands. The domestic raw coffee market is a mechanism used by smallholders to
       facilitate their livelihoods but only a modest percentage have the drive to produce and market
       as much as possible. ... In many cases, social obligations and food production requirements are
       more important than expanding coffee. To alter the market situation requires understanding the
       motivations of producers and how they perceive the welfare benefits of more cash crops. For
       many, though certainly not all, the priority is not to have more and more coffee or even better
       coffee if that requires considerably more labor or investment (Giovannucci and Hunt 2009:8-
       9).

The Project Appraisal Document for the PPAP provides a useful summary of the
broader issues facing both coffee and cocoa farmers in PNG:

       Smallholder coffee and cocoa farmers are faced with similar constraints and significant market
       failures impede their performance and their ability to respond to market signals. They are
       disadvantaged by significant diseconomies of scale resulting in high transaction costs and
       limited market access. Following the collapse of publicly funded extension services,
       smallholder farmers have little access to information, new technologies, and improved planting
       material. Because of information asymmetries, few farmers have knowledge about quality or
       standards requirements for higher remuneration or other market opportunities. Finally, the
       location of many smallholder farmers means that they lack access to roads and the necessary
       infrastructure for coffee and cocoa processing. (World Bank 2010:2-3).

Coffee Sector Policies and Strategies

The Coffee Industry Corporation Limited (CIC) has formulated a 10-year strategic plan
covering the period 2008-2018, which recognizes the need to improve industry
coordination and to increase returns to smallholder growers, if the sustainability of the
sector is to be ensured (World Bank 2010:1-2). To that end, there is increasing
consensus within the industry that PNG should build on its competitive advantage in
the higher-value segments of the market, including coffees differentiated by quality,
sustainability certifications, and geographical indications (to designate product origin).
The market for these coffees could be more remunerative and these are among the
fastest growing segments of the global coffee industry. Improving coffee farming-
systems by taking advantage of diversification opportunities is also an important part
of the strategy to improve coffee growers’ livelihoods. These elements of the strategic
plan align closely with the concern expressed throughout this report: (a) that improving
quality is critical, and likely to be more attainable than expanding output; and (b) that
doing so requires greater attention to gender dynamics in labor allocation and
remuneration in the sector.

Giovannucci and Hunt argue that the most sound strategy to improve the coffee sector
is likely to be two-pronged: improving technology for better productivity and quality
without significantly increasing labor or the amount of land needed while also reducing
costs of production and marketing. If this is done in an environmentally and socially
sustainable manner and linked with private enterprise, especially mills and exporters,
the sector should see a healthy improvement in its profitability and in its
competitiveness and market reputation (Giovannucci and Hunt 2009:24). Here too, the
emphasis on quality improvement over quantity, and the importance attached to not
adding to existing labor burdens, are appropriate, as will be discussed further below.

B      Background to the Cocoa Sector

Cocoa is one of the major agricultural export crops for PNG with an estimated 151,000
households, or about 1.0 million people, involved in the industry (Cocoa Board 2013).
Cocoa is grown in 14 of the country's 22 provinces, with the main production areas
being East Sepik, East New Britain, Bougainville, Madang, New Ireland, West New
Britain, and West Sepik Provinces. It is the largest single source of income in East New
Britain Province and in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. According to the
World Bank's PPAP documentation, about 85 percent of Papua New Guinea’s cocoa is
produced on smallholdings (World Bank 2010:2).

reaching their highest level in 2009 at K359 million. Thereafter, earnings started to
decline, in part because of low production caused by cocoa pod borer (CPB) infestation,
low world market prices for cocoa, and a stronger kina exchange rate (Annex 4, Figure
2).

PNG was classified as a 90% fine flavour producer by the ICCO Ad-Hoc Panel on Fine
Flavour in 2010 (see Cocoa Board 2013). Fine Flavour cocoa is said to command a
certain premium of between $50 and $200 on the world market. PNG cocoa is regarded
as having high standards internationally and is used for blending with bulk cocoa from
South East Asia. The biggest problem with PNG cocoa, however, is “smoke taint,”
which was identified by the ICCO Ad Hoc Panel on Fine Flavour.

The cocoa sector has been devastated by the emergence of cocoa pod borer (CPB). The
CPB pest (Conopomorpha cramerella) presents the biggest threat to the PNG cocoa
industry. Indeed, the economic impact of CPB is considered as being comparable to the
disruption caused by the 1994 volcano eruption that destroyed Rabaul (see Curry et al.
2009). It is 7 years since the Cocoa Pod Borer (CPB) pest was detected initially in East
New Britain. To-date, nine cocoa growing provinces have been confirmed to have CPB
(Cocoa Board 2013). In East New Britain, the leading cocoa producing region,
production is estimated to have declined by 80% as a result of CPB (Cocoa Board 2013).

Technical solutions are available for CPB control. Key technical solutions include
adoption of good agricultural practices, such as frequent harvesting, pruning, sanitation,
and fertilization, and greater application of the Integrated Pest and Disease
Management (IPDM) approach to controlling CPB (Cocoa Board 2013). The Cocoa
and Coconut Institute (CCI) released 10 CPB-tolerant clones of cocoa in 2012.
However, as the PPAP documentation notes, their adoption will require a substantial
scaling-up of farmer support services and on-farm investments. At the same time, the
PPAP points out that some diversification of cocoa-based farming systems will also be
necessary if rural livelihoods in affected areas are to be restored (World Bank 2010:2).


                                                                                                                           74
Cocoa Sector Policies and Strategies

The Cocoa Board identifies seven key issue areas affecting the cocoa industry in PNG.
These are: (i) CPB; (ii) declining smallholder productivity; (iii) poor transport and
market infrastructure; (iv) under-funded research and extension; (v) poor access to, and
affordability of, credit; (vi) law and order; and (vii) land tenure issues (see Cocoa Board
2013). Productivity is low: smallholder productivity has been estimated at 0.3 tonne/ha,
compared with plantation yields under high management of 1.0-2.5 tonnes/ha, and
research trials which have recorded yields of up to 2.5 tonnes/ha using the hybrid clone
varieties. Poor infrastructure is costly to the industry: the Cocoa Board estimates,
conservatively, that about 10,000 to 15,000 tonnes of cocoa do not reach the markets
due to absent or insufficient transportation.

The sector has a strategic plan articulated as part of the PPAP (Agrifood Consulting
International 2009). It provides for six main action areas, focused on governance,
extension, CPB management, investment, quality and marketability, and research.
While these areas are undoubtedly of importance, and have the overarching aim of
improving productivity, performance, and returns to the sector, it is largely silent on
the topic of gender. While advocating the importance of practical demonstrations of
good practices for farmers, the strategy makes only passing reference to women: " The
extension program would include women as beneficiaries and ensure that women
facilitators and women farmers are part of the training" (Agrifood Consulting
International 2009:4). The importance of women's role in cocoa farming (notably in
processing), and their indispensable role in ensuring quality, requires explicit attention
and pro-active focus as extension programs are designed and implemented. The
proposal to ensure that extension agents come from within the communities concerned
is, in this respect, a positive one.

It sets a target that at least 30 percent of the beneficiaries of training should be women,
and at least 30 percent of beneficiaries of seed distribution and access to capital should
be women. It will be important to monitor whether this is in fact occurring−what is the
specific result of this orientation, and what obstacles have been encountered. The
strategy acknowledges that, "in spite of women being active in cocoa cultivation,
training and extension programs are mostly directed to men" (Agrifood Consulting
International 2009:15).

The Cocoa Board emphasizes four key action areas to promote the cocoa industry. First,
it argues that clonal cocoa is the way forward for the future, and that significant
investment in new nurseries is necessary. This will provide farmers with clonal
seedlings for replanting and clonal budwood for rehabilitation of their old cocoa trees.
These need to be established in strategic locations in the growing provinces for farmers
to have access to planting material. In the remote areas and provinces, hybrids can still
produce the desired result given proper block management (Cocoa Board 2013). Here
too, an opportunity for greater gender-inclusion is apparent. According to interviewees
met during the January 2014 field visits, women are "more meticulous" and more
careful in nursery and bud garden work, which could in turn have a positive impact on
the quality of the varieties developed and of the plant material provided to cocoa
growers.



                                                                                        75
Second, it is of the view that certification is become increasingly important in the cocoa
industry, as discussed in Chapter 3. Third, it is more beneficial for farmers to work in
organized grower groups rather than individually. This makes it easier to tap into
services provided by both government and the private sector. A further advantage is
that groups have greater bargaining power to negotiate better prices for farmers, and to
exploit economies of scale.

Fourth, since the emergence of CPB, farmers are encouraged to use communal driers,
as otherwise the small quantities of beans being harvested from farms are not sufficient
for proper fermentation to occur. Usage of communal facilities would also make it
easier for the Board’s inspections and monitoring work to be conducted and can lead to
the reduction in smoke taint.

Annex 5        The Fresh Produce (Horticulture) Sector in PNG
The fresh produce (horticulture) sector in PNG is markedly different from the coffee
and cocoa sectors described in Annex 4. While the three sectors share the important
characteristic that many smallholders are involved in production, indicating that
production is highly fragmented, the fresh produce sector is also highly fragmented in
distribution and marketing. Unlike coffee and cocoa, where the product is destined for
export and the market is essentially limited to a small number of exporters, markets for
fresh produce in PNG are very diverse, and the supply chains are extremely varied. For
these reasons, and given that heretofore the WBG has paid less attention to the fresh
produce sectors, a more extensive treatment of the fresh produce sector is provided in
this Annex.

A      Background to the Sector

Lack of recent and reliable data restricts an accurate assessment of the total economic
value of the horticulture industry in PNG including any trends, both past and future,
that prevail in the industry. However, it is widely accepted, as reflected in several of
the key strategic documents of the Papua New Guinea Government such as the
PNGSDP 2010-2030, that the horticulture industry has a huge potential in contributing
to the country’s national development. Hence, the development of the food sector is
important. A recent study looking at the feasibility of a wholesale market for fresh
produce in Port Moresby (POM) highlighted further the significant economic potential
of this market, indicating that the total demand for fresh produce in POM alone is now
estimated to be 167,000 tonnes/annum, compared to 140,500 tonnes/annum in 2008,
representing an increase of 26,500 tonnes/annum (Bonney et al. 2012:11). This
increased demand for fresh produce represents a growth rate of almost 19% during the
period 2008-2012. Market demand for fresh produce is likely to remain high throughout
the country in years to come, due largely to resource-led development, increased
urbanization, and a general rise in the standards of living among the people (Bonney et
al. 2012:11).

Food crops in the horticulture industry are divided into three main groups, namely: (1)
traditional staples; (2) fruits and vegetables (classified as fresh food); and (3) rice and
wheat. The staples are largely produced for home consumption and the surpluses are
marketed. Fruits, vegetables, and nuts are regarded as commercial food crops, since
they are mainly grown for sale in formal and informal markets (DAL 2006).

Large quantities of fresh produce can be grown in the Highlands provinces of Papua
New Guinea. The Highlands provide an ideal environment for the production of
temperate fresh vegetables, while the major markets are situated in the more highly
populated coastal areas around Port Moresby, Lae and Madang (Martin and Jagadish
2006:1). Virtually all farmers in PNG grow food crops, mostly for subsistence needs,
with an increasing number producing surpluses for sale.

B      Fresh Produce Sector Policies and Strategies

The Papua New Guinea Government’s national development policies, priorities and
strategic directions are articulated in a number of key documents including the Vision


                                                                                        77
2050, the Medium Term Development Plan, and the PNG Development Strategic Plan
2010-2030.

The Vision 2050 identifies seven (7) pillars as the major focus areas for development
and growth for PNG. Wealth Creation is Pillar Two. Under this focus area, the
Government plans to develop agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism, and
manufacturing ventures to generate around 70% of GDP by 2050, with the balance
coming from mining, petroleum and gas ventures in the non-renewable sector. For
agriculture, the vision proposes to establish two major impact agricultural projects in
all 89 districts, expand production volume of all major cash crops to enable downstream
processing, provide two agricultural extension officers per district, improve the
employment conditions of agricultural officers, and establish a unified agricultural plan
by 2015 (Kaiulo and Manoka 2010:8).

The Development Strategic Plan (DSP) 2010-2030 states the goal of the Agriculture &
Livestock Sector as “a world class agriculture sector that is responsive to international
and domestic markets for a diverse range of products and provides the best available
income and job opportunities”. This Plan recognises the horticulture industry, among
other key sub-sectors such as coffee and cocoa, as a growth area that needs further
development to achieve this objective. Although there is no baseline against which to
measure progress, the DSP has set a target of a five-fold increase in the production of
horticultural products, including organic products.

The DSP also highlights a number of key strategies to achieve this target and these are:
(i) efficient land administration, allowing landowners to profit from their land; (ii)
develop roads and supply chains to link producers to markets; (iii) provision of effective
extension services; (iv) utilise economic corridor concepts such as niche or organic
farming or nucleus plantations; and (v) enforce CODEX 2 marketing standards. It is
proposed that successful implementation of these strategies will improve agriculture
production five-fold, creating an estimated 267,400 additional jobs and K7.2 billion
additional income by 2030 (DSP 2010:90-91).

The National Agriculture Development Plan (NADP) 2007-2016 focuses on sectoral
policies for the agriculture sector. The NADP highlights the importance of making the
agriculture sector more efficient and competitive through private sector development
and growth and increased agricultural exports. For the food and horticultural industry,
the strategic areas of focus under the NADP include: (1) improved food production; (2)
development of the Food Processing and Preservation Industry; and (3) market
development and promotion (NADP 2006).

According to the Fresh Produce Development Agency’s Strategic Plan (2010-2030),
the goal of FPDA is ‘improved food and nutrition security, quality of life, incomes and
business opportunities for farming communities and others who depend on
horticulture.’ FPDA aims to achieve this goal through ‘improved efficiency and
productivity of female and male farmers and others in the value chain and a
commercially and economically viable and sustainable horticulture industry.’ FPDA is

C      Dynamics of Fresh Produce Supply Chains

The major stages of the fresh produce supply chain include; (1) supply of inputs (seeds,
chemicals, fertilizer, equipment/tools, machinery and credit; as well as training in
various skills); (2) farm production; (3) basic product enhancement on farm site
(harvesting, washing, cutting /trimming, sorting, packing) and transport to largely open
markets; (4) consolidation of produce; (5) improved product enhancement at the buyer
/aggregator level (re-washing, re-sorting, re-packing into proper recommended boxes
/cartons); (5) transportation cooling chillers and storage; (6) distribution and marketing
to distant markets (freighting fresh produce via air and road transport). To provide a
fuller appreciation of the constraints affecting women, this section discusses six main
components of the supply chain: existing marketing and marketing requirements;
production systems; value addition through processing and quality management;
transportation; relationships and information flow; and systemic issues. Annex 5 Figure
1 depicts the main channels for moving fresh produce from the Highlands to POM.

Existing Markets & Market Requirements

The value addition process begins with having a fair understanding of the market’s
requirements. Once a customer’s specific needs are established including his/her ability
to pay for the improved quality, necessary investments are made and other relationships
to facilitate the value creation process are put in place to deliver the required product.

In PNG, there are many different types of markets for fresh produce with varying needs
(Martin and Jagadish 2006). Despite the differences, the marketing system for fresh
produce is commonly categorized into formal and informal systems. The formal market
involves the production and marketing of mostly "introduced fruits and vegetables"3 by
sellers, where the major actors are top-end supermarket and hotel chains. The informal
marketing system, by contrast, caters for the production and sale of both introduced and
traditional staple fruits and vegetables. Farmers under this marketing system produce
crops for immediate consumption and sell the surplus. The markets for fruits and
vegetables in the informal sector include: roadside markets along major road systems,
front yard markets, and open markets.

The key market segments for fresh produce include supermarkets of various types,
institutions of various types, kai bars, distributors, and urban markets. As analyzed by
Martin and Jagadish (2006), these markets require different product attributes from
their suppliers, and these are:

 Top-end supermarkets require high quality produce that meets strict quality standards,
  good shelf-life, continuity of supply, and certain quantities.
 Mid-range supermarkets are usually prepared to accept product that is lower quality,

3
    "Introduced" vegetables refer to what are considered to be Western-style vegetables such as
    broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, cabbages, radish, celery.


                                                                                            79
    but still require good shelf-life, continuity of supply, and certain quantities.
   Top-end institutions (such as international hotels) require high quality but there may
    be some latitude in what they accept; they also require continuity of supply, and
    certain quantities.
   Other institutions (such as universities, mines, etc.) do not have particularly high
    quality requirements, but will want continuity of supply, and certain quantities.
   Kai bars will require relatively low quality produce, continuity of supply, and certain
    quantities.
   Distributors perform the intermediation function of bringing buyers and sellers
    together; as such, they will determine what each of the above segments might require
    in a week (in terms of quality and quantity) and match this with supply from
    marketers or self-marketing farmers who approach them.
   The urban markets also perform an intermediation function of matching buyers with
    sellers, and all quantities and qualities are available for sale, with the discipline of
    the market leading to prices that reflect the demand and supply of various quantities
    and qualities.

The major players in the marketing and retailing of fresh produce include wholesalers,
retailers, middlemen or ‘black marketers,’ and the final consumer. Drawing on the
extensive analysis of Bonney et al. (2012), the following paragraphs summarize key
characteristics of these players.

Consumers. There is little direct primary research on consumers in PNG though it is
likely that PNG consumers, like those elsewhere, have a preference for local shopping.

Retailers. Retailers for fresh produce include supermarkets, urban markets, road sellers
and small vendors. There are currently six main supermarket groups operating in PNG
(as indicated in Table 5.1 above) and these groups have the principal strategic influence
in the fresh produce market. These supermarket groups are a mix of home‐grown
retailers and international investors based elsewhere in Asia that have identified PNG
as an emerging market opportunity in a highly competitive and increasingly
concentrated global retailing environment. Supermarkets employ a range of
procurement strategies, many encouraging smallholders by purchasing at the back door.
Some also have direct supply arrangements with large farms (e.g., Sogeri Hydroponics),
large collectors or farmer cooperatives. Supermarkets also grade the produce purchased,
generally classifying imports in an expat/high income section with significantly higher
prices in the fresh produce department and a ‘local produce’ section, which is of lower
quality and price.

Middlemen or ‘Black Marketers.’ These are usually female entrepreneurs who buy
fresh produce in bulk from local farmers who bring in their produce to sell at the open
urban markets and re-sell the produce at the same market. At the time of this study,
‘black marketers’ were operating in two locations, namely, Port Moresby and Mount
Hagen. In Port Moresby, local farmers arrive with their produce in PMVs to open urban
markets such as Gordons market and sell their produce in bulk to the ‘black marketers.’


                                                                                       81
These transactions usually occur outside the main market gate. Middlemen operating
in these markets have a fair idea of where the PMVs are coming from and the likely
quality and range of products. They compete aggressively for the best produce. When
the produce is unloaded, several middlemen with their male bag carriers may crowd
around the individual farmers (80% are women) badgering them to sell. Inevitably, with
such pressure, farmers often sell for a very low price, particularly if it’s after midday.
Middlemen tend to sell one or a few vegetables. The majority of the ‘black marketers’
operating in the open urban markets throughout the city of Port Moresby are
Highlanders. Bonney et al (2012), citing a study undertaken by FPDA, confirm that the
‘black marketers’ are Highlanders and provide a breakdown of their composition in
four (4) main POM open urban markets as: 41% from SHP, 32% from EHP, and 23%
from Chimbu.

In Mount Hagen, local farmers from the Western Highlands and Jiwaka Provinces bring
in their produce to the Mount Hagen open urban market and sell their produce in bulk
to the middlemen operating at the market. In almost all respects, the ‘black marketers’
in Mount Hagen operate in the same manner as the ‘black marketers’ in POM. However,
there are some notable differences between the two markets, and this is observed in
terms of the scale of operation: Mount Hagen is more commercially orientated,
involving a large number of middlemen buyers, including wholesalers or aggregators
who are buying and consolidating produce for on-selling to their clients in distant
markets; large volumes of produce are consolidated on a daily basis, and all the farmers
and the buyers congregate in one place to undertake such transactions almost every day.
Inevitably, large amounts of cash are being exchanged on a daily basis in this market.

Wholesalers or Aggregators. These individuals consolidate produce from farmers for
on‐selling to supermarkets, resource companies, institutions, hotels, and restaurants.
The exact volume of fresh produce consolidated and sold is not known and cannot be
assessed due to lack of data. However, it appears that important changes have taken
place between 2008 and 2012. For instance, in 2008 it was established that a total of
twelve (12) wholesalers were operating in POM however this number has reduced to
only three (3) wholesalers in 2012. Green Fresh Ltd is the largest of the three (3)
wholesalers currently operating in POM. Alele Ltd operates depots in Mt Hagen and
Kainantu, and Morobe Produce Marketing markets taro to POM. Part of this change
has been driven by the needs of the LNG project, estimated to be 130 tonnes/week, 40%
of which is from the Highlands (50 tonnes/week) and 60% (roughly 80 tonnes/week)
from POM and Central Province.

There are two large catering services operating as wholesalers or aggregators of fresh
produce: National Catering Services (NCS) and the Alliance Group (TAG). TAG is
now part of NCS and NCS is now part of the Anitua Group. Both of these companies
source fresh produce, and provide catering and other services to the LNG and resource
projects throughout the country. Others providing catering services include Eurest
(South Pacific) Ltd, Fubilan Catering Services Ltd and IPI Mountain Catering Pty Ltd.
Two females were operating as wholesalers or aggregators of fresh produce at the
Mount Hagen open urban market at the time of this study. These female aggregators
buy produce from local farmers and on-sell the produce to their clients in distant
markets such as Lae and Port Moresby.

Input Suppliers and Other Agencies. There are two major suppliers of agricultural


                                                                                       82
inputs associated with the fresh produce sector: Brian Bell & Co. Ltd, and Farmset Ltd.
Both operate at the national level, having representation throughout the country and
carry a wide range of products including agricultural supplies. The Fresh Produce
Development Agency (FPDA) is the organization mandated by the PNG Government
to provide extension services to all players along the supply chain of fresh produce.

Production Systems

Smallholder farmers operating at the subsistence level of farming produce food crops
mainly for their immediate consumption and sell the surplus (Bonney, 2012: Martin &
Jagadish 2006). At this level, farmers cultivate a range of traditional food crops such as
taros, bananas, sugar cane and sweet potato (kaukau) for the family’s direct
consumption. Smallholder farmers do not require conventional agricultural inputs.
Likewise, these farmers do not require technical knowledge or training on producing
traditional staple crops. At the subsistence level, farmers do not require credit or
financial support to expand their production.

The main tasks associated with growing food crops include: land preparation, collecting
planting materials, planting of seeds, maintaining the crop including weeding and
pruning, and fencing the land from animals. Women are directly responsible for the
production of the family’s food and they sell the surplus for cash incomes.

Commercial farmers, by contrast, produce fruits and vegetables for sale or income. The
word commercial farmer is loosely used but for the purposes of this paper, a
commercial farmer refers to those smallholders farmers who produce mainly
introduced fruits and vegetables for sale (as opposed to direct consumption). A
commercial farmer is not distinguished in terms of large scale farming operations using
highly mechanized systems of production or specialized production of certain crops or
mono-cropping covering hectares of land. A commercial farmer’s production
requirements differ greatly from that of the subsistence level farmer. Most commercial
farmers grow introduced4 fruits and vegetables for sale. In order to grow introduced
vegetables for sale, farmers require many of the conventional agricultural inputs (seeds,
fertilizers, insecticides and other materials /equipment) and in some instances, even
credit. Commercial farmers of fresh produce also require training in the technical
aspects of growing and maintaining a crop.

The main tasks associated with growing introduced fruits and vegetables include; land
preparation, purchasing planting materials such as seeds, purchasing other agricultural
inputs such as fertilizers, establishing nurseries, maintaining nurseries, field planting,
maintaining the crop whilst in the field including weeding, pruning, fertilizer
application, spraying of insecticides, and fencing the land from animals.

In general, both men and women contribute labor towards the production of fruits and
vegetables for sale. However, there are some differences in the amount of time or labor
that both men and women contribute towards producing a crop. With some crops, due
to their nature, both men and women contribute equal amounts of labor every time the
crop is grown. In other instances, labor inputs are required from both parties at the

    Introduced vegetables refer to Western style vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes,
    celery, cauliflower, zucchini, etc.


                                                                                                      83
introductory phase of the crop, say during the first and second rounds of production,
but for the subsequent rounds, women provides the sole labor in producing a crop. In
other instances,

Martin and Jagadish found that, in general, those smallholder farmers who are operating
at subsistence level produce a range of crops at minimum cost. They have minimal
capital (such as bush knives, grass knives, spades and knapsacks), farm communally
owned land and use family labor. While some may have small-scale borrowings, those
spoken to in this study used internally generated funds to meet variable costs (such as
seeds and insecticides) and to purchase capital items (Martin and Jagadish 2006:9).
They point out that in some parts of the Western Highlands and Jiwaka Provinces,
farmers have moved well beyond the subsistence focus and were running highly
successful commercial businesses. In these communities, farmers were using
commercial labor, able to produce sufficient high quality produce that could easily be
sold to various markets and farmers were able to undertake capital purchases. Bonney
et al (2012) summarized key production characteristics in 3 provinces (Annex 5, Table
1).
 Annex 5, Table 1: Profile of Fresh Produce Smallholders in 3 Provinces




 Source: Bonney et al. 2012:20.


Smallholder farmers encounter various constraints in producing fruits and vegetables
for cash incomes. These include: poor communication between suppliers of agricultural
inputs and smallholder farmers, inaccessibility of seeds/seedlings and other planting
materials, lack of reliable and consistent supply of quality seeds, lack of appropriate
farming equipment/machinery and other materials, lack of credit for expanding
production by smallholders, (in some areas) shortage of land due to population pressure,
lack of irrigation systems, and lack of technical training or farmer schools. Farmers also
lack training in business and financial management skills as well as training in socio-
cultural and livelihood strategies.


                                                                                       84
The inability of smallholder farmers to access quality seeds on a regular basis was
identified as a major problem by several previous studies (Martin and Jagadish 2006;
Bonney et at, 2012). Martin and Jagadish (2006:13), in particular, note that:
       A number of farmers in different chains reported difficulty in accessing quality seed and/or in
       being able to purchase seed at the right time. While it is usually difficult for outside agencies to
       intervene successfully in chains with respect to the provision of information (particularly
       towards the market end of the chain), some intervention to improve the information flow
       between input suppliers and smallholders could be quite beneficial to improving chain
       performance and smallholders’ returns.

In a recent study undertaken to assess the feasibility of a new wholesale fresh produce
market in POM, Bonney et al. (2012) highlighted that smallholder farmers have devised
their own techniques to save or collect seeds due to lack of consistent supply of reliable
and quality planting materials including seeds. They go on to explain that smallholder
farmers buy first generation hybrid (F1) seeds in small home gardener packets and then
collect seed for a second year’s production, though such mechanisms are unreliable and
are likely to result in poor performance of the crop, including low yields and poor
quality.

Production of fresh produce (for sale) is fragmented. There is no coordination among
farmers, there is no single line of command directing farmers what to grow, the
frequency for growing, how much to grow at any given time, how to grow, and when
to harvest and manage the post-harvest process. Poor coordination among farmers and
lack of proper planning results in oversupply of certain crops. Inevitably, oversupply
leads to reduced prices for farmers, which results in their becoming discouraged and
not ensuring consistency in the production of fresh vegetables. Apart from several
specialized farming operations, such as the hydroponics, many smallholder farmers
cultivate on average one hectare of land for vegetables and apply the shifting mode of
production. As a result, smallholders are constrained from obtaining a critical mass of
produce or even a critical mass for a single line of product.

Smallholder farmers face variable costs of production as they move towards producing
bulk for distant markets or planning their production to get a certain volume on a regular
basis. This is particularly true for the production of sweet potato (kaukau) for distant
markets. Each task associated with producing, harvesting, packing and transporting
kaukau (from the farm gate to the main road) is a cost to the farmer.

Access to credit is another major constraint for smallholder farmers. Financial
institutions do not provide credit to smallholders largely because there is no acceptable
form of collateral. Land, which the smallholder farmer owns, is non-tradable, as it is
not formally registered with clear ownership titles and demarcation of boundaries.

Value-Addition through Processing and Quality Management

At present, almost all fresh produce is sold as fresh. Much effort is concentrated on
enhancing the quality of a product. Enhancement refers to the various tasks (such as
trimming, washing, sorting, grading, packaging, using recommended materials, etc)
that are done in an effort to improve its overall freshness, quality, and presentation.
Value addition, as per conventional thinking through processing is almost non-existent


                                                                                                       85
along the supply chain of fresh produce. A main reason for this is:

          Currently there are no industrial scale produce farms in PNG and this will not change within
          the medium term. This is because the vast majority of land in PNG (96%) is held under
          customary tenure and mobilising land remains a key constraint to potential investors,
          therefore any improvements in the efficiency of the fresh produce system must involve
          smallholders and producer groups. Even where ethnic groups are organised into land ‐owner
          cooperatives or companies, PNG’s topography and land capability remain major
          impediments to large scale production. Hence PNG will remain reliant on smallholder
          production into the medium‐term future so improvements in their coordination, capacity and
          supporting infrastructure will be necessary for food security (Bonney et al. 2012:8).

Post-harvest losses are high due to lack of cool chain practices along the supply chain.
Product quality deteriorates at the farm site soon after harvest due to lack of cool storage
facilities at the farm gate. The deterioration of product quality accelerates as the
smallholder farmer struggles to pack his/her produce in whatever packaging material is
available, including old biscuit or twisties cartons, and loads it onto a PMV that is
carrying both passengers and cargo at the same time. The product continues to diminish
in quality (and value) as it changes hands from one player to the next as it moves along
the supply chain. By the time the product reaches the final consumer, it is sometimes
considered as non-saleable. For example, it has been estimated that 30-50 percent of
sweet potato production may be unsaleable upon arrival in POM due to rots and other
physical damage (Chang et al. 2013:17). This is confirmed by the POM wholesale
market feasibility study, where wastage levels of 20% or more are common (Bonney et
al, 2012).

The observations made by Martin and Jagadish (2006:11-12) in their analysis of the
fresh produce supply chain affirm the challenges smallholder farmers face in managing
the quality of their produce in the absence of cool storage, while indicating that quality
issues will be product- and chain-specific. Less perishable products targeted to lower-
quality market segments in relatively short chains will be relatively well-placed to cope
with difficult logistics. By contrast, perishable products targeted to higher-quality
market segments in long chains that face strong logistics challenges will find it less
easy to maintain the quality of the product and preserve its value on its journey from
the producer to the market (Martin and Jagadish, 2006:11-12).

Transportation of Fresh Produce to Distant Markets

Individuals and businesses associated with the fresh produce supply chain utilize
various modes of transport to move their produce to their clients. At times, the players
undertake complex marketing routes to get their produce to their clients. The finding of
an ACIAR research acknowledges the fragmented nature of the supply chain and notes
that fresh produce was largely transported by farmers or small-scale middlemen from
the highlands down to coastal markets. The produce is often poorly packed and
transported in a public motor vehicle (PMV) or on the back of an open truck. It was
frequently damaged by rough handling or high temperatures (Spriggs et al. 2013:11).

A recent analysis (Bonney et al. 2012) indicates that there are a total of eight trucking
companies moving cargo along the Highlands Highway, though these trucking
companies are dedicated to the resource projects. Most of these trucking companies
have a policy of not carrying smallholder consignments because premature harvesting



                                                                                                  86
and poor packaging and handling techniques mean that wastage of vegetables may be
high and transporters will not accept liability. Those that are involved in transport do
so on a ‘no liability’ basis. There is a significant potential for back‐ loading fresh
produce from the Highlands to Lae, but because it is regarded as highly problematic
and transporters want a quick turn‐ around for resource project work, companies are
reluctant to become involved. However, some drivers unofficially become involved in
back‐ loading on the return journeys to Lae, but this is discouraged by companies.

Many smaller collectors and adventurous farmers transport their vegetables via
unofficial backloads in dry containers returning to Lae or in the many varieties of PMVs.
Costs from Mt Hagen to Lae vary, but are around PGK20‐30 per seat and cargo is
charged the same as it occupies a seat (Bonney et al. 2012).

Air Niugini operates three dedicated, non‐refrigerated freight flights per week out of
Mt Hagen (Monday‐Wednesday‐Friday) for transporting perishable produce to POM.
The total weekly shipment is between 10‐12 tonnes and there are currently about four
regular users of the service. Air Niugini apparently plans to upgrade the service in the
near future to the Series 400 with the higher payload, which could increase potential
weekly capacity to 25 tonnes. The standard freight charge is PGK5.45/Kg but volume
discounting brings the price down to just under PGK3/Kg with signed volume
agreements. Air Niugini prefers consignments in stackable boxes. The airline has a
small shed area for storage, which is not designed for perishables, so produce shippers
have to synchronize their transport with aircraft arrivals. However, because planes are
sometimes late or even cancelled, there is a need for a dedicated cool/refrigerated
storage facility close to the Mt Hagen airport.

Goroka does not have a scheduled freight service but planes are available for charter
on demand. Despite the lack of a dedicated freight service, there are vegetables flown
out of Goroka on passenger flights as luggage. However, the Goroka runway is too
short for larger aircraft and, since it is within the town boundaries, extension of both
the runway and other facilities such as a dedicated fresh produce staging facility are
problematic.

Lae Port is the ‘export’ port for PNG, the main point of access for resource development
projects in the northern half of the country and re‐packing trans-shipment for the SW
Pacific islands. Consequently, throughput has grown rapidly and is estimated to grow
at 30% per annum for the next five years (Bonney et al. 2012). According to Bonney et
al, major developments are in the pipeline for both the Lae and Port Moresby ports.
These developments should assist in the movement of fresh produce.

Lack of data restricts an accurate assessment of the volumes of fresh produce shipped
from the Highlands, via Lae, to Port Moresby. However, Bonney et al. (2012) indicate
that Bismarck Maritime and Consort Express Lines Ltd each run twice weekly, fixed
cross‐over services capable of carrying 220 containers including about 40 x 20 foot
‘reefer’ or refrigerated containers. The total time it takes to send a shipment of fresh
produce from Lae to Port Moresby is currently estimated to be between 5-8 days
(Bonney et al. 2012). In the absence of any refrigeration or cool chain system while in
transit, one can easily imagine the state of the produce once it arrives at the designated

markets in Port Moresby.

Relationships and Information Flows

The supply relationships for fresh produce in PNG are complex. As stated by Bonney
et al. (2012), just about every combination of relationship that can be imagined exists
somewhere. However, the relationships established to create value cannot be sustained
because the fresh produce market is characterized by a high level of fluidity and
volatility. The relationships involved are transactional, short-term, with price-based
incentives and no trust, commitment or coordination of supply. Bonney et al. further
highlight that all parties regularly engage in opportunistic, exploitative behavior, that
invites reciprocally and mutually reinforcing negative behavior. This behavior in the
marketplace discourages smallholders to improve consistency of supply or the quality
of their vegetables to markets outside their local area. Conventional practices
demonstrate that value is created through developing, maintaining and utilizing various
relationships along the supply chain. However, in the PNG fresh produce sector, value
creation through relationships is limited because there are very few contractual
relationships and relationship‐based alliances. As analyzed by Bonney et al. (2012),

directly or indirectly, should take
necessary steps to ensure that

turn up with their produce at the doorsteps of a supermarket/hotel, hoping to sell their
produce, only to be told that they already have sufficient stock or they refuse to buy
due to poor quality. The Purchasing Supervisor of a major supermarket in Lae, during
a recent interview (held on 21 January 2014), confirmed that farmers were turned away
after they brought their produce to the doorstep of the supermarket because they could
not buy the produce for reasons such as poor quality.

consistency in supply is a major issue
among the farmers in PNG. Rebecca None of the Fresh Produce Development Agency
indicated during a farmers meeting (held on 24 January 2014) in Goroka that farmers
continue to complain about lack of markets for fresh produce, however, the main
problem among farmers is lack of consistent supply to the market(s). To ensure
consistent supply of produce, there must be regular communication between farmers
and suppliers of agricultural inputs. An aggregator of fresh produce in Mount Hagen
indicated that farmers cannot source the seeds that they need on a timely basis.

Communication is also poor between transporters (shipping companies and airlines),
smallholder farmers, and middlemen or wholesalers. Shipping companies do not know
the requirements of a smallholder farmer in terms of how much space he/she requires,
when the produce is expected to arrive at the port, and what type of container is required.
Smallholder farmers arrive at the front gates of Consort Shipping and Bismarck
Shipping with their produce. It takes a day or two before the produce is loaded onto a
container, usually a dry container. In an interview (on the 22 January 2014) with the
Lae Operations Manager at Consort Shipping, it was confirmed that there is lack of
communication between the shipping company and smallholder farmers. Lack of
communication between the airline companies and the users of freight service on
updates on flight delays or cancelled flights contributes greatly to the post harvest losses
of fresh produce.

Systemic Issues

Businesses and individuals along the fresh produce supply chain cannot prosper in the
absence of reliable infrastructure such as roads, bridges, airstrips, and cool chains.


                                                                                           89
Smallholder farmers cannot engage meaningfully in business if they cannot access the
market. Furthermore, the requirements of a buyer cannot be fully satisfied by a supplier
of fresh produce due to lack of supporting infrastructure such as cool storage facilities.

Wholesalers, aggregators, farmers, retailers, transport and shipping companies
consulted during the field visits indicated that the cost of doing business was high due
to poor infrastructure. The Operations Manager of Consort Shipping in Lae, for
example, indicated during a recent interview in January 2014 that it costs as much to
truck a container 5km in the Lae area as it does to send a container 50km in Australia.
Past studies (Martin and Jagadish 2006) also acknowledged the poor condition of the
roads and have highlighted the consequences of these conditions for supply chain
efficiency - increased wear-and-tear on vehicles and delays in getting product to
market.

Insecurity along the Highlands Highway is also hindering operations for many
businesses and individuals along the fresh produce supply chain. As highlighted by the
Operations Manager of Consort Shipping in Lae, shippers will not send refrigerated
trucks along the Highlands Highway because of poor road conditions and insecurity. It
was also noted during the discussions with the Consort Shipping representatives that
truckers group together in large convoys for security purposes as they move along the
Highlands Highway, which may mean further delays in transporting goods to the port
-- an issue that is especially critical for more perishable fresh produce. Bonney et al.
(2012) confirm that trucking companies are reluctant to use reefer containers on the
Highlands Highway because of the damage caused by the rough road and the high
likelihood of theft.

Martin and Jagadish's analysis of the fresh produce marketing system in PNG also
brought to light key supply chain issues, including systemic problems with logistics
and infrastructure. Specifically, they note that:

       poor logistics and infrastructure creates problems for the marketing of smallholder produce
       from the Highlands. However, the extent to which it does this will be product and chain specific.
       Less perishable products targeted to lower- quality market segments in relatively short chains
       will be better placed to cope with difficult logistics. By contrast, perishable products targeted
       to higher-quality market segments in long chains face much stronger logistics challenges. The
       extent to which logistics poses problems depends on where a product or chain sits between these
       two extremes.
       Poor infrastructure can have two key impacts on supply chains. Firstly, it can reduce the
       effectiveness of a chain; that is, its ability to meet the needs of its customers through the
       provision of product of the required quality and quantity at a specified time. Secondly, it can
       increase costs in the chain, thereby reducing efficiency and returns to all participants along the
       chain. In more extreme situations, where there are no roads, it can even deny smallholders
       market access. ... Transport operators, marketers and farmers all commented on the impact of
       poor roads, which increased wear-and-tear on vehicles and caused delays in getting product to
       market. A shipping operator noted that outdated port infrastructure made it difficult to maintain
       shipping schedules, which can also cause unexpected delays in getting product to market.
       Unreliable airline schedules will have the same impact (Martin and Jagadish, 2006:10-11).
Annex 6         Summary Results of the Stakeholder Workshop
A Stakeholder Workshop was held in Port Moresby on April 15, 2014, to discuss the
findings of the analytical report and to provide an opportunity for people directly
engaged in the three agri-business sectors to articulate their own ideas as to what the
key challenges and priorities are. Participants represented a very diverse array of

interested parties: farmers, exporters, women's organizations, cooperative associations,
policy-makers, researchers, providers of extension and other services, aggregators,
wholesalers, and catering services. The Workshop Agenda is in Attachment 1. The list
of participants is in Attachment 2. The Workshop was facilitated by Deepak Adhikary
(IFC).

A       Summary of Report Findings

The key findings of the analytical report were presented at the outset of the workshop.
To summarize, these were: (i) women are key to quality in all three agribusiness sectors,
albeit in different ways, as women are largely responsible for time-critical and quality-
relevant tasks in production and processing; (ii) labor dynamics affect outcomes in each
of these supply chains, as much labor is allocated for "social" purposes, smallholders
tend not to see their activity as a "business," and labor shortages exist, especially at
critical production/processing times, and are especially apparent when the gender
division of labor is explicitly taken into account; (iii) provision of services, including
inputs, extension, training/capacity-building, and finance, is limited and poorly
targeted, and gender-specific tasks and needs are insufficiently integrated into design
and delivery of services; and (iv) systemic issues persist and to affect performance of
all three supply chains, including poor or non-existent infrastructure, absence of storage
and cold chain facilities, and pervasive insecurity and violence, including domestic
violence, which disproportionately affect women and their ability to operate along these
supply chains.

B       Summary of Group Discussions

Stakeholders formed four groups, one for each of the three sectors and one covering
broader cross-cutting issues, to discuss these findings in more detail, to outline the main
causes and effects of the issues identified, and to indicate key solutions and responses
to these issues, based on their own experience and perceptions of the main challenges
and priorities in these areas. While many issues affect the performance of these supply
chains, the aim of the Stakeholder Workshop was to focus on identifying gender-
specific issues, where differences between men and women are relevant. Their findings
and proposed responses are summarized below.

Coffee Group

The main issues identified by the group were:

       lack of technical knowledge, especially by women, of key production and
        processing tasks;
       coffee theft (which is a local issue, estimated by some to represent 10-15% of
        production) and insecurity;
       farmers not seeing their work as a business;
       differences in incentives for men and women affecting labor allocation in the
        sector;
       lack of control by women of coffee-related income; labor issues; and land tenure
        conflicts.




                                                                                        91
The key implications of these issues for the sector were identified as affecting the
reputation of PNG coffee (low quality) and as reducing demand for PNG coffee. At the
same time, poor quality coffee (an estimated 85% of PNG coffee is in the lowest [Y]
Grade) contributed to lower incomes earned in the sector. Moreover, the critical work
done by women in the sector is insufficiently appreciated and valued, and the persistent
lack of female extension agents, and the lack of outreach of training to women, further
limits women's potential to contribute effectively to raising both quality and quantity
of coffee produced.

The principal solutions identified by stakeholders included:

      focus training and capacity-building on the key quality-enhancing tasks, with
       particular focus on women's tasks;
      expand the number and reach of female extension agents, including recruiting
       women agents from within communities (as this too contributes to greater
       security of women);
      set up a coffee college to train women extension agents;
      developing a women-friendly coffee curriculum;
      use new and emerging technologies (example: "digital green") to communicate
       knowledge and facilitate access (by women) to training opportunities;
      address coffee theft through measures within communities (where the problem
       lies), including fines and other sanctions for perpetrators and strengthening the
       role of village councils;
      improve incentives for women to allocate their labor to the sector, including
       through direct payment systems (where women are supported in opening bank
       accounts and accessing financial services), and PV training involving
       sensitization of men to women's contribution and to changing cultural norms;
      work with certification agencies (largely beyond PNG) to strengthen attention
       to gender dimensions in verifying "social" or other co-benefits of certification,
       including labor dynamics and greater equity in sharing of benefits;
      shorten the supply chain to the extent possible by maximizing the opportunities
       for women to sell cherry directly to exporters, a measure that would
       simultaneously contribute to greater quality of the final product;
      link the provision of key infrastructure (notably targeting of where roads are
       needed) directly to where the opportunities for direct sale of cherry are greatest;
      explore new models for delivery of quality inputs in a timely and efficient
       manner, through agribusiness-dealer approaches, which would bring retail
       outlets for inputs closer to farmers.

Stakeholders emphasized the importance of cultural and behavioral shifts that need to
occur in the coffee sector, and in farming more generally. They noted that the lack of a
savings culture, the persistence of farming as a subsistence activity, and the absence of
financial literacy, management capacity, as well as persistent patriarchal attitudes
toward women and their contribution to the economy, could all be addressed through
personal viability (PV) training, which has become an integral part of much of the
outreach and extension work undertaken in PNG. It was pointed out that an impact
assessment of PV training should be carried out, before any systematic expansion of
such training were to be undertaken, while noting that it would be important for both
men and women to attend such training together, so as to maximize their access to



                                                                                       92
knowledge and to strengthen spousal communication in these areas. Consideration
should be given to strengthening the savings culture by facilitating women's greater
access to bank accounts and financial services, developing electronic and other payment
systems through which coffee buyers could provide equal (or proportionate) payments
to husbands and wives for the work they do in the sector. Measures of this kind could
in turn contribute to addressing the lack of incentive women currently have to
contribute their labor effectively to coffee, over and above the other (domestic and food
production) tasks for which they are responsible.

Stakeholders considered it equally important to build associated infrastructure, notably
roads and transport services, where there is a need to build the business case for the
benefits that would result from building such infrastructure. While it was critical to
emphasize the need to improve the quality of red cherry that can be sold, it was pointed
out that if there is no road that will enable the farmer to sell her cherry directly to the
exporter (a much more certain way of ending up with better quality coffee than
fermentation and drying by the smallholder), then no amount of improving production
and picking practices will lead to better quality. It was pointed out that women who
sell cherry directly to the exporter earn 33% more than those who do not, which, in
turn, helps to shorten the supply chain considerably, to the benefit of women. This
reflects a more general finding from the workshop, namely that the shorter the supply
chain, the easier it is for women to contribute effectively. Investment in road and
transport infrastructure needs to be undertaken in a manner that is directly aligned with
investment in improved production and processing, if the full benefits of improving the
quality of coffee are to be realized. Workshop participants also argued that
strengthening the business case for coffee, including women's greater involvement as
coffee exporters, was an important avenue to pursue.

Based on the workshop discussions, and the participatory methodology developed by
the workshop facilitator, illustrative problem and objective trees for the coffee sector,
which are intended to underpin greater World Bank Group (WBG) operational
engagement in this, and the other, sectors, are presented in Charts 1-3 below.5

Cocoa Group

The main issues identified by the group were:

       low yields, in part due to CPB;
       low quality, in part due to poor block management, and inadequate processing
        (drying and fermenting) facilities;
       lack of business orientation among farmers (the "farming" vs. "foraging" mind
        set);
       persistent labor constraints, especially in the light of CPB, including different
        incentives facing men and women (as well as youth) in the sector, in view of
        male (household head) control over associated income;

    These problem and objective trees for the coffee sector were prepared by Rahmad Saykib,
    Operations Officer, IFC. The authors of this report gratefully acknowledge this valuable
    contribution to the articulation of key issues in the coffee sector.


                                                                                         93
      weak market access, including through lack of transport, and poor
       understanding of market requirements (quality and quantities needed), leading
       to unreliability of supply; and
      lack of inputs.

The main causes of low yields were cocoa pod borer (CPB), low quality planting
material, inadequate labor input, and poor extension services. Women face multiple
claims on their time, they have lower incentives than men (because they lack control
over resulting income), and they are not targeted for provision of extension and other
services. The key drivers of low quality are poor pre- and post-harvest techniques,
deficient drying and fermenting facilities, and lack of training and participation,
including women's insufficient involvement in decision-making within the household.

The principal solutions identified by the group were:

      raise yields by improving the functioning and economic viability of nurseries
       and bud gardens, while focusing on developing CPB-resistant strains and
       improving the overall quality of plant material;
      focus specifically on developing women's technical skills and capacities to work
       in nurseries and bud gardens, as this is a high-potential area for greater women's
       involvement, where women are perceived as being more "meticulous" and
       therefore in a good position to contribute directly to better quality plant material
       in the sector, while, at the same time, working in nurseries and bud gardens
       could provide a career path for women toward training and employment as
       extension agents in the sector;
      improve quality through better training in production and processing
       techniques, where participants advocated for the establishment of farmer field
       schools in cocoa growing areas: moreover, in cocoa, as in other sectors, the
       emphasis was on whole-family training, and developing the concept of the "lead
       couple" (not "lead farmer") in delivering training;
      tackle the need to change the mind-set, both with respect to business practices
       and gender attitudes, through community sensitization, strengthening the "lead
       couple" model through the farmer field schools; and
      expand skills in the areas of book-keeping, management, financial literacy, and
       personal viability (PV), while focusing on the critical need for cocoa itself to be
       economically viable if it is to be seen as a business.

Changing mind-sets required changing community norms, not just individual
behaviors.

Other points raised by the cocoa group included: the importance of seeing the totality
of farming activities, and not just be limited to cocoa cultivation, as farmers operate in
wider systems that they need to manage (including food and other crops), and cocoa
cultivation needs to fit within these wider farming management systems; it is important
not to tell farmers what to do, but to allow farmers to express their own ideas and needs;
while it is true that coping with CPB requires much more intensive management,
including 2 -3 times as much labor inputs, this is for a limited time, and, once CPB is
under control, a more normal pattern of labor allocation can be resumed. It was argued
that extension should not be a matter of "visiting" farmers, but of staying with them,
and mentoring them as they seek to improve production and incomes.


                                                                                        94
Fresh Produce Group

The main issues raised by the fresh produce group were:

      low farm level productivity;
      high post-harvest losses, in large part because of the absence of cool chain and
       adequate storage facilities;
      limited access to good seeds and inputs;
      poor handling, including lack of appropriate packaging materials;
      lack of credit and financial services;
      poor irrigation;
      lack of transport infrastructure, including lack of transport opportunities
       specifically geared to the transport of fresh produce, and associated issues of
       accessibility, affordability, and reliability of transport services; and
      weak market linkages, including poor information flows along the supply
       chains, leading to high losses, poor coordination with transport services,
       inconsistency in quality and quantity, poor or non-existent relationships
       between producers and buyers (supermarkets and others).

Other issues raised included socio-cultural factors where men are the decision-makers
in matters relating to income and expenses, and lack of appropriate knowledge and
skills in post-harvest management. As in other sectors, the lack of female extension
agents, coupled with male reluctance to women traveling or being absent for training,
mean that outreach to, and skill-building of, women is very limited. Moreover, lack of
access to finance, and insufficient knowledge of financial issues, further limits women's
capacity to develop or grow their farming in the sector. The potential of the fresh
produce sector, including as a source of exports to other countries in the region, was
emphasized by the group.

The principal solutions outlined by the fresh produce group were:

      establish seed production, storage, and distribution facilities, in key provincial
       and regional centers, enabling NARI, FPDA, and others to produce seeds
       locally, to buy seeds in bulk, and to distribute to farmers at all district and LLG
       levels;
      establish cool storage facilities at key provincial and central locations, which
       would be managed by a private sector company, and which would provide
       appropriate support services to farmers;
      enable the private sector entity responsible for managing the cool storage
       facilities to provide all fresh produce transportation requirements to farmers,
       thus enabling farmers, especially women, to sell their produce at the farmgate,
       which has the added advantage of shortening the supply chain, from the farmer's
       perspective, considerably: this entity would coordinate all transportation needs,
       including land, air, and sea transportation, and ensure distribution of fresh
       produce to buyers and markets;
      facilitate marketing through the transport/cold storage private company, so that
       (women) farmers can concentrate on production tasks;




                                                                                       95
      target training and extension to women farmers, along the lines of what was
       discussed for other sectors, including expanding the number and reach of female
       extension agents;
      tackle socio-cultural barriers through PV training, and "whole family"
       approaches, where husbands and wives participate jointly in training and
       sensitization activities: this training would include capacity-building in business
       skills, financial literacy and management;
      enable women to open their own bank accounts and to receive payment from
       buyers (the cool chain/transport/marketing company) directly, along the lines
       of what is the current practice, mentioned during group discussions, of CPL.

Some participants expressed concern that opening bank accounts separately for women
might also provoke more "family and sexual violence" (FSV), not less conflict, and it
was noted that efforts in this area require continuous supervision and monitoring, and
that support to men and women is required to facilitate these processes. The role of
women aggregators in the fresh produce sector, some of whom were present at the
workshop, was recognized as a pioneering change, which gave both men and women
to see the value of the contribution women can make to improved performance in this
sector.

Cross-Cutting Issues Group

The main issues raised by this group were:

      poor public finance management and expenditure prioritization, with
       insufficient attention given to transport infrastructure development and
       maintenance;
      lack of accountability;
      socio-cultural issues, including land rights and conflict over land;
      prevailing beliefs and negative attitudes toward women;
      pervasive insecurity and violence affecting communities, and especially
       women, throughout PNG;
      lack of information and key services, both in the agribusiness supply chains and
       elsewhere.

The impacts of these cross-cutting issues are felt throughout these supply chains:

      poor access to markets;
      high production and transportation costs;
      law and order issues;
      insufficient health and education services, leading to lower literacy and skill
       levels and generally poor health outcomes;
      inconsistent and poor quality produce, notably in the fresh produce sector,
       including high levels of waste, owing in part to lack of high-value market
       facilities, such as cool chain and storage, in turn leading to lower value products
       in markets and diminution of PNG's reputation in regional and global markets;
      lack of business development facilities, including gender bias in extension
       services, inappropriate training and skill development, and limited outreach;



                                                                                       96
      poor communications and information services throughout the supply chains,
       leading to insufficient knowledge of market dynamics and requirements, poor
       coordination with transport and other services, leading in turn to lower
       productivity and persistence of subsistence-focused, as opposed to business-
       oriented, farming.

The principal solutions identified by the group were:

      strengthen both the reach and content of training, focusing on personal viability
       (PV) training, involving both men and women, and facilitating broader "family
       business planning;"
      tackle insecurity and violence, with particular focus on ensuring that
       communities and local-level government agencies take ownership of this issue,
       and implement locally-appropriate solutions, including strengthening village
       courts, building community level government (LLC), and providing sufficient
       manpower and resources (policing) commensurate with the need in the
       communities concerned;
      develop new models of land use combining both food and cash crop activities,
       and which look at the whole farming system, not just crop-specific issues;
      mobilize communications technology and other information services (phone
       services, internet) to facilitate electronic banking services and access to finance,
       to improve information flows (market conditions, prices, transport schedules)
       along these supply chains, and to build the knowledge, skills, and capacities of
       farmers, with focus on " whole family" and PV training;
      improve market infrastructure and access, especially in fresh produce markets
       throughout the country, working in partnership with key activities, such as the
       UN Safe Cities initiative: key measures to consider include provision of banking
       and financial access services within market spaces; providing toilet and other
       facilities for women inside markets; substantially strengthening market security
       through adequate policing and provision of security services; facilitating greater
       women's participation in market management, oversight and decision-making;
      generate and use new data and baselines on production, processing, and
       marketing in all three sectors, including farmer profiling, to provide a basis for
       making the business case for, and to help to prioritize, investment in key
       supporting infrastructure in these sectors, including transport, cold chain, and
       storage facilities.

Other ideas mentioned by this group included use of freight subsidies to support
transportation of product to market, though opinions differ as to the usefulness and
feasibility of this kind of measure; strengthening accountability of public and private
service providers through report cards, community engagement, social audits, and
improving district- and local-level planning processes. Tackling socio-cultural issues
would require social mapping of communities, greater engagement with men, stronger
focus on the family (and not the individual) as the center of attention, as with the "lead
couple" model proposed by the cocoa sector, and focusing especially on training and
sensitization of landowners on issues of land use planning at the local/village level.
There is clearly an important need to reach out to PNG's youth, notably to encourage
and enable youth to remain on (or come back to) the land, and to take over farming
responsibilities from the older generation.

C      Summing Up by Tania Lozansky, IFC

Tania Lozansky, Head of Advisory Services for Asia for IFC, was invited to provide
an overall summing up of the workshop. She did so around six key words:

Amazing: the meeting included a very diverse range of stakeholders who were strongly
committed and fully engaged throughout the day, which is very rare.

Daunting: it is easy to feel that the challenges and issues raised are complex and
overwhelming, and that things cannot change, but ...

Inspiring: the stories people have told during the day show that people are always
trying new things and that there's always a solution.

Learning: a key lesson of the day is that we must learn from experience and try new
things.

Together: for the World Bank and IFC, which are both engaged in addressing gender
issues in PNG, collaboration enables us to focus on both private and public sector
dimensions, and to identify cross-cutting solutions and new ideas.

Opportunity: PNG's economic potential is enormous: "everything grows in PNG."
Women's empowerment is part of the answer, in the 3 sectors and beyond, though this,
and the broader sectoral issues, all need to be addressed.

Annex 7             Task Terms of Reference
                       THE WORLD BANK GROUP
                         TERMS OF REFERENCE
            GENDER EQUALITY ANALYSIS AND RESPONSE FOR THE
               AGRIBUSINESS SECTOR IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA

        1. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
    The World Bank Group’s mission is to help reduce poverty. This is delivered through a
    combination of investment and advisory services. The World Bank’s Pacific program has
    been scaling up over the past three years, and its catalytic and convening role is in
    increasing demand. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is a member of the World
    Bank Group, and the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the
    private sector in developing countries. IFC pursues its mission of reducing poverty and
    improving people’s lives by providing financing to help businesses employ more people
    and supply essential services, by mobilizing capital from others, and by delivering advisory
    services to ensure sustainable development.

    The World Bank and International Finance Corporation, known together as the World
    Bank Group (WBG) are undertaking a joint program to empower Pacific women. The joint
    WBG Program on Gender Empowerment in the Pacific includes parallel and joint activities
    to help improve equality for women in the Pacific. The objectives of this program are to:
    -   Promote women’s migration to formal sector employment;
    -   Improve women’s access to public services and financial services;
    -   Enhance women’s security and safety, in private and public spaces; and
    -   Increase the number of women in positions of leadership in business and
        society.
    The program is now in its pre-implementation phase and seeks to establish the baseline and
    analytical diagnostics needed to design effective advisory services to enhance gender
    empowerment in the Pacific.

    The World Bank’s World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development
    and its companion report Toward Gender Equality in East Asia and the Pacific emphasizes
    how reducing gender inequalities in economic opportunities can improve economic
    outcomes. The 2013 IFC Jobs Study and the forthcoming IFC WINVEST: Investing in
    Women: The Business Rationale also makes the business case for gender diversity for
    firms, society, and the economy.

    The overall goal of this study is to assist the WBG in achieving greater impact for women
    from its current activities in agribusiness and the associated supply chains in PNG and to
    provide clear recommendations on additional interventions aimed at improving outcomes
    for women in agribusiness supply chains. Agribusiness and related supply chains include
    crop production, agricultural extension services, seed supply, agrichemicals, farm
    machinery, distribution, transport, processing, marketing, and retail sales and food services.
    The study will focus on the supply chains for coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products,6
    with the objective of:
    -   Understanding the constraints and opportunities that these sectors present for
        women’s employment, income, and agency in PNG;

6
        These have been chosen as organized supply chains exist for these three commodities. There is also
        a wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated on the supply chains for these products and on
        gender aspects by the World Bank and the IFC. Working on these products will also provide a
        useful entry point for follow-up activities.

                                                                                                     109
-   Identifying private sector behaviors and practices that contribute to gender
    inequality in economic opportunities and employment these sectors and their
    associated supply chains;
-   Proposing rapid, medium, and long term policy recommendations that can be
    effective in improving women’s employment and economic opportunities, and
    identify opportunities for additional gender audits that can be conducted in
    private sector companies in PNG; and
-   Proposing methods/interventions to ensure that women’s employment and
    economic opportunities contributes to their improved safety.

    2. CURRENT AGRIBUSINESS INTERVENTIONS OF THE WORLD
       BANK GROUP IN PNG
The World Bank’s Productive Partnerships in Agriculture Project (PPAP) for Papua New
Guinea aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholder cocoa and coffee producers through
the improvement of the performance and the sustainability of value chains in cocoa-and
coffee-producing areas. There are three components to the project.
     The first component is institutional strengthening and industry coordination. The
        objective of this component is to improve the performance of sector institutions
        and to enhance industry coordination in the coffee and cocoa sectors. Existing
        stakeholder platforms for industry coordination will be consolidated to address
        short- and long-term issues such as sector governance, skills development in the
        industry, improvement in extension services, industry strategy on threats to quality
        and quality promotion, information within the industry, market development and
        crop diversification.
     The second is productive partnerships. The objective of this component is to
        increase the integration of smallholder producers in performing and remunerative
        value chains by developing and implementing productive alliances between
        smallholders and the private sector aiming at improving market linkages in the
        project areas.
     The third is market access infrastructure. The objective of this component is to
        improve market access for smallholder cocoa and coffee growers in the areas
        targeted in the project.

To date, 25 partnerships (between smallholder farmers and lead partners including
exporters, processors, knowledge, and service providers) have been approved and about
18,000 farmers are directly benefiting from the project in six provinces of PNG.
The International Finance Corporation aims to provide Investment and Advisory Services
in the Agribusiness Sector in PNG. Taking an investment led approach, IFCs
Agribusiness-PNG project aims to enable 4,500 lead firm-linked coffee and cocoa farmers,
including 1485 women farmers, to graduate into more productive and sustainable
enterprises through the adoption of better farming practices, application of higher quality
inputs, such as seed and tools, as well as increased use of market information in managing
farm operations.

An important part of this project will be working directly with investment clients to pilot
gender equality-based training and incentivizing women’s engagement along their supply
chain with the aim of increasing the productivity of small holder farms through improved
production practices of female farmers
IFC is also scaling up its investment activities in agribusiness-related supply chain and
downstream activities with a strong pipeline of potential investments in the coffee, cocoa,
fresh produce and poultry sectors.




                                                                                          110
   3. SCOPE OF WORK
This work requires a three-pronged approach:
    1. Gender equality analysis of agribusiness and related supply chains in PNG
    related to coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products, with proposals for rapid
    response interventions;
    2. Gender equality program design workshop to discuss the findings and
    proposed rapid response interventions with various stakeholders; and
    3. A report outlining recommendations for medium- and long-term
    interventions to effect reform.
    
 1. Gender equality analysis and rapid response interventions
The analysis will identify the opportunities and challenges for enhancing the contribution
of women and increasing their access to income and employment along different segments
of the supply chain for coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products in PNG.

a.   It is important to undertake a literature and documentary review on gender
     aspects in the supply chains for coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products,
     leveraging existing research to draw together the relevant information relating
     to:
-    Education and training;
-    Customary land tenure;
-    Participation in extension services;
-    Access to finance, property/collateral;
-    Access to resources (e.g., water/energy/telecommunications/equipment/seeds);
-    Access to services (health and education);
-    Access to grants/incentives/services/innovative technology (government,
     NGOs);
-    Involvement in representative bodies (private, cooperatives, public);
-    Private sector behaviors and practices in employment, with suppliers, and with
     customers;
-    Infrastructure, transport and logistics;
-    Certification schemes and lead buyer relevant commitment and policies,
     particularly in coffee and cocoa; and
-    Caregiving commitments.

b. The Consultant should analyze:
- What is the role of women in the coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products’
    supply chains? What is their income and from which crops do women derive
    more income?
- What is the degree of control over their income?
- How do they expend their income?
- For which of the identified crops do women provide the majority of labor
    inputs?
- What are the potential incentives to increasing women’s integration into their
    supply chains?
- Once women’s roles in the supply chain are mapped, key informant and focus
    group discussions could help identify opportunities and challenges.

c.   The Consultant should also explore how gender equality issues arising from
     major legislative barriers, cultural considerations, patrilineal customary land

                                                                                        111
    tenure and access to finance undermine agribusiness sub-sectors and supply
    chains’ access to skills through poor recruitment, retention and attendance;
    limit productivity, create workplace tension, undermine worker-management
    relations and reduce innovation in agribusiness; negatively affect relations
    between agribusinesses and local communities; and reduce market access and
    sales for processors, retailers and service companies.

d. The Consultant should identify any underlying social constraints which may
   impede women’s access to employment or income. For example, does the
   security situation restrict free movement or women and hence limit their
   participation in certain segments of the supply chain? Possible impacts could
   include, among other things, gender and sexual based violence, reduced voice
   and agency and limited safety in public places, such as markets. Once
   identified, harms should be assessed as to their impact on agribusiness growth
   and job creation for women, and the expected impacts if these types of social
   constraints were removed.
Rapid response interventions: While undertaking this work, the Consultant should
identify and suggest rapid response interventions that can help to increase women’s
involvement or remove/reduce constraints and social threats. Interventions could include
awareness workshops, facilitating linkages, presenting recommended policy changes to
public and private sector stakeholders, such as major retailers, processing/commodity
firms, education/training etc. Rapid response interventions should be coordinated with the
IFC gender specialists conducting the gender audits and related actions. These
interventions would be discussed at the workshop (see point 3) and should be such that
they could be taken forward either as part of existing WBG projects or as a complement to
these projects. Further opportunities for gender audits of private sector companies should
also be identified so that the rapid response interventions can be coordinated with the IFC
gender specialists conducting the gender audits and related actions in PNG.

  2. Joint gender equality program design workshop
Based on the work undertaken in point 1. above, the Consultant will contribute to
facilitating a World Bank Group program design workshop prior to finalizing the report by
acting as a resource person. The workshop will provide a platform to discuss the findings,
especially the proposed rapid response interventions that have been identified by the
consultancy team.
  3. Report with medium- to long-term recommendations
The Consultant will analyze the supply chains in coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products
in PNG, by role, income, and control over income. How can women’s involvement be
increased at each step? What are the opportunities and the kinds of constraints that need to
be removed in order to affect this?

The Consultant should consolidate the findings from the various data sources and the
above-mentioned activities and develop a final report with a set of medium- to long-term
recommendations; these may also consist of follow-up activities to the rapid response
interventions that will have been identified. The report should identify key performance
indicators to track progress towards gender equality and women's economic empowerment
in PNG. It should recommend areas where further work by the WBG or other organizations
might be considered. In addition, the Consultant should prepare a one page brief that
provides a succinct summary of main findings and the actions that are needed, and prepare
an Op-Ed for media distribution. The findings of this work will help to position the World
Bank Group to undertake key strategic interventions in order to enable increased female


                                                                                         112
participation in the coffee, cocoa, and horticultural products supply chains in PNG. They
would also be used for advocacy purposes.

  4. DELIVERABLES/SPECIFIC OUTPUTS EXPECTED FROM
     CONSULTANT
The overall assignment is expected to last 80 working days with the possibility of extension
for 10 days subject to approval from the Project Leader. The specific breakdown of
deliverables (per days) will be discussed with the Project Leader.
       In consultation with WBG project/country teams, global specialists, and
        results measurement team, the Consultant will be responsible for the outputs
        outlined in Section C. above.
       As part of this process, the Consultant will need to should undertake desk
        and field research, and utilize existing literature and various resources
        supplied in meetings with small holders, provincial women’s groups,
        businesses (management, HR, operational and production line staff),
        commodity traders, and key stakeholders in the agribusiness supply chain,
        government agencies and civil society organizations and donors.

In terms of desk/field work, the Consultant should:
       Gather primary/secondary data and sources relating to policies, constraints,
        opportunities etc. The bulk of the work regarding identifying opportunities
        and constraints would need to be done in the six provinces where the PPAP
        is active and additional provinces where IFC is active
       Identify appropriate women and women’s representatives in various layers
        of the supply chain with whom to conduct interviews/focus group
        discussions in order to establish functions and roles of women, the positive
        opportunities the sector presents, and perceived constraints to greater input
        and meaningful involvement of women. This might include women
        employees within both large and small commercial companies, cooperative
        members, or as landowners who might be leasing their land to large
        commercial companies or may be growing produce on small land holdings
        to sell on contract to larger commercial companies/exporters.
       Interview men among the different categories of workers, landowners, and
        growers in order to capture the perspective of both genders.

Schedule of Deliverables:
