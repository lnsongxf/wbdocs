                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Context
1.	 Ukraine is currently experiencing a period of instability and insecurity. Large-scale
    demonstrations in Kyiv in late 2013 led to a change in government in February 2014. Early
    presidential elections were held in May 2014 and early Parliamentary elections in November
    2014. Following the developments in Crimea, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution
    68/262 on 27 March 2014 which states that it:

     “[...] 5.  Underscores that the referendum held in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the
     city of Sevastopol on 16 March 2014, having no validity, cannot form the basis for any altera-
     tion of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol;

     Calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize
     any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol
     on the basis of the above-mentioned referendum and to refrain from any action or dealing
     that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status.”2

     In the spring of 2014, conflict erupted in the eastern oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk—known
     as the Donbas—where pro-Russian separatists took control over parts of the two oblasts.
     Despite the existence of a peace agreement (the Minsk Protocol of September 2014) and the
     renewal of its cease-fire provisions in February 2015, the likely outcome of this conflict re-
     mains uncertain.

2.	 The conflict has had a significant and detrimental impact on human welfare, and on
    social and economic conditions generally. Of some 5.2 million people in the Donbas, at
    least 3.9 million have been directly affected by the conflict. In addition, the three adjoining
    oblasts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv have been particularly affected by eco-
    nomic disruption and a heavy influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs). As of late Febru-
    ary there were a reported 7,000 deaths (including military personnel), some 18,000 wound-
    ed, and more than 1.6 million people displaced both internally and outside of Ukraine. Prior
    to the conflict, the Donbas region had already faced significant long-term challenges related
    to poverty, demography, and its economic structure. Many of the country’s key heavy indus-
    tries that are located in the Donbas have experienced long-standing decline and have been
    further damaged by the conflict and trade disputes. The situation is likely to be compounded
    by the significant loss of services, shelter, and livelihoods associated with the conflict, which
    poses even more acute risks for the population’s well-being. The conflict has also significantly
    deteriorated levels of social cohesion, trust, and cooperation throughout the country, which
    were already eroded from years of divergent and politically charged narratives about history,
    language, and patriotism.



2  On March 27, 2014, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262 stating that the referenda had “no validity” and “can-
not form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol” (see http://www.
un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/262). 




                                                                                                                           Volume I:
                                                                 3                                                 SYNTHESIS REPORT
3.	 The Government of Ukraine (GoU) and its partners recognize the need to urgently ad-
    dress reconstruction, economic recovery, and peacebuilding needs in areas affected
    both directly and indirectly by the conflict. In mid-2014, the government requested tech-
    nical assistance and financial support from the international community to assess and plan
    priority recovery and peacebuilding efforts in the conflict-affected regions of eastern Ukraine.
    Following a joint EU, UN, and WBG scoping mission to Ukraine that took place between Sep-
    tember 29 and October 3, 2014, the three institutions agreed to organize an assessment of
    recovery and peacebuilding needs. The Eastern Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assess-
    ment (RPA) was launched in October 2014 as a two-stage process. In view of the continuing
    conflict, it was decided to undertake an initial rapid assessment, covering areas under gov-
    ernment control that would provide an analytical and programmatic baseline for recovery ef-
    forts, identify urgent interventions, and provide a basis for scaling up the responses as needs
    evolve on the ground. As such, these findings should be considered as a snapshot in time. In
    particular, the assessment of infrastructure damage is limited to the damage that occurred
    prior to November 2014. Furthermore, the number of registered IDPs—used as a reference
    to estimate their needs—corresponds to official government estimates as of February 2015.

4.	 The RPA is therefore an assessment undertaken in a context of ongoing crisis. The con-
    flict could escalate and expand, become “frozen,” or be settled through diplomacy. The first
    two scenarios would aggravate the distress of people in eastern Ukraine, and likely lead to
    additional waves of displacement. Moreover, failure to address the severe human welfare and
    development concerns will very likely worsen the conflict. This would have serious implica-
    tions, including increasing vulnerability and eroding confidence in the state. As social cohesion
    continues to deteriorate and worsening socioeconomic conditions cause further tensions, it
    is essential that key high-priority recommendations be initiated as soon as possible, irrespec-
    tive of the cessation or continuation of armed conflict. Doing so will also lay the foundation to
    effectively implement other aspects of recovery, such as rehabilitating infrastructure, restor-
    ing social services, and revitalizing economic activity. Without reconciliation—between dif-
    ferent members of the community, between different communities, and between citizens and
    authorities—lasting peace and recovery are unlikely to be achieved.

5.	 The RPA looks beyond immediate humanitarian needs to assess the conflict’s impact
    and identify key priorities for recovery and building peace. In light of the ongoing crisis,
    the RPA focuses on improving human welfare, particularly of the displaced and their host
    communities, and avoiding the further exacerbation of conflict drivers. Geographically, the
    RPA focuses on conflict-affected areas under government control in Donetsk and Luhansk,
    as well as the three adjoining oblasts of Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and Kharkiv. Certain
    supportive national-level initiatives are also recommended. The report’s recommendations
    provide an initial framework for initiatives that focus on short- to medium-term results. This
    framework will also help the government and the international community to update, pri-
    oritize, and sequence recovery interventions on a regular basis as the situation evolves. Fur-
    thermore, the recommendations provide positive precedents for future reforms in the areas
    of economic policy, governance, and social services. The first phase of the RPA will lay the
    groundwork for a second phase that supports the development of a longer-term and compre-
    hensive recovery and peacebuilding strategy, when conditions allow.

6.	 Phase 1 of the RPA report (which is presented in two volumes) is anchored in three
    major thematic components: (i) restoring critical infrastructure and services; (ii) improv-
    ing economic livelihoods; and (iii) strengthening social resilience and initiating reconcilia-

     tion and peacebuilding. Volume I provides an overview of the results of the assessment, key
     findings, and recommended interventions over a two-year period, in the form of a synthesis
     report. Volume II provides the detailed assessment reports for each of the three components.

7.	 The RPA’s three thematic components have been designed to be mutually complemen-
    tary and strategically synchronous. For example, the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
    damaged infrastructure in Component 1 will provide opportunities to introduce labor-in-
    tensive construction technologies. This links with the recommendation in Component 2 to
    jump-start local employment by reconstructing district and community infrastructure. The
    RPA also provides concrete activities for host communities and IDPs to collaborate in meeting
    urgent needs, which helps break down prejudice and builds trust (Component 3). Similarly,
    key transversal issues—internal displacement, local governance and implementation capac-
    ity, gender, and human rights—are integrated across components. Criteria are suggested to
    support the prioritization of those recommendations that require immediate attention, either
    because of their urgency or because of their critical importance as foundations for recovery
    and peacebuilding. The report strongly recommends that, as much as possible, responsibility
    for the design and implementation of activities be delegated downward to subnational levels
    and involve all major stakeholders at the local level.

Main Findings
8.	 Initial estimates of recovery, reconstruction, and peacebuilding financing needs total
    some US$1.52 billion,3 as outlined below.

9.	 Total recovery needs for the infrastructure and social services component are estimat-
    ed at US$ 1.26 billion. The sustainable restoration and improvement of infrastructure and
    social services holds the key to normalizing and stabilizing society in the crisis-affected areas,
    and to creating conditions for IDP return and repatriation. Efficient and effective recovery
    of infrastructure and service delivery will not only ameliorate the affected populations’ suf-
    fering, but will also help restore citizens’ trust in the state. In addition to “brick-and-mortar”
    damage to infrastructure, the loss of equipment, the exodus of employees, and a drop in staff
    skills and capacity in the directly affected regions are other challenges that need to be ad-
    dressed.

10.	 Ensuring satisfactory provision of social services in indirectly affected areas is compli-
     cated by the influx of displaced populations. For example, preschools are fast approaching
     enrollment capacity; the road network is suffering from increased usage; and sewage sys-
     tems need to handle increased loads due to a steady influx of IDPs in various raions. Needs
     are greatest in the transport, health, and energy sectors, at US$558 million, US$184 million,
     and US$79 million respectively. Needs estimates build upon the damages reported to infra-
     structure to additionally: (i) reconstruct impacted infrastructure to improved standards (the
     “building back better and smarter” principle); (ii) restore service delivery to individuals re-
     siding in Donetsk and Luhansk, and replace facilities; and (iii) provide social services to indi-
     viduals displaced as a result of the conflict.

11.	 Total recovery needs for the economic recovery component are estimated at US$135.5
     million. Ukraine’s current trade dispute with Russia, coupled with damage and disruptions
     associated with the conflict, have had significant economic implications for the Donbas. In the
     first 11 months of 2014, exports from Donetsk oblast dropped by almost 30 percent and by
     43 percent from Luhansk oblast, compared to the same period of previous year. During Janu-
     ary–September 2014, metal export to Russia declined by 28 percent compared to a year ear-
     lier, with the share to Russia declining to 10 percent of total metal exports from 14 percent in
     2013. As a consequence of direct and indirect impacts, small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
     decreased their economic activities by 80–90 percent, leading to a similar percentage of jobs
     lost. This situation has resulted in the widespread disruption of economic activity, loss of live-
     lihoods and employment, and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. In this context,
     this report proposes a multi-track approach to economic recovery to reduce the vulnerabil-

    ity of conflict-affected populations and increase societal resilience. This approach consists of
    generating short-term employment opportunities, improving productive capacities and liveli-
    hood options, strengthening local economic planning, stimulating SMEs and the private sec-
    tor, and facilitating provision of financial services. Collaboration between local governments,
    civil society, and the remaining private sector will be essential to address key bottlenecks,
    rebuild the local economy, and restore social trust.

12.	 Total recovery needs for the social resilience, peacebuilding, and community security
     component are estimated at US$126.8 million. The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has
     had a direct and highly negative impact on social cohesion, resilience, livelihoods, community
     security, and the rule of law. Displacement, fear, and diminishing levels of trust are acute social
     problems, and conflict-related distress is widespread. While social fragmentation, prejudices,
     regional divides, and low levels of trust in local authorities and institutions existed prior to the
     crisis, these have been exacerbated as a result of it, particularly in the Donbas region. In many
     ways, the conflict and resulting displacement has magnified Ukraine’s pre-conflict fragility.
     As the numbers and the duration of stay for the displaced increase, pressure mounts on local
     resources, service delivery, livelihoods, and governance. Signs of increasing tensions between
     IDPs and host communities are becoming more evident. Moreover, under conflict conditions,
     law enforcement agencies, security services, and justice institutions are ill equipped to ensure
     respect of rights and rule of law, mitigate disputes and tensions, and address crime and vio-
     lence. Current hostilities, related community-level violence, and misinformation contribute to
     polarization and deepen divisions. Impacts are especially acute in areas with a high percent-
     age of IDPs compared to the host communities. Restoring and strengthening the social fab-
     ric—within the Donbas, as well as nationally—is therefore a critical requirement for effective
     and sustainable recovery. In the absence of reconciliation and peacebuilding, the risk of re-
     newed conflict will remain, which puts investments in infrastructure, services, and economic
     recovery at risk. Priorities in this regard include building trust, strengthening the resilience of
     displaced populations and host communities, better protecting conflict-affected populations,
     and promoting reconciliation, peacebuilding, citizen security, and access to justice.

Institutional Arrangements
13.	 For the RPA to become operational and be effective, the government must take a lead
     role, though it must also broadly engage national stakeholders. Government ownership
     over the RPA process would greatly benefit from rapidly identifying and operationalizing a
     structure that has formal intragovernmental authority and a clear mandate to lead and coor-
     dinate recovery and reconstruction efforts. Given the nature of recovery needs and response
     strategies proposed in the RPA, most interventions will be implemented by government agen-
     cies and local governments, civil society organizations, and the beneficiaries themselves. It is
     therefore proposed that an intragovernmental coordination structure (for example, a Donbas
     Recovery Coordination Committee) be created with both intragovernmental authority and
     broad membership. It will need to have a dual focus on (i) activities in the five eastern oblasts;
     and (ii) national activities. Implementation challenges will be best met through flexible and
     hybrid arrangements, with the intragovernmental authority assuming a policy-setting and
     oversight role. It will be necessary to clarify from the outset the mandates of key actors and
     establish appropriate but flexible mechanisms and processes. It is also essential to create
     space for civil society organizations and the private sector to work effectively with national
     and subnational budget allocations.

14.	 It will be important to establish a process for periodically reviewing the continued rele-
     vance of the RPA’s strategy and initiatives. An RPA progress review should take place every
     six months, with a thorough mid-term review after 12 months. The coordination committee
     should organize the reviews, which need to be inclusive consultative processes in which all
     stakeholders can provide their views and feedback. The coordination committee should es-
     tablish a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) subcommittee. The Strategic Results Framework
     (SRF) presented in the report can serve as an M&E tool. Participatory M&E with the engage-
     ment of the conflict-affected population should be used whenever feasible. Public access to
     M&E outputs will be essential for transparency and credibility.

Financing
15.	 The RPA provides an overview of recovery, reconstruction, and peacebuilding financ-
     ing needs, as well as principles and options regarding both the sources of financing and
     associated instruments. Ensuring adequate, flexible, and rapid financing is a government re-
     sponsibility that will require support from the international community. Some international
     partners have already earmarked funding for eastern Ukraine. The RPA will help to situate
     these commitments by providing a dedicated institutional framework to facilitate alignment
     and linkages among funding sources and enabling national and international stakeholder co-
     ordination.

16.	 A variety of financing instruments can be deployed in support of the RPA’s implementa-
     tion. These will need to be predictable and harmonized, and also aligned with national and
     RPA priorities, the national budget process, and the government’s institutional framework for
     recovery in eastern Ukraine. Options include: (i) budgetary allocations from the government;
     (ii) direct budget support from international partners; (iii) pooling grant financing through a
     Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF); (iv) international loans; (v) support for the financial sector
     in the form of participation in specialized instruments and guarantees; and (vi) mechanisms
     to promote coordination with private sector investments.

In Conclusion
17.	 The situation in eastern Ukraine is still evolving, with ongoing military operations and
     uncertain prospects for a lasting ceasefire. Nevertheless, it is urgent to formulate a re-
     sponse and provide feasible elements of support in an integrated, fast, and flexible manner.
     Addressing priority recovery, reconstruction, and peacebuilding needs in the short term will
     require leadership and substantial commitments on the part of the GoU, along with support
     from the international community. The response should be tailored to specific needs yet also
     cognizant of the severe constraints posed by the ongoing conflict. Beyond the analytical and
     programmatic framework provided by the report, this will necessitate specialized institu-
     tional arrangements for prioritizing interventions, flexibly aligning financing and ensuring
     rapid disbursement, and identifying appropriate implementation capacities to achieve rapid
     results.




Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine   8
                                         Chapter I
                        RATIONALE AND SCOPE

1.0	 Introduction
1.1	 In mid-2014, the GoU requested technical assistance and financial support from the inter-
national community to assess and plan priority recovery and peacebuilding efforts in the conflict-
affected regions of eastern Ukraine. Following these requests, and within the framework of the
2008 Joint Declaration on Post-Crisis Assessments and Recovery Planning, the EU, UN, and WBG
agreed to support the government in undertaking a Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
(RPA).

1.2	 This assessment follows the Post-Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA) methodology. In view
of the continuing conflict in eastern Ukraine, it was decided to undertake an initial rapid assess-
ment as a first phase of activity, which would provide an analytical and programmatic baseline for
recovery efforts to inform urgent interventions and provide a basis for scaling up recovery plan-
ning and responses as the situation and needs evolve on the ground.

1.3	 This report summarizes the findings and recommendations of the first phase of the RPA,
which was undertaken in the period November 2014 to February 2015. In light of the dynamic
and fluid nature of the situation in eastern Ukraine, these findings should be considered as a
snapshot in time. In particular, the assessment of infrastructure damage is limited to the damage
that occurred on or before November 2014. Furthermore, the number of registered internally
displaced persons (IDPs), utilized as a reference to estimate the needs of this affected population,
corresponds to the official government estimates as of February 2015.

2.0	 RPA Goal and Vision
2.1	 The goal of the first phase of the RPA is to produce a pragmatic and coherent set of recom-
mendations on urgent priorities related to restoring critical infrastructure and services, improv-
ing economic livelihoods, and strengthening social resilience and peacebuilding. It is expected
that these recommendations will help inform the efforts of the government, its international
partners, and other national stakeholders in improving human welfare and stabilizing social and
economic conditions in conflict-affected areas under government control, while efforts continue
to reach a definitive resolution of the Donbas crisis. In so doing, the recommendations of the RPA
are intended as a contribution to, and an integral part of, the broader vision on national recovery
and reform in Ukraine.
2.2	 Although the conflict in the Donbas region has not yet ended, its impact in the Luhansk and
Donestk oblasts, as well as in surrounding areas in Ukraine, has been significant and requires an
urgent response from both the humanitarian and development communities. In addition to the
significant loss of human life, physical and human capital have been decimated by the fighting,
which has also resulted in large-scale population displacement. Economic output and employ-
ment in Donbas has also declined dramatically due to widespread insecurity, violence, and the
disruption of economic activity, and banks face worsening balance sheets, loss of access to collat-
eral, severe liquidity strain, and soaring risks. While these are problems banks face countrywide,



                                                                                               Volume I:
                                                 9                                     SYNTHESIS REPORT
they are all the more severe in Donbas, where lending has essentially halted as a result of the
conflict. There is a clear and urgent need to stabilize the conflict-affected areas under government
control and outside the zone of active conflict, and to improve the welfare of the millions who cur-
rently live amid heightened vulnerability and deteriorating living conditions.
2.3	 The conflict in 2014 began at a time when the economy of Donbas was already in decline
due to long-standing systemic inefficiencies and institutional deficiencies. While reviving eco-
nomic activity and restoring infrastructure is critical to improving the welfare and livelihoods of
the population, a return to the status quo ante is unlikely to be sustainable. Rather than restoring
productive sectors that had been kept afloat through subsidies in the past, economic recovery
and the reconstruction of infrastructure should be underpinned by a new vision for the region’s
economic transformation and development.
2.4	 “Rebuilding better and smarter” in Donbas and nationwide should provide an opportunity
to improve the state’s relationship with society. Participatory, effective, equitable, and stable gov-
ernance is essential for restoring the deeply eroded state–society compact. Social cohesion needs
to be strengthened, divisive narratives counteracted, and deep economic and social problems ad-
dressed. Confident local leadership will infuse transparency in economic and political decision
making, and strengthen its accountability to the population by creating space for continuous citi-
zen participation to influence decisions.
2.5	 The relationship between central and local governments, and their interaction with eco-
nomic actors, also requires review. It will be necessary to further clarify the division of tasks for
various levels of government, and match them with commensurate resources to avoid unfunded
mandates and promote timely and efficient recovery processes. An improved budgetary frame-
work would allow external financial support to flow through government systems to a greater
extent, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Public service delivery could also improve sub-
stantially if local governments, private businesses, and civil society function with fewer formal
constraints, and engage each other more flexibly and effectively.
2.6	 In order to do so, several challenges need to be addressed. First, the recent influx of IDPs
to government-controlled areas of the East and across the country, and the central government’s
inability thus far to provide adequate financial and personnel support to regional and municipal
governments to meet their needs, pose a major and immediate challenge to the effective provision
of services and support, which in turn is contributing to heightened tensions with host communi-
ties. To address these growing challenges, local administrations have taken emergency initiatives
outside of national-level mechanisms and tried to collaborate horizontally with civic structures
and other local administrations. While this is commendable, it undermines existing formal bud-
getary and administrative processes. In addition, local governments have serious capacity gaps,
with their limited precrisis capacity further reduced by the departure of many government work-
ers and the need to organize the relocation of others from areas outside government control. They
also face an increasing workload owing to rising numbers of IDPs and the resulting demand for
already strained services.
2.7	 While the response at the local level will be all-important, a set of factors exogenous to the
Donbas situation as such will also shape the future of the conflict-affected areas. Key exogenous
factors include restoring peace and citizens’ security, keeping the exchange rate policy flexible
while containing inflation, and implementing sound budgetary and financial measures across all
levels of government. Not all of these factors are under the government’s control, but most de-
pend on national-level policies which, if successful, could strengthen the basic functioning of local
governments in the East and facilitate reconstruction of the social and economic fabric. This in

turn could set the stage for sustainable recovery, peacebuilding, and long-term growth, creating
an environment in which infrastructure reconstruction can be financed in the absence of risk of
renewed conflict and destruction.
2.8	 Restoring infrastructure and social services contributes to alleviating the suffering of
conflict-affected populations and to rebuilding citizens’ trust in the state. The adverse effects of
conflict-inflicted damage are disproportionately borne by poorer households, the displaced, and
other vulnerable and conflict-affected groups. Restoring critical infrastructure and service is thus
essential for societal normalization and stabilizing crisis-affected areas, and for creating the nec-
essary conditions for the return and reintegration of the displaced. This is particularly acute in
sectors such as housing, transportation, and the provision of critical social services (such as pen-
sions).
2.9	 Another prerequisite for effective recovery and reconstruction is the need for strength-
ened community security and social resilience, as well as community-level reconciliation. Cur-
rent challenges include escalating crime and violence, and increasing tensions due to the mas-
sive forced displacement of conflict-affected populations. Displacement raises demand for social
services and housing in host communities, which leads to social tensions between IDPs and host
communities. It also contributes to a further surge in poverty, inequality, and to the depletion of
trust in the state. The elderly, women, children, and the disabled are most vulnerable to the degra-
dation in access to social services, livelihoods, and justice, and institutional care has been greatly
disrupted.
2.10	 The first phase of the RPA provides an initial assessment of these various impacts and as-
sociated priority needs for recovery and peacebuilding. As such, recommendations in the RPA are
intended to provide the basis for an initial framework for recovery efforts that focus on short- to
medium-term results over a two-year period. It is hoped that such a framework will help the gov-
ernment and international community identify, prioritize, and sequence recovery interventions
on a regular basis, and that it will be continuously updated and adjusted in order to reflect recov-
ery needs and priorities as the situation in the East evolves. The recommendations made in the
report should all start within the next 24 months, and most will continue beyond that time frame.
However, the costs presented cover only the initial two years.
2.11	 It is also hoped that the RPA will inform agreements and programs with important devel-
opment partners, notably those flowing from Ukraine’s EU Association Agreement. Ukraine’s dis-
cussions with the IMF on macroeconomic stabilization policies also inform the RPA’s recommen-
dations focused on local government, community-level and microeconomic aspects of recovery,
and the restoration of infrastructure. Finally, the RPA does not focus on immediate humanitarian
needs linked to the crisis, but through its focus on durable solutions, looks beyond the humanitar-
ian Strategic Response Plan (SRP) presented by the UN to the international community.

3.0	 Overview of the RPA Process
Background
3.1	 The RPA process for Ukraine was initiated in September 2014, following requests from the
GoU for support on the assessment of recovery needs and priorities in the Donbas region. Follow-
ing a joint EU, UN, and WBG scoping mission to Ukraine that took place between September 29
and October 3, 2014, the three institutions agreed to organize a two-phase assessment of recov-
ery and peacebuilding needs in the conflict-affected regions of eastern Ukraine on the basis of the
PCNA approach.



                                                                                                 Volume I:
                                                 11                                      SYNTHESIS REPORT
3.2	      The Eastern Ukraine RPA is guided by three primary objectives:

•	 to support the GoU in the assessment of short-, medium-, and long-term recovery and peace-
   building  needs, related strategic and programmatic priorities, and associated financial re-
   quirements;
•	 to inform the development of a collective vision and strategy on longer-term recovery and
   peacebuilding for the Donbas and other conflict-affected regions, including within the frame-
   work of the 2015–2017 Ukraine Economic Recovery Plan and future policy reforms;
•	 to provide a platform for coordinated and coherent provision of support from the EU, the UN,
   and the WBG, as well as broader donor assistance—among other things via linkages to the
   reform processes of interest to the EU’s Ukraine Support Group.
3.3	 The first phase of the RPA was undertaken in November and December 2014. This phase
consisted of a rapid assessment that examined the immediate interventions necessary to stabilize
conflict-affected areas under government control and improve the welfare, living conditions, and
return prospects for displaced and vulnerable populations. Follow-up consultations were held in
January and February 2015 in eastern Ukraine and Kyiv, with government civil society, and inter-
national partners.

Assessment Methodology
3.4	 Phase 1 of the RPA focused primarily on assessing the impact of the 2014 conflict in the
Donbas, with specific attention paid to areas under government control and adjacent areas af-
fected by the conflict, including those that host large numbers of IDPs. For the purposes of Phase
1, short-term recovery needs and priorities were defined as those interventions that are neces-
sary to rehabilitate critical infrastructure and services, improve social and economic welfare and
livelihoods (particularly for conflict-affected and vulnerable groups), strengthen social cohesion
and resilience, and create an enabling environment for longer-term development. These inter-
ventions follow up on the provision of humanitarian assistance and pave the way for longer-term
durable development efforts.

3.5	 The RPA focused on three major thematic areas that correspond to its three strategic ob-
jectives (see Chapter III); each of these include treatment of the cross-cutting issues shown in
Figure 1.

3.6	 Phase 1 of the RPA was organized as a rapid exercise that drew for the most part on exist-
ing primary- and secondary-source information and used qualitative and quantitative methods to
describe and measure impacts, assess needs, and develop preliminary and costed priority inter-
ventions. The joint EU/UN/WBG assessment team worked in collaboration with the Ministry of
Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services and other national min-
istries and agencies (notably the Ministry of Social Services, the State Emergency Services, and
local oblast administrations), and also undertook missions to eastern Ukraine to conduct field
assessments to address critical information gaps and permit consultations with regional and local
stakeholders.4

3.7	 It must be emphasized that the division of the RPA into these three components is more
administrative than technical. The three components have been designed to be mutually com-
plementary and strategically synchronous. For example, the rehabilitation and reconstruction
of damaged infrastructure in Component 1 will provide opportunities for introducing labor-in-
tensive construction technologies. This is designed to link well with Component 2, priorities for
jump-starting local employment, particularly in the case of subdistrict and community infrastruc-
ture. Similarly, the equitable, consistent, and harmonious delivery of basic services across host
and IDP populations proposed in Component 1 will complement the outcomes of Component 3
by improving social cohesion by reducing competition for such services.

Geographic Scope
3.8	 For this assessment, the geographic scope was defined on the basis of the nature and extent
of damage, and further broken down by (i) most affected; (ii) less affected; and (iii) indirectly af-
fected areas (oblasts and raions)(see Table 1).5




5  This typology does not represent diminishing levels of damage or impact, but is rather intended as a way to demarcate areas by the
type of damage—in some zone III areas, for instance, the cumulative impact of the conflict exceeded the impact in some zone II areas.

Assessment Process
3.9	 On November 13–14, the RPA team hosted a workshop with the GoU, outlining the compo-
nent Terms of Reference (ToRs) and the assessment methodology. Representatives and specialists
from across the GoU’s various ministries and sectors attended the workshop. From the inception
of the RPA, the component teams worked closely with government counterparts to secure sec-
ondary data.

3.10	 From November 16–22, EU, UN, and WBG sector specialists conducted field missions to
Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Semenivk, Novoivanivka, Donetskoye, Slovyansk, Severodonetsk, Novoai-
dar, Lysychansk, Kharkhiv, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Berdiansk, Mariupol, and other rural
locations to collect primary data and meet with local actors. The data collected from these field
missions, coupled with the existing secondary data fed into sector-specific reports, was further
consolidated into component reports.

3.11	 The assessment findings were presented to the GoU through a workshop at the Ministry
of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services on December 16. Both
volumes of the assessment were provided to the GoU in late December for review.

3.12	 In January–February 2015 the RPA’s initial results were reviewed with the government
through a series of technical workshops, and discussed with national stakeholders (including civil
society, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector) and international part-
ners through consultations organized in Kyiv and Kharkiv. This report has been revised to incor-
porate feedback received during both the technical reviews and consultations.

Outputs
3.13	 The following outputs were produced during the RPA Phase 1 exercise:

•	 Impact assessment, results, and findings—analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of the
   conflict in the various sectors/subsectors assessed.
•	 Overview of short-term (24 months) recovery priorities—identification of priority needs and
   related interventions based on the RPA’s strategic objectives and outcomes.
•	 Strategic Results Framework (SRF)—overview of baseline conditions, performance indica-
   tors, and likely impact timelines of the proposed interventions.
•	 Institutional arrangements, governance, and implementation capacity—overview of institu-
   tional arrangements and governance mechanisms necessary to implement the strategy and
   achieve results/outcomes; overview of implementation capacity (current constraints and pri-
   orities).
•	 Costing of priorities/budget—overview of financial requirements for implementing proposed
   priority interventions.

RPA Report Structure
3.14	 These outputs are presented in a report comprised of two volumes:

•	 Volume I provides an overview of the results of the assessment, key findings, and recom-
   mended interventions for the two-year period, in the form of this synthesis report.
•	 Volume II provides the detailed assessment reports for each of the RPA’s three components.

4.0	 Limitations
4.1	 The first phase of the RPA was undertaken in a short period of time (with much of the actual
data collection and analysis limited to a few weeks in November and December 2014), in a context
of active conflict and insecurity, where the impacts on infrastructure and human welfare continue
and are ongoing. Limitations in access due to insecurity and significant gaps in the availability of
data for the Donbas limited the data obtainable to already existing primary and secondary sourc-
es, and precluded collection of additional quantitative and qualitative data. Furthermore, needs in
some sectors, such as agriculture, were not examined in depth nor were recommendations made.
For this reason, the RPA report should be considered as a preliminary analytical baseline that will
need to be further refined, adjusted, and expanded as conditions and needs evolve.

4.2	 As a result, the RPA report must not be seen as a definitive end to the process of assess-
ment—but more the beginning of a continuous process and mode of assessment. Some sectors
such as housing, environment, and employment, among others, require more work due to the
present unavailability of full damage data, particularly in areas with active conflict. Moreover,
other areas, such as social cohesion, require additional time in order to gather data given the
sensitivity of the issues and the longer time frames required to measure changes in social dynam-
ics. Given the unpredictability and uncertainty of the situation in some parts of the crisis-affected
region, the government structure established to coordinate and lead recovery efforts will need
to play a key role in regularly updating this assessment. This may require incorporating the data
template and analysis methodology employed for this assessment into the government’s preexist-
ing systems. Such institutionalization of this data-collection and recovery-planning approach will


                                                                                                Volume I:
                                                 15                                     SYNTHESIS REPORT
help create a temporal, sectoral, and geographical damage and needs database of actionable and
comparable information. This will contribute to more systematized and “time-sliced” recovery
planning to address the unprecedented challenges and requirements posed by an ongoing con-
flict, for which RPA partners can continue to provide active technical support.

5.0	 Risks
5.1	 Undertaking recovery planning in a context of ongoing crisis is never without significant
risks. Key risks in the context of eastern Ukraine include:

5.2	 Continued uncertainty and conflict. The outcome of the conflict in the East is currently
uncertain, which renders assessment and planning of recovery activities extremely difficult. At
present, there is the risk that the conflict could still escalate and expand, or become a “frozen”
conflict. On the other hand, a satisfactory diplomatic solution may be found. From a recovery per-
spective, the only way to manage the risks associated with the uncertainty concerning the trajec-
tory and duration of conflict is to maintain a dual-track approach that combines on the one hand a
process of continuous assessment of recovery needs, and on the other hand using an implementa-
tion framework that allows for flexible and responsive programming of recovery interventions as
needs and opportunities emerge.

5.3	 National capacity on recovery. The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and the signifi-
cant burdens imposed on the government with respect to managing the multiple dimensions of
the crisis (humanitarian, political/diplomatic, security) alongside the country’s broader macro-
economic problems pose the risk of hampering the government’s ability to focus on and manage
recovery efforts in eastern Ukraine. At the national level, this could include the inability to ensure
adequate coordination between ministries, national services, and the international donor com-
munity; in eastern Ukraine, this could include the inability of local administrations to support,
oversee, and manage the implementation of specific recovery interventions. Mitigating measures
include the need to ensure strong political commitment at the highest levels in government for
recovery efforts, and the provision of adequate technical, staffing, and financial means to govern-
ment structures charged with coordinating and implementing recovery efforts centrally and lo-
cally.

5.4	 Coordination capacities. Multisectoral recovery interventions in low-capacity environ-
ments heavily impacted by conflict necessitate strong coordination between the national govern-
ment, international donors, and a broad array of governmental and nongovernmental actors and
implementing agencies. A prerequisite for such coordination is the establishment of a govern-
ment structure with the appropriate mandate, and technical, human, and financial resources to
lead and coordinate recovery efforts at both the national and local levels. In the absence of such
a structure, there is a significant risk that recovery efforts will falter, or be insufficient to address
needs in a responsive, targeted, and effective manner, which, as the experience of other crisis
contexts illustrates, could lead to duplication, poor prioritization, major delays, and ineffective
programming.

                                                     Chapter II
                                      CONTEXT ANALYSIS

6.0	 Political and Security Developments in 2014:
     Backdrop to the Conflict
6.1	 In November 2013, antigovernment demonstrations erupted in Kyiv, sparked by President
Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to suspend preparations for the signing of an association agreement
with the EU that had been under negotiation since 2007. The demonstrations, which subsequent-
ly became popularly known as “the Revolution of Dignity,” gained strength and security forces
employed excessive force to control unrest, particularly in Independence Square (Maidan) in Kyiv,
where over 100 people were killed between January and February 2014, including by sniper fire.
On February 22, President Yanukovych left Kyiv and subsequently the country, whereupon Par-
liament voted for his dismissal. Parliament reinstated the 2004 constitution, thus reverting to a
parliamentary–presidential republic with a stronger role for Parliament.
6.2	 Following the developments in Crimea, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution
68/262 on 27 March 2014 which states that it:
“[...] 5.  Underscores that the referendum held in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the
city of Sevastopol on 16 March 2014, having no validity, cannot form the basis for any alteration
of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol; Calls upon all
States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the
status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol on the basis of the above-
mentioned referendum and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as
recognizing any such altered status.”6
6.3	 In May 2014, “people’s republics” were proclaimed in the parts of both Luhansk and Do-
netsk oblasts not under government control, following referenda that were not recognized by
the GoU and were widely criticized by large parts of the international community. On May 25,
2014, Ukraine held early presidential elections. Petro Poroshenko won in the first round with 55
percent of the vote. The elections were qualified by the International Election Observation Mis-
sion as “a genuine election largely in line with international commitments and with a respect for
fundamental freedoms in the vast majority of the country.”7
6.4	 In late May, Ukrainian forces began a concerted military response to reestablish control
over areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists and gained significant ground until they were
pushed back. Military clashes continue, though recently on a significantly lower level, despite the
existence of a peace agreement (the Minsk Protocol) signed by Ukraine, the Russian Federation,



6  On March 27, 2014, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 68/262 stating that the referenda had “no validity” and “can-
not form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the city of Sevastopol” (see http://www.
un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/262).

and the separatists on September 5, 2014, a memorandum signed by all sides of the conflict on
September 19, and a new package of measures in support of the implementation of the Minsk
Agreements, which notably renewed the cease-fire provisions on February 12, 2015.
6.5	 Parliamentary elections were held on October 26, with 27 seats for areas not under gov-
ernment control remaining vacant, and a new government was formed on December 2, 2014. The
government decided to cease social service delivery and payments to areas beyond government
control as of December 1, 2014; such a situation had de facto already existed for months due to
the collapse of the banking system in the separatist-held region.
6.6	 The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has had a significant impact on human welfare and
on social and economic conditions in the East. To date, out of the 5.2 million people who resided in
conflict-affected regions in the East, at least 3.9 million have been directly affected by the conflict.
As of late February there are a reported 7,000 deaths (including military personnel), some 18,000
wounded, and more than 1.6 million displaced both internally and outside of Ukraine.8 The actual
figures are likely considerably higher.
6.7	 Before the conflict, the Donbas region had already faced significant long-term challenges
related to poverty, demography, and its economic structure. Many of the country’s key industries
that are located in this region have experienced long-standing decline and have been further dam-
aged by the conflict and trade disputes. However, the deteriorating economic situation poses even
more acute risks for the well-being of the population of the East. This situation is likely to be com-
pounded by the significant loss of services, shelter, and livelihoods associated with the conflict,
necessitating the urgent restoration of basic infrastructure, renewed access to social services,
and access to employment or other income-generating opportunities. The conflict in the East has
also significantly deteriorated levels of social cohesion, trust, and cooperation throughout the
country—already low after years of divergent and politically charged narratives about history,
language, and patriotism.
6.8	 Recovery in the conflict-affected regions of the East therefore offers an opportunity to
strengthen unity in the country, building on the desire of the overwhelming majority of Ukraini-
ans to remain united.9 While immediate attention will need to be focused on specific post-conflict
needs in the East, bridges must also be built between all parts of Ukraine. Ukraine’s dire fiscal sit-
uation will be a primary concern for both the new government and the population. However, fail-
ure to also address the associated humanitarian and development concerns related to the conflict,
including those outlined above, will have serious implications in terms of increasing vulnerability,
lost confidence in the state, and risk a renewed humanitarian crisis. Ukraine’s conflict recovery
process—to create a foundation for stability and development——must therefore be both reflec-
tive and responsive to the country’s underlying structural drivers of conflict and societal tension,
as well as to potential opportunities to build resilience and promote civic engagement.

7.0	 External and Internal Factors Underpinning the
     Situation
7.1	 The Maidan protests most fundamentally reflected deep-seated dissatisfaction with a sys-
tem perceived as corrupt and lacking accountability, marked by weak rule-of-law institutions and
a judiciary that was neither independent nor able to ensure due process10 and which was also
perceived as being highly corrupt. For many Maidan protestors, alignment with European Union
standards held the prospect of correcting these endemic governance deficits that severely under-
mined the relationship between citizens and the state.

7.2	 Most of present-day Ukraine11 was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1922 and the re-
mainder in 1945, and Ukraine became an independent state when the USSR dissolved in 1991.12
Since Ukrainian independence, insufficient attention has been paid to nation building: that is,
strengthening the attachment of individuals and culturally diverse communities to a national en-
tity.

7.3	 Economic and social discontent are evident in most of Ukraine’s regions. Yet against the
background of the events of 2014, perceptions of regional identity and regional differences were
manipulated and used for geopolitical purposes not only by internal but also external actors, po-
larizing “pro-Ukrainian” and “pro-Russian” narratives and fueling tensions.

7.4	 Economic distress (see below), now coupled with overt military conflict and a de facto
information war, has eroded social cohesion. Issues involving social payments and subsidies, em-
ployment and salaries, accountability mechanisms, the role of personal wealth in national poli-
tics, and the transparency of budgeting and the reform process have also become highly politi-
cized and stoked further grievances within the population.

The Economy
7.5	 Following independence, the country has experienced a significant economic contraction.
In the 1990s, unemployment rose alarmingly and an emergent oligarchic class established effec-
tive control over state assets, undermining transparent and effective governance. The economy
began to recover in 2000, only to falter again in the global recession of 2008. In late 2014 a finan-
cial crisis loomed as a conflict-induced economic decline, coupled with rapid currency deprecia-
tion, rising inflation, and depletion of international reserves made the rising fiscal deficit unsus-
tainable and undermined the solvency of a large part of the banking system. Inflation reached an
annualized rate of about 20 percent in late 2014 and will perhaps be higher in 2015; over the past
year, real household incomes have dropped by 5 percent and the exchange rate of the national
currency, the hryvnia, has fallen dramatically.

7.6	 The dire economic situation has been felt across the whole country: in the East, with its
largely obsolete and inefficient heavy industries and in the West, which lacks the equivalent de-
gree of industrialization and has even lower GDP levels. However, key industries were already in

decline; significant components were outdated, inefficient, and unprofitable, financed by subsi-
dies and by wage arrears. Amidst this economic decline, many residents in eastern Ukraine, (par-
ticularly pensioners), are nostalgic for the social safety nets and managed economy of the Soviet
Union, and thus more oriented toward Russia as its present-day successor.

7.7	 It is estimated that between 30 and 60 percent of Ukraine’s economic activity occurs in
the shadow and informal economies, and therefore goes unreported and generates no direct tax
revenue.13 On the one hand, much of the resultant burden is borne by the citizenry through the
underfunding of social programs and local budgets, resulting in worsening quality of services
and higher out-of-pocket payments, both official and unofficial, in health and education. On the
other hand, the informal sector is flexible and more easily generates employment and livelihoods
(and through the multiplier effect contributes to VAT revenue), although it offers no employment-
related social protection.

7.8	 As the Donbas historically contributed approximately 16 percent to the GDP and 25 per-
cent to Ukrainian exports, the conflict in the East has had significant economic implications for the
whole country. Trade disputes with Russia have further damaged the Ukrainian economy, again
most heavily in the East. Ukraine’s real GDP is expected to decrease by 8 percent14 in 2014 and is
forecast to contract by a further 7.5 percent in 2015, while the exchange rate has heavily depreci-
ated since early 2014. Over the same period, registered unemployment has increased from 7.7
percent to 9.3 percent. The economic spillover of the conflict thus extends to the entire country.

Governance
7.9	 The current conflict, combined with geopolitical factors and social and economic volatility,
reveal serious governance challenges and the absence of the elements of governance that could
manage instability. Over the past 10 years, little progress has been made to ensure rule of law
and access to justice or to develop a working system of governance that is participatory, effec-
tive, and stable. There are no clear ways to hold leaders accountable between elections, to ensure
transparency in economic and political decision making, or to allow effective citizen participation
in governance between elections. Distrust of government runs very deep and the state–society
compact has eroded. Though there have been significant improvements, there is still too little dia-
logue between the government and the citizenry, which in turn lacks the means to influence the
government’s decisions or supervise its actions.15

7.10	 Government and governance methods in Ukraine are heavily centralized. Government
functions are exercised through strong central state and exclusive political power, and local prob-
lems are solved primarily by transferring the issues up to the national level. Formally, local gov-
ernments are autonomous entities, but in reality are heavily controlled through the financial and
administrative channels of the national government. Despite several waves of decentralization
reforms, public service provision is still controlled by the central public administration. However,
oblasts, raions (districts), and hromada (municipalities/local administrations) are also respon-
sible for local public service provision. This arrangement reduces the population’s ability to influ-

ence, or hold authorities accountable for, political, financial, and management decisions regarding
basic public services. It also increases the incidence of corruption and misalignment of budget al-
locations with local priorities. A process of decentralization started in late 2014 with decisions on
fiscal decentralization. This was followed by further legal changes in early 2015. However, many
key measures for decentralization still need to be enacted.

7.11	 These structural issues have significantly contributed to the current crisis. The center–
dependent governance model discouraged horizontal cooperation between regions and also be-
tween local communities within the same region. This disconnect exacerbated existing social dif-
ferences and precipitated a misperception shared in all parts of Ukraine—that other parts of the
country were better funded and that their needs were better addressed. These misperceptions
have been reinforced by the electoral rhetoric of regional political candidates in their attempts to
mobilize their electorate.

7.12	 Corruption is a widespread problem in Ukrainian society. Ukraine was ranked 142 out of
175 countries in Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index, the lowest of
all eastern European countries. Transparency International estimates that 30 to 50 percent of all
Ukrainians have faced governmental corruption. The intricate connections between political life
and business life in Ukraine revolve around the influence of a small number of rich and powerful
individuals, commonly referred to as oligarchs, who wield disproportionate influence over politi-
cal, economic, and, as a result, social life. This phenomenon is fueled by systemic problems such
as lack of transparency in party financing, permissive practices concerning conflicts of interest,
and, until recently, the tenuous connection between the electorate and those who hold political
power. It is still too early to judge whether recent positive changes in the political culture in this
field are sustainable.

7.13	 The Maidan movement in effect became a vehicle that aimed to destroy this politico–busi-
ness nexus and build a new, democratic, and “clean” Ukraine. However, the interplay between the
powerful individuals, their patronage systems, and politics continues to negatively influence the
country’s trajectory. While Ukraine’s civil society is relatively strong, it is still fragile; though it has
been able to make progress in engaging citizens on issues such as local and national politics, the
environment, health, education, and local development, its engagement in governance remains
nascent. Its media is similarly weak, and easily manipulated by pressure from official and private
interests. The general level of trust in the media stands at no more than 40 percent and is fully
trusted by only 3.3 percent of Ukrainians.16 The weak media and a growing but still underdevel-
oped civil society with limited engagement around governance issues feed into limited mecha-
nisms for citizen voice in political parties and institutions of governance.

8.0	 Population Displacement
8.1	 To date, at least 3.9 million people have been directly affected by the conflict, with some
7,000 deaths and 18,000 wounded. Around 1 million people are registered as internally displaced
and another 640,000 have taken refuge in other countries.17 Successive waves of internal dis-

placement followed the first outflows of residents from Crimea in March 2014. By June, the num-
ber of IDPs in the country rose to 54,400, including 12,000 from Crimea, as violence in eastern
Ukraine escalated.18 By August, following an intensification of the conflict in the East, the total
had reached 117,000, with 15,000 originating in Crimea.19 Despite a cease-fire agreed to on Sep-
tember 5, violence continued through October 2014 as government forces launched an offensive
to regain control of territory in late summer. That month, the number of IDPs tripled to 415,000,
driven primarily by concerns over physical security, colder weather, and the deterioration of ser-
vices and rule of law in areas not controlled by the government.20, 21 By mid-January, the number
of IDPs had risen to 660,000 and by mid-February had passed 1 million.

8.2	 Interviews with civil society organization (CSO) activists and the displaced suggest that
many IDPs do not seek out aid or register as IDPs for government services, out of fear that male
members of displaced families might be conscripted or out of concern about how they may be
treated by the authorities, as well as anxiety over the consequences that registering may have in
terms of separatist de facto authorities in their home areas.22 Furthermore, it is widely believed
that those IDPs who register are among the most vulnerable subset of the IDP population23 and
most in need of social support. (See Chapter V, Transversal Issues and Priorities for additional
details on the characteristics of population displacement).




18  This is the figure UNHCR issued in June based on IDPs that were counted by local authorities, CSOs, and those that had registered
for diverse government services. As with all IDP numbers for 2014 cited in this analysis, the actual number may be much larger due
to the absence of a central registry and inconsistent registration methods employed by CSOs and local authorities. With no central
registry, IDPs that had been exiled for some time but may have registered for aid either because of their deteriorating circumstances or
otherwise, may appear as “new” IDPs in internal displacement tallies. It is possible, for instance, that the rise in IDP numbers toward
the end of September 2014 is attributable this phenomenon.

Ukraine SES estimates. SES data is determined using information recorded by local CSOs and the number of IDPs that have registered
for diverse government services. Actual internal displacement figures over the period were believed to be much higher (perhaps up to
three times higher) as a result of the absence of a central registry, inconsistent reporting methods by CSOs, and the diverse registra-
tion practices of separate government agencies. (See UNOCHA, 2014a).

Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine           22
                                        Chapter III
  OVERVIEW OF RECOVERY AND PEACEBUILDING
      PRIORITIES FOR EASTERN UKRAINE

9.0	 Proposed Approach to Identifying Recovery and
     Peacebuilding Priorities
9.1	 Despite the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine and the broader historical, social, and other
structural drivers of the crisis, both the government and its partners recognize the need to ur-
gently address reconstruction, economic recovery, and peacebuilding needs in the areas affected
(directly and indirectly) by the conflict in the East. In this context, the RPA should be seen as an
iterative process to assess the impact of the conflict and identify key priorities for recovery and
building peace. For the first phase of the RPA, and in light of the ongoing crisis, the focus is on
improving human welfare, particularly of the displaced, and avoiding the further exacerbation of
the conflict drivers described above. The short-term recovery interventions proposed by the RPA
should also help inform, through positive precedents, future reforms in the areas of economic
policy, governance, and social services, as well as a longer-term and comprehensive recovery and
peacebuilding strategy.

9.2	 In order to systematically lay the basis for identifying, prioritizing, and sequencing recov-
ery and peacebuilding initiatives, recommendations are presented within the framework of three
strategic components:

•	 Strategic Component 1: Restore critical infrastructure and social services. The sustain-
   able restoration and improvement of infrastructure and social services holds the key to nor-
   malizing and stabilizing society in the crisis-affected areas and to creating conditions for IDP
   return and repatriation. Efficient and effective recovery of infrastructure and service delivery
   will not only ameliorate the affected populations’ suffering, but also help restore citizens’ trust
   in the state. In addition to “brick-and-mortar” damage to infrastructure, the loss of equip-
   ment, the exodus of employees, and a drop in staff skills and capacity in the directly affected
   regions are other challenges that need to be addressed. Ensuring satisfactory provision of so-
   cial services in indirectly affected areas is complicated by the influx of displaced populations;
   in some cases this is quite dramatic, requiring that existing services be expanded and adjusted
   to meet these additional needs.
•	 Strategic Component 2: Promote economic recovery. In the context of widespread dis-
   ruption of economic activity, loss of livelihoods and employment, and a deteriorating mac-
   roeconomic environment, this report proposes a multi-track approach to economic recovery
   aimed at reducing the vulnerability of conflict-affected populations and increasing societal
   resilience. This approach consists of generating short-term employment opportunities, im-
   proving productive capacities and livelihood options, strengthening local economic planning,
   stimulating small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the private sector, and facilitating pro-
   vision of financial services. Collaboration between local governments, civil society, and the
   remaining private sector will be essential to address key bottlenecks and rebuild the local

                                                 23                                      SYNTHESIS REPORT
      economy and social trust.
•	 Strategic Component 3: Strengthen social resilience, peacebuilding, and community
   security. Restoring and strengthening the social fabric is a critical requirement for effective
   and sustainable recovery. The risk of renewed conflict remains in the absence of reconcili-
   ation and peacebuilding, which puts investments in infrastructure, services, and economic
   recovery at risk. Priorities in this regard include building trust, strengthening the resilience of
   displaced populations and host communities, better protecting conflict-affected populations,
   and promoting reconciliation, peacebuilding, citizen security, and access to justice. Cross-
   cutting issues of gender, human rights, and capacity development need to be fully integrated.

10.0	Underlying Principles and Considerations
10.1	 Achieving meaningful progress in recovery and peacebuilding in eastern Ukraine during
a period of continued uncertainty and conflict requires a robust approach to implementation.
Drawing on the lessons of postcrisis recovery strategies in other countries, the following prin-
ciples are proposed:

•	 Targeting. In order to ensure that recovery interventions directly impact the populations
   most in need, they should focus on specific population groups. Priority groups include the
   displaced (including actual and potential returnees), resident and host communities, youth,
   women, combatants, and ex-combatants (and their home communities).
•	 Coordination and communication. Effective coordination will be necessary to ensure that
   sectoral interventions are mutually complementary and achieve the combined impacts neces-
   sary for maximizing recovery and peacebuilding prospects. A clear communications strategy
   will also be important to ensure that stakeholders are well informed and to manage expecta-
   tions.
•	 Management of the recovery process. How a recovery process is led and managed can
   significantly impact peacebuilding. In this context, stakeholders’ broad participation and en-
   gagement will be important to define collective priorities, while empowering local communi-
   ties and authorities in decentralized decision-making processes will be critical to build trust
   and ensure responsiveness to local needs and priorities.
•	 Implementation modalities. Recovery provides an opportunity to not only address the
   damages caused by conflict, but also to consider how improvements can be made across sec-
   tors to improve economic welfare, societal cohesion, and service provision, and to address
   constraints and challenges that existed prior to the conflict. Moreover, and in view of the need
   for flexibility, responsiveness, and speed in achieving immediate results, it may be necessary
   to consider a wide range of implementation mechanisms for peacebuilding and recovery ac-
   tivities—including both government and nongovernmental mechanisms.
•	 Establishing an enabling policy framework for recovery. This is critical for efficient and
   effective implementation and will require consensus building around key cross-cutting op-
   erating principles for multisectoral recovery, such as: subsidiarity and local implementation,
   public sector facilitation of private sector recovery, restoring sustainable livelihoods, inde-
   pendent oversight and transparency, and effectively managing public expectations and griev-
   ances.

Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine   24
11.0	 Prioritization and Sequencing
11.1	 The continuation of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the likelihood that the situation
will remain volatile and fluid for some time precludes, for the time being, the development and
implementation of a comprehensive recovery plan in the conventional sense. Rather, a flexible
and responsive approach to addressing recovery needs is required that takes into account the
strong likelihood that impacts, needs, and opportunities will change and evolve over time. Such
an approach would necessitate the identification and prioritization of recovery interventions on
a regular basis, which would be sequenced and implemented alongside humanitarian, political,
and security efforts. The following criteria could be considered as a basis for prioritizing the ini-
tiatives in conflict-affected areas under government control:

•	 Urgency and criticality of needs, and the feasibility of rapid action (key infrastructure, short-
   term jobs, IDP essential welfare)
•	 Minimum security and operating conditions
•	 Stabilizing affected populations (IDPs in host communities)
•	 Social cohesion initiatives
•	 Immediately feasible, rapid, and visible impacts

12.0	Transversal Issues
12.1	 The RPA team identified four issues that need to be addressed in a transversal manner:
the needs of the internally displaced, local governance, gender, and human rights. These are ad-
dressed in more detail in Chapter V.

12.2	 Internal displacement. To contain the developmental impacts of displacement and lever-
age the skills and presence of the displaced for more positive outcomes for all, four key challenges
must be addressed: delivering services such as security, education, health, and social payments,
along with basic infrastructure in equal measure to the displaced and host populations; assisting
the displaced regain control of land and property; reestablishing livelihoods and social bonds
that are disrupted by forced displacement and conflict; and establishing accountable and respon-
sive governance and rule of law at the local level. These are the barriers to durable solutions for
Ukraine’s internally displaced—and they are, at the same time, critical development challenges
for the country’s entire population. The RPA integrates these concerns throughout the three com-
ponents outlined above. This approach is premised on the continuation of the IDP crisis for the
foreseeable future and the associated strains that such population movements place on state fi-
nances, service delivery mechanisms, governance, and social cohesion.

12.3	 Local governance. The crisis has had widespread impacts on local governance24 in af-
fected areas, including on institutional capacities, assets, and infrastructure; local budgets and
income streams; delivery of municipal services; local social dynamics; relations between national,
regional, and local levels of government; and state–society relations and citizen–state trust. Local

to one or more stakeholders of local dimension, including local governments, local state administration, local CSOs/CBOs, communi-
ties, the private sector, and so on.




                                                                                                                            Volume I:
                                                                 25                                                 SYNTHESIS REPORT
governance is an intrinsic part of recovery processes and is addressed throughout the RPA. Ensur-
ing support for and strengthening local governance will promote efficient implementation and
coordination of activities on the ground, ensure responsiveness to urgent and emerging needs,
improve public trust in the capacity of the state, and promote a more sustainable, participatory,
inclusive, and accountable recovery process.

12.4	 Gender. The crisis has had different impacts on men, women, children, and the elderly.
Therefore, recovering from the crisis will necessitate a recognition of, and response to, gender
and age-differentiated needs. The RPA has adopted a gender-mainstreaming approach—meaning
that the analysis of the crisis impacts, resultant needs, and related strategic recommendations all
take this into account. Moreover, it recommends that gender sensitivity be similarly integrated
into the implementation of the recovery strategy as an integral dimension of successful recovery
programming.25

12.5	 Human rights. The armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has been accompanied by numer-
ous allegations of human rights abuses by all parties, including gross violations such as sum-
mary executions, abductions, torture and ill treatment, arbitrary detention, and intimidation and
harassment. The deterioration of law and order in conflict-affected communities is also believed
to have resulted in some armed groups and security providers acting with impunity and a lack
of transparency and accountability, which adversely impacts the economic and social rights of
the conflict-affected populations (including displaced communities) and citizen–state trust. The
armed conflict has also weakened respect for fundamental human rights. Where appropriate, hu-
man rights–related measures have been mainstreamed throughout the recommendations. 




25  Significant international experience on gender-sensitive recovery programming, including from the UN Security Council Resolu-
tion 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, is available to support the implementation of the RPA.

  SUMMARY OF RPA STRATEGIC COMPONENTS

13.0	Strategic Component 1: Restore Critical Infrastructure
     and Social Services
13.1	 The sustainable restoration and improvement of infrastructure and social services holds
the key to normalizing and stabilizing society in the crisis-affected areas and to creating condi-
tions for eventual IDP returns. Efficient and effective recovery of infrastructure and service deliv-
ery will not only help ameliorate the affected populations’ suffering, but also help restore citizens’
trust in the state. Therefore, it is imperative to pay immediate attention to addressing critical
service delivery disruptions and shortcomings caused by the conflict.

Impact of the 2014–2015 Crisis
13.3	 This section provides a summary of the direct and indirect impacts of the conflict in the
various subsectors assessed as of November 2014. Impact on physical infrastructure and asso-
ciated ability to provide social services can be divided into three broad categories: (i) damages
caused by intensive fighting and artillery usage around key facilities; (ii) the loss of facilities to
antigovernment armed groups; and (iii) damages to service provision and supply infrastructure
that prevent services from reaching the affected population. Total damages to infrastructure and
social services are estimated at around US$463 million. Of these, damages to the transport and
energy sectors constitute a bulk of the impact. While the impact on the environment could not be
quantified in Phase 1 of the RPA, it is substantial and needs attention. Furthermore, losses that
have been incurred in various subsectors but not fully quantified in this phase of the assessment
include: (i) diminished output capacity due to infrastructure damage and fuel shortages affecting

revenue; (ii) increased production costs and cost hikes resulting from emergency infrastructure
repairs; (iii) the inability to efficiently transmit and deliver services because of infrastructure
damage (which has also been impeded by the need for emergency infrastructure repairs); and
(iv) reduced ability of consumers to pay for services received.

Rationale and Recovery Objective
13.4	 Infrastructure and social services encompass a broad swath of public life. A reliable energy
supply powers public, private, and government operations, helps educational institutions func-
tion, frees caretakers (mostly women) to seek employment, and allows transport networks to be-
come the arteries of a healthy economy. As such, this component has multiple linkages with the so-
cial cohesion and economic recovery components of the RPA. For example, the rehabilitation and
reconstruction of damaged infrastructure will provide opportunities to introduce labor-intensive
construction technologies. This links with Component 2 priorities for jump-starting local employ-
ment, particularly in the case of subdistrict and community infrastructure. It is recommended
that the government seize such opportunities to introduce social protection and cash-for-work
schemes that can target the more vulnerable segments of the affected populations, particularly
IDPs. Similarly, the equitable, consistent, and harmonious provision of basic services across host
and IDP populations will improve social cohesion.

13.5	 The interventions recommended by individual sectors are aligned with the GoU’s broad
vision for recovery. While the measures proposed for each sector are designed as short-term
measures to stabilize living conditions in the affected areas, they contribute to the government’s
2015–2017 reform agenda. Stabilizing living conditions in affected areas may mean reconstruct-
ing and rehabilitating infrastructure and service delivery to at least precrisis conditions, but pref-
erably to improved standards. The principle of Building Back Better and Smarter (BBBS) has been
applied differentially and selectively in calculating recovery costs across and within subsectors.
This is to ensure cost-optimized reconstruction and recovery programs that are sensitive to the
needs of vulnerable populations and those displaced by the conflict. BBBS recommendations in
this component mostly focus on recovery that improves upon precrisis conditions.

Overview of Priority Interventions and Financial Requirements
13.6	 Total recovery needs for the IS component are estimated at around US$1.258 billion. Needs
are greatest in the transport, health, and energy sectors, at US$558 million, US$184 million, and
US$79 million respectively. Needs estimates build upon the damages reported to infrastructure
to additionally (i) reconstruct impacted infrastructure to improved standards; (ii) restore service
delivery to individuals residing in Donetsk and Luhansk, and replace facilities; and (iii) provide
social services to IDPs. These also include other capacity and human development resources re-
quired to reconstruct needed infrastructure and restore social services (see Table 3).

14.0	Strategic Component 2: Promote Economic Recovery
14.1	 The economic recovery component of the RPA assesses the economic impact of the crisis
on affected regions of eastern Ukraine; identifies strategic priorities for promoting early recovery
and improving human welfare; quantifies associated costs of early recovery needs; and outlines
a number of short- (24-month) and medium-term interventions for the government to consider.
It does so in the context of a difficult macroeconomic environment. The component covers needs
and proposed interventions in the areas of (i) employment; (ii) productive capacities and liveli-
hoods; (iii) local economic planning; (iv) SMEs and the private sector; and (v) financial services.

Impact of the 2014–2015 Crisis
14.2	 Ukraine’s unprecedented economic challenges in 2014 came on the heels of two years of
economic stagnation, with GDP growth averaging 0 percent in 2012–2013. For years preceding



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine           30
the current crisis, Ukraine’s economy was underperforming. Characterized by systemic weakness
and inefficiencies, the economy did not recover from the 2008 global economic crisis.26 Weak
macroeconomic policies and delayed structural reforms widened internal and external imbal-
ances. The government embarked on much-needed macroeconomic adjustment in early 2014 and
began steps to ease structural constraints to growth, but its efforts were stymied by conflict in the
East, the industrial heart of Ukraine.

14.3	 Donetsk and Luhansk are economically important to Ukraine, accounting for 15.7 percent
of Ukraine’s GDP in the pre-conflict period and 12.5 percent of the population. Coal mining, steel,
petrochemicals, and the fertilizer industry are the main sectors in these two oblasts. Around one-
fourth of Ukraine’s industrial activity and an equal share of its exports came from these oblasts
in 2013. Of the regional exports, metals exports were high at around 60 percent. In the first 11
months of 2014, exports from Donetsk oblast dropped by almost 30 percent and by 43 percent
from Luhansk oblast, compared to the same period of previous year.27 Given the geographical
location of Donetsk and Luhansk at the eastern border, they have close economic relations with
Russia. During January–September 2014, metal exports to Russia declined by 28 percent y/y, with
the share to Russia declining to 10 percent of total metal exports from 14 percent in 2013. As a
consequence of direct and indirect impacts, SMEs lowered their economic activities by 80–90
percent, leading to a similar percentage of jobs lost.

Rationale and Recovery Objective
14.4	 The economic recovery component of the RPA estimates the impact of the crisis on the
economy of affected regions, identifies priorities for effective and sustainable economic recovery,
and quantifies their costs. The geographic focus is on those areas of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts,
which are currently under the Ukrainian government’s control. Given wider impacts, recovery
needs in adjacent oblasts of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk are also considered. The
main target groups for employment considerations are the IDPs displaced in Dnipropetrovsk,
Donetsk, Luhansk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, and the pre-conflict existing population in
all five oblasts concerned who experience similar needs and problems.

14.5	 However, it must be underscored that recovery prospects in the East are closely linked to,
and in turn affect, Ukraine’s broader economic challenges. Recovery efforts in the East need to be
viewed through the prism of the country’s unprecedented economic crisis, and additional security
problems in these regions further undermine investor and consumer confidence. More specifically,
it is imperative to restore macroeconomic and banking sector stability; address wider structural
challenges by making the overall environment friendlier to investors; curb widespread corrup-
tion so public services can be delivered to citizens efficiently and cost-effectively; and deal with
problems in the gas sector. These steps are preconditions for recovery in the East. Of course, this
is challenging given that problems in the East and overall economic problems are closely linked—
with links running in both directions. However, without macroeconomic stabilization and struc-
tural reforms, it will be difficult to talk about recovery in the East in isolation. In other words, if the
rest of the country does not grow and create jobs, it will be difficult to employ people displaced in
the East and have the fiscal space to provide social assistance in a sustainable manner.

Overview of Priority Interventions and Financial Requirements
14.6	 The cost of the proposed economic recovery interventions are estimated at US$135.5 mil-
lion. The recommendations are outlined in a sequential manner that prioritizes critical and prac-
tical interventions. Considering the changing situation in the East, as well as various time frames
required for allocating funds, not all suggested measures foreseen for Phase 1 can be started im-
mediately, and a more flexible approach is needed. Nevertheless, it is useful to formulate a list of
priority projects so they are “ready for launch” when conditions permit. Depending on the situa-
tion in conflict areas as well as lessons learned from Phase 1 interventions, topics and objectives
for medium- and long-term projects will be evaluated. In addition to new targets, the most effec-
tive projects from Phase 1 would be extended and expanded during Phase 2 (see Table 4).

15.0	Strategic Component 3: Strengthen Social Resilience,
     Peacebuilding, and Community Security
15.1	 The social resilience, peacebuilding, and community security component of the RPA is es-
timated to cost US$126.8 million. It considers issues related to restoring the social fabric, which
is critical for recovery processes. This includes supporting the early recovery of conflict-affected
populations, including the displaced, host and other resident communities, volunteers and ex-
combatants, and victims of conflict by providing livelihoods support, protection, and promoting
reconciliation, peacebuilding, and access to justice. Some of the recommendations should be ap-
plied at a national level to ensure that local interventions are both effective and sustainable, as
well as to address the national impact of conflict.

Impact of the 2014–2015 Crisis
15.2	 The ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine has had a direct and highly negative impact on so-
cial cohesion, resilience, livelihoods, community security, and the rule of law. Displacement, fear,
and diminishing levels of trust are acute social problems, and conflict-related distress is wide-
spread. While social fragmentation, prejudices, regional divides, and low levels of trust in local
authorities and institutions existed prior to the crisis, these have been exacerbated as a result of




                                                                                                   Volume I:
                                                   33                                      SYNTHESIS REPORT
it, particularly in the Donbas.28 In many ways, the conflict and resulting displacement from Do-
netsk and Luhansk oblasts has magnified Ukraine’s pre-conflict fragility. As the numbers and the
duration of stay for the displaced increase, pressure mounts on local resources, service delivery,
livelihoods, and governance.

15.3	 Exposure to conflict-related violence among combatants, as well as residents in conflict-
affected areas and displaced populations, has resulted in widespread trauma that existing medi-
cal and mental health services are unable to address. Signs of increasing tensions between IDPs
and host communities are becoming more evident. Moreover, under conflict conditions, law en-
forcement agencies, security services, and justice institutions are ill equipped to ensure respect
of rights and rule of law, mitigate disputes and tensions, and address crime and violence. Current
hostilities, related community-level violence, and misinformation contribute to polarization and
deepen divisions. Recovery challenges become more pronounced as this fragility and divisiveness
become more intense.

15.4	 Impacts are especially acute in areas with a high percentage of IDPs compared to the host
communities, such as Konstnatinyvskyi and Marinskyi raions of Donetsk oblast, Borivskyi raion
of Kharkivska oblast, and Berdianskyi and Zaporizhkyi raions of Zaporizhzhia oblast. These areas,
as well as those likely to experience significant returns of ex-combatants and/or displaced per-
sons in a post-conflict period, should serve as priority areas to be targeted for peacebuilding and
recovery support. Needs in indirectly affected areas hosting significant IDP communities, includ-
ing those geographically distant from the front line of the conflict, should also be addressed, as
they pertain to IDPs and poor and vulnerable host community members alike.

Rationale and Recovery Objective
15.5	 Under this strategic component, the focus is on strengthening the resilience of all conflict-
affected communities, especially displaced populations and their host communities; better pro-
tecting conflict-affected populations; promoting reconciliation and social cohesion; and strength-
ening community safety and access to justice where conditions allow.

15.6	 These are fundamental to sustainable recovery and peacebuilding—they lay the founda-
tion for effectively implementing other aspects of recovery, such as rehabilitating infrastructure,
restoring social services, and revitalizing economic activity. Of particular importance is the notion
of trust building and reconciliation; bringing various groups together to overcome differences
and grievances through dialogue. This is a difficult and sensitive process, but the first steps need
to be taken immediately. Without reconciliation—between different members of the community,
between different communities, and between citizens and authorities—lasting peace and recov-
ery are unlikely to be achieved.

15.7	 As social cohesion continues to erode and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions cause
further tensions, it is crucial that conflict mitigation and reconciliation activities commence as
soon as possible, irrespective of the cessation or continuation of armed conflict. While more ex-
plicit peacebuilding activities such as large-scale reintegration processes must wait until the end
of overt conflict, there is no time to waste in preventing further erosion of social cohesion. Ef-

of both local and national authorities.

fective responses must situate social cohesion and reconciliation interventions within practical
and tangible local recovery efforts, including both restoration of services and community infra-
structure (as detailed in Component 1) and economic recovery, including livelihoods and income
generation (as detailed in Component 2).

Overview of Priority Interventions and Financial Requirements
15.8	 This report recommends a number of priority interventions should begin in the next 24
months, as detailed in Table 5. Recommendations also reflect international experience, which
demonstrates that without addressing and resolving grievances and root causes of conflict
through a process that involves all affected groups, there cannot be any meaningful or lasting
peace or recovery. Moreover, this cannot happen without a national policy framework that under-
pins regional and local interventions.

15.9	 Recommendations are presented as distinct sets of issues but are closely interrelated in
terms of both priority needs and timelines. Flexibility in implementation is important, both in
response to changing circumstances and to the scale of the challenge. While deeper analysis is
needed to develop a disaggregated and targeted program, this should not diminish the urgency of
the response: Such analysis should be the first step of implementation.

16.0	Population Displacement
16.1	 The humanitarian exigencies of over 1 million IDPs are compelling, and are initially being
addressed through the UN humanitarian appeal. Displacement flows contribute to underdevelop-
ment and may, if left unaddressed, drive further conflict. Forced displacement may weaken so-
cial and state capacities, further eroding confidence in government and increasing the burden on
state finance and institutions. Displacement may also exacerbate threats to citizen security and
create underemployment and price distortions. Despite the fact that internally displaced popula-
tions bring capital and skills that can be put to use in the recovery and benefit the resilience of
affected communities, few means exist to tap into these resources.

16.2	 A number of factors dramatically increased the number of registered IDPs in December
2014, starting a trend that continued through February 2015, as illustrated in Figure 2. First, the
arrival of winter and weakened economic resilience among residents in conflict areas increased
outflows as conditions deteriorated. Second, Government Decree 875/2014, issued in mid-No-
vember, closed all government offices in nongovernment-controlled areas, halting funding of pen-

sions, social benefits, and other services, while also withdrawing support to schools and hospitals.
Ukraine’s central bank offices also closed, limiting access to cash and banking services. Pension
and social payments are now only available to persons with registered residences in government-
controlled areas. The withdrawal of financial services and resources deepened vulnerability and
prompted outflows of some of the Donbas region’s most desperate residents. There are indica-
tions, for example, of extraordinary numbers of pensioners leaving nongovernment-controlled
areas in December and January and registering as IDPs in government-controlled areas.29

16.3	 A third factor contributing to an increase in IDP registrations is the late December 2014
transition from a Ukraine State Emergency Service (SES) paper–based methodology for IDP reg-
istrations to a Ukraine Ministry of Social Policy (MSP)–managed electronic system, which more
rapidly tracks and aggregates the numbers. The MSP, now the official source of displacement sta-
tistics in Ukraine, uses a formal registration procedure, local welfare offices, regional offices that
aggregate formal submissions and check the data at the regional level, and a central registry of-
fice that aggregates IDP registration data at national level. This comprehensive approach is likely
contributing to additional IDP registrations.30

16.4	 A fourth factor contributing to the large increase in registered IDPs is an intensification of
fighting since early January. Fierce fighting and heavy, indiscriminate shelling in densely popu-
lated areas continues in different locations along the front line in the East, prompting additional
outflows of persons from conflict-affected areas.31 Leaving separatist-controlled areas is becom-
ing increasingly perilous due to the presence of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and mines, the de-
struction of critical transport infrastructure such as bridges and main roads, and increasingly
restricted freedom of movement in and out of the conflict area.

Characteristics of IDP Movements in Ukraine
16.5	 The demographic profile of IDPs in eastern Ukraine suggests several distinct patterns
that are similar to forced displacement crises in other countries. As in many displacement crises
where women and children leave home areas at the first signs of violence or duress in their com-
munities, women and children represent a sizeable proportion of the IDP population. For the
eastern five oblasts, the numbers of able-bodied, working-age women (who often leave with their
children) averaged 34 percent of IDPs in September and October 2014. This proportion has since
fallen, as the number of disabled and elderly among new IDPs has increased significantly—from
17 percent in December 2014 to 70 percent in January 2015. The relatively small number of dis-
abled and elderly residents leaving in early waves of displacement is common to forced displace-
ment crises, due to mobility challenges, fear of the unknown, misinformation or hearsay, or the
insistence by long-time residents (who are also typically past fighting age) to stay in their home
areas near what they know. The current increase in displacement among older and disabled resi-



29  It remains unclear how many people registering with the MSP are IDPs and how many are registering solely for the purpose of
transferring their pensions, and may move back to their homes once their pensions and social benefits have been collected (UNHCR.
2014b. “Ukraine Situation.” UNHCR Operational Update, UNHCR, Geneva. http://unhcr.org.ua/attachments/article/1299/UNHCR%20
External%20Update%20Ukraine%20Situation_7%2031%2012%202014.pdf). This lack of clarity affects planning of aid provision.
30  Humanitarian actors in the field suggest that the MSP numbers still understate the true scope of the forced displacement crisis,
due both to the dynamism in population movements and the enduring reluctance of many IDPs to register (See, for example: UNOCHA.
2015b. “Ukraine.” Situation Report No. 25, UNOCHA, Kiev; where it is suggested that the MSP system is “unable to capture the move-
ment of people in real time. Local authorities and partners agree that the discrepancy between the real and registered numbers of IDPs
is a major issue hampering delivery of assistance”).

dents is due to circumstances that include worsening service delivery deficits, weather-related
hardships, an escalation in fighting, and an inability to access official financial support. In general,
since September 2014, the percentage of able-bodied men among registered IDPs in the East has
remained constant, averaging 15–17 percent of the total number of IDPs in the East.32

16.6	 Over 96 percent of IDPs originate from the oblasts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Of these, 75
percent have sought refuge in host communities within the five eastern oblasts. More telling is
that 49 percent of IDPs have stayed within Luhansk and Donetsk, swelling the population of con-
flict-affected host communities nearest to the fighting.33

16.7	 This is a typical movement pattern for IDPs, reflecting a desire to achieve greater physical
safety while remaining within a reasonable distance of homes, relatives, property, and former
livelihoods. In Ukraine this pattern is likely reinforced by IDPs’ fear of poor treatment if they move
to areas further west, as well as by the movement of pensioners and other social service support
payment recipients to adjacent government-controlled areas in order to register for continuation
of their assistance. The result, however, is a concentration of the displaced into host areas that are
poorly prepared to receive them. Conditions for both the displaced and hosts deteriorate as these
inflows continue.

16.8	 In many areas, local officials and civic organizations have established collective centers
for the displaced. Many, however, are overwhelmed by the demand for shelter. Several summer
camps and institutions that were abandoned as cold weather approached are now being filled out
of necessity, providing suboptimal accommodation for increasing numbers of IDPs. Conditions in
many centers are not good. A local CSO told visiting Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe (OSCE) monitors that there was a dramatic increase in alcohol abuse by women at the
center, reportedly due to the pressures of divorce, child care, and unemployment.34

16.9	 Outside of the new centers and camps being established for the surging numbers of IDPs
near the line of contact, IDPs have moved into host areas where they fill available housing stock
or find lodging with relatives, often crowding multiple families into accommodations meant for
fewer people. Living conditions in some apartment blocks and neighborhoods have deteriorated
for both residents and the displaced as IDPs crowd in. The government is identifying a significant
stock of almost-completed new housing throughout the country that can be finished in order to
meet some of the need. Other empty buildings are also being inventoried by local authorities.
Greater demand for rental accommodation has led to increases in brokerage fees and rents. The
presence of IDPs has also placed downward pressure on wages and upward pressure on food
prices. While large-scale price increases are strongly linked to fiscal challenges, the conflict, and
monetary policy at the central level, local residents often attribute these economic distortions to
the presence of the displaced and eastern separatists.35

16.10	 Health facilities and classrooms are overpopulated in many areas, and community services

Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine        42
such as elderly care, child care, recreation services, and sanitation services have been affected as
resource-poor authorities redirect their budgets to the needs of IDPs. This fuels mutual suspicion
and social fragmentation in host areas, particularly as fighting intensifies and greater numbers
of Ukrainian soldiers are wounded or killed. Interactions in host areas are increasingly becoming
bitter and confrontational, particularly toward men from the East who may be suspected of anti-
government sympathies.

16.11	 The majority of the displaced in Ukraine have moved at least twice in the course of their
displacement, and one-third have moved three or more times. Repeat movements are typically
driven by a search for secure, adequate, and reasonably priced accommodation, but should be
understood as disruptive episodes in the lives of the displaced as they search for improved cir-
cumstances. Movements are frequently driven by the hard choices IDPs face as personal resources
are depleted; as they search for the best access to services and assistance in other areas; as land-
lords are increasingly disinclined to rent to IDPs; and as host families and family members lose
the ability (or tolerance) to support IDPs.36 Repeated dislocations due to renewed physical safety
concerns are also common as many of the displaced who seek to remain near home areas have
had to flee again due to heavy nearby fighting. Of the estimated 130,000 IDPs who were housed in
nonwinterized accommodations over the early months of winter, nearly all were moved or moved
themselves to areas where winter-ready shelters were available—though sometimes in more re-
mote locations. This has also led to the return of some IDPs to less-than-desirable situations near
or in home areas, due to their dissatisfaction with accommodation options in the West and as
news in the East suggested that returning to home areas is the best available option.37

16.12	 With each displacement and even with returns, people must register with new government
offices and local CSOs. They must also undertake a difficult search for adequate accommodation
(if homes were destroyed or property was lost), enroll children in school, and navigate difficult
social relationships. Social networks commonly weaken with each move, and delays in finding
adequate assistance or financial support sometimes trigger difficult gaps in household resources.
Successive moves often lead to the incremental weakening of a household’s resilience.

16.13	 Even for returnees, being home does not mean returning to the status quo. “Home” will
have changed for returnees since their departure. Case studies of multiple forced displacement
crises underline that home regions may have changed socially, developmentally, and politically. In
addition to the challenges to return posed by the destruction of homes and infrastructure and the
decline in services and governance capacity, the presence of nonstate political entities and politi-
cal conflict may have permanently altered the social landscape such that return to places of origin
becomes impossible for some groups. In cases of protracted displacement, the demographic reali-
ties will have changed in home areas, and returnees will experience increased pressure on scarce
land resources and often disputed access to the property they left behind. The role of women may
have changed as well, either enhancing or restricting their freedom of movement and ability to
engage in activities different from those in their predisplacement situation.

of the displaced for more positive outcomes for all, four key challenges must be addressed—de-
livering services such as security, education, health, and social payments, along with basic infra-
structure in equal measure to the displaced and host populations; assisting the displaced regain
control of land and property; reestablishing livelihoods and social bonds that are disrupted by
forced displacement and conflict; and establishing accountable and responsive governance and
rule of law at the local level. These are the barriers to durable solutions for Ukraine’s internally
displaced—and they are, at the same time, critical development challenges for the country’s en-
tire population. The RPA integrates these concerns throughout the three components outlined
above. This approach is premised on the continuation of the IDP crisis for the foreseeable future
and the associated strains that such population movements place on state finances, service deliv-
ery mechanisms, governance, and social cohesion.

17.0	Strengthening Local Governance in Recovery Efforts
17.1	 The crisis has had widespread impacts on local governance38 in affected areas, including
on institutional capacities, assets and infrastructure, local budgets and income streams, delivery
of municipal services, local social dynamics, relations between national, regional, and local levels
of government, and state–society relations and citizen–state trust. Local governance is an intrin-
sic part of recovery processes and is addressed throughout the RPA. Ensuring support for and
strengthening local governance will promote efficient implementation and coordination of activi-
ties on the ground, ensure responsiveness to urgent and emerging needs, improve public trust
in the state’s capacity, and promote a more sustainable, participatory, inclusive, and accountable
recovery process.

17.2	 The crisis has acutely affected local authorities in the government-controlled areas of Lu-
hansk and Donetsk. For example, half of all local administrative infrastructures in these areas are
estimated to have suffered some level of damage,39 and some infrastructure in areas very close to
the front line has been completely destroyed. Apart from infrastructure, the crisis is also reflected
in human resources by a decrease in the number of civil servants (in some instances, only 20 per-
cent of the staff positions are filled; in other cases, only one-third of the staff are present in the
oblast administration, and city councils and oblast administrations only have 78 percent of the
staff they should have).40 As the demand for many municipal services has drastically increased
(especially for pensions, social assistance, and health), local bodies are facing serious shortages of
capacity and in many cases, losses in capacity due to staff displacement and dismissal. These are
compounded by shortages of space and equipment and by the relocation of state administration
offices in the worst affected areas. Many local authorities’ financial situation is dire: Their budgets
are insufficient to meet unforeseen expenditures related to the crisis (including social services for
IDPs), while at the same time their revenues41 have decreased as inflows from municipal services
(such as communal heating and water distribution) and income taxes have plunged. Lack of fi-

nancial resources can strain the ability to recruit additional staff in local administrations, and the
provision of services. Several examples document the decrease in local authorities’ own source
revenues.

17.3	 Lack of citizen–state interaction and public councils’ reduced capacity to cope with the
situation is one area that needs attention. Apart from capacity gaps, the public councils also lack
the financial and policy support to be able to exercise their functions with the regular participa-
tion of the private sector and civil society. Currently, citizens—especially IDPs—rarely or never
participate in needs assessment, planning, and implementing recovery response. Consequently,
trust in government is low. At the same time, the stress on local authorities to deal with the con-
sequences of the conflict on their own, without the necessary national support, has also eroded
the state–society relationship.

17.4	 Proposed priorities for strengthening local governance in the context of recovery and
peacebuilding efforts include:

•	 Restoring local government infrastructure and assets;
•	 Helping central government actors provide overall policy guidance and recovery planning
   support to local authorities;
•	 Mobilizing financial and human resources and capacity to match increased local service de-
   livery needs;
•	 Building local authorities’ capacity to effectively coordinate and support the different institu-
   tional and nongovernmental actors involved in service delivery and recovery interventions;
•	 Building capacity to sensitize local appointed and elected officials regarding processes, in-
   cluding participatory planning processes that promote participatory, transparent, and inclu-
   sive local dialogues and inclusion in decision making;
•	 Supporting the development of an integrated approach to meeting local recovery needs; en-
   hancing the policy dialogue on implementing decentralization.
17.5	 A strategy for strengthening local governance in the context of recovery and peacebuilding
efforts is being coordinated at the national level by the Vice Prime Minister’s office, with sup-
port from the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services
and the Ministry of Finance. Local authorities should develop the recovery strategy in order to
increase their ownership over the process and ensure their needs and requirements are appro-
priately addressed. This approach will enhance the national–subnational relationship and foster
trust in the idea that government assistance is provided where needed. It is recommended that
the Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services work di-
rectly with oblast and raion council administrations and local authorities to endorse the strate-
gies of established recovery committee councils (which are comprised of local council members,
civil society, the private sector, and also women, youth, and marginalized groups).

17.6	 It is also important to establish one-stop citizens’ service centers to ensure the local popu-
lation’s needs are met and to help enhance capacities for service delivery. The establishment of
such centers will enable local authorities to assess the increase in demand for public services.
These centers could play a critical role in the recovery process, serving as a hub between citizens
and local authorities on local needs, and providing the public access to timely and reliable infor-
mation on matters that affect their lives.

17.7	 Capacity development for local authorities, including administrative staff, should be ad-
dressed through knowledge-sharing platforms, peer-to-peer support, different online tools, and
trainings at the local level.

17.8	 Local development planning processes that are based on inclusive dialogue and promote
transparency in the selection of reconstruction and recovery priorities will facilitate trust be-
tween local authorities and communities. Communities—in particular CSOs, businesses, women,
youth, and the elderly from the urban and rural areas—should be encouraged to participate in
the planning process for the development of their oblast/raion/municipality. Policy support from
the national level that enables local strategic participation in the planning process should be a
priority.

17.9	 Priority during the initial 6–12 months could be given to: (i) areas that have suffered the
most damage and displacement; (ii) areas that have received the highest number of IDPs in rela-
tion to their population and local authorities’ capacities for response; and (iii) areas undergoing
difficult political stabilization processes. Other principles could include attention to the differ-
entiated needs and capacities of urban and rural governance systems; alignment with planned
decentralization reforms and recognition of the specific needs of conflict-affected areas within
the decentralization process; creating spaces for citizen participation in local decision-making
processes, including openings for the participation of IDPs, women, and vulnerable groups.

18.0	Gender
18.1	 The crisis has had different impacts on men, women, children, and the elderly. The RPA
has adopted a gender mainstreaming approach—meaning that the analysis of the crisis impacts,
resultant needs, and related strategic recommendations all take gender into account through-
out. Moreover, it recommends that gender sensitivity be similarly integrated within the recovery
strategy’s implementation, as an integral dimension of successful recovery programming.42

18.2	 Within the RPA, a gender-sensitive approach implies attention to the specific experiences
of both women and men affected by the crisis, and their potentially differing recovery risks, needs,
and capacities. For example, the conflict has caused changes in family relations and family pat-
terns. The majority of displaced families are incomplete, with most now headed by women. Wom-
en constitute approximately two-thirds of able-bodied adult IDPs. They are the main caretakers of
displaced children and elderly relatives and shoulder the responsibility of ensuring their families’
social and economic well-being—including managing domestic needs, securing housing, and pro-
viding economically. Young women, especially those isolated from families and social networks,
are at increased risk of sexual violence and trafficking. Meanwhile, although social reintegration
of female IDPs and children is broadly supported, male IDPs can face acute stigma and prejudice
in host communities, drastically limiting their livelihood options and social reintegration poten-
tial and reducing their likelihood of registering as IDPs. An additional gender dimension relates to
men who account for the vast majority of volunteer security and protection forces and the social
and economic strains their families experience as a result.

18.3	 Differentiated needs include gender sensitivity in supporting access to services (Chapter



42  Significant international experience on gender-sensitive recovery programming, including from the UN Security Council Resolu-
tion 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, is available in support of the implementation of the RPA.

IV, Section I) and livelihood opportunities (Chapter IV, Section II), as well as access to justice—in-
cluding for SGBV, which is aggravated in conflict and post-conflict settings, as well as for forced
recruitment of men and boys into armed groups (Chapter IV, Section III). Gender inclusiveness
is also highlighted around issues of social resilience and peacebuilding, including psychosocial
recovery, gender-sensitive DDR, and training men and women to become peacebuilders. The sug-
gested institutional arrangements similarly highlight the importance of gender-inclusive partici-
pation of conflict-affected populations in decision making around recovery activities, gender-dis-
aggregated recovery data collection, and gender-responsive institutional capacity for recovery at
national, oblast, and local levels, including gender advisors within institutional structures.

19.0	Human Rights
19.1	 The armed conflict in eastern Ukraine has been accompanied by numerous allegations of
human rights abuses by all parties, including gross violations such as summary executions, ab-
ductions, torture and ill treatment, arbitrary detention, and intimidation and harassment. The
deterioration in law and order in conflict-affected communities is also believed to have resulted
in some armed groups and security providers who act with impunity and a lack of transparency
and accountability, which negatively impacts economic and social rights of the conflict-affected
populations (including displaced communities) and citizen–state trust. The context of the armed
conflict has weakened respect for fundamental human rights.

19.2	 As already noted, systemic institutional weaknesses that predated the current crisis have
been further exacerbated by it, and are particularly evident in the sphere of human rights (civil,
cultural, economic, political, and social rights). Exacerbation of inequalities, erosion of trust in
public institutions (especially notable in the law enforcement and justice systems), and the appar-
ent impunity of armed irregular forces undermine the rule of law and, therefore, citizen security.
Long-standing institutional shortcomings—including chronic underfunding of the justice system,
asymmetry between prosecution and defense in criminal proceedings, questionable judicial inde-
pendence, and excessive use of pretrial detention—further compound the problem.

19.3	 While these shortcomings are best addressed in the context of a national reform of the
security sector, immediate measures must be taken by all actors in the conflict-affected areas to
prevent a further deterioration of the overall human rights situation and to strengthen adherence
to and respect for human right norms and standards. Targeted human rights training for law en-
forcement agents, security providers, and combatants should be complemented by a more con-
certed effort to investigate reports and allegations of human rights violations by any actor. Where
appropriate, human rights-related measures have been mainstreamed throughout the RPA’s rec-
ommendations. As with the overall concept of peacebuilding, however, transformative impact will
depend on the central government’s promotion of a clear and strategic vision, possibly within the
framework of the national reform agenda. This will need to be implemented locally in conjunction
with reconciliation, access to justice, and other social cohesion interventions.

                       INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS

20.0	 Institutional Framework
20.1	 The extent of eastern Ukraine’s recovery and peacebuilding needs will necessitate dedi-
cated institutional capacity for recovery planning, implementation, coordination, and monitoring.
This section highlights key considerations for the GoU regarding the establishment of appropriate
institutional arrangements to implement RPA recommendations and wider recovery efforts. It
highlights the importance of government ownership over the RPA process, balanced with wide-
spread stakeholder engagement.

20.2	 The current situation calls for an approach to recovery, reconstruction, and peacebuilding
that is flexible and responsive to evolving needs and opportunities. Beyond the analytical and
programmatic framework provided by Phase 1 of the RPA, this will necessitate specialized in-
stitutional arrangements for prioritizing urgent recovery interventions, flexibly aligning financ-
ing and ensuring rapid disbursement, and identifying appropriate implementation capacities to
achieve results in the short term. The specific institutional arrangements to be adopted for RPA
implementation will need to be developed by government as an immediate next step in order to
facilitate RPA implementation planning. The institutional architecture selected should be suitable
for managing both:

•	 Continuous monitoring of the conflict’s impact and periodic assessments to ensure that this
   report’s data and analysis are regularly updated. This would include the expansion of the
   scope of the RPA assessment to include additional areas impacted and/or expected to be ac-
   cessible. Monitoring and assessment activities would be utilized to regularly update the RPA
   programmatic and results framework.
•	 Ongoing identification, prioritization, and implementation of feasible priority recovery inter-
   ventions. This would include: (i) identifying a first set of priority recovery interventions that
   can be immediately implemented to mitigate the potentially destabilizing effects of large IDP
   concentrations and worsening economic and social conditions—notably in the oblasts adjoin-
   ing Donetsk and Luhansk; and (ii) periodically assessing and identifying additional recovery
   interventions that would be sequenced to build on humanitarian assistance and accompany
   improvements in the political and security situation.
20.3	 Experiences from other countries that have undertaken complex postcrisis recovery and
reconstruction highlight the importance of institutional arrangements that combine strong gov-
ernment leadership to ensure coordination across stakeholders, with representation from the
wide range of sectoral line ministries, government agencies, oblast and local authorities, civil so-
ciety organizations, and beneficiaries who will play a role in the recovery process. Given the
cross-cutting nature of recovery needs and response strategies in Ukraine, a similar institutional
structure will thus be necessary.

20.4	 It is therefore recommended that as an immediate priority, an intragovernmental coordi-
nation structure (for example, a Donbas Recovery Coordination Committee) be established under



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine       48
the aegis of the executive level of government (either office of the president or prime minister).
This committee would be cross-sectoral and include representation from key ministries with re-
sponsibility for key recovery sectors (such as the Ministry of Regional Development, Construc-
tion, Housing and Communal Services, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Social Policy,
State Emergency Services, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and so on), as well
as representatives from decentralized levels of government, civil society, and the international
community (including donors). This mechanism could be chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services in charge
of the overall coordination of recovery in eastern Ukraine.

20.5	 This structure should take a lead role in coordinating and planning recovery and peace-
building activities in an integrated and coherent manner. A first task should be to clarify the com-
prehensive institutional framework required RPA implementation. The framework should be as
simple as possible and draw on existing structures, given the immediate need for priority inter-
ventions and focus on identifying, financing, and implementing a first set of priority interventions.

20.6	 Early additional activities for the RPA coordination structure could also include:

•	 Defining key programmatic, operational, and financial parameters for the recovery process—
   including scope, objectives, policy and reform implications, resource requirements;
•	 Prioritizing and sequencing recovery needs and associated interventions to ensure equitable
   and demand–responsive recovery across various sectors and to minimize the potential for
   duplicated efforts;
•	 Developing an integrated financing framework that ensures that all financing sources and
   instruments are aligned with agreed upon recovery priorities and interventions, including
   the government budget and donor financing, and overseeing resource mobilization for RPA
   priorities (see Chapter VII);
•	 Undertaking baseline data collection for recovery and developing monitoring and evaluation
   arrangements as recommended by the RPA;
•	 Developing a communication strategy to promote citizen engagement with the recovery pro-
   cess and to promote transparency and accountability.

20.7	 Moving forward, a key ongoing task of the coordination structure will be to identify oppor-
tunities to promote synergies and links between different sectors and recovery objectives and to
ensure effectively integrated and multisector recovery program development. Linkages between
public recovery efforts and civil society or private interventions and between national, regional,
and local initiatives should also be carefully promoted and facilitated. Given that many of the driv-
ers and impacts of the crisis are shared by communities around the country, it will be important to
have a dual focus on activities specifically related to the recovery of conflict-affected areas, along-
side countrywide recovery activities to promote peacebuilding, tolerance, and reconciliation, and
to support the reintegration of IDPs, armed forces, and volunteer combatants.

20.8	 At the level of implementation, hybrid institutional arrangements—which are a mix of ded-
icated central agencies and existing institutions—may best suit the challenges of ensuring effi-
cient and effective recovery of the conflict-affected areas. As described above, the government en-
tity mandated to lead recovery efforts should assume a central role with respect to policy setting,
implementation oversight, and performance management at a core programmatic level. Various
sector-, oblast-, and raion-level line agencies and departments will likely carry out actual imple-



                                                                                                 Volume I:
                                                  49                                     SYNTHESIS REPORT
mentation. However, making such a hybrid arrangement work will require clarifying from the
outset the operational mandates of key recovery actors and mechanisms for policy development,
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting. Special mechanisms for resource alloca-
tion, financial management procurement, capacity development and staffing, quality assurance,
transparency, communications, and grievance redress will also need to be established.

20.9	 Regardless of the specific arrangement selected by government, the intragovernmental co-
ordination structure would benefit from a Technical Secretariat to provide technical-level leader-
ship and to take charge of the day-to-day coordinating and monitoring of RPA implementation.
The Technical Secretariat would also play a role in coordinating the financing instruments that
support RPA implementation, to identify areas of overlap, fragmentation, or gaps in support, and
ensure funds are aligned with priority activities. The Secretariat could include staff from govern-
ment and possibly, subject to further exploration and each organizations’ rules and procedures,
the three principal organizations supporting the RPA (the EU, the UN, and the WBG). The techni-
cal secretariat would be expected to include a combination of analytical, monitoring, and techni-
cal expertise to both support RPA implementation and facilitate the functioning of the coordina-
tion structure and RPA financing.

20.10	 Capacity building for RPA implementation structures—including technical support and
specialist expertise from experts involved in past recovery processes—should be an immediate
priority to ensure efficient RPA planning and implementation. Within the Technical Secretariat,
specialist units for monitoring and evaluating the RPA—as well as for cross-cutting issues such
as gender sensitivity and the inclusion of vulnerable groups, human rights, local governance, and
IDPs—could also be anticipated.

20.11	 Civil society and the private sector should be involved in recovery planning and decision
making, as they are important actors in postdisaster and postcrisis recovery. They have a proven
ability to mobilize sizable funding and social capital, and can often be sources of valuable exper-
tise. Civil society organizations often have well-cultivated links to the affected communities that
can be valuable in project implementation. Creating space for civil society organizations and the
private sector in the institutional arrangements of crisis recovery will help promote an effective
and inclusive recovery process, including meeting the staffing needs of recovery, mobilizing exist-
ing delivery systems, raising funds, and bringing in expert resources to help guide the recovery
process. This may also include creating recovery planning forums for involving subnational gov-
ernment, civil society, technical institutions, academia, private sector, and affected communities.

21.0	Process for Periodic Review and Updating
21.1	 The recommendations of the RPA provide considerable flexibility to the government and
its partners. Therefore, it will be necessary to integrate a process for reviewing the continued
relevance and appropriateness of the strategic approach. Over time, changes in the nature of the
crisis—in national contexts, legal or policy frameworks, the activity or capacity of stakeholders
and implementing partners, available financing flows, and local needs—may necessitate revis-
ing or reorienting the strategy. Similarly, as some interventions prove more timely or effective
than others, interventions’ focus or prioritization may also be usefully adapted. Therefore, it is
strongly recommended that an RPA progress review exercise be planned every six months, with a
slightly more intensive mid-term review replacing the progress review after 12 months of imple-
mentation. The mid-term review would be a particularly useful juncture at which to consider the
alignment between this first phase of the RPA and the eventual second phase, and to identify how



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine   50
to transition or integrate successful interventions into longer-term development strategies. The
coordination structure would be expected to be the lead agency for the RPA progress reviews, but
the reviews themselves should be based on strongly consultative processes in which all stake-
holders are able to provide feedback on RPA implementation to date.

22.0	 Monitoring and Evaluation
22.1	 Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is an essential function for measuring progress in the
recovery strategy’s implementation and achievement of intended objectives. The main M&E tool
proposed by the RPA for recovery interventions is the SRF, which captures the priority outcomes
and indicators identified by each component to monitor progress over the twenty-four-month
period of RPA implementation (see Annex I).

22.2	 It is recommended that responsibility for M&E coordination and oversight reside with the
intragovernmental coordination structure. This will depend on activities managed and data col-
lected by line ministries, local authorities, and other implementing agencies. As such, a system
for cross-sectoral M&E collaboration should be an early priority, and include senior officials from
all implementing agencies to ensure high-level support for M&E activities. Additional priority ac-
tions should include establishing a specialist M&E unit with adequate capacity43 and resources;
developing and agreeing on reporting procedures with implementing partners, including line
ministries and relevant oblast and local staff; training and capacity building for the M&E unit and
all implementing partners on M&E procedures; and developing a management information sys-
tem. Ensuring public access to M&E data will be essential to keeping implementation transparent
and credible. Regular M&E reports and updates to the Strategic Results Framework should be
available online and widely disseminated to the public via the media and other communication
channels. Participatory M&E processes that support the engagement of conflict-affected areas
should also be designed and promoted wherever feasible.




43  The specific composition of the M&E unit will need to reflect the need for dedicated M&E specialists at central and local levels
and should include expertise in data analysis and management, conflict monitoring, gender disaggregation, and IT.

           FINANCING STRATEGY AND MODALITIES

23.0	 Principles
23.1	 Addressing priority recovery, reconstruction, and peacebuilding needs in the short term
will require leadership and substantial commitments from the GoU, along with support from the
international community. This chapter proposes a financing strategy to meet urgent recovery and
peacebuilding support needs identified in the Eastern Ukraine RPA. It describes the main objec-
tive and key components of such a strategy, including the main financing sources and instruments
and key considerations to encourage collective responsibility for outcomes.

23.2	 The situation in eastern Ukraine is still evolving, with ongoing military operations and un-
certain prospects for a lasting ceasefire. Estimated reconstruction needs may continue to rise as
they are further assessed. Nevertheless, it is urgent to formulate a response and provide feasible
elements of support in an integrated, fast, and flexible manner. The response should be tailored to
ongoing needs yet also cognizant of the severe constraints posed by the ongoing conflict. It should
aim to leverage the different available funding sources.

23.3	 The government has earmarked recovery and reconstruction funding for the eastern re-
gions in the 2015 budget, but faces difficult resource and institutional capacity constraints. Given
this, and the overall economic hardships of the communities affected by the conflict, Ukraine’s
humanitarian and early recovery needs cannot be met by the government alone. Therefore, in-
ternational development partners will be called upon to finance part of the short-term recovery
needs. Over time, the government will need to make fiscal space to take over more of the recovery
spending. It will also need to enhance the efficiency of public spending, engage nongovernmental
actors in the design and administration of the recovery and peacebuilding interventions, and,
critically, create the conditions and space for competitive private-sector activities.

24.0	 Objectives and Core Considerations
24.1	 The overall objective of this financing strategy is to strengthen the effectiveness of the im-
mediate post-conflict reconstruction effort by linking different financing sources and instruments
together in support of identified priority activities. By doing so, the goal is to encourage collective
responsibility for delivery, a higher degree of integration of resources (human and financial), and
coordinate technical support and risk management during the post-conflict recovery period.

24.2	 Ukraine is a middle-income country, and recovery financing is expected to come primarily
from a combination of regular budget allocations and loans, while grants are likely to make up a
smaller proportion of the total. To ensure synergies between the different sources of financing
and effective use of different funding instruments, the financing strategy will be grounded in the
following:

•	 Prioritization between different needs in the RPA, based on a combination of urgency, critical-
   ity, and feasibility;


Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine       52
•	 A comprehensive overview of possible funding sources (from the national budget as well as
   from loans, grants, and bilateral programs) and their scope and limitations;
•	 A recognition that collective action and responsibility for results is important, in particular for
   activities that aim to strengthen social cohesion, reconciliation, and peacebuilding;
•	 A responsive approach that can ensure flexible and rapid financing and disbursement to ac-
   commodate changes in needs and priorities;
•	 An approach that allows for scalability to accommodate future financing needs as and when
   they emerge (for example, based on expanding the geographic scope of the RPA).
24.3	 An important consideration when formulating a financing strategy for the RPA is the ex-
tent to which it will promote coordination and collective responsibility for delivery of results in
conflict-affected areas. There are limits to shared accountability for results across different fi-
nancing sources and instruments, especially when these rely to a large extent on sovereign loans
and guarantees. Yet integration at the outcome level can be achieved by focusing on a subset of ac-
tivities where a broader coalition and collective action is both possible and warranted in response
to high risks, insecurity, and limited capacity of government to deliver. In these cases, specialized
solutions should be drafted for pooling certain resources (human, procedural, financial) to jointly
manage these during RPA implementation.

24.4	 A second consideration relates to the utility of pooling grant financing in a specific instru-
ment. While grants are expected to only account for a smaller percentage of the total resource
flows, a pooled fund can still perform important functions by preventing duplication and frag-
mentation of activities, filling critical gaps in financing, promoting economies of scale, and facili-
tating collective action and risk management. Importantly, a pooled fund can provide a platform
to finance those priority areas where collective focus and attention is absolutely critical, and/or
where financing through country systems at the necessary scale is less likely (such as for spe-
cific capacity strengthening activities and projects focused on social cohesion, reconciliation, and
peacebuilding). A key consideration during the finalization of the RPA will be to explore whether
a critical mass of grant financing can be mobilized to justify the initial higher operating costs of
establishing a pooled fund.

25.0	 Components of the Financing Strategy
25.1	 Establishing a financing strategy involves four key steps: (i) agreeing on a set of priorities
(financing needs) within the overall cost envelope of the RPA; (ii) mapping the various financing
sources that can be accessed to deliver on these priorities; (iii) identifying the range of specific
instruments needed for delivery (strategic allocation framework); and (iv) establishing appropri-
ate institutional arrangements, including governance and accountability mechanisms, to promote
joint responsibility for outcomes. Figure 3 illustrates this process, while each step is further de-
scribed in the subsections below.

Overall Financing Needs
25.2	 The total cost envelope for the RPA has been estimated at US$1.520 billion. Needs are di-
vided into three components (see Table 6). Within the RPA, components also include several cate-
gories of spending that would possibly merit a more integrated approach, such as priorities relate
to generating knowledge, strengthening capacities, and providing technical assistance.

25.3	 The RPA team is also putting forward a set of criteria to encourage further prioritization

of those activities that require immediate attention, either because of their urgency or because of
their critical importance for the sustainability of the recovery effort.

25.4	 Across the RPA, there are specific

tance. Similarly, several priority activi-      Economic recovery                            135.5

ing efforts through direct engagement           and community security

critical priorities can be found in more        Total                                     1,520.0
sensitive areas that are directly related
to stabilization, peacebuilding, and strengthening social cohesion, notably for reconciliation, sup-
port to IDPs, demining, and support for reintegrating ex-combatants. Given their criticality for
conflict resolution, these aspects will require dedicated arrangements during implementation.

Sources of Financing
25.5	 Even in a period of stress, part of Ukraine’s funding needs must be met from the national
budget. Different types of remaining needs will attract a variety of sources of financing. For in-
stance, general balance of payments financing is typically provided by the IMF; multilateral bank



Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment

loans are the natural financing source for infrastructure needs beyond what the budget can cover
in a middle-income country like Ukraine; while urgent recovery requirements, civil society sup-
port, or community-level peacebuilding are often funded by grants.

25.6	 Financial requirements are likely to exceed currently available national and international
resources. Thus, the RPA will need to be supported by strong measures to increase fiscal space. A
proper mapping of available financing is needed as basis for operationalizing the RPA.

25.7	 Grant financing from international donors will be particularly important while the Ukrai-
nian government is largely shut out of private capital markets. This mainly takes the form of ear-
marked funding to specific programmatic areas. Grant financing can help access flexible funding
earmarked for immediate interventions that support recovery and peacebuilding. Grants may be
channeled as direct budget support to the government or local entities. But because of the impact
of the crisis on institutional capacities, grants implemented by specialized agencies (national or
international) may enhance financing opportunities. In a post-conflict context, working with a
variety of organizations can attract international donors if they see programmatic risks mitigated
by an effective network of such organizations.

25.8	 Private-sector financing and investments are of major importance for fostering economic
recovery and setting the basis for sustainable development and stability. Foreign direct invest-
ment (FDI) can be critical for sectors such as mining, telecommunications, and construction. En-
couraging social investments (such as employing and training nationals, and using local suppli-
ers) can magnify the benefits to the local economy, help create jobs, and build the tax base while
producing necessary goods and services. Remittances are also significant from a macroeconomic
point of view, providing households with family members working abroad an important financial
safety net. But conflict and economic instability pose a substantial risk to private sector inflows
owing to asset destruction, weakened property rights, inflation, currency depreciation, and lack
of effective economic regulation and rising corruption.

Defining the Mix of Financing Instruments
25.9	 From the above it is clear that financing for RPA implementation will come from a range of
instruments, including:

•	 The national budget (including direct budgetary support): The budget will be the main
   source of financing, in particular to ensure sustainability of the recovery efforts over time
   and to cover recurrent costs associated with the reestablishment of government capacities
   and services in the conflict-affected areas. A budget allocation of UAH 300 million has already
   been confirmed.
•	 Lending instruments (investment financing, reorientation of existing projects): A number
   of loan-funded projects are already in place, and it is expected that these will be scaled up
   or reoriented over time to finance RPA priorities, in particular in terms of large-scale infra-
   structure reconstruction. These are predominantly implemented through national systems
   and thus aligned to budget priorities. A key challenge will nonetheless be to ensure that the
   various working groups and project implementation units (PIUs) that have been set up to
   support these loans are aligned and able to coordinate with each other.
•	 Grant financing: Grants will likely constitute an important part of RPA financing, even if
   the relative amounts are expected to be small compared to external financing through loans.
   Grants will be particularly critical in areas of the RPA that try to address challenges of social

                                                55                                     SYNTHESIS REPORT
      cohesion, stability, and reconciliation; and where coordination is critical to avoid duplication
      (that is, knowledge, assessments, technical assistance). Grants will also be needed to finance
      key thematic support in areas where the government’s ability to borrow might be limited,
      and/or where the risks of engagement on sensitive issues are too high for partners to take on
      individually.
25.10	 It may be expedient for the majority of grant financing to be pooled into a Multi-Partner
Trust Fund (MPTF), as has been the case in several other post-conflict recovery contexts. An
MPTF would ensure that support that explicitly targets issues of cohesion, stability, and reconcili-
ation is financed in a coordinated manner that builds synergies between different activities and
strengthens collective understanding of the context and evolving risks. In the case of Ukraine, an
MPTF could have the benefits of:

      1.	 Supporting overall coherence by filling critical gaps and underfinanced priorities;

      2.	 Leveraging national investments by providing cofinancing in critical areas;

      3.	 Building capacity to create enabling conditions for overall implementation; and

      4.	 Providing specific expertise and support on thematic issues not naturally covered by oth-
      er financing instruments.

25.11	 Several international institutions have significant experience administering such facilities,
and examples also exist in which private firms have taken on fund administration. The specific
design and administrative arrangements will depend both on the agreed activities that will be
prioritized and the available financing to be pooled. Based on experiences from past trust fund
models and the need to ensure that country systems are used to the largest extent possible, an
MPTF may be highly relevant in Ukraine. A possible MPTF would be recommended as an early
topic for discussion between the RPA implementation coordination structure and donor agencies.

25.12	 The interventions and their implementing entities within a possible MPTF would be select-
ed through a collective decision-making process involving both national representatives and fi-
nancial contributors. The projects would directly contribute to the objectives defined in the RPA’s
SRF and would report on their achieved results in a consolidated manner. The MPTF can thus be
understood as a technical solution to the challenges of delivering results in the post-conflict en-
vironment; a political solution to issues related to capacity, coordination, and coherence of such
support; and an effective mechanism to pool and manage risks. To fulfill the described functions
and justify its operational cost, a critical mass representing a minimum of 10 percent of overall
RPA funding would be recommended to be mobilized through an MPTF.

25.13	 Support through bilateral aid channels will also support RPA implementation. There are
many reasons why donors might prefer continued bilateral support, such as to promote specific
policies, cater to different constituencies, or because of procedural constraints that prevent pool-
ing of funds. However, in the context of a high-risk, weak capacity–implementing environment
in eastern Ukraine, a “spaghetti bowl” of bilateral financing runs a high risk of being inefficient
and ineffective. The main reasons for this are likely insufficient coordination and possible incon-
sistency with the recovery strategy. These in turn could lead to the duplication of implementa-
tion modalities, excessive demands on local implementing partners, and fragmentation of smaller
projects that address overlapping parts of the same priority.

25.14	 To the extent possible, it will be important for the RPA to integrate a maximum number of

financing instruments. Figure 4 shows how this can be done under the general umbrella of the
RPA coordination structure without violating the integrity of individual instruments and the spe-
cific accountability and procedural requirements associated with each, which might in some cases
prevent direct resource pooling. The institutional and governance arrangements section below
describes how collective responsibility for outcomes can still be achieved within the joint facility,
and highlights the role of the Technical Secretariat in this process.

Coordination of Financing Instruments
25.15	 As detailed in Chapter VI, the proposed intragovernmental coordination structure could
also oversee the RPA financing strategy, including resource mobilization. This would allow RPA
priorities to be aligned with the various funding channels and instruments and allow for strate-
gic reorientation of individual financing instruments when necessary. The Technical Secretariat
would remain in close contact with the multiple financing instruments to target available financing
to priority needs and reduce potential duplication or gaps. Some financing mechanisms, such as
an MPTF, would be expected to work under the overarching RPA coordination framework (includ-
ing, for example, oversight by the intragovernmental coordination structure and administration
by the technical secretariat), but may also require complementary accountability arrangements.

             RPA STRATEGIC RESULTS FRAMEWORK


A
        n SRF will measure progress regarding how the RPA strategy is implemented and how its
        intended objectives are achieved. It seeks to capture progress toward priority indicators
        and the outcomes they represent across each component of the RPA. As a representation
of visible progress toward peace, the strategic results framework is also a tool for trust- and confi-
dence-building and for strategic communication. A disconnect between the population’s expecta-
tions for recovery and peacebuilding and the results that are visible to the population (or a lack
of understanding of what progress has been made toward peacebuilding objectives) could drive
distrust and suspicion and be a conflict-multiplier. However, a strategic results framework with
meaningful indicators, clear measures of visible progress, and transparency and regular com-
munications can be deeply significant for the population and stimulate support for the recovery
process.

The RPA currently presents a wide range of progress indicators across each component for the
government and its recovery partners to consider. The next step will be for government to lead a
process to refine and prioritize these indicators, as part of RPA implementation planning and op-
erationalization planning. This exercise would review the current set of indicators proposed; as-
sess the scope and reach of each; reconfirm the ongoing relevance of each indicator as a measure
of recovery and peacebuilding; identify additional indicators that may be needed, including those
that reflect specific outcomes for vulnerable groups or different regions; identify the interim and
final targets for each indicator, including gender disaggregation as is relevant; and ensure that
indicators are sufficiently modular and phased to allow for progress to be meaningfully measured
across the 24-month duration of RPA implementation (and beyond). Examples of how existing
indicators could be converted into strategic-level indicators are included below.

This exercise would be expected to result in two separate tools: (i) an SRF, which will include a
limited number of key indicators that will most visibly demonstrate progress toward peace in
the eyes of the population as a whole; and (ii) an Implementation Monitoring Framework, which
would be a crucial tool for monitoring progress at the technical level. The Implementation Moni-
toring Framework would be a key management tool for the intragovernmental coordination com-
mittee, as well as individual ministries and implementing partners. The SRF, meanwhile, would
be the foundation for a social contract between citizens and the state on recovery—and represent
indicators that would reinforce the faith and confidence of the population that recovery efforts
are proceeding in the right direction and yielding tangible results. As such, it would be expected
to be widely shared and visibly discussed as part of the six monthly RPA progress reviews.

In selecting indicators for the SRF, the following principles are recommended:

•	 Indicators should be measures that can be tangibly defined and recognized by the popula-
   tion, and can credibly increase the population’s confidence that recovery is going in the right
   direction.
•	 Indicators should be compelling and generate support for their achievement across different
   stakeholder groups.

Analysis of Crisis Impacts and Needs in Eastern Ukraine     58
•	 Indicators should be a subset of key outcomes for each component. They should illustrate the
   big picture objectives to which each subcomponent aims to contribute, but need not represent
   each subcomponent individually.
•	 Ideally, no more than 15 indicators would be included (no more than five for each of the three
   components).
•	 For each indicator, short-term and long-term objectives should be defined. Short-term in-
   dicators could be process- or output-oriented, and will help build confidence and ensure
   that progress is on track. Longer-term indicators would be targeted toward the end of the
   24-month RPA implementation period and would be a more outcome-oriented measure of
   recovery.

For the Implementation Monitoring Framework:

•	 Limit each outcome to a small number of indicators that include a sense of scope.
•	 Seek to highlight visible goals, particularly in recovery sectors where goals can seem abstract
   or might not be visible to the population.
•	 Integrate a clear timeline for indicators to be achieved.
•	 Develop a review process for the framework that will allow for incremental changes and mid-
   course corrections in indicators as needed.

In addition to these principles, it is also recommended that the existing draft indicators proposed
by the RPA component teams be refined by the government to make sure they fully reflect the
government’s specific strategic and implementation level objectives. While both the SRF and the
Implementation Monitoring Framework will be informed by their overall purpose of fostering
trust and confidence in the recovery process, they will need to be uniquely designed in terms of
their frequency and sensitivity. Strategic indicators will need to resonate strongly with citizens
(conflict-affected populations, IDPs, host communities, and citizens around the country) and will
serve as signals of recovery and reconciliation. Implementation monitoring indicators, however,
need to demonstrate forward momentum in delivering recovery and peacebuilding programming
and credible incremental spending of financing for recovery investments.

Many RPA outcomes, such as restoring access to education, can integrate both “hard” and “soft”
elements—for example, in rebuilding schools and helping teachers and students recover from
trauma. Education results could thus be framed as:

                                                                                                       Volume I:

Indicators 1 and 2 are more short-term and would demonstrate progress in the first 6–9 months of
the RPA. Indicators 3 and 4, meanwhile, would be more medium-term and show results through-
out the RPA period. The SRF would focus on one important milestone for each indicator, showing
where the RPA expects to be at each six-month review, whereas for implementation monitoring,
each indicator would be broken down into several incremental milestones that would be moni-
tored and would quickly illustrate any delays.

In reviewing and finalizing indicators, it will also be crucial for the government and its recovery
partners to formulate indicators in a way that makes them clear, understandable, and measurable
for the population, and also minimizes potential intergroup tensions. For example, some key indi-
cators may seem apolitical but could be regarded as giving preference to one group over another.
In such cases, such as restoring power, it will be key to build in transparency about beneficiaries
within relevant indicators in order to demonstrate the evenhandedness of the RPA.

Similarly, objectives and aspirations should be easily understandable to average citizens and
linked to measurements that have meaning for the citizenry. Trust between the state and conflict-
populations could be reformulated.
