This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

        For the official number, the Federal District Department will
        assign a single official number for each property, at the request
        of the interested party, that has a front facing the public
        pathway. For the official alignment, the plot across the land
        indicates the restrictions or expropriation lines to be respected in
        the interaction between the property and the public pathway.

      Once the water feasibility process is on its way, Buildco. can also
      request a certificate of debts. This is another mandatory
      requirement to register a construction statement type B. The

      therefore this is applicable.

      Agency: Water Services Agency



      Register Construction Statement Type B

      Construction Statement Type B applies to nonresidential or
      mixed uses of up to 5,000 square meters or up to 10,000 square
      meters for residential use or for single-family dwelling units
      within a risk zone.

      The following documents must be submitted:
      • Valid alignment certificate and official number (simple original
      copy or certified one)
      • Single zoning certificate for specific land use and feasibility
      (simple original copy or certified copy for collation)
      • Four copies of the architectural project for the construction
      work on duly outlined scale maps and containing all
      specifications regarding materials, finishes, and equipment to be
      used, signed by the owner, the director responsible for the
      construction work, and the co-responsible party for urban and
      architectural design and installations, as the case may be
      • Project descriptive report
      • Calculation report
      • Registration and identification card of the director responsible
      for the construction work and the co-responsible party for

      as appropriate (simple original copy or certified copy for
      collation)
      • Two copies of the structural design signed by the director
      responsible for the construction work and the co-responsible
      party for structural safety
      • Proof of payment of improvement taxes for potable water and
      sewerage works provided by the Federal District Department and
      license issuance fees if the application is required (simple original
      copy or certified copy for collation). Because the building
      considered here requires installation or modification of the water
      main and hook-up to the sewage system, the application and
      proof of payment of the corresponding fees are attached.

      After registration of the construction statement, the one-stop
      shop (Ventanilla Única Delegacional) reviews the submitted data
      and documents and verifies the progress of the construction
      work under the terms stated in the Administrative Verification
      Rules (Reglamento de Verificación Administrativa) for the Federal
      District.

      construction work statement and the general construction work
      data, including the location and statement validity. The
      signboard must be posted in a visible place and legible from the
      public pathway.

      The validity of the statement (for construction work completion)
      is as follows:
      • Up to 300 square meters: 1 year
      • 300 -- 1,000 square meters: 2 years
      • More than 1,000 square meters: 3 years

      The cost breakdown for obtaining the building permit is the
      following:

      • Register: MXN 562.20 (DF Tax Code 2016 Article 185, Sec. B, fr.

      • Compensations for the Environment: MXN 43.38 x 1300.6 m2 =
      56,420.028 MXN (DF Tax Code 2016 Article 300)
      • Compensations for road impact: MXN 125.20 x 1300.6 m2 =
      161,835.9 MXN (DF Tax Code 2016 Article 301)
      • Rights for new water and sewage connection: MXN 306.68 x
      1300.6 m2= 398,868 MXN (DF Tax Code 2016 Article 302)

      TOTAL= 725,269.53 MXN

      • Water Connection: MXN 14,347.50 (DF Tax Code Article 181,
      Section A, fr. I, p. c)
      • Water measurer device: MXN 7,198.73 (DF Tax Code Article
      181, Section A, fr. III, p. c)

      • Water pipes usage fee: MXN 1,248.69 (DF Tax Code, Article 182,
      fr. III)

      TOTAL = 75,137.49

      Thus, the total cost to Register Construction Statement Type B
      based on "Codigo Fiscal del Distrito Federal" amended in
      December 2014 is the following: MXN 725,269.53 + MXN
      75,137.49 = MXN 800,407.016

      The cost for the water connection includes the installation of the
      main pipeline, board, and meter. The cost to connect to water
      and sewage services are included in this procedure since the
      proof of payment of such fees are needed to request connection
      to these utility services (procedure 10). The cost is established by

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

      The notary requests a commercial valuation of the property

      Sometimes parties have a previous valuation, and the notary can have it
      reviewed to see if it suffices. However, these previous valuations are
      usually not fiscal ones and therefore another one has to be done to
      determine the value of the property for the ISAI tax, but also for the VAT
      tax to which commercial constructions are subject to when transferred
      (please note that the land is not taxable under VAT, just the commercial
      constructions).

                    Mexico strengthened its secured transactions system by
DB2012              implementing a centralized collateral registry with an electronic
                    database that is accessible online.
                    Mexico improved access to credit by amending its insolvency
                    proceedings law and establishing clear grounds for relief from a
DB2015              stay of enforcement actions by secured creditors during
                    reorganization procedures. This reform applies to both Mexico
                    City and Monterrey.
                    Mexico improved access to credit by implementing a decree
DB2016              allowing a general description of assets granted as collateral.
                    This reform applies to both Mexico City and Monterrey.

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business
taxpayer service centers or allowing for more deductions          recorded in Mexico (table 8.1)?

                   Mexico increased taxes on companies by raising several tax
                   rates, including the corporate income tax and the rate on cash
DB2011             deposits. At the same time, the administrative burden was
                   reduced slightly with more options for online payment and
                   increased use of accounting software.
                   Mexico continued to ease the administrative burden of paying
                   taxes for firms by ending the requirement to file a yearly value
DB2012
                   added tax return and reduced filing requirements for other
                   taxes
                   Mexico made paying taxes easier for companies by abolishing
                   the business flat tax—though it also made paying taxes more
                   costly by allowing only a portion of salaries to be deductible.
DB2016
                   These changes apply to both Mexico City and Monterrey. In

                   for Mexico City.

the debtor’s estate. The average recovery rate is 69.1
cents on the dollar. Most indicator sets refer to a case

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                              The Law of the Commercial Insolvency Law (LCM) provides a unitary
                                              form of insolvency proceedings (concurso mercantil) which has two
                                              phases: Conciliation (reorganization) and Bankruptcy (Liquidation).

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
     Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless
       membership is mandatory.
The business:
     Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).

Doing Business introduced new data on job quality in 2015. Doing Business 2017 covers eight questions on job
quality (i) whether the law mandates equal remuneration for work of equal value; (ii) whether the law mandates
nondiscrimination based on gender in hiring; (iii) whether the law mandates paid or unpaid maternity leave; (iv)
the minimum length of paid maternity leave (in calendar days); (v) whether employees on maternity leave receive
100% of wages; (vi) the availability of five fully paid days of sick leave a year; (vii) whether a worker is eligible for
an unemployment protection scheme after one year of service; and (viii) the minimum duration of the contribution
period (in months) required for unemployment.

greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
