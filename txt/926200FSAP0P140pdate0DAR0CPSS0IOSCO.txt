EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Korea has a well-developed payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructures. BOK-WIRE+ is
the real-time interbank gross payment and settlement system, and the backbone of the
infrastructure where the final payments of various markets are settled. It is operated by the Bank of
Korea (BOK). The Korea Exchange (KRX) is the main player in the securities and derivatives market,
operating three exchanges and offering clearing and settlement services for all securities and
derivatives traded on the KRX. While the authorities have decided to establish a central
counterparty (CCP) for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives at a future date, discussions are ongoing
on the desirability of transforming the current trade reporting systems into full-fledged trade
repositories (TRs). The planned CCP for OTC derivatives should ensure full compliance with the
Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI) before being launched, taking into account
lessons learned from the assessment of the CCP for exchange-traded products.

BOK-Wire+ is largely compliant with the PFMI, and is overall sound. It is subject to
comprehensive and transparent risk management frameworks comprising clear policies and
guidelines, governance arrangements, and operational systems including regularly tested default
and business continuity procedures. All transactions once settled in BOK-Wire+ are deemed final
and irrevocable, as well as bankruptcy remote.

There is room for improvement in certain areas to enhance the level of compliance of the
BOK-Wire+ with the PFMI. It is recommended that the operator of BOK-Wire+ improves the
collateral risk management framework by adopting regular testing of haircuts and an independent
validation of haircut procedures at least annually. The BOK should provide more clarity in the
regulations regarding settlement finality and queue management, particularly with regard to
revocation of queued transactions. It should also fully implement the disclosure framework,
including disclosure of relevant rules and regulations in English. Finally, BOK’s oversight powers
should be strengthened, to include linked financial market infrastructures (FMIs) and participants,
particularly to obtain authentic information and enforce compliance.

The CCP of the KRX has taken steps to increase compliance with the PFMI. The CCP contributes
to the safety and efficiency of the securities and derivatives market in Korea, but also concentrates
systemic risk. Important steps to improve its risk management systems have been initiated in the
recent period such as the introduction of intraday margin calls, back testing and sensitivity analysis,
which need to be further implemented. The sizes of the joint compensation fund and settlement
reserves have been increased to strengthen the KRX’s financial protection against a potential
default of its clearing members. The introduction of the operational risk management system in
January 2013 enables the KRX to manage its companywide risks in a consistent and comprehensive
manner.

However, additional steps to further compliance of the CCP with the PFMI related to the
management of credit risks are warranted. The KRX should reform the credit risk management
framework for the securities market, by collecting risk-based collateral (margin) on a daily basis to




                                                                                                        5

cover the KRX’s exposures towards its clearing members between the transaction and settlement
days. The KRX should also reconsider the current design of its joint compensation funds, in
particular by removing the fixed size requirement of the fund to better adapt to increased
exposures. The KRX’s criteria for settlement banks and custodians should be increased. Finally, the
KRX’s risk management framework, and in particular its margin model, should be reviewed and
validated by an experienced and independent entity, such as an academic or a consultant.

The independence of the KRX risk management committee should be improved and the size
of staff responsible for the management of credit and liquidity risk should be increased. The
committee, although independent of the business departments, is chaired by an executive director
who is also responsible for strategy and planning, and therefore not fully independent from
business related matters. Staffing levels in the risk management team and the clearing and
settlement department responsible for risk management is small compared to the scope of their
responsibilities; it should be increased. More generally, the focus of the KRX on the safety and
efficiency of the CCP should be increased, for example by placing higher priority on the safety and
efficiency of the CCP and on financial stability in the KRX’s company objectives.

Recovery planning for CCPs has recently been introduced as a tool to reduce the potential
burden for tax payers. CCPs should maintain viable plans with preventive measures for restoring
the CCP’s ability to operate as a going concern. In drafting a recovery plan the KRX should decide
which of its operations are critical to continue in times of crisis. The KRX should also develop crisis
scenarios that go beyond the default procedures and business continuity plans. The scenarios may
cover extreme but plausible events, such as the default of a large participant that is part of a
financial group that provides multiple services to the KRX, such as settlement and custody activities
combined with a decrease in the value of assets widely used as collateral.

The overlap in responsibilities among the Financial Services Committee (FSC) and the BOK
hampers effective regulation, supervision, and oversight of the KRX CCP. Overlap in regulation
between central banks and market regulation is common in many countries. Authorities in those
countries should ensure the effectiveness of supervision and oversight by appropriate cooperation
and coordination arrangements. The mission is of the opinion that the BOK and the FSC do not
appropriately cooperate in the regulation, supervision and oversight of the FMIs in Korea, in
particular with regard to the KRX and the Korea Securities Depository (KSD). Formal cooperation
among the BOK and FSC at the highest level has not been used to discuss any matters related to
FMIs. The cooperation at the technical level is informal, without adequate agreements that
supported the BOK in effectively exercising its oversight responsibilities.

It is therefore recommended to formalize the cooperation among the BOK and FSC at a more
technical level, for example the FSC capital markets division and the BOK payment systems
policy team. Such a cooperative framework could be in the form of a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) to ensure effective coordination between the BOK and FSC where their roles
as regulators overlap. It should enable the BOK to ensure that its suggestions are implemented and
to confirm the authenticity and completeness of the information submitted by the FMIs. The BOK
and FSC should “speak with one voice” to avoid any inefficiencies in their communication towards

the KRX and KSD. It should also allow the FSC to benefit from relevant information that is obtained
by the BOK during international meetings or meetings with the FMI operations council. The
authorities should develop a crisis management framework allowing timely coordination in case of
an operational or financial crisis.

To further improve the regulatory structure for FMIs it is recommended to increase the
powers of the BOK and the resources of the FSC. There is a need to amend the existing statute
to provide the BOK with enforcement tools to effectively discharge its oversight responsibilities.
Also, although the FSC staff has good knowledge and is relatively effective in its activities the work
load is considered too large for one staff member, especially given the complexity of the topic and
the two year rotation policy of the FSC. An increase in resources will support a proactive policy
approach and a more effective guidance of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) by the FSC.

BACKGROUND, KEY FINDINGS, AND FOLLOW-UP
A. Introduction

Assessor and objectives

1.      This report contains the assessments of the BOK-Wire+ and KRX CCP based on the
PFMI. The assessment was undertaken in the context of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s)
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to the Republic of Korea in April and July 2013. The
assessors were Gynedi Srinivas of the World Bank’s Payment Systems Development Group and
Froukelien Wendt of the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department. The assessors would like
to thank the Korean counterparts for their excellent cooperation and generous hospitality.

2.       The objective of the assessment has been to identify potential risks related to the
FMIs that may affect financial stability. While safe and efficient FMIs contribute to maintaining
and promoting financial stability and economic growth, they may also concentrate risk. If not
properly managed, FMIs can be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and credit
losses, or a major channel through which these shocks are transmitted across domestic and
international financial markets.

Scope of the assessment

3.     The scope of the assessment includes two main FMIs as well as the authorities in
Korea responsible for regulation, supervision, and oversight of FMIs. The BOK-Wire+ and the
KRX CCP are assessed against all relevant principles of the PFMI. The authorities, being the BOK, the
FSC, and the FSS, are assessed using the responsibilities for authorities of FMIs. Unlike the BOK-
Wire+ system the KRX-CCP has not been assessed earlier during an FSAP.

B. Methodology and Information used for the Assessment

4.      The information used in the assessment includes relevant national laws, regulations,
rules, and procedures governing the systems and other available material. Other available
material included annual reports; self assessments; responses to the IMF questionnaire; websites
from the regulators, overseers, supervisors, operators and stakeholders, and other relevant
documents.1 In addition, discussions were held with regulators, overseers, and supervisors, being
the BOK, FSC, and FSS. The assessment also benefited from discussions with the KRX, the KSD, and
main stakeholders.

5.     At the request of the IMF the authorities conducted self assessments. The BOK
prepared a self assessment of the BOK-Wire+ system, whereas the FSC conducted an assessment of

the KRX-CCP. Both self assessments were based on the PFMI. The self assessment included an
assessment of the responsibilities of the Korean authorities.

6.       The assessment is based on information available in July 2013. Information available
after July 2013 has not been taken into account in determining the assessment ratings.

C. Overview of the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Landscape

7.       Korea’s payment, clearing, and settlement infrastructure consists of a consolidated set
of systemically important FMIs (see Figure 1). The BOK-Wire+ is the interbank payment system
and the backbone of the infrastructure in which the ultimate payments of various markets are
settled. The KRX is the main player in the securities and derivatives market, operating three
exchanges, which are (i) the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) market; (ii) the Korean
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (KOSDAQ) market; and (iii) the derivatives market (DM). In
addition, the KRX offers CCP services to all these markets and has a majority stake in the KSD, which
is a securities settlement system, central securities depository (CSD), and maintains the register for
all securities traded on the KRX. Discussions are ongoing on the desirability to transform the current
trade reporting systems into full-fledged TRs. Also, the authorities have decided to introduce a CCP
for OTC derivatives in 2014.

8.      The KRX is the main securities and derivatives market operator in Korea and is one of
the largest exchanges worldwide. The KRX opened for trading in 1956 with 12 listed companies. It
grew rapidly, supported by government policies that fostered the capital market as a means to
support economic development and encourage companies to go public. The KRX introduced
continuous trading in 1975, and automated its order-routing system in 1983. In 1997, the trading
and clearing systems were fully automated and the KRX began to operate without the trading floor.
Futures and options have been available for trading in Korea since 1996 and 1997, respectively. In
2012, the KRX ranked number one as the exchange with the highest number of stock index option
contracts traded in the world. It was number five measured in value of bond trading and number
eight in value of share trading.

BOK-Wire+

9.      The BOK-Wire+ is the hybrid real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system which is owned
and operated by the BOK. The BOK has been operating Korea’s large-value payment system, the
BOK-Wire, since December 1994. BOK-Wire was used for the transfer and settlement of funds
between financial institutions having current accounts with the BOK. With the growing increase in
settlement volumes and the need to save participants’ intraday liquidity, the BOK launched a plan to
upgrade the BOK-Wire in May 2005. BOK-Wire was replaced with BOK-Wire+ in 2009, which has a
hybrid settlement function using continuous bilateral and multilateral offsetting mechanisms added
to the RTGS system. Table 1 provides details on the RTGS and hybrid settlement functions. The BOK-
Wire+ is used for the settlement of all short-term financial transactions (general funds transfers,
interbank short-term lending/borrowing, third-party funds transfers), the cash leg of securities
transactions, the Korean won (KRW) leg of foreign exchange settlement and the settlement of retail

payment systems. BOK-Wire+ is also used for the implementation of BOK monetary policy
operations and for the issuance and redemption of government and other public bonds.

Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act, enacted in 2006, stipulates that transactions settled in the BOK-
Wire+ are exempt from bankruptcy proceedings.

11.      Participants in the BOK-Wire+ are both banks and nonbanks who must open current
accounts with the BOK. Local and foreign banks, insurance companies, securities dealers and
brokers, government agencies, and the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) bank are allowed to
open current accounts with the BOK. Participants should be financially sound, devote an adequate
number of staff to BOK-Wire+ operations, and generate sufficient volumes. Participant requirements
are laid down by the governor of the BOK in line with the principles set out by the monetary policy
committee (MPC), which is the ultimate decision-making body.

12.     In June 2010, the BOK implemented a tiered participation model in BOK-Wire+.
Indirect participants send and receive large-value transfers through direct participants. The BOK
reviews the participant access criteria on an annual basis.

13.     Participants in the BOK-Wire+ hold two types of accounts—a current account and a
deposit account for settlement. The current account is used for the settlement of transactions in
the RTGS system and is used for fund transfers for BOK loans, government and public bond
transactions, and CLS and retail payment system settlements. General fund transfers, short-term
interbank lending/borrowing, and the cash leg of securities transactions are settled in the hybrid
system using the deposit account for settlement.

14.    The BOK provides intraday credit to participants facing temporary liquidity shortages
through intraday overdrafts, and intraday repo in BOK-Wire+.2 The BOK is able to provide
settlement liquidity as it is the sole issuer of legal tender in Korea, taken together with its mandate
to promptly intervene in the market in times of crisis to provide loans to participants in order to
prevent delays in settlement caused by temporary liquidity shortages. Participants’ intraday
settlement liquidity needs have reduced considerably since the introduction of BOK-Wire+.

15.     Queuing arrangements are different in the RTGS and the hybrid components of the
BOK-Wire+. Payment orders in the RTGS system are processed using the bypass FIFO (first in, first
out) rule. In the hybrid system, the participants can change the priority of the message from urgent
to normal and vice versa to facilitate settlement. All other transactions such as netted retail payment
system settlements, receipt of treasury funds from financial institutions and redemptions of
short-term loans with specified maturities are processed and settled at designated times.



2
  Liquidity adjustment loan is an overnight standing facility provided by the BOK with its interest rate pegged above
the Base Rate depending on the day on which the loan is taken by the participant.

The KRX securities and derivatives clearing and settlement systems

16.      The KRX operates two markets for securities, which are the KOSPI and KOSDAQ
markets. The KOSPI market is the main securities market for stocks and bonds. Stocks can be
shares, investment funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and securitized derivatives. Bonds can be
corporate and government bonds, including monetary stabilization bonds and bonds of the Korea
deposit insurance corporation (KDIC). The KOSDAQ market is a dedicated market for small and
medium-sized businesses. At the end of 2012 a total of 1,784 companies were listed at the KRX
representing a market capitalization of USD 1,179 billion. Listing and trading of foreign shares is still
modest, with 17 foreign companies, representing a trading volume of USD 4 billion in 2012. Table 2
provides some key statistics for the securities market.

17.     The KRX also operates the DM, which was the largest derivatives market worldwide for
stock index options in 2012. The DM opened in 1996 with the introduction of index futures based
on KRX's main benchmark stock index, the KRX KOSPI 200. KOSPI 200 options were introduced in
1997 and government bond futures and US dollar derivatives in 1999. The DM also offers trading in
commodity and currency options. Table 3 provides some key statistics for the derivatives market.

 18.      The KRX CCP clears all products that are traded on the KRX securities and derivatives
 markets and is of systemic importance to the financial system of Korea. A default of the KRX
 CCP has the potential to highly disrupt the domestic financial markets as potentially many financial
 institutions may be affected by its losses and no alternative CCP is operational within Korea. The
 values cleared by the CCP indicate what markets are of particular systemic importance. The value of
 trading of the KRX stock markets relates to GDP with a factor 1.3, the government bond market with
 a factor of nearly 1, the stock index option market with a factor 4.4, and the stock index future
 market with a factor of 6.2. The systemic importance of the KRX CCP will further increase with the
 introduction of OTC derivatives clearing.

 19.     The main role of the KRX-CCP is to guarantee the settlement of securities and
 derivatives in case of default of one or more of its participants. In its role as CCP, the KRX
 assumes settlement obligations, performs multilateral trade netting, and confirms settlement of
 funds and securities in accordance with the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act
 (FSCMA). The KRX has established a risk management framework to protect itself against exposures
 from its members. As a first line of defense, the KRX has established participation requirements for
 clearing members, which are stricter than the access criteria for trading members. The aim of the




                                                                                                                             13
REPUBLIC OF KOREA




risk management framework is to cover potential losses in the securities market by the joint
compensation fund for securities and settlement reserves, whereas potential losses in the
derivatives market should be covered by margin, the joint compensation fund for derivatives, and
settlement reserves. The joint compensation fund consists of contributions from clearing members,
whereas the settlement reserves are funds of the KRX dedicated to cover potential losses resulting
from the guarantee function of the KRX CCP.

20.     Cash settlement is conducted both in central bank money and in commercial bank
money. The cash leg of most securities transactions, except for general bonds,3 is settled in the
BOK-Wire+ system. The cash payments following derivatives transactions are settled in the books of
six commercial banks, which are called settlement banks. The settlement banks also act as custodian
banks, keeping the cash collateral deposited by clearing members on behalf of the KRX.

21.     The CCP is integrated into the KRX organization and is part of the same legal entity.
The departments responsible for the CCP activities are the clearing and settlement department, the
risk management team, and the membership team. The clearing and settlement department is
responsible for the regulations and operations of the CCP. The clearing and settlement department
falls under the DM business division, although it also manages the CCP activities for the securities
divisions. The risk management team and membership team fall under the management strategy
division. These teams are responsible for the company wide risk management framework and the
membership management and monitoring respectively. In addition, the risk management
committee is responsible at board level for the approval of risk management policies and
regulations and sets risk limits for the company. Figure 2 illustrates the organization structure of the
KRX.

22.     The KRX is a corporation owned by the members, market-related organizations, and
treasury stock of the KRX. The 36 member firms together have the largest stake (88.17 percent),
followed by the 3 market-related firms (7.21 percent) and the KRX treasury (4.62 percent). The KRX
has two subsidiaries. The KRX owns a stake of 76.63 percent in the KOSCOM. The KOSCOM is an
information technology (IT) company responsible for the development and operations of the trading
and clearing systems. The KSD is the CSD and is owned by the KRX for 70.41 percent.

23.     The KSD is the sole CSD in Korea, established as a special corporation under the
FSCMA. The KSD is the securities settlement system (SSS) and CSD for all securities listed and
traded on the KRX markets. The KSD also settles securities that are traded OTC. In 2012, the value of
stocks traded OTC was USD 999 billion, which is approximately two-thirds of the value of exchange
traded stocks. Bonds are more heavily traded in the OTC market compared to the value of exchange
transactions in bonds, with a value of more than USD 6 trillion in 2012. Since 2013 the KSD acts as
the CCP for institutional settlements in OTC traded stocks, bonds, repos, and securities lending.

24.      Settlement procedures differ for different types of instruments traded. Table 4 outlines
the differences per market. For stocks and bonds traded on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets, the
KRX notifies its members and the KSD of the settlement details. Settlement takes place on T+2 for
stocks, T+1 for government bonds, and T+0 for general bonds using a delivery versus payment
(DVP) model 3 in all cases. OTC transactions are also settled by the KSD. Institutional stock
transactions are settled on T+2 using a DVP model 2 arrangement. Bond transactions are settled on
T+1 using a DVP model 1 arrangement, whereas other stocks are settled on T+2 using a DVP model
2 arrangement. The settlement of the securities is in all cases conditional upon the payment of the
cash.

Regulation, supervision, and oversight of Financial Market Infrastructures

25.      The KRX is regulated, supervised and overseen by the FSC and BOK based on statutory
law. The regulation and supervision of the FSC is based on the FSCMA. The KRX needs approval
from the FSC to amend its regulations. The FSC is empowered to induce change by using a range of
disciplinary measures as described in the FSCMA. The Bank of Korea Act (BOK Act) stipulates that
the BOK shall play a principal role in overseeing payment and settlement systems. The BOK Act
provides the legal ground for the BOK to collect information, perform assessments, request
improvement, and monitor any payment and settlement systems.

26.       Where the FSC is the government organization responsible for the regulation and
supervision of the KRX it may request the FSS to conduct inspections. The FSCMA prescribes
that the FSS may inspect the business, financial status, books, documents, or other materials related
to the KRX. The governor of the FSS has to report the result of the inspection to the FSC. In case the
KRX is found to violate the rules the FSS may advice the FSC on any disciplinary measures. Figure 4
illustrates the regulatory structure for FMIs in Korea.

27.        A reform agenda is currently being discussed for OTC derivatives clearing. Since 2008,
the financial supervisory authorities, the BOK, and major market participants have jointly discussed
how to enhance the efficiency and safety of OTC derivatives market activities in Korea. In the light
of market growth and the lessons learnt from the recent global financial crisis, the decision has
been taken to build a new infrastructure for the OTC derivatives market, including a CCP and a
trade repository. While the details are still being discussed by a task force established in February
2010, the instruments most likely to be subject to CCP clearing are interest rate swaps. The FSC
completed the legislative process in July 2013. The launch date of the OTC derivatives CCP is
expected in 2014.

D. Key Findings and Follow up for the BOK-WIRE+

General organization (Principle 1-3)

28.     The BOK has a well-founded and clear legal and regulatory framework governing the
operations of the BOK-Wire+ and its participants' rights and obligations. The BOK Act and the
relevant regulations articulate the legal basis for the BOK-Wire+ to participants and the public in a
clear and understandable way. The rules and regulations are enforceable and in accordance with
the relevant acts. The relevant jurisdiction for each legal aspect is Korea. The regulation lists the
various settlement services made available in the BOK-Wire+. While this provides an implicit




18
                                                                                           REPUBLIC OF KOREA




understanding that the settlement through BOK-Wire+ is final, it is suggested that an explicit clause
to this effect is inserted in the regulation.5 Further, the BOK could consider articulating its legal
basis in a better manner by providing hyperlinks or placing the relevant acts and regulations on its
payments systems webpage.

29.      The BOK has an explicit commitment towards the safety and efficiency of the
payment system as a whole. This is laid down in article 81 (1) of the BOK Act. The BOK also
explicitly supports and works towards financial stability in terms of article 1 of the BOK Act. These
two articles read in conjunction with article 28 of the BOK Act reinforcing the objectives of safety,
efficiency, and financial stability. Risk management decisions related to BOK-Wire+ are taken by or
reported to the MPC, the ultimate decision-making body. The internal audit department audits the
operation of BOK-Wire+. The National Assembly and the board of audit and inspection, a
government agency, audit the operations of BOK-Wire+ as well. A consultative committee of
participants in the BOK-Wire+ has been established. The committee meets at least twice a year to
discuss various issues relating to risk management, business procedures, standardization of IT
systems, and fees. When the BOK changes its major policies with respect to payment and
settlement systems, it must notify the relevant institutions in advance and collect their opinions. The
revised policy changes are placed on the website of the BOK and are also notified to the
participants. The changes are also reflected in the annual payment and settlement systems report
which is placed on the website of the BOK. It is suggested that issues related to governance could
be considered for inclusion as a separate chapter in the annual payment and settlement systems
report.

30.     The main risk that the BOK has identified relates to the interdependency between
systemically important FMIs in Korea, including BOK-Wire+, and their participants. Other
systemically important systems, such as the KRX systems, CLS, and the retail payment systems
conduct their ultimate settlements in BOK-Wire+. The BOK recognizes that any operational
disruptions in BOK-Wire+ could cause risks to the participants and other FMIs, leading to increased
credit and liquidity risks. Delays in settlement and operational disruptions in other FMIs could be
potential sources of risk to BOK-Wire+, in terms of pending payment instructions and queue
management related issues, leading to an extension of operating hours of the BOK-Wire+ system. If
needed an emergency response committee is set up and necessary action is taken. The business
continuity plan (BCP) is reviewed annually. The BCP for the BOK-Wire+ deals with 12 potential
scenarios. The BCP scenarios also take into account the nonavailability of the systems of operators
of FMIs like the KRX, KSD, and the Korea Financial Telecommunications and Clearing Institute
(KFTC)6 on a system-by-system basis. It is recommended to develop in addition scenarios that deal
with the simultaneous disruption of more than one FMI.

Credit and liquidity risk management (Principle 4–7)

31.      The BOK’s exposure to credit risk is limited as it provides intra-day credit to
participants on a fully collateralized basis; however, the collateral framework could be
enhanced. The collateral management system is operated efficiently through a link with the KSD,
which keeps the government securities that the BOK accepts as collateral. The assets that are
accepted as collateral are subject to a haircut, have low credit and market risks and are highly
liquid. However, details regarding testing the sufficiency of the haircut, stress-testing, and pro-
cyclicality are not available. Details of any independent validation taking place on an annual basis
are also not available. There is a need to increase the frequency of the review of the haircut
methodology taking into account the above aspects including an independent validation of the
methodology on an annual basis. In addition, stress testing scenarios should include adverse
market conditions in line with the PFMI requirements.

32.      Liquidity risk in the BOK-Wire+ system is minimized due to the provision of an
intraday liquidity facility by the BOK to the participants in the BOK-Wire+ system. Moreover,
the hybrid settlement system significantly reduced the liquidity needs of the participants. The BOK
as operator of the system monitors the settlement and payment flows in BOK-Wire+ system on a
real time basis and initiates measures if required to smoothen payment flows. The differential
pricing fees mechanism also contributes to smoothening payment flows throughout the operating
hours of the BOK-Wire+ system. Nevertheless, there is a concentration of settlement transactions
after 4.00 pm, due to incoming settlements from the KRX, and settlement of call loans and repo
transactions (which are the principal sources of liquidity for Financial Investment Companies (FICs)).
In view of the above, an impact study on the impact of differential pricing on payment flows may be
undertaken by the BOK.

Settlement (Principle 8–10)

33.     Settlement of payment transfers in BOK-Wire+ is achieved in real-time and payments
once settled are final and irrevocable; cash settlement happens in central bank money. The
BOK-Wire+ provides for finality of settlement as set out in article 5 of the relevant BOK-Wire+
regulation, in which the various types of settlement services provided by BOK-Wire+ are specified.
However, the regulation and working regulation7 do not explicitly define the point at which
settlement is deemed final. The provisions in article 5 are implicit statements regarding the
settlement finality being made available in BOK-Wire+. Further, participants can cancel/revoke a
payment instruction which is placed in a queue. Revocation and cancellation can only be done with
the consent of a pre-arranged funds beneficiary institution. It is accordingly recommended that
relevant articles in the regulation and working regulation be appropriately amended to emphasize
and reflect these positions.

 The regulation and working regulation are respectively the ROMPSS and the Working Regulation on Operation
and Management of Payment and Settlement Systems (WROMPSS).

Central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems (Principle 11,
12)

34.     DVP and payment versus payment (PVP) settlement mechanisms are being used for
the settlement of securities and foreign exchange transactions respectively in central bank
money in the BOK-Wire+. Adoption of these forms of settlement has led to the elimination of
principal risk.

Default management (Principle 13, 14)

35.     The BOK has rules and procedures governing the disposal of collateral of a defaulting
participant with respect to the intra-day liquidity facilities provided by the BOK. These rules
and procedures are publicly available on the BOK webpage. In addition, when the rules and
procedures are revised, the BOK reflects the opinions of the relevant institutions and provides
guidance to participants through BOK-Wire+ before the date of effect of such revision.

General business and operational risk management (Principle 15–17)

36.     To manage operational risk, the BOK has established comprehensive operational
management guidelines covering technology, risk factors, human resources, monitoring,
control, and periodical testing. It has a recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours. The BCP is
developed in line with the relevant regulation and working regulation and relevant sub-regulations
and deals with 12 potential scenarios. These are found to be adequate in tackling operational risk
and ensuring the continuity of operations of BOK-Wire+. The BCP scenarios also take into account
the nonavailability of the systems of operators of FMIs like the KRX, KSD, and the KFTC on a system-
by-system basis. However, it is desirable to develop a more holistic approach taking into account a
disaster scenario when the operations of more than one FMI are disrupted.

37.       KSD is assessed once every two years by BOK as part of its oversight activity. Given the
critical nature of the FMI, the BOK could consider assessing the FMI at more frequent intervals.

Access (Principle 18–20)

38.     BOK-Wire+ has fair and open access criteria for participation, which comprehensively
considers each participant’s risk management capability, the stable and efficient operation of
BOK-Wire+, and the possibility of systemic risk. Though tiered participation arrangements are in
place, the risks of indirect participation in BOK-Wire+ are very small because the scope of usage
through indirect participation is limited and transactions of indirect participants through direct
participants can be identified and monitored in real time. While this being so, it is not clear as to
how the BOK monitors that direct participants are putting through transactions on behalf of indirect
participants which are limited to the availability of funds in the indirect participants account with
the direct participant. The BOK may consider seeking a periodical statement to this effect from the
direct participants.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA




Efficiency (Principle 21, 22)

39.      The operational objectives stipulated in the relevant regulations on BOK-Wire+ have
been fulfilled. BOK-Wire+ is operated efficiently and its system design has been developed to
reflect the needs of the participants and the financial markets.

40.      BOK-Wire+ uses international standards for communicating with participants, and
international messaging service providers such as SWIFT to communicate with CLS bank. The
initiative to migrate to ISO 20022 message standards may be initiated and completed.

Transparency (Principle 23, 24)

41.     The BOK-Wire+ regulation and its sub-regulations are disclosed through the website
of the BOK and, to facilitate participants’ understanding of BOK-Wire+, the BOK provides
them with manuals and guidebooks. The BOK plans to use the disclosure framework published
by the CPSS-IOSCO in December 2012. In addition, the BOK should also make the relevant
information and data it discloses, in a language commonly used in financial markets in addition to
the domestic language.

E. Key Findings and Follow-up for the KRX-CCP

General organization (Principle 1–3)

42.      The legal basis for the KRX-CCP is generally sound and enforceable. The FSCMA and
the KRX market regulations sufficiently describe the organization and responsibilities of the KRX.
The Debt Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act provides for a firm statutory foundation for netting,
set-off and closing out of positions. There’s a high certainty that the KRX regulations, procedures
and contracts are enforceable in the Korean jurisdiction. A third country financial institution which
intends to apply for KRX membership has to establish a local entity or a branch to get a business
license from the FSC as a financial investment trader or financial investment broker.

43.     There is room to improve the legal framework in the normal course of business. The
regulatory framework could be further improved by increasing its clarity. The relevant provisions for
CCP clearing are currently comingled with concepts related to the KRX trading activities. The KRX



22
                                                                                     REPUBLIC OF KOREA




regulations could make better use of the internationally used concepts, in particular the concepts
used in the PFMI. Finally, as the KRX currently has not developed a recovery plan the regulatory
framework has no explicit provisions that support recovery activities.

44.    The governance arrangements of the KRX are transparent and the roles and
responsibilities of its board and management are clearly described and publicly available.
Nonexecutive directors are appointed to represent public interests. The KRX has established a risk
management committee and a risk management department to identify, monitor, and manage
companywide risks as well as CCP-related risks. The risk management department reports to the
board and the board endorses major decisions.

45.      The governance arrangements do however contain some gaps and issues of concern
that should be addressed in a defined timeline. The risk management committee is, although
independent of the business departments, chaired by an executive director who is also responsible
for strategy and planning, and therefore not fully independent from business related matters. The
risk management team and the clearing and settlement department, that are responsible for the
management of credit and liquidity risks, is small compared to the scope of their responsibilities. It
is therefore recommended to extend staff resources dedicated to risk management. Finally, the
objectives of the KRX do not place a particular high priority on the safety and efficiency of the KRX-
CCP. It is recommended to include the safety and efficiency of the CCP as one of the objectives of
the KRX and explicitly state that the KRX CCP intends to support financial stability.

46.     The KRX has developed a companywide risk management framework, consisting of
policies, tools, governance arrangements, and default procedures for managing credit,
liquidity, operational, and market risks. The risk management framework has recently been
implemented and requires business departments and the market oversight department to identify,
monitor, and manage its risks. In addition to this bottom-up approach the KRX board decides on
risk management limits. The risk management framework is reviewed on an annual basis and
includes risks related to external stakeholders, such as settlement banks, the KSD, and the BOK. The
risk management framework is regularly assessed through independent audits.

47.     The KRX has not started with the development of plans for recovery or orderly wind
down. The KRX should decide which of its operations are critical to continue in times of crisis.
The KRX should also develop crisis scenarios that go beyond the default procedures and business
continuity plans. The scenarios may cover extreme but plausible events, such as the default of a
large participant that is part of a financial group that provides multiple services to the KRX, such as
settlement and custody activities and a simultaneous decrease in the value of its collateral. The lack
of such a plan is an issue of concern, given the size of systemic importance of the KRX-CCP and the
impact of a potential failure of KRX on the financial stability in Korea.

Credit and liquidity risk management (Principle 4–7)

48.     The KRX has identified various sources of credit and liquidity risks related to its CCP
activities. The KRX has developed the settlement risk management system that monitors credit




                                                                                                     23
REPUBLIC OF KOREA




exposures per clearing account in real time. For the derivatives markets credit risks are in general
properly identified and monitored. The KRX manages credit risks in the derivatives markets by
collecting margin, joint compensation fund contributions and by allocating its settlement reserves
to cover credit losses. The KRX uses daily stress testing to determine the sufficiency of its financial
resources available in the event of a clearing member’s default in extreme but plausible market
conditions. The KRX has defined a risk management waterfall for the use of financial resources in
case of credit losses. The legal and regulatory framework supports this framework.

49.     For the derivatives market the CCP covers its credit exposures to its clearing members
through a margining system,8 which is based on internationally used margin models. The
margin model is risk based and comprises both initial and variation margin. The initial margin is
determined per product group based on the maximum net loss, calculated with a 99.7 confidence
level and using a 2-day close-out period. The scenarios used for calculating volatility margins are
based on price changes in the underlying assets and option volatility. The KRX allows for offsets in a
conservative way. Currently, the CCP does not have the operational capacity to make intraday
margin calls, although it has plans to implement intraday margin calling in 2014.

50.     The KRX has taken an important step by starting the development of a
comprehensive risk management framework for the securities market. The KRX started to
investigate the introduction of securities margin, as securities volumes are large and the KRX is
exposed to credit losses between the trading and settlement day. Currently, potential credit loss is
covered by the joint compensation fund for the securities market. As the size of the joint
compensation fund is defined in the regulations it is not possible for KRX to adapt the fund to
accommodate increased exposures in the securities market in a timely manner.

51.     Despite these positive developments several features of the credit risk management
framework are not in line with the PFMI requirements and potentially pose risk to the
market. The credit risk management models, including the margin models, are not validated by an
independent entity, such as its regulators or an external expert, such as an academic or consultancy
bureau. The models are also not subject to back testing and sensitivity analysis. It is therefore not
possible to assess whether the margin models sufficiently cover credit exposures in the derivatives
market. The concept of affiliated members is not yet considered in the credit risk management
framework of the KRX. The risk management waterfall should better reflect the suggestion of the
PFMI that part of the KRX capital should be taken before the financial resources of surviving
clearing members can be used (skin in the game).

52.    The KRX has established clear policies regarding eligible collateral and has tools to set
and enforce conservative haircuts. The KRX can further improve its collateral management by
implementing collateral limits. The KRX accepts a broad range of assets as collateral, including
domestic and foreign cash, listed bonds, U.S. government bonds and listed securities. In practice,


8
    The margining system is called the Composite Optimized Margin System (COMS).




24
                                                                                     REPUBLIC OF KOREA




the majority of collateral is deposited in government bonds. Collateral is marked to market on a
daily basis, except for bond securities which are marked to market on a weekly basis. The KRX
should implement a stress testing framework for collateral.

53.      The KRX does have an effective framework for the management of liquidity risks,
consisting of a liquidity guideline and access to credit lines that are sufficiently large. The KRX
is able to identify, measure, and monitor its settlement and funding flows on an ongoing basis. The
KRX stress tests its liquidity needs both daily and monthly and reports its findings on a quarterly
basis to the risk management committee. The KRX does not stress its liquidity needs for foreign
currencies, as settlements in foreign currencies are low. If needed the KRX can draw on an FX credit
line with one of its liquidity providers. The liquidity providers need to comply with specific criteria
set out in KRX rules. The KRX does not rely on central bank money; however, its largest liquidity
provider has a public profile and a triple A credit rating.

Settlement (Principle 8–10)

54.     Securities settlements are final as soon as the settlement account has been debited or
credited, which occurs real time during the settlement day. Derivatives transactions are final as
soon as the KRX has determined the net obligation per clearing member, following a transaction.
The Debt Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act protects the KRX against any insolvency proceedings
following the bankruptcy of a clearing member.

55.      The KRX conducts its money settlements for the securities market in central bank
money and for the derivatives markets through commercial banks. The main reason for using
commercial bank money for derivatives is that the majority of clearing members active in
derivatives trading do not have direct access to the BOK-Wire+. The KRX therefore uses the
accounts of six commercial banks to settle cash following derivatives transactions. The KRX has a
limited set of criteria to select its settlement banks. Banks should be regulated and supervised and
have a capital ratio of at least 8 percent. It monitors compliance with these criteria on a monthly
basis. The KRX does not impose additional requirements, such as creditworthiness, access to
liquidity, and operational reliability. The KRX should increase its requirements for settlement banks
and monitor compliance with these requirements regularly. It may also consider including an
expiration date in its contracts with the settlement banks to provide incentives to the settlement
banks to continue to provide adequate services and reduce risks.

56.     The DM business regulations and enforcement rules specify processes, procedures
and controls to monitor and manage the delivery process and associated risks related to the
physical delivery of gold derivatives. The KRX requests the deposit of physical delivery margin to
cover potential losses in case one of the counterparties is not able to fulfill its obligations in the
delivery process. In addition, rules and procedures are in place to protect the KRX against any losses
related to the damage of gold bars.




                                                                                                    25
REPUBLIC OF KOREA




Central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems (Principle 11,
12)

57.      The KRX eliminates principal risk by applying DVP arrangements for the settlement of
the different products that it clears. The arrangements ensure final settlement with conditional
final settlement of one obligation upon the final settlement of the other. Different DVP models are
used to ensure efficiency and accommodate the needs of different markets and different market
participants.

Default management (Principle 13, 14)

58.     The KRX has developed default rules and procedures to manage a participant’s
default. The KRX has appropriate discretionary power to implement these rules. The rules do
include the necessary actions to be taken by the KRX, potential changes to normal settlement
practices, the treatment of proprietary and customer transactions and accounts, and the existence
of other mechanisms that may be activated, such as an auction. The default manual is tested on an
annual yearly basis. Key stakeholders are involved in the testing. The KRX rules and regulations
could articulate certain key aspects in a more extensive way, such as the actions that an FMI can
take when a default is declared and the extent to which such actions are automatic or discretionary.
The internal plan should be reviewed by its management and the relevant board committees at
least annually or after any significant changes to the FMI’s arrangements.

59.     Segregation and portability arrangements are in place for the securities and
derivatives market. The account structures of the KRX, KSD, settlement banks, and clearing
members segregate the clearing member’s proprietary assets from its customer assets. The
segregation and portability arrangements are supported by the legal framework. The relevant laws
and regulations are publicly disclosed. Although the KRX is not able to monitor individual client
positions during normal business it has the power to ensure timely transfer of customer accounts
from the failing participant to another participant in times of crisis. The CCP should extend its
regulatory provisions on portability arrangements for the securities market and use similar rules for
the securities market as are currently available for the derivatives market.

General business and operational risk management (Principle 15–17)

60.      The KRX has a system in place to identify potential general business risks, which
includes risks related to the introduction of new products and services. The KRX holds
sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity so that it can continue operations and services as a
going concern if it incurs general business losses. However, as the KRX does not have a plan for
recovery or orderly wind-down, no explicit link is drawn by the KRX between the size of its liquid
net assets and the length of time required to maintain its critical operations and services. Assets

additional equity if needed. The potential recovery plan of the CCP should link the size of the
available liquid net assets and the length of time requirement to maintain critical operations and

services. It should also contain a reassessment of the sufficiency of the size of the settlement
reserves.

61.     The KRX holds its own and its participants’ assets at supervised and regulated entities,
but the KRX should enhance the monitoring of its custodians. The KRX’ selection criteria for
custodians and subsequent monitoring systems should be upgraded to ensure that these entities
have robust accounting practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls that fully protect
the assets held in custody. The maximum allowed concentration of settlement flows is set at
60 percent, however the KRX may analyze whether it is able to withstand the default of a custodian
holding 60 percent of assets and adapt the percentage if needed. The KRX’s investment strategy
allows only investments in cash, government bonds and monetary stabilization bonds, which
supports timely liquidation. The KRX should disclose its investment policy in English.

62.      The KRX has an operational risk management framework in place consisting of
systems, policies, procedures, and controls to identify, monitor, and manage operational
risks. Its procedures ensure scalable capacity adequate to handle increasing stress volumes. The
KRX recently developed policies for physical and information security policies. A BCP is in place, as
well as a secondary and third site. The BCP is regularly tested with all relevant stakeholders. The
RTO is 3 hours, which allows for same day settlement, but is not fully in line with the prescribed
RTO of 2 hours by the PFMI.

Access (Principle 18–20)

63.       The access criteria of the CCP allow for fair and open access to its services based on
reasonable risk-related participation requirements. The KRX has publicly disclosed procedures
for facilitating the suspension and orderly exit of a participant that no longer meets the
participation requirements.

64.      The current legal framework does not allow the KRX to monitor settlement positions
of individual customers. Subsequently, the KRX is not able to monitor positions at that level. The
KRX’s regulations regulate the relationship between its participants and its indirect participants. The
KRX is however able to regularly identify indirect participants responsible for large positions in the
DM market. It should increase its possibilities to identify risks from tiered participation in the
securities market.

Efficiency (Principle 21, 22)

65.      The KRX has arrangements in place to consult its participants on a regular basis and
address their needs in the design of its services. The CCP is subject to government audits that
aim to ensure the efficiency of KRX’s operations. Its fees and investments are subject to approval of
a market efficiency committee. The KRX has established mechanisms for the regular review of its
efficiency and effectiveness, such as customer satisfaction surveys.




                                                                                                    27

66.     The KRX does not use internationally accepted communication procedures and
standards for communication with its clearing members, settlement banks, the KSD, and the
BOK. Conversion into internationally accepted communication procedures and standards is
technically possible, but costly. The KRX should at least be able to accommodate the internationally
accepted communication network and procedures to eliminate manual interventions in clearing and
settlement processing, reduce risks, and increase efficiency by allowing for full straight through
processing.

Transparency (Principle 23, 24)

67.      The KRX has recently disclosed responses to the CPSS-IOSCO Disclosure Framework
for FMIs, which enable participants to assess the risks they incur by participating in the CCP.
Rules and regulations are disclosed on the website in Korean. Various rules and regulations are
available in English, as well. The website also contains statistics and various descriptions of the risk
management and operational systems. The KRX provides ad hoc training and information to its
clearing members. Fees are also publicly disclosed. It is recommended that the KRX discloses all its
rules, regulations and guidelines on its website in English.

F. Key Findings and Follow up for Authorities

68.     FMIs in Korea are subject to regulation and oversight of the BOK and subject to
regulation and supervision of the FSC and FSS. The legal underpinning of the responsibilities
suggests overlap as both regulators are responsible for financial stability and have responsibilities
related to the KRX and KSD. This is the case in many countries and needs to be managed by a
consultative and cooperative framework in the form of an MOU to ensure effective coordination
between the BOK and FSC where their roles as regulators overlap.

69.    The powers of the FSC and FSS are considered sufficient. The powers of the BOK are
considered not to be effective. While the BOK may request other FMIs than the BOK-Wire+ to
take measures for the improvement of their operating rules and to provide related information, it
has no powers to ensure that its suggestions are implemented, nor is the BOK able to confirm the
authenticity of the submitted information and ascertain whether only selective information has

                                                                                    REPUBLIC OF KOREA




been submitted by these entities. There is a need to amend the existing statute to empower the
BOK to effectively discharge its oversight responsibilities including the powers to obtain authentic
information and to be able to oversee that its observations/findings are implemented by the FMIs
and the ability to impose sanctions when required.

70.     The resources of the BOK and FSS are considered sufficient, however, the resources of
the FSC are considered insufficient. Although the FSC staff has good knowledge and is relatively
effective in its activities, the work load is considered too large for one staff member, especially
given that staff members rotate every two years. The seconded KRX staff brings appropriate
knowledge, however, may prevent the FSC from preparing independent opinions. It is
recommended that the FSC extends the number of staff members responsible for clearing and
settlement related matters to allow for a proactive and complete analysis of the compliance of the
KRX CCP with the relevant laws, regulations and the PFMI. It will also allow for a more proactive
cooperation with the FSS.

71.     The authorities disclose the main laws and policies on FMIs, but further disclosure of
information is recommended. The BOK discloses its policies publicly with respect to all FMIs
including the BOK-Wire+. The FSC and FSS objectives are publicly disclosed in the FSCMA. The BOK
should make the relevant information and data it discloses, in a language commonly used in
financial markets in addition to the domestic language on its website. The FSC and FSS should
provide dedicated information on FMIs on their websites.

72.     The BOK and FSC have both publicly announced their support for the PFMI; further
implementation of the PFMI is needed. The BOK has implemented the PFMI as the oversight
framework for the BOK-Wire+. The BOK’s application of the PFMI as the oversight framework is
however incomplete, due to the regulatory overlap with the FSC and the BOK’s lack of powers to
see that its decisions are implemented by other FMIs. The FSC intends to adapt the regulations
under the FSCMA in accordance with the PFMI. The FSC, together with the FSS, is in the process of
approving regulations for OTC derivatives trading and clearing. Regulations for exchange traded
stocks, bonds and derivatives have not yet been adapted to reflect the PFMI.

73.     The BOK and FSC do not appropriately cooperate in the regulation, supervision and
oversight of the FMIs in Korea, in particular regarding the regulation, supervision and
oversight of the KRX and KSD. Cooperation among the BOK and FSC at the highest level has
proven not to be effective, as FMIs so far have not been discussed at that level. The cooperation at
the technical level is informal, without adequate agreements and arrangements. This impedes the
BOK from effectively exercising its oversight duties. The KRX has to respond to requirements of two
different regulating and supervising authorities that may be overlapping or even contracting. The
FSC cannot benefit from specific knowledge that is obtained by the BOK in its role as overseer, for
example information obtained during international meetings or during the FMI operations council.
There are no crisis management arrangements between the authorities to manage a potential
financial or operational crisis relating to FMIs in Korea.




                                                                                                   29

74.      It is recommended to formalize the cooperation between the BOK and the FSC
regarding the regulation, supervision and oversight of FMIs. This formal arrangement should
enable the cooperation between the BOK and FSC at the appropriate technical and management
level and should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulation, supervision, and
oversight, in particular in relation to the KRX CCP and the KSD. Such a cooperative framework could
be in the form of an MOU having a sound legal basis to ensure effective coordination between the
BOK and FSC where their roles as regulators overlap. It should enable the BOK to ensure that its
suggestions are implemented and to confirm the authenticity and completeness of the information
submitted by the FMIs. The BOK and FSC should “speak with one voice” to avoid any inefficiencies
in their communication with the KRX and KSD. It should also allow the FSC to benefit from relevant
information that is obtained by the BOK during international meetings or meetings with the FMI
operations council.

75.     The BOK and FSC should define arrangements regarding the frequency of their
information exchange and plan joint meetings with the FSS, KRX, and KSD. They should also
develop a crisis management plan and test such a plan to enable timely and effective cooperation
in times of crisis that may affect the safety and efficiency of the FMIs. Any assessments should be
shared. Before finalizing an assessment the authorities should consult each other and take each
other’s comments into account.

                    furnish materials related to payments and settlements to the BOK in terms of
                    article 81 (3). Additionally, article 81 (4) requires all participant institutions of
                    payment systems operated by the BOK to provide any relevant materials to
                    the BOK.

                    Article 81.2 allows the BOK to provide temporary intraday liquidity to

                    Settlement finality is ensured through article 120 of the Debtor Rehabilitation
                    and Bankruptcy Act. Article 120 (1) says that “the effects of transfer instruction
                    or payment, execution thereof, settlement, deductions, deposit funds, the
                    furnishing of security, disposition, appropriation, and settlement involving the

                    operates the payment and settlement system, notwithstanding the provisions
                    of this Act and they shall not be subject to cancellation, termination,
                    revocation, or setting aside.” This provision is applicable when “rehabilitation
                    procedures commence for any participant in the payment and settlement
                    system that is designated by the governor of the BOK after consulting with

regard thereto with the FSC in order to ensure the completeness of the
payment and settlement system” (http://www.moleg.go.kr/english).

Bilateral netting is recognized under the Civil Act in articles 492 to 499. The
legal recognition for electronic transactions including electronic payments is
provided by the Electronic Financial Transaction Act. Article 2 (2) defines an
electronic financial transaction while article clauses (3), (6), (11), and (12)
define an electronic payment transaction, an electronic payment gateway, an
electronic payment means and electronic funds transfer respectively
(http://www.moleg.go.kr/english).

Immobilization of securities has its legal basis in the FSCMA articles 294 to
323). Dematerialization of securities is dealt with under the overall provisions
of the Registration of Bonds and Debentures Act, and the Government Bonds
Act.

Registration of Bonds and Debentures Act articulates the legal basis for
issuing the local government bonds, corporate debentures, and other special
bonds in registered form. Short-term bonds are issued and distributed in the
form of electronic securities under the Issuance and Distribution of Short-term
Bonds Act.

The BOK-Wire+ is only subject to the laws of Korea.

Legal basis for each material aspect

The legal basis for the enforceability of netting arrangements in the hybrid
BOK-Wire+ system are provided under the provisions of the Civil Act (Civil
Act, articles 492 to 499) read with the provisions of the ROMPSS (article 5) and
WROMPSS [section 2 (articles 16 and 17), section 3 (1), (2), (3) and section 4
(1), (2), (3), (4).

The BOK-Wire + provides for finality of settlement as set out in article 5 of
ROMPSS wherein the various types of settlement service provided by BOK-
Wire+ are specified. The settlement so arrived at is protected under article
120 of the Debtor Rehabilitation and the Bankruptcy Act. The provisions of
article 120 are also applicable to securities transactions and in view thereof,
ensure finality of settlement.

Intra-day liquidity support to participating institutions (banks, qualified
financial investment companies and KRX) in BOK-Wire+ is made available by
BOK under article 81-2 of the BOK Act.

                                             with the relevant statutes. As indicated above, these rules and regulations are

                                          Article 5 of the ROMPSS lists out the various settlement services made
                                          available under BOK-Wire+. While this provides an implicit understanding that
                                          the settlement done in the accounts of the BOK through BOK-Wire+ is final, it
                                          is suggested that an explicit clause to this effect is inserted in the ROMPSS.
Recommendations and comments
                                          Further, the BOK could consider articulating its legal basis in a better manner
                                          by providing hyperlinks or placing the relevant acts and regulations on its

                                                Principle 2; Governance

An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety and efficiency of the
FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant public interest considerations, and the
objectives of relevant stakeholders.

Key consideration 1                       The BOK has an explicit commitment towards the safety and efficiency of the
                                          payment system as a whole. This is laid down in article 81 (1) of the BOK Act

relevant public interest considerations
                                          The BOK also explicitly supports and works towards financial stability in terms
                                          of article 1 (1) of the BOK Act which states that the “BOK shall pay attention
                                          to financial stability in carrying out its monetary and credit policies.”

                                          These two articles read in conjunction with article 28 (Decisions on Monetary
                                          and Credit Policies) of the BOK Act further reinforce the objectives of safety,
                                          efficiency and financial stability. Article 28, clause (10) says that the MPC shall
                                          deliberate and decide on “basic matters for the operation and management
                                          of the payment systems according to the provisions of article 81” (stated

                                            The ROMPSS which governs the operations of BOK-Wire+ also has the public
                                            policy objectives of safety and efficiency embedded in it. Article 3 (1) of the
                                            ROMPSS states that the BOK “shall seek to secure the safety and efficiency of
                                            the payment systems as its objectives in carrying out matters related to their
                                            operation and management”. These objectives are sought to be achieved
                                            through “oversight of the payment systems” (article 3 (2)).

                                            To achieve the above objectives, the BOK through its oversight unit (in the
                                            payment & settlement systems department) conducts real-time monitoring of
                                            the BOK-Wire+ system, reports on the daily payment trends and quarterly
                                            oversight activities, and further assesses the BOK-Wire+ every two years in
                                            accordance with international standards and recommends any improvements
                                            as needed. Moreover, with the final settlements of all systemically important
                                            payment systems, such as the SSSs, the RPSs, and the CLS system, happening
                                            in BOK-Wire+, its stable operations contribute to overall financial stability.
Key consideration 2                         Governance arrangements

An FMI should have documented               Article 12 of the BOK Act establishes the MPC as the policy-making body of

                                            The governance arrangements of the MPC are documented in the BOK Act.
                                            Articles 12 to 20 outline the composition of the MPC. The operations of MPC
                                            are contained in articles 21 to 27. The powers of MPC are elaborated in
                                            articles 28 to 31. Article 30 empowers the MPC to draw up regulations for the
                                            purpose of carrying out its duties.

                                            In accordance with article 28 (10) all matters concerning BOK-Wire+ are
                                            decided upon by the MPC. In accordance with the above, the BOK has drawn
                                            up the “regulation on the operation and management of payment and
                                            settlement systems”. The payment and settlement systems department which
                                            administers these regulations is headed by a director-general who reports to
                                            a deputy governor. The deputy governor reports to the senior deputy
                                            governor/governor. Thus, all matters concerning BOK-Wire+ operation are
                                            reported to and decided on by the MPC in accordance with the BOK Act and
                                            the ROMPSS.

                                            Under the existing governance arrangements the oversight division is housed
                                            in the payment and settlement systems department, while the operations unit
                                            is located in the IT department. The two departments are headed by different
                                            director generals and report to two separate deputy governors.
                                            This arrangement allows for a formal separation of the operator and oversight
                                            functions.

                                            The operations of BOK-Wire+ are overseen by the oversight division. The
                                            reports of the oversight unit are submitted by the director general to the
                                            deputy governor concerned and to the higher authorities.

nonbanks) is fully collateralized. The value of the collateral is subject to a
haircut policy and the collateral securities can be classified as highly liquid
securities bearing minimal credit and market risk.

Operational risk is sought to be addressed through standardized IT
systems and detailed business continuity plans.
Further, comprehensive operational risk-management plans such as the
risk control self-assessment (RSCA) and key risk indicator (KRI) processes
have been established. Under the RCSA and the KRI, each risk factor and
control measure for monitoring the same has been defined.

Risk management policies, procedures and systems

The BOK's principal risk-management framework related to BOK-Wire+ is
provided in the ROMPSS that the MPC, the BOK decision-making body,
has the authority to enact and revise.

To elaborate, the framework for management of risks is stipulated in the
ROMPSS, WROMPSS, and the sub-regulations of the ROMPSS and the
sub-regulations of BOK-Wire+ IT requirements. Issues relating to risk
management (including settlement risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, IT
operations, operational risk, and business continuity) are addressed in
these guidelines.

Matters concerning important risk management related to BOK-Wire+ are
decided on by or reported to the MPC in accordance with article 28 of the
BOK Act.

Furthermore, the BOK submits the payment and settlement systems
report, on the operation and management of the payment and settlement
systems, to the MPC on an annual basis.

The management and oversight units in the payment and settlement
systems department monitor the flows of payments in the BOK-Wire+ in
real time. The real-time monitoring screen allows for monitoring the
participants settlement balances in the current and settlement accounts
and their use of intra-day overdraft from BOK. The real-time monitoring
tool allows the BOK to have a bird’s eye-view regarding the payment
flows, pending transactions in the queue, and the use of intra-day
liquidity facilities. This provides for a comprehensive measurement tool in
aggregating exposures in the system and provides the capability to
undertake trouble-shooting if required.

Review of risk management policies, procedures, and systems

The framework for the management of important risks is stipulated in the
ROMPSS, WROMPSS, and the sub-regulations of the ROMPSS and the
sub-regulations of BOK-Wire+ IT requirements. These are all documented.

                                          The ROMPSS regulations are enacted and revised by the MPC, while the
                                          WROMPSS are formulated with the approval of the Governor. The sub-
                                          regulations of the ROMPSS and the BOK-Wire+ IT guidelines are
                                          formulated by the respective director generals of the departments
                                          concerned.

                                          Issues relating to risk management (including settlement risk, liquidity
                                          risk, credit risk, IT operations, operational risk, and business continuity) are
                                          addressed in these guidelines. The decision–making parameters are
                                          stipulated in the ROMPSS and the WROMPSS.

                                          Any amendments to the ROMPSS are carried out by the MPC. The
                                          WROMPSS can be amended with the approval of the Governor. The
                                          Director General’s notify amendments to the respective sub-regulations
                                          after the approval of the Deputy Governor concerned.

                                          In an emergency, in accordance with its BCP established in advance, the
                                          BOK decides whether it is a physical emergency such as a technical
                                          malfunction or an artificial or natural disaster, or a human disaster such as
                                          a disease epidemic, sets up an emergency response committee if
                                          necessary, and takes necessary actions. The BCP is checked annually, and
                                          revised as necessary. The risk management frameworks are assessed
                                          every two years.

                                          Notwithstanding the above, depending on the situation amendments to
                                          the ROMPSS and WROMPSS and the sub-regulations are carried out
                                          based on market developments internationally and nationally. The
                                          commitment to oversee payments and settlement systems in line with the
                                          PFMI as laid down in article 37 of the ROMPSS is one such example.
                                          The risk management frameworks as laid down in the ROMPSS,
                                          WROMPSS, and the sub-regulations are audited internally by the
                                          independent audit department of the BOK, and externally by the National

BOK provides incentives to participants to manage their risks by
stipulating that the participants should adhere to the BOK-Wire+
participation standards as laid down in article 4 appendix-5 of the
WROMPSS. The director general of the IT department of the BOK decides
on all IT related issues (article 8 (2) of the WROMPSS), while all other
issues are decided upon by the director general of the payment and
settlement systems department as laid down in chapter 2 section 1
Standards for Bok-Wire+ Participation and Operation in the WROMPSS.

Further, in terms of article 14 of the WROMPSS, the BOK operates a
consultative committee of participants and payment system operators. In
terms of article 3 of the WROMPSS, the BOK collects the opinions of
participants where it intends to change existing policy or enact a new
policy.

To reduce the operational risk of and improve the efficiency of BOK-
Wire+, some criteria (such as the establishment of internal standards for
the minimum number of personnel fully dedicated to system-related
duties and BOK-Wire+ transactions) are applied to those wanting to
participate in the system.

Fees are charged differentially, depending upon the time when payment
instructions are submitted and settled, in order to ease the concentration
of settlement at around the system closing time and enhance liquidity
saving measures and smoothen settlement.

Participants that cause risks by delaying deferred net settlements which
are carried out at a designated time, or request for extensions of the BOK-
Wire+ operating hours are induced to properly manage their risks through
the imposition of sanctions. Article 6 of the WROMPSS provides powers to
the director general of the payment and settlement systems department
to annually assess the participants and impose sanctions on participants
not complying with standards as stipulated by the BOK. The sanctions
comprise imposing a requirement on the participants to comply with the
prescribed standards, advise them to withdraw from BOK-Wire+ or could
also result in cancellation of the participant access agreement.

At a higher level, the governor of the BOK in terms of article 43 of the
ROMPSS has the power to impose sanctions on a participant in BOK-
Wire+ or linked payment system operators. For participants, the sanctions
may take the form of a verbal warning, a request for corrective actions, or
a partial or overall suspension of access to BOK-Wire+. For linked payment
system operators, the sanctions may take the form of a verbal warning and
a request for corrective actions.

                                         It is recognized by BOK, that any operational disruptions in BOK-Wire+
                                         could cause risks to the participants and other FMIs, leading to the
                                         building up of liquidity and settlement risks. Further, delays in settlement
                                         and operational disruptions in other FMIs could be potential sources of
                                         risk to BOK-Wire+, in terms of pending payment instructions and queue
                                         management related issues, leading to an extension of operating hours of
                                         the BOK-Wire+ system.

                                         These risks are monitored through the real-time monitoring tool in BOK-
                                         Wire+ which enables the payment and settlement systems department to
                                         monitor the settlement and payment flows as well as queued transactions.
                                         The IT department monitors the overall functioning of the IT system of

                                         Risk management tools

                                         The framework for management of the risks arising from use of BOK-
                                         Wire+ are provided in Chapters 2 and 3 of the ROMPSS and, separately
                                         from it, in the agreements on use of the system between the BOK and the
                                         operators of payment and settlement systems. Article 12 of the ROMPSS
                                         enables BOK to prescribe standards for IT equipment, communication
                                         protocols, message delivery and business procedures. Article 13 of the
                                         ROMPSS specifies the duties of participants and payment system
                                         operators which include maintaining sufficient balances in their current
                                         accounts, and maintaining the hardware and software necessary for the
                                         use of BOK-Wire+ and have in place a business continuity plan. Article 14
                                         clauses (1) and (2) of the ROMPSS detail the measures for ensuring
                                         business continuity and provides powers to the governor to guide all
                                         participants and payment system operators to establish and implement
                                         measures for their business continuity.

                                         Also, article 40 of the ROMPSS requires payment system operators to
                                         notify the BOK in case of any change to the regulations, business
                                         procedures, and IT systems which may affect their system’s safety and

                                           The management framework for risks related to deferred net settlements

                                           is separately provided in article 8 read with Chapter 3 Management of

                                           down in article 43 of the ROMPSS.

                                           As part of its oversight function, BOK carries out an assessment of
                                           systemically important payment systems once in 2 years. The assessment
                                           of KRX (CCP) and KSD (CSD) was carried out in 2011 and 2010
                                           respectively. A self-assessment of BOK-Wire+ has been carried out by

                                          BOK Act. The BOK's principal risk-management framework related to
                                          BOK-Wire+ is provided in the ROMPSS that the MPC, the BOK decision-
                                          making body, has the authority to enact and revise. To elaborate, the
                                          framework for management of risks is stipulated in the ROMPSS,
                                          WROMPSS, and the sub-regulations of the ROMPSS and the sub-
                                          regulations of BOK-Wire+ IT requirements. Issues relating to risk

                                          operations, operational risk, and business continuity) are addressed in
                                          these guidelines. Furthermore, the BOK submits the payment and
                                          settlement systems report, on the operation and management of the
                                          payment and settlement systems, to the MPC on an annual basis.

                                          In BOK-Wire+ the final settlement of various other systemically important
                                          payment systems such as the securities market, foreign exchange market,
                                          and the retail payments takes place. Therefore, the material risk that has
                                          been identified is the level of interdependency between SIPS, participants,
                                          and the BOK-Wire+. It is recognized by the BOK, that any operational
                                          disruptions in BOK-Wire+ could cause risks to the participants and other
                                          FMIs, leading to the building up of liquidity and settlement risks. Further,
                                          delays in settlement and operational disruptions in other FMIs could be
                                          potential sources of risk to BOK-Wire+, in terms of pending payment
                                          instructions and queue management related issues, leading to an
                                          extension of operating hours of the BOK-Wire+ system.

                                          In an emergency, according to the BCP established in advance, an
                                          emergency response committee is set up and necessary action is taken.
                                          The BCP is reviewed annually, and revised as necessary.

Assessment of Principle 3                 Observed
Recommendations and comments              The BCP laid down for the BOK-Wire+ in accordance with the ROMPSS,
                                          WROMPSS and the relevant sub-regulations thereof deals with 12
                                          potential scenarios. The BCP scenarios also take into account the non-
                                          availability of the systems of operators of FMIs like the KRX, KSD, and the
                                          KFTC (retail payment operator) on a system-by-system basis.
                                          It is recommended to develop a more adverse disaster scenario when the
                                          operations of more than one FMI are disrupted rather than taking into
                                          account non-availability of individual systems in the BCP.



                                               Principle 4: Credit Risk

An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those arising from
its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain sufficient financial resources to cover its
credit exposure to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence. In addition, a CCP that is involved in
activities with a more-complex risk profile or that is systemically important in multiple jurisdictions should maintain
additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but

not be limited to, the default of the two participants and their affiliates that would potentially cause the largest
aggregate credit exposure to the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions. All other CCPs should maintain
additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but
not be limited to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate
credit exposure to the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions.
Key consideration 1                            Since BOK-Wire+ processes funds transfers based on an RTGS

                                               The value of the collateral is subject to a hair-cut policy and the
                                               collateral securities can be classified as highly liquid securities bearing
                                               minimal credit risk. Where participants fail to repay the intra-day
                                               liquidity, the loan is converted to an overnight facility (liquidity
                                               adjustment loan) and a penalty rate is charged.

                                               Where participants fail to repurchase the securities for intraday repo,
                                               they should buy back the securities, with a penalty rate, on the next
                                               business day.

                                               The intraday overdraft facility provided to banks is on an interest free
                                               basis. However, interest is charged to banks when the intra-day
                                               overdraft availed by them exceeds 25 percent of the bank’s equity
                                               capital.

                                               In the case of non-bank participants, the intra-day repo limit is
                                               pegged at 25 percent of the equity capital of the entity concerned.

                    Chapter 3, article 58 of the WROMPSS provides the details of intra-day
                    repo transactions. The details include (i) a cap on the support to cover

                    percent of the equity capital of the institution, with the exception for
                    the KRX, which shall be provided the amount requested (article 58-3);
                    (ii) securities subject to intraday repo transactions including their
                    market transaction prices of the previous day and the haircuts
                    prescribed by the BOK (article 58-4); (iii) methodology of the haircuts
                    applied as specified in appendix 4 of the WROMPSS (article 58-5); (iv)
                    method of availing intra-day repo support either through automatic
                    route or through support by transaction basis (article 58-6); (v)
                    repayment of funds drawn to meet temporary shortages in settlement
                    balances (article 58-7); (vi) priority processing of transactions to
                    support temporary shortages of settlement balances and repurchases
                    (article 58-8); and (vii) recording and management of intra-day repo
                    transactions (article 58-9).

                    Intra-day overdrafts

                    Intraday overdrafts to banks are provided as part of the broader
                    monetary policy operations under the lending and deposit facilities of
                    the BOK (http://www.bok.or.kr/broadcast.action?menuNaviId=1906).
                    Intra-day overdrafts were introduced in September 2000 by the BOK
                    to extend financial support to banks experiencing temporary
                    shortages of settlement funds in the course of a day. Financial
                    institutions that are subject to reserve requirements and participate in
                    BOK-Wire+ are eligible for intra-day overdrafts. In the case where a
                    bank fails to redeem its borrowings by the close of the business day,
                    non-redeemed intra-day overdraft amount is converted into a liquidity
                    adjustment loan. These loans are in principle provided on an interest-
                    free basis. To avoid an increase in settlement risk arising from financial
                    institutions' over-reliance on them, however, a certain level of interest
                    is applied on loans exceeding 25 percent of a financial institution's
                    equity capital—at a rate equivalent to the spread between yields on
                    three-year treasury bonds and the uncollateralized overnight call rate
                    during the last month of the immediately preceding quarter.

                    The BOK monitors the amounts of intraday overdrafts of individual
                    BOK-Wire+ participants in real time, and BOK-Wire+ is designed so
                    that no further intraday overdrafts are provided to a participant when
                    the amount of that participant's intra-day overdrafts reaches the value
                    of its pledged collateral. And the BOK receives bonds, as collaterals,
                    which have low credit, liquidity and market risks such as KTBs and
                    MSBs.

scenarios that should include, but not be
limited to, the default of the participant
and its affiliates that would potentially
cause the largest aggregate credit
exposure for the CCP in extreme but
plausible market conditions. In all cases, a
CCP should document its supporting
rationale for, and should have appropriate
governance arrangements relating to, the
amount of total financial resources it
maintains.

Key consideration 5                              N/A

A CCP should determine the amount and
regularly test the sufficiency of its total
financial resources available in the event
of a default or multiple defaults in
extreme but plausible market conditions
through rigorous stress testing. A CCP
should have clear procedures to report
the results of its stress tests to appropriate
decision makers at the CCP and to use
these results to evaluate the adequacy of
and adjust its total financial resources.
Stress tests should be performed daily
using standard and predetermined
parameters and assumptions. On at least a
monthly basis, a CCP should perform a
comprehensive and thorough analysis of
stress testing scenarios, models, and
underlying parameters and assumptions
used to ensure they are appropriate for
determining the CCP’s required level of
default protection in light of current and
evolving market conditions. A CCP should
perform this analysis of stress testing
more frequently when the products
cleared or markets served display high
volatility, become less liquid, or when the
size or concentration of positions held by
a CCP’s participants increases significantly.
A full validation of a CCP’s risk-
management model should be performed
at least annually.

Key consideration 6                            N/A

In conducting stress testing, a CCP should
consider the effect of a wide range of
relevant stress scenarios in terms of both
defaulters’ positions and possible price
changes in liquidation periods. Scenarios
should include relevant peak historic price
volatilities, shifts in other market factors
such as price determinants and yield
curves, multiple defaults over various time
horizons, simultaneous pressures in
funding and asset markets, and a
spectrum of forward-looking stress
scenarios in a variety of extreme but

                                                 Principle 6: Margin

A CCP should cover its exposure to its participants for all products through an effective margin system that is
risk-based and regularly reviewed.

Key consideration 1                            N/A

A CCP should have a margin system that
establishes margin levels commensurate
with the risks and particular attributes of
each product, portfolio, and market it
serves.
Key consideration 2                            N/A

A CCP should have a reliable source of
timely price data for its margin system. A
CCP should also have procedures and
sound valuation models for addressing
circumstances in which pricing data are
not readily available or reliable.
Key consideration 3                            N/A

A CCP should adopt initial margin models
and parameters that are risk-based and
generate margin requirements sufficient
to cover its potential future exposure to
participants in the interval between the
last margin collection and the close out of
positions following a participant default.
Initial margin should meet an established
single-tailed confidence level of at least
99 percent with respect to the estimated
distribution of future exposure. For a CCP
that calculates margin at the portfolio
level, this requirement applies to each
portfolio’s distribution of future exposure.

For a CCP that calculates margin at more-
granular levels, such as at the sub-
portfolio level or by product, the
requirement must be met for the
corresponding distributions of future
exposure. The model should (a) use a
conservative estimate of the time
horizons for the effective hedging or
close out of the particular types of
products cleared by the CCP (including in
stressed market conditions), (b) have an
appropriate method for measuring credit
exposure that accounts for relevant
product risk factors and portfolio effects
across products, and (c) to the extent
practicable and prudent, limit the need
for destabilising, procyclical changes.
Key consideration 4                            N/A

A CCP should mark participant positions
to market and collect variation margin at
least daily to limit the build-up of current
exposures. A CCP should have the
authority and operational capacity to
make intraday margin calls and payments,
both scheduled and unscheduled, to
participants.
Key consideration 5                            N/A

In calculating margin requirements, a CCP
may allow offsets or reductions in
required margin across products that it
clears or between products that it and
another CCP clear, if the risk of one
product is significantly and reliably
correlated with the risk of the other
product. Where two or more CCPs are
authorized to offer cross-margining, they
must have appropriate safeguards and
harmonized overall risk-management
systems.
Key consideration 6                            N/A

A CCP should analyze and monitor its
model performance and overall margin
coverage by conducting rigorous daily
back testing—and at least monthly, and

more-frequent where appropriate,
sensitivity analysis. A CCP should
regularly conduct an assessment of the
theoretical and empirical properties of its
margin model for all products it clears. In
conducting sensitivity analysis of the
model’s coverage, a CCP should take into
account a wide range of parameters and
assumptions that reflect possible market
conditions, including the most-volatile
periods that have been experienced by
the markets it serves and extreme
changes in the correlations between
prices.
Key consideration 7                            N/A

                                               Principle 7: Liquidity Risk

An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk. An FMI should maintain sufficient liquid
resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday settlement of
payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should
include, but not be limited to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would generate the largest
aggregate liquidity obligation for the FMI in extreme but plausible market conditions.

                                                    To overcome this, BOK provides intra-day liquidity facilities to both

                                                    In addition, BOK has introduced the hybrid settlement mechanism
                                                    in BOK-Wire+ with bilateral and multilateral offsetting mechanisms

Key conclusions for                          Liquidity risk in BOK-Wire+ system is minimized due to the
Principle 7                                  provision of intraday liquidity facility by the BOK to the participants
                                             in the BOK-Wire+ system. Moreover, with the hybrid settlement
                                             system in operation the liquidity needs of the participants are
                                             reduced.

                                             BOK as operator of the system has a real-time monitoring tool to
                                             monitor the settlement and payment flows in BOK-Wire+ system
                                             and initiate measures if required to smoothen payment flows. The
                                             differential pricing fees mechanism also contributes to
                                             smoothening payment flows throughout the operating hours of the
                                             BOK-Wire+ system. But this has only a limited effect in view of the
                                             fact that the settlement of OTC traded securities are concentrated
                                             at the end of the afternoon (at 4.00 pm KRX sends its settlement
                                             instructions). The settlement of call loans and repo transactions
                                             (which are the principal sources of liquidity for FICs) is also
                                             concentrated around 4.00 pm due to the settlement cycle (T+0) and
                                             the existing market practices. In view of this there is a concentration
                                             of settlement transactions towards the closing hours of BOK-Wire+.

                                       Principle 8: Settlement Finality

An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value date. Where
necessary or preferable, an FMI should provide final settlement intraday or in real time.

If an FMI settles in commercial bank
money, it should monitor, manage,
and limit its credit and liquidity risks
arising from the commercial
settlement banks. In particular, an
FMI should establish and monitor
adherence to strict criteria for its
settlement banks that take account
of, among other things, their
regulation and supervision,
creditworthiness, capitalization,
access to liquidity, and operational
reliability. An FMI should also monitor
and manage the concentration of
credit and liquidity exposures to its
commercial settlement banks.

individual settlement banks are
expected to occur, that transfers are
to be final when effected, and that
funds received should be transferable
as soon as possible, at a minimum by
the end of the day and ideally intra-

                      Based on this information, on T+2 the parties deliver the securities
                      to their accounts with KSD and transfer the funds to KSD’s account
                      with the BOK during BOK-Wire+ business hours (currently 9 a.m.
                      to 5.30 p.m.). Once both parties complete their delivery of the
                      securities and payment of the funds, the KSD initiates
                      simultaneous settlement of the securities and funds under the
                      DVP3 scheme.

                      For bond, certificate of deposit and commercial paper transactions
                      made over the counter, the trading parties must deliver the
                      securities or make payment to the KSD settlement accounts during
                      BOK-Wire+ business hours on the settlement date, in accordance
                      with the notified details. Settlement occurs on day T+1 for bonds
                      and day T for certificate of deposit or commercial paper
                      transactions. As soon as the trading parties have delivered their
                      securities and funds to their securities accounts with KSD and
                      KSD’s account with the BOK, the KSD settles the securities and
                      funds—through the parties’ securities accounts at the KSD and
                      funds accounts held with the BOK (DVP1 scheme).

                      By implementation of a DVP mechanism linking KSD’s SSSs with

                      securities transactions is substantially eliminated. Also, as final
                      settlement of securities occurs no later than T+2 (i.e. T+2 for
                      stocks and T or T+1 for bonds), the volume of trade outstanding is

                      transactions, such as spot exchange, forward exchange and swaps,
                      and non-deliverable forward are settled through the CLS system.
                      CLS settlement member banks and third parties in Korea follow
                      the same procedures used worldwide to settle their transactions,

                      Pacific currencies, including KRW, is between 7 a.m. CET, which is
                      from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Korean standard time.

                      To facilitate safe and efficient KRW funds transfers between CLS

                      granted direct access to BOK-Wire+. Because BOK-Wire+ does not
                      use SWIFT (the standard communication network for CLS), the BOK
                      has established the “CLS Link System”, which converts SWIFT
                      messages to/from the CLS Bank into the proprietary message

A CCP should, at a minimum, have

customers’ positions and related collateral
from the default or insolvency of that
participant. If the CCP additionally offers
protection of such customer positions and

a participant’s customers and to segregate
related collateral. A CCP should maintain
customer positions and collateral in
individual customer accounts or in omnibus
customer accounts.

A CCP should disclose its rules, policies, and
procedures relating to the segregation and
portability of a participant’s customers’
positions and related collateral. In particular,
the CCP should disclose whether customer

omnibus basis. In addition, a CCP should
disclose any constraints, such as legal or
operational constraints, that may impair its
ability to segregate or port a participant’s
customers’ positions and related collateral.

reserves, or other retained earnings) so that it
can continue operations and services as a
going concern if it incurs general business
losses. The amount of liquid net assets
funded by equity an FMI should hold should
be determined by its general business risk
profile and the length of time required to
achieve a recovery or orderly wind-down, as
appropriate, of its critical operations and
services if such action is taken.
Key consideration 3                                N/A

An FMI should maintain a viable recovery or
orderly wind-down plan and should hold
sufficient liquid net assets funded by equity
to implement this plan. At a minimum, an FMI
should hold liquid net assets funded by
equity equal to at least six months of current
operating expenses. These assets are in

participant defaults or other risks covered
under the financial resources principles.
However, equity held under international risk-

                                                    could consider assessing the FMI at more frequent intervals.



                                            Principle 17: Operational Risk

An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate their
impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Systems should be designed to
ensure a high degree of security and operational reliability and should have adequate, scalable capacity. Business
continuity management should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of the FMI’s obligations,
including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption.

                    of the ROMPSS enjoins upon linked payment system operators to
                    notify the BOK in case of any changes to the regulations, business

                    operators to inform the BOK of any emergency situations such as
                    system failure, disaster, terrorist attack etc.

                    Article 41 of the ROMPSS enables BOK in an emergency situation to
                    recommend to the payment system operators and participants to
                    effect necessary changes in their procedures including the
                    temporary suspension of a participant. More details are provided in

                    If data losses are expected from a system disaster, the BOK
                    carries out reconciliation with participants to recover the data that
                    has been lost. In cases of emergency, the emergency system
                    (emergency response committee comes into operation, to ensure
                    efficient decision-making and emergency response/business
                    recovery, and the contact points between the BOK and participants
                    are used to notify participants on alternate arrangements.

                    Secondary site

                    In the case that the main office is not accessible or available due to
                    disaster, the BOK's Gangnam branch is designated as the first
                    backup site, and if both Headquarters and the Gangnam
                    branch are unavailable, the secondary alternative site begins
                    operation.

                    The secondary alternative site (IT backup center) is a hot-site
                    (system standby), and its resources are checked periodically. Fax
                    and manual operations are part of the BCP.

                    Review and testing

                    On-site BOK-Wire+ BCP training is carried out once a year,
                    simulated training is done twice a year, and secondary site resource
                    inspection takes place every other month.
                    Any deficiencies discovered through the BCP training, or
                    suggestions from participating departments, are reflected in
                    establishment of a supplement to the BCP.

                    The framework for management of risks arising from the use of
                    BOK-Wire+ are provided in Chapter 2 - of the ROMPSS and,
                    separately from it, in the agreements on use of the system between
                    the BOK and the operators of payment and settlement systems.

                    Articles 11 and 12 of the WROMPSS outline the measures to be
                    taken for ensuring business continuity. These include: (i) situation-
                    specific response procedures; (ii) composition and operation of an
                    emergency response organization; (iii) conditions and procedures
                    for inputs of agency business, manual operations; (iv) carrying out
                    simulation exercises; (v) setting up emergency contact systems with
                    participants and payment system operators; and (vi) procedures for
                    reporting. Article 12 of WROMPSS enjoins upon participants and
                    payment system operators to immediately notify BOK of any
                    system failures of BOK-Wire+ or matters deemed to be system
                    failures and initiate procedures in accordance with the measures

                                                 The BOK runs an FMI Operation Council, consisting of the director

Key conclusions for                              To manage operational risk, the BOK has established
Principle 17                                     comprehensive operational management guidelines covering

                                                 potential scenarios.
Assessment of Principle 17                       Observed

Recommendations and comments                     The BCP is found to be adequate in tackling operational risk and
                                                 ensuring the continuity of operations of BOK-Wire+. The BCP
                                                 scenarios also take into account the non-availability of the systems
                                                 of operators of FMIS like the KRX, KSD and the KFTC (retail
                                                 payment operator) on a system-by-system basis.

                                                 However, it is desirable to develop a more holistic approach taking
                                                 into account a disaster scenario when the operations of other FMIs
                                                 are disrupted (see also principle 3).

An FMI that establishes a link with one or more FMIs should identify, monitor, and manage link-related risks.
Key consideration 1                             N/A

Before entering into a link arrangement and
on an ongoing basis once the link is
established, an FMI should identify, monitor,
and manage all potential sources of risk
arising from the link arrangement. Link
arrangements should be designed such that
each FMI is able to observe the other
principles in this report.
Key consideration 2                             N/A

A link should have a well-founded legal
basis, in all relevant jurisdictions, that
supports its design and provides adequate
protection to the FMIs involved in the link.
Key consideration 3                             N/A

Linked CSDs should measure, monitor, and
manage the credit and liquidity risks arising
from each other. Any credit extensions
between CSDs should be covered fully with
high quality collateral and be subject to
limits.
Key consideration 4                             N/A

Provisional transfers of securities between
linked CSDs should be prohibited or, at a
minimum, the retransfer of provisionally
transferred securities should be prohibited
prior to the transfer becoming final.
Key consideration 5                             N/A

An investor CSD should only establish a link
with an issuer CSD if the arrangement
provides a high level of protection for the
rights of the investor CSD’s participants.

Key consideration 6                                N/A

An investor CSD that uses an intermediary
to operate a link with an issuer CSD should
measure, monitor, and manage the
additional risks (including custody, credit,
legal, and operational risks) arising from the
use of the intermediary.
Key consideration 7                                N/A

Before entering into a link with another CCP,
a CCP should identify and manage the
potential spill-over effects from the default
of the linked CCP. If a link has three or more
CCPs, each CCP should identify, assess, and
manage the risks of the collective link
arrangement.
Key consideration 8                                N/A

Each CCP in a CCP link arrangement should
be able to cover, at least on a daily basis, its
current and potential future exposures to
the linked CCP and its participants, if any,
fully with a high degree of confidence
without reducing the CCP’s ability to fulfill
its obligations to its own participants at any
time.
Key consideration 9                                N/A

A TR should carefully assess the additional
operational risks related to its links to
ensure the scalability and reliability of IT and
related resources.

                                                  be extended by BOK. The BOK-Wire+ closing times were extended
                                                  seven times during the year 2011 due to IT failures at participants’

                                                  The BOK-Wire+ enables two types of payment instructions
                                                  “Urgent” and “Normal”. Provided there is sufficient balance, urgent
                                                  payment instructions are settled immediately on a gross basis. In
                                                  the event of insufficient balance, the payment instructions are held

                                                  process can be initiated. A simultaneous bilateral settlement
                                                  process is usually used for normal payment instructions whenever
                                                  the counterparty’s payment instruction is received or is settled

                                             Principle 1. Legal Basis

An FMI should have a well-founded, clear, transparent, and enforceable legal basis for each material
aspect of its activities in all relevant jurisdictions.
Key consideration 1                      Material aspects and relevant jurisdictions

The legal basis should provide a         Material aspects for the KRX-CCP are:
high degree of certainty for each
material aspect of an FMI’s activities         Legal basis for the CCP;
in all relevant jurisdictions.
                                               Settlement finality and arrangements for DVP;
                                               Netting;

                                                instruments;
                                               Rights and interests of the KRX to use and dispose of
                                                collateral; and
                                               Default procedures.
                                         Relevant jurisdictions for the KRX-CCP:

                                         As the CCP is active in Korea the Korean jurisdiction applies. The
                                         CCP has no links with FMIs in other jurisdictions.

                                         With regard to non-local clearing members, a third country
                                         financial institution which intends to apply for KRX membership
                                         has to establish a local entity or a branch to get a business license
                                         from FSC as a financial investment trader or financial investment
                                         broker. After that, the third country entity can apply for KRX
                                         membership and should comply with the membership
                                         requirements. There are currently 12 non-local clearing members
                                         in the securities market, 10 in the bond market and 9 in the
                                         derivatives market. They represent jurisdictions from France,
                                         Germany, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, U.K. and
                                         U.S.

                                         With regard to collateral the U.S. jurisdiction is relevant as KRX
                                         accepts government securities from the US to cover collateral
                                         requirements.

                                       Chapter VII of the FSCMA describes the organization and
                                       responsibilities of the KRX, in particular the articles 377, 378, and
                                       393. The FSCMA specifies the business scope of a CCP including
                                       transaction confirmation, debt acquisition, confirmation of
                                       settlement, settlement guarantees and default procedures in the
                                       securities market and the derivatives markets.

                                           Settlement finality and arrangements for DVP.

                                       The Debt Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act 10 (articles 120 and
                                       336) specifies that contracts for which the CCP becomes the
                                       counterparty cannot be removed, terminated, cancelled or
                                       disclaimed due to the bankruptcy procedures of one of the KRX
                                       members to ensure conclusion of clearing and settlement
                                       procedures in line with the rules of the KRX markets.

                                       The market regulations further specify that the claims of the KRX
                                       and its participants have priority over other creditors with respect
                                       to the payment of fidelity guarantee money, member margin and
                                       joint fund contributions.

                                       The market regulations also specify the DVP procedures for
                                       different types of clearing members.

                                            Netting

                                       The Debt Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act (articles 120 and 336)
                                       protects netting as it specifies that transaction contracts for which
                                       the CCP becomes the counterparty cannot be removed,
                                       terminated, cancelled or disclaimed due to the bankruptcy
                                       procedures of one of the KRX members.

                                       Netting for securities markets is also specified in the market
                                       regulations. The protection of netting arrangements includes CNS
                                       (continuous net settlement). Settlement of securities that are not
                                       delivered on the specified day are netted together with the
                                       settlement positions of the next day.

                                            Novation and the moment of liability.

                                     The FSCMA specifies that the KRX is responsible for follow up
                                     measures on settlement failure (articles 377). The regulations
                                     specify when a clearing member should be suspended from
                                     trading, and some actions the CCP should undertake. The
                                     regulations specify that the CCP can use buy-in procedures to
                                     ensure settlement of securities obligations between clearing
                                     members.

                                         legal experts of the KRX.

                                         as the collateral is pledged to the KRX. The legal experts of the

                                         Degree of certainty for rules and procedures

                                         There is no precedent case that any actions taken by the KRX in
                                         accordance with its regulations can be voided, reversed or subject
                                         to stays. Occasionally, listed firms and investors have filed lawsuits
                                         against the KRX over application of KRX rules and regulations.
                                         However, no court decision has affected the application of KRX’s
                                         rules and regulations.

Key consideration 5                      The KRX does not conduct business in other jurisdictions than the
                                         Korean jurisdiction.
An FMI conducting business in
multiple jurisdictions should identify
and mitigate the risks arising from
any potential conflict of laws across

                                        positions. There’s a high certainty that the KRX regulations,
                                        procedures and contracts are enforceable in the Korean
                                        jurisdiction. A third country financial institution which intends to
                                        apply for KRX membership has to establish a local entity or a

                                        There is room to improve the legal framework in the normal
                                        course of business. The regulatory framework could be further
                                        improved by increasing its clarity. The relevant provisions for CCP
                                        clearing are currently comingled with concepts related to the KRX
                                        trading activities. The KRX regulations could make better use of
                                        the internationally used concepts, in particular the concepts used
                                        in the PFMI. Finally, as the KRX currently has not developed a
                                        recovery plan yet the regulatory framework has no explicit
                                        provisions that support recovery activities.

                                        Observed
Assessment of Principle 1
                                        It is recommended to explicitly distinguish between the trading
                                        and CCP activities in the FSCMA. The KRX regulations could make
                                        better use of the internationally used concepts, in particular the
                                        concepts used in the PFMI. The KRX could improve the disclosure
                                        of its laws and regulations to its clearing members to support
                                        them to assess risks related to the use of the CCP. It is
                                        recommended to improve the public disclosure of laws and
                                        regulations in English.
Recommendations and comments
                                        The KRX has not yet developed a recovery plan. As part of the
                                        drafting of this recovery plan the KRX should establish rules,
                                        procedures, and contracts related to its operations that are
                                        enforceable when the KRX is implementing its plans for recovery
                                        or orderly wind- down. Where relevant, the laws and regulations
                                        should address risks resulting from foreign participants in the case
                                        of the KRX is being wound down.


                                         Principle 2: Governance

An FMI should have governance arrangements that are clear and transparent, promote the safety and
efficiency of the FMI, and support the stability of the broader financial system, other relevant public
interest considerations, and the objectives of relevant stakeholders.

Key consideration 1                     The FSCMA stipulates that the KRX should be established to fix

                                         into account public interests in operating the CCP. The objectives
                                         generally express KRX’s aim to become the leading capital market
                                         in Northeast Asia. In addition, the objectives express KRX’s aim to
                                         further market credibility, investor protection and confidence in
                                         the organization.
Key consideration 2                      Governance arrangements

An FMI should have documented            The KRX ownership structure:
governance arrangements that
provide clear and direct lines of            Treasury stock 4.62 percent;

more general level, the public.
                                         The KRX was demutualized when the KRX was converted into a
                                         stock company in 2005. Currently, not all KRX members are
                                         shareholders. Appendix 1 contains a list of all KRX shareholders.

                                         The KRX is governed by the FSCMA, the act of public institutions
                                         and the commercial act that prescribes that the KRX should have
                                         articles of incorporation, as well as its own regulations.

                                         The FSCMA prescribes the board of directors, the executives of the
                                         KRX, their qualifications, as well as the different board committees.
                                         It prescribes that a majority of board members shall be non-
                                         executive. The FSCMA also contains provisions to prevent conflicts
                                         of interests at the level of KRX staff.

                                         The KRX is a company established under the FSCMA, with trading
                                         of its shares being restricted pursuant to article 406 of FSCMA.
                                         Share ownership of the KRX is limited to 5 percent of the total
                                         number of shares with voting rights, with some exceptions. When
                                         a shareholder intends to sell its holdings, it should acquire a prior
                                         approval of the board of the KRX, pursuant to article 58 of the
                                         articles of incorporation. This is to prevent conflicts of interest,
                                         which may hamper the stable functioning of the capital market.
                                         After its incorporation as a stock company subject to the
                                         commercial act of January 2005, KRX was designated as a public
                                         institution due to its monopolistic income structure (the only
                                         exchange in Korea), in accordance with the act of public
                                         institutions. Therefore, its governance framework such as budget,
                                         personnel affairs, and business plan are under control of the
                                         government.

                                       allow for the establishment of multiple trading venues, KRX’s

                                          KRX members are shareholders. The KRX does not have a

                                          The governance arrangements of the KRX are transparent and the
                                          roles and responsibilities of its board and management are clearly
                                          described and publicly available. Non-executive directors are
                                          appointed to represent public interests. The KRX has established a
                                          risk management committee and a risk management department
                                          to identify, monitor and management companywide risks as well
                                          as CCP related risks. The risk management department reports to
                                          the board and the board endorses major decisions.

Key conclusions for Principle 2           The governance arrangements do however contain some gaps and
                                          issues of concern that should be addressed in a defined timeline.
                                          The risk management committee is, although independent of the
                                          business departments, chaired by an executive director who is also
                                          responsible for strategy and planning related issues, and therefore
                                          not fully independent from business related matters. The number
                                          of staff of the risk management team and the clearing and
                                          settlement department responsible for management of risks is
                                          small compared to the scope of their responsibilities. Finally, the
                                          objectives of the KRX do not place a particular high priority on the

Assessment of Principle 2
                                       It is recommended to address the identified gaps and
                                       shortcomings in a defined timeline.

                                       First, it is recommended that the CCP activities of the KRX are
                                       more explicitly addressed within the KRX organization. In particular
                                       the KRX should explicitly and publicly state its objectives for the
                                       KRX-CCP, addressing the safety and efficiency of its operations
                                       and support for the financial stability in Korea. This is important as
                                       the functioning of the CCP may affect multiple financial institutions
                                       and markets in Korea.

                                       recommended to publish the risk management regulation on the
                                       KRX website.

                                        In addition, for the safety of the CCP it is essential that the
                                       number of staff in the KRX responsible for risk management is
                                       increased to allow them to manage companywide and CCP risks in
                                       a proactive way. They should be able to familiarize themselves with

                Principle 3: Framework for the Comprehensive Management of Risks

An FMI should have a sound risk-management framework for comprehensively managing legal, credit,

                    Risk management policies, procedures and systems

                    The KRX introduced the risk management regulation in April 2009.
                    The regulation specifies the risks to be managed, responsibilities
                    of different units involved in risk management, and the principles
                    and procedures for the management of risk.

                    The policies and procedures related to the risk management
                    committee are covered by the regulation for the risk management
                    committee operation. Principles and procedures for risk
                    management are further described in other relevant regulations
                    and guidelines.

                    The risk management department supports the risk management
                    committee and reports on the actual risks compared to the ex ante
                    risk limits set by the risk management committee and other
                    important issues related to risk management.
                    The role of the risk management department is defined in article 7
                    of the risk management regulations and specifies the duties of the
                    risk management department:

                       Execution of the Committee resolutions;

                       Enterprise-wide risk measurement, monitoring, evaluation
                        and reporting; and

                       Management and calculation of proper equity capital scale

                    Analysis and reporting of management activities, affecting
                    finance and risk; and

                         Businesses associated with other risks except for the
                          subparagraphs 1 to 4.

                    Review of risk management policies, procedures and systems

                    The risk management department prepares an annual risk
                    management plan, which is submitted to the risk management
                    committee and contains proposal for further improvement of the
                    risk management policies, procedures and systems. The risk
                    management committee evaluates the feasibility of policies on a
                    quarterly basis or more frequent if needed. The internal audit
                    office conducts an annual surveillance on the adequacy of risk
                    management framework.

                    Risk management systems

                    The KRX has developed and introduced the settlement risk

                                      December 2010. KRX plans to extend this management system to
                                      OTC-traded products in 2014. It has also introduced an
                                      operational risk management system in January 2013.

                                            Settlement Risk Management System (operational since
                                             December 2010).

                                      The settlement risk management system measures, monitors and
                                      manages credit risk and liquidity risk from defaults of participants.
                                      The main objectives of the system are to identify a potential
                                      member default risk in advance and manage risk exposures and
                                      financial resources to enable continuous provision of clearing and
                                      settlement services in stressful market conditions. It calculates risk
                                      exposures and evaluates settlement risk on a daily basis.

                                      The system is connected with the KRX clearing and settlement
                                      system and data vendors via interfaces. It automatically receives
                                      information to calculate risk exposures and evaluate the
                                      settlement risk management indices.

                                            Operational Risk Management System (January 2013)
                                             The operational risk management system measures,
                                             monitors and manages operation risk. Operational risk is
                                             the possibility that the KRX will face losses due to improper
                                             or erroneous internal procedures, personnel, systems and
                                             external events, including business risk, IT risk, legal risk and
                                             reputational risk.

                                            Its main objectives are to prevent and control a variety of
                                             operational risks in an efficient manner.

                                      Key risk indicators (KRIs) and KRI limits are automatically extracted.
                                      Risk control and self assessment reports and KRI trends are
                                      automatically generated. All departments and executives in the
                                      KRX take part in the assessment of operational risk. The system
                                      collects and evaluates RCSA and KRI values on a quarterly basis.

                                     poses credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk to participants.
                                     The KSD has a vertical relationship with the KRX, since it performs
                                     securities settlement in the securities market and depository and
                                     management services of substitute securities in the derivatives
                                     market. Thereby, the KSD is exposed to operational risks posed by
                                     the KRX.

                                     Risk management tools

                                     The KRX has established criteria for banks to become settlement
                                     banks. The KRX monitors compliance regularly. Regarding other
                                     FMIs the KRX continuously cooperates with the KSD and BOK and
                                     shares information that is relevant to identify, monitor and
                                     mitigate risks. In case a system failure occurs in the KSD, the KRX
                                     has the opportunity to modify the settlement deadline and
                                     settlement date taking into account the impact of such a delay on
                                     the stability of the system.

                                       The KRX is working on a resolution scheme for orderly
                                       arrangements together with the FSC to manage the event of
                                       unexpected bankruptcy of the CCP.

Key conclusions for Principle 3        The KRX has developed a companywide risk management
                                       framework, consisting of policies, tools, governance arrangements
                                       and default procedures for managing credit, liquidity, operational,
                                       and market risks. The risk management framework has recently
                                       been implemented and requires business departments and the
                                       market oversight department to identify, monitor and manage its
                                       risks. In addition to this bottom-up approach the KRX board
                                       decides on risk management limits. The risk management
                                       framework is reviewed on an annual basis and includes risks
                                       related to external stakeholders, such as settlement banks, the KSD
                                       and the BOK. The risk management framework is regularly
                                       assessed through independent audits.

                                       The KRX has not started with the development of plans for
                                       recovery or orderly wind down. The KRX should decide which of its
                                       operations are critical to continue in times of crisis. The KRX
                                       should also develop crisis scenarios that go beyond the default
                                       procedures and business continuity plans. The scenarios may cover
                                       extreme but plausible events, such as the default of a large
                                       participant that is part of a financial group that provides multiple
                                       services to the KRX, such as settlement and custody activities. The
                                       lack of such a plan is an issue of concern, given the size of
                                       systemic importance of the KRX-CCP and the impact of a potential
                                       failure of the KRX on the financial stability in Korea.

Recommendations and comments              The KRX should develop a recovery plan in line with the
                                          requirements stated in the PFMI and the other relevant
                                          documentation provided by the standard setting bodies CPSS and
                                          IOSCO. The plan should (i) identify critical operations of the FMI;
                                          (ii) contain scenarios that may potentially prevent the KRX from
                                          providing critical operations to the markets it serves; and (iii)
                                          strategies to support recovery of its critical operations. The plan
                                          should be developed in close cooperation with the FSC as well as
                                          the BOK and regularly reviewed and updated.


                                             Principle 4: Credit Risk

An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its credit exposures to participants and those
arising from its payment, clearing, and settlement processes. An FMI should maintain sufficient financial
resources to cover its credit exposure to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence. In
addition, a CCP that is involved in activities with a more-complex risk profile or that is systemically
important in multiple jurisdictions should maintain additional financial resources sufficient to cover a wide
range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, the default of the two
participants and their affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate credit exposure to the
CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions. All other CCPs should maintain additional financial
resources sufficient to cover a wide range of potential stress scenarios that should include, but not be
limited to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would potentially cause the largest aggregate
credit exposure to the CCP in extreme but plausible market conditions.

                                         The risk management regulation specifies the risks to be managed,
                                         responsibilities of different units involved in risk management, and
                                         the principles and procedures for the management of risk. Principles
                                         and procedures for risk management are further described in other

    Guideline on margin management.

Systems

The KRX operates the settlement risk management system, a
collateral system in the clearing and settlement system and a
margining system COMS. In addition, the KRX is able to monitor the
settlement process on a real time basis through its EXTURE system.

    The main functions of settlement risk management system are
     the management of risk from a potential participant’s default
     by monitoring the financial condition of the members.

    Management of financial resources to ensure completion of
     settlement, by calculating the maximum settlement amount
     per member.

    Management of potential losses, by calculating the market
     risks of settlement positions.

    Management of margin rates on derivatives trading by
     measuring the volatility for each product.

    Management of intraday risk by estimating the intraday gains
     and losses on open positions.

For the DM the KRX calculates the margins by using the COMS
which determines margin requirements per individual risk
management account.

Governance

The clearing and settlement department is responsible for the
provision of clearing and settlement services to participants as a
CCP. This department is in charge of managing credit risk, which
includes regular analyses of the credit management framework. The
department initiates improvements to the framework if needed.

                                          In case a clearing member does not fulfill its obligations the KRX will
                                          start its default procedures as described in principle 13. In case a
                                          clearing member does not deliver its securities the CCP will activate
                                          a buy-in procedure to purchase securities on behalf of a failing
                                          member (KOSPI 75-10). The failing clearing member shall pay to the
                                          KRX the loss caused by the settlement delay.
Key consideration 2                       The KRX’s operation as a CCP exposes it to credit risk:

                                                  collateral that is posted with the KRX.

                                          The management of credit risk consists of:

                                                 Monitoring compliance of clearing members with
                                                  participation requirements.

   The joint compensation fund should not be confused with fidelity guarantee money and the good faith deposit.
Fidelity Guarantee Money is a fund to guarantee the repayment of debt which is likely to be incurred as a result of
transactions on the securities market or the derivatives market pursuant to Article 395 of the FSCMA. A KRX member
should deposit an amount of KRW 1 million for both of the equity market and the derivatives market. The good faith
deposit means collateral which participants may collect from their customers to ensure the fulfillment of their
obligations. Participants are free to determine the rate and collection method of the good faith deposit. Finally, the

Key consideration 3                       N/A

A payment system or SSS should
cover its current and, where they
exist, potential future exposures to
each participant fully with a high
degree of confidence using
collateral and other equivalent
financial resources (see Principle 5
on collateral). In the case of a DNS
payment system or DNS SSS in
which there is no settlement
guarantee but where its participants
face credit exposures arising from
its payment, clearing, and
settlement processes, such an FMI
should maintain, at a minimum,
sufficient resources to cover the
exposures of the two participants
and their affiliates that would create
the largest aggregate credit
exposure in the system.

                                         The KRX is collecting margins on settlement position at 99.7 percent
                                         confidence level to cover credit exposure (the guideline on margin

                                         Joint Compensation Fund

                                         FSCMA article 394 stipulates that every KRX member should
                                         contribute to the KRX joint compensation fund in order to
                                         compensate for losses following the default of a clearing member.
                                         The KRX has established separate joint funds for the securities
                                         market and the derivatives market.

                                         The total size of the joint compensation fund for the securities and
                                         the derivatives markets is described in the membership regulation
                                         and should be KRW 200 billion for each market. The contribution of
                                         a clearing member is calculated on a quarterly basis. The KRX can

require a full replenishment in case the joint compensation fund is
used to cover the losses following a clearing member’s default.

The contribution of a clearing member to the joint compensation
fund for the securities market is determined as the sum of the
following:

     Basic contribution of KRW 1 billion.

     The multiplication of the ratio [of the average daily trading
      value of the concerned clearing member to the total average
      daily trading value of all clearing members contributing to the
      joint compensation fund for one year period retroactive from
      the end of the previous quarter] by the difference resulting
      from subtracting the total of the basic contribution and other
      contributions from the total value of the joint compensation
      fund of the securities market.

The contribution of a clearing member to the joint compensation
fund for the derivatives market is determined as the sum of the
following:

     Basic contribution of KRW 1 billion.

     The multiplication of the ratio [of the average daily margin

      from subtracting the total of the basic contribution from the
      total value of the joint compensations fund of the derivatives
      market.

Additional financial resources

Additional financial resources to cover losses are comprised of the
own assets of the KRX, including the settlement reserves.
The KRX deposits a part of its retained earnings as settlement
reserves as an additional cushion to cover losses caused by a
participant’s default pursuant to article 54 of the articles of
incorporation.

Risk profile and systemic importance in multiple jurisdictions

At present, KRX does not clear products with more-complex risk
profiles, but KRX is planning to provide clearing service for OTC
KRW-IRS from June 2014 and considering other OTC instruments
like CDS which has a more-complex risk profile.

                                          The clearing and settlement department conducts stress tests on
                                          member’s settlement positions on a daily basis. The results of the
                                          daily stress tests are stored and forwarded to the risk management

Key conclusions for Principle 4        The KRX has identified various sources of credit and liquidity risks
                                       related to its CCP activities, i.e. from guaranteeing settlement and its
                                       investment book. For that purpose the KRX has developed the
                                       settlement risk management system that monitors credit exposures
                                       per clearing account in real time. For the derivatives market credit
                                       risks are in general properly identified and monitored. The KRX
                                       manages credit risks in the derivatives market by collecting margin,
                                       joint compensation fund contributions and by allocating its
                                       settlement reserves to cover credit losses. The KRX uses daily stress
                                       testing to determine the sufficiency of its financial resources
                                       available in the event of a clearing member’s default in extreme but
                                       plausible market conditions. The KRX has defined a risk
                                       management waterfall for the use of financial resources in case of
                                       credit losses. The legal and regulatory framework supports this
                                       framework.

                                       The KRX has started to develop a comprehensive risk management
                                       framework for the securities market, as volumes are large and the
                                       KRX is exposed to credit losses between the trading and settlement
                                       day. Also, as the size of the joint compensation fund is defined in
                                       the regulations it is difficult for the KRX to adapt the fund to
                                       accommodate increased exposures in the securities market. The KRX
                                       does not stress test the sufficiency of the joint compensation fund
                                       for the securities market.

                                       Several other features of the credit risk management framework are
                                       however not in line with the PFMI requirements. The KRX does
                                       currently not conduct back testing or sensitivity analysis to measure
                                       the adequacy of its margin model, although the KRX has developed
                                       plans to introduce them in the autumn of 2013. The credit risk
                                       management models, including the margin models, are not
                                       validated by an independent entity, such as its regulators or an
                                       external expert, such as an academic or consultancy bureau. The
                                       concept of affiliated members is not yet considered in the credit risk

                                       management framework of the KRX. The risk management waterfall
                                       does not yet reflect the requirement of the PFMI that part of the
                                       KRX capital should be taken before the financial resources of
                                       surviving clearing members can be used (skin the game).

Assessment of Principle 4              Partly Observed
Recommendations and comments           By its nature a CCP concentrates the counterparty credit risk in a
                                       market, which may cause systemic disruptions in the case of a
                                       default of the CCP. A CCP should therefore adopt a solid risk
                                       management framework to manage credit risks related to all
                                       markets it serves. It is recommended that KRX accords a high
                                       priority to addressing the shortcomings in its current credit risk
                                       management framework.

                                       First, it is recommended to reform the credit risk management
                                       framework for the securities market, by collecting risk-based
                                       collateral (margin). The KRX may also reconsider the current design
                                       of its joint compensation funds, for example by removing the fixed
                                       size requirement of the fund in its regulations to better address the
                                       need for increased funds in case of increased exposures. In any case,
                                       the contribution of the joint compensation fund should be based on
                                       the exposures of a particular clearing member. This approach may
                                       replace the current determination of the clearing member’s
                                       contribution to the fund, which is currently based on its transaction
                                       volumes.

                                       The KRX is encouraged to continue with its planned reforms
                                       regarding the introduction of back testing, sensitivity analysis and
                                       the skin in the game concept.

                                       The KRX should in addition ensure that its credit risk management
                                       model and in particular its margin model are reviewed at least
                                       annually by an independent party. A CCP should have its valuation
                                       models validated under a variety of market scenarios by a qualified
                                       and independent party to ensure that its model accurately produces
                                       appropriate prices, and where appropriate, the CCP should adjust its
                                       calculation of initial margin to reflect any identified model risk.

                                       Finally, the KRX should ensure that its credit risk calculations take
                                       into account not only the individual clearing members, but also its
                                       affiliates.

                                          Principle 5: Collateral

An FMI that requires collateral to manage its or its participants’ credit exposure should accept collateral
with low credit, liquidity, and market risks. An FMI should also set and enforce appropriately conservative
haircuts and concentration limits.

                                         security valuation through the electronic information delivery
                                         medium operated by the KRX and on its homepage.

                                         The KRX considers stability, liquidity as well as convenience in
                                         management and valuation when determining which assets it

                                         liquidity and market risk.

                                         The KRX does not accept other collateral on an exceptional basis.

                                         For foreign securities the KRX determines the basic market price of
                                         foreign securities by averaging the market prices for each issue
                                         that the global information and communication service provider
                                         provides consecutively in the recent five trading days.

                                         The KRX has the discretion to limit the types of foreign securities
                                         accepted, or change the valuation parameters.

                                         The KRX marks to market all collateral types on a daily basis,
                                         except bonds. Bonds are marked to market on a weekly basis as
                                         the KRX considers that price volatility of bonds is relatively small
                                         and bond prices are bought from external data providers.

                                         The KRX sets haircuts, taking into account the credit and liquidity
                                         risk for the different asset classes:

                                                20–40 percent for listed stocks, including ETFs and DRs;

                                                5–20 percent for listed bonds;

                                                5 percent for foreign currency;

                                                Treasury bills with maturity of 1 year or less: 8 percent;

                                                Treasury notes with maturity of 10 years or less: 12
                                                 percent; and

                                         To validate whether haircuts are adequately set, the KRX monitors
                                         price volatility, market liquidity and other variables every day. In
                                         case where volatility increases continuously or market liquidity
                                         decreases abruptly, KRX may adjust haircuts in accordance with
                                         articles 92, 92–2 and 130 of the enforcement rules of the DM

timely manner.                         To ensure access to cross-border collateral the KRX accepts US
                                       government securities that are regarded as risk-free assets among
                                       cross-border assets.

                                       For the certainty of claiming rights on US government securities
                                       and the convenience of disposal, the KRX has opened a link

                                       collaterals are automatically validated at the moment of deposit.
                                       Securities are deposited at the KSD and cash and foreign
                                       currencies are deposited in settlement banks. Systems of the KRX,
                                       KSD and settlement banks are linked to one another, so it’s

                                       demand and monitor the overall collateral status.

                                       There’s no reuse of collateral. Member’s collateral margin is
                                       available only for guaranteeing the repayment of debt to KRX in
                                       derivatives transactions, and the reuse of collateral for other
                                       purposes is strictly prohibited by law. Also, has the KRX holds a
                                       right of pledge on securities deposited at the KSD it is practically

                                       Upon request of a member, an immediate withdrawal or deposit of
                                       collateral is possible.

                                       The collateral management system accommodates changes in the

                                         such as securities, it is recommended that the KRX develops a

                                            Principle 6: Margin

A CCP should cover its exposure to its participants for all products through an effective margin system
that is risk-based and regularly reviewed.

                                         KRX’s COMS margin system is a mixed pre-and post-margin
                                         system. The pre-margin is deposited only by customers. Customers
                                         with the exception of qualified institutional investors must deposit
                                         the customer margin with their clearing member before
                                         submitting an order. A trading member cannot submit the
                                         customers’ order unless the required margins are deposited.

The margin methodology is documented in the DM business
regulations, in particular annex 18, and the guideline on margin
management.

Credit exposures

In case of a participant’s default, the KRX is responsible for taking
over the payment obligations of the default participant and
completing settlement as the CCP. The KRX may face replacement
cost risk, which is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction
will default before final settlement has occurred. The resulting
exposure is the cost of replacing the original transaction at current
market prices. Due to worsened market conditions the CCP may
face replacement cost. The new price may differ from the original
price, due to unfavorable market developments, causing a loss to
the CCP.

The KRX has identified the main determinants for credit risk, which
are a participant’s default and market volatility. Other
determinants are the composition of positions and the correlation
among positions. When the underlying assets within a product
group show similar movements, credit exposures can be reduced
according to the composition of positions, but credit exposures
can also increase when correlations among positions rise steeply in
stressful market conditions.

The KRX manages credit risk by requesting its members to deposit
margin, based on the size and composition of their positions (see
key consideration 3).
Operational components

The clearing member has to deposit its own margin as well as its
customers’ margin at one of the six settlement banks for cash
collateral or at the KSD for securities collateral. Customers’ margin
or pre-margin has to be deposited before the transaction can take
place. Post-margin is deposited by clearing members and
institutional investors at noon on T+1.

In case of a delay in the margin deposit, the clearing and
settlement department reports this to the market oversight
division as a violation of KRX’s regulations. The market oversight
division can take disciplinary actions.

In case where a participant has failed to deposit the margin
amount, the KRX may declare a non-fulfillment of settlement, or
default, and start the default procedures as described in article 107
of the DM business regulation.

circumstances in which pricing data
are not readily available or reliable.   In order to secure the continuity of operations in emergency
                                         situations, including the use of KRX systems as data source for
                                         margin calculations, the KRX has established a secondary IT site as
                                         a backup solution in a geographically remote area. Data is fully
                                         synchronized with the primary site. Bond prices are obtained from
                                         several external data providers.

                                         Estimation of prices

                                         If the end of the day closing prices of futures and options are not
                                         available the KRX will use the most recent prices. If these prices are
                                         not available the prices used for margin calculations will be based
                                         on the theoretical prices derived from the price of the nearest
                                         month contract. If prices of the nearest month are not available,
                                         the theoretical price will be determined using the same futures
                                         with expiration months further into the future. However, if these
                                         settlement prices are also not available, the theoretical settlement
                                         price of futures will be used. The calculation of the theoretical
                                         settlement price of futures is comprehensively described in the
                                         enforcement rules.

                                         The theoretical prices are calculated based on the equations that
                                         are proved theoretically by researchers and widely used in the
                                         financial market. In addition KRX uses an analysis based on
                                         historical price data (closing execution price, the value weighted
                                         average price and the theoretical price).
                                         The KRX has the discretion to deviate from these rules in case of
                                         abnormal trading or otherwise deemed necessary for the safe and
                                         efficient functioning of the market.

                                         To reflect both current volatility and past market volatility, KRX
                                         determines margin rates using both short-time periods (20, 60
                                         days) and long-time periods (120, 250, 1,000 days). In case of a

                                         As outlined in the guideline for the margin rate management, KRX
                                         is able to adjust margin rates conservatively in case of changing

Principle 6                               its clearing members through a margining system called COMS,
                                          which is based on internationally used margin models. The margin
                                          model is risk based and comprises both initial and variation
                                          margin. The initial margin is determined per product group based
                                          on the maximum net loss, calculated with a 99.7 confidence level
                                          and using a 2-day close-out period. The scenarios used for
                                          calculating volatility margins are based on both price changes in
                                          the underlying assets and option volatility. The KRX allows for
                                          offsets in a conservative way.

                                          Currently, the KRX does not have the operational capacity to make
                                          intraday margin calls. As recommended in principle 4 the KRX
                                          needs further improvements to its margin framework to comply
                                          with the PFMI, in particular in relation to back testing and
                                          sensitivity analysis and by obtaining an independent review and
                                          validation of its model on an annual basis.

Assessment of Principle 6                 Broadly Observed

Recommendations and comments              A main recommendation is to continue with developing plans to
                                          introduce intraday margin arrangements. A CCP should have the
                                          authority and operational capacity to make intraday initial margin
                                          calls, both scheduled and unscheduled, to its participants.
                                          In addition, the close-out period of 2 days should be better
                                          substantiated for the individual products that are cleared by KRX.
                                          The appropriate close-out period may vary among products and
                                          markets depending upon the product’s liquidity, price, and other
                                          characteristics. The CCP should also consider and address position
                                          concentrations, which can lengthen close-out timeframes and add
                                          to price volatility during close outs.


                                           Principle 7: Liquidity Risk

An FMI should effectively measure, monitor, and manage its liquidity risk. An FMI should maintain sufficient
liquid resources in all relevant currencies to effect same-day and, where appropriate, intraday and multiday
settlement of payment obligations with a high degree of confidence under a wide range of potential stress
scenarios that should include, but not be limited to, the default of the participant and its affiliates that would
generate the largest aggregate liquidity obligation for the FMI in extreme but plausible market conditions.

Key consideration 1                       The KRX’s liquidity risk arises when clearing members, or other

                                      If participants fail to fulfill their payment obligations, the KRX needs to
                                      ensure completion of settlement by using its own liquidity resources.
                                      Also the KRX may also face liquidity needs from its settlement banks
                                      and liquidity providers if they fail to perform as expected.

                                      Because cash payments in the securities market and the derivatives
                                      market are settled in KRW, and the final delivery of FX derivatives in

                                      the KRX may face liquidity risk in all these currencies.

                                      In order to estimate potential liquidity needs, the KRX monitors
                                      members’ securities delivery and cash payments on a real-time basis.

                                      To finalize the settlement process even in case where a certain
                                      liquidity provider or a settlement bank fails to perform as expected,
                                      the KRX has opened lines of credit with various institutions (KSFC and
                                      three commercial banks with a credit ratio of at least 8 percent). For
                                      FX derivatives KRX has opened a FX credit line with the Korea
                                      Exchange Bank.

                                      To ensure the sufficiency of the amount of credit lines and other
                                      liquidity resources, the available credit lines and the use of liquidity
                                      resources are designated as management indicators in the
                                      enforcement rules of the risk management regulation, which means
                                      that information about the credit lines is included in the quarterly

Key conclusions for Principle 7         The KRX does have an effective framework for the management of

                                        and funding flows on an ongoing basis. The KRX stress tests its
                                        liquidity needs both daily and monthly and reports its findings on a
                                        quarterly basis to the risk management committee. KRX does not
                                        stress its liquidity needs for foreign currencies, as settlements in
                                        foreign currencies are low. If needed the KRX can draw on an FX credit
                                        line with one of its liquidity providers. The liquidity providers need to
                                        comply with specific criteria set out in the KRX rules. The KRX does
                                        not rely on central bank money; however, its largest liquidity provider
                                        has a public profile and a triple A credit rating.
Assessment of Principle 7               Observed
Recommendations and comments            It is recommended that the KRX implements stress testing exercises
                                        for foreign currencies in the normal course of its business.
                                       Principle 8: Settlement Finality

An FMI should provide clear and certain final settlement, at a minimum by the end of the value date. Where
necessary or preferable, an FMI should provide final settlement intraday or in real time.

                                      A transaction is final at the moment of settlement, which differs per

                                      In the event that a book-transfer entry for settlement securities has

                                      Settlement of the cash leg of the securities transaction is conducted in
                                      the BOK-Wire+ system of the BOK. Finality is achieved in real-time and
                                      payments once settled in cash account of the BOK member. The
                                      settlement in the BOK-Wire+ is protected under article 120 of the

                                      For a derivatives transaction the moment of settlement finality is
                                      covered by DM business regulation article 103. A transaction is

                                       settlement deadlock caused by OTC settlement positions related to
                                       KRX settlement positions.

Key conclusions for Principle 8        Securities settlements are final as soon as the settlement account has
                                       been debited or credited, which occurs real time during the settlement
                                       day. Derivatives transactions are final as soon as KRX has determined

Assessment of Principle 8              Observed
Recommendations and comments           The KRX can improve its DM regulations to specify the point after
                                       which member’s obligations may not be revoked by a clearing
                                       member. The KRX may do so in the normal course of its business.


                                       Principle 9: Money Settlements

An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank money where practical and available. If central
bank money is not used, an FMI should minimize and strictly control the credit and liquidity risks arising from
the use of commercial bank money.
Key consideration 1                     The cash leg of transactions in stocks, government securities and
                                        repos are settled in central bank money, i.e. the BOK-WIRE+ system.

                                        also conducted in commercial bank money.

                                        The main reason for not using central bank money is that not all
                                        clearing members have access to the BOK-WIRE+ system.
                                        For retail bonds central bank money is not provided, because the
                                        settlement risk of this market is considered low, its market size is
                                        small and settlement takes place on the same day as the transaction
                                        date (T+0).

                                        For derivatives commercial bank money is considered more
                                        convenient. The KRX uses commercial banks (Shinhan bank, Woori
                                        bank, Nonghyup bank, Korea exchange bank) for the cash settlement

                                           has contributed to a more timely completion of settlements.

Key conclusions for Principle 9          The KRX conducts its money settlements for the securities market in
                                         central bank money, except for retail bonds, which are settled on T+0

                                         market are settled in commercial bank money because the majority
                                         clearing members active in derivatives trading do not have direct
                                         access the BOK-Wire+. The KRX makes use of six commercial banks to
                                         settle cash following derivatives transactions. The KRX has a limited
                                         set of criteria to select its settlement banks. Banks should be
                                         regulated and supervised and have a capital ratio of 8 percent. The
                                         KRX does not impose additional requirements, such as
                                         creditworthiness, access to liquidity and operational reliability. It
                                         monitors compliance with these criteria on a monthly basis. The
                                         contracts between the KRX and its settlement banks do not contain
                                         an expiration date.

Assessment of Principle 9                Observed
Recommendations and comments             As long as the KRX makes use of commercial bank money it should
                                         increase its requirements for settlement banks and monitor
                                         compliance with these requirements regularly. It may also consider
                                         including an expiration date in its contracts with the settlement banks
                                         to provide incentives to the settlement banks to continue to provide
                                         adequate services and reduce risks.

                                      Principle 10: Physical Deliveries

An FMI should clearly state its obligations with respect to the delivery of physical instruments or commodities
and should identify, monitor, and manage the risks associated with such physical deliveries.
Key consideration 1                   Gold derivatives are eligible for physical delivery. The KRX guarantees

                                      The DM business regulations and enforcement rules specify processes,
                                      procedures and controls to monitor and manage physical delivery risks
                                      (DM business regulations article 61–2 and articles 33–45 of the related
                                      enforcement rules). Annex 18 of the enforcement rules specifies the
                                      calculation of physical delivery margin, which should cover any losses
                                      that the KRX may suffer in its role as CCP.

                                      The regulations further specify that gold is delivered in bars of 1,000
                                      gram with the purity level higher than 99.99 percent, on which the
                                      name of refinery or brand name, weight, purity and manufacturer’s
                                      serial number are engraved.

                                      On the last trading day the buying and selling clearing members shall
                                      inform the KRX of the transaction details, within thirty minutes after the
                                      closing of the market on the last trading day. This enables the KRX to
                                      calculate the final settlement payments. The sellers should inform the
                                      KRX on whether the gold bar is imported or not, and whether it is tariff-
                                      free or not. Buyers should inform the KRX on whether the receiver is a
                                      person eligible for the exemption from the taxation.

                                      The KRX notifies the clearing members and warehouse operators of the
                                      final settlement quantity of gold futures traded per offer and bid for
                                      each derivatives account, as well as other details of delivery and receipt.
                                      The KRX nets the quantities and allots the physical delivery quantities to

                                      The receiving clearing member shall deliver the specified payment to

                                         of the gold bars is the risk of destruction or damage of the bar. Article
                                         37 of the DM regulation enforcement rules specifies that the KRX is

                                         in place to protect KRX against any losses related to the damage of

                         Principle 13: Participant-default Rules and Procedures

An FMI should have effective and clearly defined rules and procedures to manage a participant default.
These rules and procedures should be designed to ensure that the FMI can take timely action to contain
losses and liquidity pressures and continue to meet its obligations.

                                        The FSCMA stipulates the use of member’s collateral such as
                                        member margin, joint compensation fund, and the settlement
                                        reserve in case of a member’s default (articles 394 and 395 of the
                                        FSCMA).

                                        Measures to be taken in the event of default of a securities market
                                        member are stated in the KOSPI market business regulation (article
                                        76). The measures to be taken in the event of default of derivatives

                                        are specified in DM business regulation (articles 107 and 108).
                                        Considerations for determination of default are mentioned in the
                                        enforcement rules of the KOSPI market business regulation (article
                                        101-3) and the enforcement rules of the DM business regulation
                                        (article 111-2).

                                        The risk management waterfall is defined in relevant regulations
                                        and guidelines of the KRX (articles 5 and 397 of the guideline for
                                        use of financial resources for settlement, article 10 of the guideline
                                        for management of default fund, article 25 of the membership
                                        regulation, article 5 of the guideline for management of settlement
                                        reserve).

                                        The KRX declared the default of the Lehman Brothers Securities
                                        Seoul branch in September 2008, in accordance with the business
                                        suspension order imposed by the FSC. For securities transactions,
                                        KRX issued the securities delivery bill against undelivered securities
                                        and upon realizing that a few securities couldn’t be settled,
                                        purchased such securities to complete settlement.

                                        For derivatives transactions, the KRX granted Lehman a grace
                                        period for the voluntary close-out of open interests. The KRX
                                        liquidated the remaining position by offsetting transactions with
                                        help of surviving clearing members.

                                        The KRX can use dedicated financial resources in case of a clearing
                                        member’s default:

                                        (a)    Financial resources of defaulting member (margin, joint
                                               compensation fund).

                                               of the KRX.

                                        The KRX is adjusting the order of financial commitments and
                                        reviewing the revision of applicable laws and regulations in order
                                        to comply with recommendations of PFMI, i.e. that the CCP’s
                                        capital should be used before the joint compensation fund of the

participant’s customers and the collateral provided to the CCP with respect to those positions.

                    Customer protection from participant and fellow customer
                    Default

                    At the level of the clearing member the account structure for both
                    the securities markets and the DM consists of separate accounts
                    for participants and individual customers.

                    Legal basis

                    The legal framework supports the segregation of accounts and
                    contains specific provisions specifying that customers’ assets are
                    protected against the default of a participant or a fellow customer.
                    The FSCMA and KRX’s regulations require that trading and clearing
                    members maintain separate accounts for individual clients and its
                    proprietary accounts (FSCMA articles 74 and 75, KOSPI regulation
                    article 9, DM business regulation articles 65 and 88-5).

                    In the case of the securities market, investment traders or
                    investment brokers should deposit or trust investors’ deposits
                    separately (including cash deposits received in connection with the
                    transactions and sale of financial investments products) from their
                    proprietary assets under the FSCMA article 74. Investment traders
                    or investment brokers cannot seize or offset investors' deposit.
                    Investors’ deposits which are deposited or trusted to the KSD
                    cannot be used as collateral or be transferred. In addition,
                    investors’ deposits which are deposited or trusted to the
                    depository institution should be paid to investors first even if
                    depository institution is dissolved or bankrupt.

                    In the case of securities deposits of investors, in accordance with
                    FSCMA article 61, investment traders or investment brokers should
                    deposit their own securities to KSD without delay. And, investment
                    traders or investment brokers should deposit investor-owned
                    securities to KSD under FSCMA article 75.

                    In addition, the KRX mandates its members to separate orders for
                    proprietary trading and those for brokerage trading in the bidding
                    process under the KOSPI regulation article 9.

                    DM business regulation article 139 specifies: Members are
                    prohibited to use the cash, substitute securities, foreign currency
                    or foreign securities that the customer has deposited for the
                    purposes other than the settlement and deposit of member
                    margin/clearing-member margin, which are related to the trades
                    of the concerned customer, or the purposes specified by the FSC.

                                         another participant to take over the position.

                                         Before transferring the open interest the customer and its new
                                         clearing member shall conclude a legal agreement covering the

                                         The legal agreement between the customer and its new clearing
                                         member has to be submitted to the KRX, which will ensure that the
                                         contract contains all pre-specified requirements.

                                         As soon as the transfer of the position is executed the customer
                                         shall ensure that the collateral representing the member margin
                                         will be deposited with its new clearing member.

                                         The KRX conducts the transfer of open interests and positions
                                         between accounts from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. after receiving request

                                    Principle 15: General Business Risk

An FMI should identify, monitor, and manage its general business risk and hold sufficient liquid net assets
funded by equity to cover potential general business losses so that it can continue operations and services
as a going concern if those losses materialize. Further, liquid net assets should at all times be sufficient to
ensure a recovery or orderly wind-down of critical operations and services.

comprehensive analysis of enterprise-wide risks to the risk
management committee.

KRX’s definition of general business risk

The KRX defines general business risks as (1)
acquisition/disposition of real estate worth of KRW 10 billion or
more, (2) investment/disposition of an amount of KRW 5 billion or
more or 30 percent of other entity, (3) investment in a new
business with a value of KRW 5 billion or more. In addition, the
risks of losses occurring during normal business operations are
included in the company wide risk management framework.

New business

General business risk management also entails the management of
risks coming from new business plans. Each business division has
to submit it plans and proposals for the introduction of new
businesses to the risk management committee. The risk
management department analyzes the particular risks related to
the proposed business and its impact on the financial status of the
KRX. The risk management department analyzes business
feasibility (financial and non-financial), risk factors, contingency
plans of material business decisions and sets risk limits (or
permitted level of risk), if necessary. The risk management
department reports the results of the analysis to the risk
management committee. Based on the analysis the risk
management committee conducts the final examination on the
proposed business and determines the permissible range of risk.

Capital

Beside the above-stated risk limits, the KRX maintains an
appropriate level of liquid assets in accordance with advices of an
external professional organization. Financial data is automatically
collected on a real time basis. The KRX is subject to external audits
on a semiannual and annual basis. In addition, the KRX calculates
the adequate capital taking account of clearing and settlement
risks measured by stress tests and mid-and long-term financial
strategies inclusive of new business plans. The risk management
committee has to approve the size of the adequate capital.

 Key conclusions for Principle 15        The KRX has a system in place to identify potential general
                                         business risks, which includes risks related to the introduction of

 Recommendations and comments            The potential recovery plan of the KRX should link the size of its
                                         liquid net assets and the length of time requirement to maintain
                                         its critical operations and services. It should also contain a

                                        In the securities market, the settlement bank for foreign securities is
                                        selected by the KSD after a prior consultation with the KRX, pursuant
                                        to article 75–2 of the KOSPI business regulation. This settlement
                                        bank should be a commercial bank with a capital ratio of at least 8

                                        derivatives markets, the KRX selects settlement banks among
                                        commercial banks with the equity capital ratio above 8 percent.
                                        These settlement banks are selected to act simultaneously as a

                                        The KRX has concluded a contract with every individual settlement
                                        bank. The KSD is a signatory of the contract as well. The contract has

Key conclusions for Principle 16       The KRX holds its own and its participants’ assets at supervised and
                                       regulated entities. KRX selection criteria for custodians and
                                       monitoring systems do not ensure that these entities have robust
                                       accounting practices, safekeeping procedures, and internal controls
                                       that fully protect the assets in custody. The KRX monitors the
                                       concentration of its credit and liquidity credit in relation to its
                                       custodians. The maximum allowed concentration of settlement flows
                                       is set at 60 percent. KRX does not perform tests to determine
                                       whether it is able to manage losses following the default of the
                                       custodian to which it has the largest exposure.

                                       KRX’s investment strategy allows only investments in cash,
                                       government bonds and monetary stabilization bonds, which
                                       supports timely liquidation. The investment strategy is not publicly

Assessment of Principle 16             Broadly Observed
Recommendations and comments           Selection criteria for custodians of the KRX should ensure that these
                                       banks have robust accounting practices, safekeeping procedures,
                                       and internal controls that fully protect the assets of KRX and its
                                       participants. The KRX should ensure that the foreign collateral held
                                       in custody by the foreign bank is protected against claims of the
                                       custodian’s creditors. The KRX should ensure that the custodian
                                       banks have a strong financial position to be able to sustain losses
                                       from operational problems or non-custodial activities. The KRX
                                       should reconsider the 60 percent cap on the value of assets held by
                                       one custodian based on an analysis of its ability to withstand the
                                       default of a custodian holding 60 percent of assets. The KRX should
                                       also disclose its investment policy in English.



                                      Principle 17: Operational Risk

An FMI should identify the plausible sources of operational risk, both internal and external, and mitigate
their impact through the use of appropriate systems, policies, procedures, and controls. Systems should be
designed to ensure a high degree of security and operational reliability and should have adequate, scalable
capacity. Business continuity management should aim for timely recovery of operations and fulfillment of
the FMI’s obligations, including in the event of a wide-scale or major disruption.

                                        consists of:

                                            Companywide policies and procedures;

                                            Operational risk management system;

                                            Governance (see key consideration 2); and

                                            Contingency plans (see key consideration 6).

                                        Companywide policies and procedures

                                        Early 2013 the KRX introduced the operational risk management
                                        regulation to reinforce existing risk management regulation in
                                        particular regarding operational risks. The regulation requires that
                                        each business division is required to appoint a risk manager.

                                        Operational risk is one of the risks identified by the KRX. It is
                                        therefore included in the company wide risk management
                                        framework and is subject to risk limits set by the risk management
                                        committee. Every division of the KRX conducts regular RCSA and
                                        determines KRI. The RCSAs and KRIs are reported to the risk
                                        management department and the risk management committee.

                                        The risk management committee discusses the reports and
                                        provides the individual business divisions with recommendations
                                        or instructions to improve their risk management.

                                        The KRX classifies its operational risk into the following
                                        components:

                                        The KRX has internal rules in respect of system management such
                                        as the Regulation on Management of IT Business, the Information

                                        operation and manages system operation risks in accordance with
                                        the Regulation on Supervision of Electronic Finance of the FSS.

                                        Operational risk management system

                                        Early 2013 the KRX has introduced the operational risk
                                        management system to be able to manage operational risk
                                        information in an automated way.

                                        The KRX organizes training courses/workshops on methodologies
                                        of risk management for its employees periodically.

                                        Regarding change management material business decisions are
                                        subject to deliberation of the risk management committee and if
                                        necessary, the committee makes decisions on additional allocation
                                        of capital, suggests recommendation for improvements or refuses
                                        the business plan itself. Through such process, the KRX analyzes
                                        possible negative impacts caused by change in on-going business
                                        and new major business, and mitigates identified risks.

Key consideration 2                     The risk management committee allocates capital on risks,

                                        and 1 financial expert). The risk management committee takes
                                        decisions on behalf of the board, which are reported to the board.
                                        The risk management committee receives reports on the status of
                                        operational risk management on a quarterly basis.

                                        The internal audit office of the KRX validates the adequacy of the
                                        risk management framework through annual and special audits.
                                        Operational risk management is not subject to external audit, but

                                          The KRX established information protection policies by segment
                                          (server, network, and data, terminal) and identifies unauthorized

                                          Also, systems are operated in a secured IT operation room and
                                          system operators can get access to systems only within the

                                          provides security education and trainings to those staffs regularly.

                                          Outsourced staffs should sign on ‘security covenant’ and take part

                                          The KRX acquired ISO 27001 in 2009, an international standard

                                        The participation requirements for clearing members are publicly

requirements.                           The KRX determines a settlement management index for every
                                        participant, based on its net capital ratio, settlement resource GAP
                                        and credit ratings. This index is a tool that is internally used to
                                        monitor the soundness of the clearing member. In case the index
                                        value is decreasing the head of the clearing and settlement
                                        department will contact the clearing member.

                                        All participants should submit their financial information
                                        (statement of financial position, income statement, their net capital
                                        ratio and short-term liquidity ratio) to the KRX on a monthly basis.
                                        In addition, the clearing member should report any changes in the
                                        shareholder base or board and management immediately.
                                        The membership team analyzes the information on a monthly basis
                                        and reports its findings to the risk management committee.
                                        Participants of the KRX are obliged to submit to the KRX the

                                        and any other documents on the financial status stipulated in the

                                        The member regulation specifies that in cases where the net capital

                                        requirements, the concerned member shall report this to the KRX
                                        within three trading days from the day it has occurred. The three
                                        days provide the member with a grace period so that the member
                                        can take actions to increase its capital.

                                         Since the default of an indirect participant may cause the default
                                         of a direct participant, the KRX stipulates members’ obligation to
                                         manage their customers’ default risk such as collection of
                                         customer margin and procedures for handling the default of

Key consideration 1                     N/A

Before entering into a link
arrangement and on an ongoing
basis once the link is established,

                                       The KRX as a CCP has determined the number of settlement delays
                                       during the year as the parameter for its evaluation of the efficiency
                                       of its clearing and settlement services. The maximum number of

                                       The Presidential Decree is a supplementing regulation to specify
                                       the provisions in FSCMA. The FSCMA article 414 stipulates the

                                       The market efficiency committee is a consultative committee
                                       established by the FSC, which aims to promote efficient operations

                                       established the clearing and settlement committee, which consists

framework for FMIs. An FMI also
should, at a minimum, disclose basic
data on transaction volumes and
values.

Key conclusions for Principle 23       The KRX has disclosed its rules and regulations on its Korean
                                       website. Various rules and regulations are available in English as
                                       well. The website also contains statistics and various descriptions
                                       of the risk management and operational systems. The KRX has
                                       recently disclosed responses to the CPSS-IOSCO Disclosure
                                       framework for FMIs, which enables participants to appropriately
                                       assess the risks they incur by participating in the CCP. The KRX
                                       provides ad hoc training and information to its clearing members.

Assessment of Principle 23             Observed

Recommendations and comments           It is recommended that the KRX discloses all its rules, regulations
                                       and guidelines on its website in English. The clarity of laws and
                                       regulations can be improved by a clear separation between
                                       clearing and trading activities of the KRX and by adopting the
                                       concepts addressed by the PFMI (see also principle 1).

Key consideration 1                      BOK regulation and oversight

Authorities should clearly define and    In terms of article 81 (1) of the BOK Act, the BOK in order to
publicly disclose the criteria used to   promote the safety and efficiency of the payment system as a

to regulation, supervision, and          payment systems that it operates, which is the BOK-Wire+, which
oversight.                               is the only payment system operated by the BOK. For this
                                         purpose, in terms of article 81 (4), the BOK may require
                                         participating institutions to provide any relevant materials.

                                         Article 35 (1) of the ROMPSS classifies payment systems into
                                         systemically important payment systems (SIPS) and other payment
                                         and settlement systems depending on their settlement values and
                                         nature of settlement.

                                         Article 35 (2) of the ROMPSS defines SIPS as “a system” whose
                                         normal operations if interrupted, may cause widespread shock to
                                         the financial system in Korea and abroad and could cause a
                                         system collapse. Under the provisions of this article, BOK-Wire+ is
                                         identified as a SIPS which is subject to oversight by the BOK.
                                         Article 37 of the ROMPSS prescribes the PFMI as the standard for
                                         assessments of the BOK-Wire+.

                                         The BOK-Wire+ is the real time gross settlement system with a
                                         hybrid module in which all systemically important payment
                                         systems settle their balances. This ensures that all systemically
                                         important payment systems settle in central bank money.

                                         The BOK Act as well as the ROMPSS are available on the website

                                         The FSCMA specifies that the KRX and the KSD are subject to
                                         regulation and supervision of the FSC. Articles 373–414 contain
                                         provisions related to the KRX, with articles 410-414 prescribing
                                         the supervision by the FSC and FSS. The law is publicly disclosed
                                         on Internet, e.g. (www.fsc.go.kr). Articles 294–323 contain
                                         provisions on the KSD, with articles 305–307 prescribing the
                                         supervision by the FSC.

                                         The FSCMA specifies the purpose of the regulation and
                                         supervision by the FSC: ‘The purpose of this FSC Act is to

                                       The FSCMA further specifies that the purpose of the FSCMA is to
                                       contribute to the development of the national economy by
                                       facilitating financial innovation and fair competition in the capital

                                       FSCMA article 410 stipulates that the objective of supervision of

Key consideration 2                    BOK regulation and oversight

FMIs that have been identified using   Pursuant to article 35 of the ROMPSS, the BOK has classified and
these criteria should be regulated,    conducts oversight over the following FMIs:
supervised, and overseen by a
central bank, market regulator, or          Check clearing system, Interbank Remittance system, and
other relevant authority.                    Electronic Banking system operated by the KFTC;

                                            Institutional settlement system of bonds operated by the
                                             KSD;

                                            KOSPI market settlement system and KOSDAQ market
                                             settlement system operated by the KRX and KSD;

                                            DM settlement system operated by the KRX; and

                                            CLS system operated by the CLS Bank.

                                       The legal basis for the oversight of BOK over FMI operators such
                                       as the KRX and the KSD is provided under provisions of the BOK
                                       Act (article 81(2) and (3)) and ROMPSS (articles 33 and 42). As laid
                                       down in the ROMPSS, the BOK assesses the FMIs under its
                                       oversight framework on a biennial basis. Where the KRX and KSD
                                       are concerned the BOK conveys the results of the assessment to
                                       the FSC.

                                       FSC and FSS regulation and supervision

                                       Pursuant to the FSCMA, the FSC regulates and supervises the KRX
                                       and KSD. The regulation and supervision of the KRX includes the
                                       CCP activities of KRX. As one of the authorities for the supervision
                                       of non-profit organizations set up under Civil Act, the FSC also
                                       supervises the KFTC.

                                       Where the FSC is the government organization responsible for the
                                       regulation and supervision of the KRX it may have the governor of

                                      other materials related to the KRX. The governor of the FSS has to
                                      report the result of the inspection to the FSC. In case the KRX is
                                      found to violate any rules the governor shall provide the FSC with
                                      an opinion on how to takes actions in response to such violation
                                      (see FSCMA article 410).

                                      There is regulatory overlap between the FSC and BOK regarding
                                      the regulation, supervision and oversight of KSD, KRX and KFTC.
                                      However, currently there is no cooperative oversight framework in
                                      place between the BOK and FSC. There is a need to establish a
                                      consultative and cooperative framework in the form of a
                                      Memorandum of Understanding having a sound legal basis to
                                      ensure effective coordination between the BOK and FSC where
                                      their roles as regulators overlap (see responsibility E).

Responsibility A                      and subject to regulation and supervision of the FSC/FSS. The
                                      legal underpinning of the responsibilities suggests overlap as both
                                      regulators are responsible for financial stability and have
                                      responsibilities related to the KRX and the KSD.

          Responsibility B: Regulatory, Supervisory, and Oversight Powers and Resources

Central banks, market regulators, and other relevant authorities should have the powers and resources to
carry out effectively their responsibilities in regulating, supervising, and overseeing FMIs.

Key consideration 1                  BOK’s powers to obtain timely information and induce change

Authorities should have powers or    As the system owner and operator, the BOK faces no constraints in
other authority consistent with      obtaining information regarding BOK-Wire+. A real-time
their relevant responsibilities,     information monitoring system helps BOK to access all information
including the ability to obtain      regarding BOK-Wire+. The real-time information monitoring system
timely information and to induce     enables BOK to assess the BOK-Wire+’s various functionalities,
change or enforce corrective         performance in terms of system capabilities, payment behavior of
action.                              participants and liquidity usage in the system.

                                     Article 43 of the ROMPSS empowers the BOK governor to “impose
                                     sanctions on a participant in BOK-Wire+ or a payment system
                                     operator, such as a verbal warning, a requirement of corrective
                                     measures, a partial or overall suspension of access to BOK-Wire+,
                                     or a cancellation of relevant agreements.”




                                                                                                    181
REPUBLIC OF KOREA




                    Thus the BOK, has the powers to induce changes as well as take
                    necessary corrective measures including imposing sanctions as far
                    as the BOK-Wire+ is concerned. An instance where these powers
                    were exercised was when the KDS was served an official notice of
                    warning when the operating hours of the BOK-Wire+ had to be
                    extended on account of problems at the KSD’s end.

                    The legal basis for the oversight of BOK over FMI operators such as
                    KRX and KSD is provided under provisions of the BOK Act (article 81
                    (2), (3)) and ROMPSS (article 33 and 42).

                    While BOK may request these FMIs to take measures for the
                    improvement of their operating rules and to provide related
                    information, it has no powers to ensure that its suggestions are

                    powers to obtain information and induce changes. The KRX needs
                    to obtain approval of the FSC in case the KRX intends to establish,
                    amend or repeal their articles of incorporation, membership rules,
                    business rules and other regulations on business. In addition, the

                                 The FSS has three teams responsible for supervision and
                                 examination of the KRX, i.e. a department responsible for the

                                 load is considered too large for one staff member, especially given

                                      use of the PFMI as a tool to promote the safety and efficiency of

                                         The FSC intends to adapt the regulations under the FSCMA in
                                         accordance with the PFMI. The FSC, together with the FSS, is in the
                                         process of approving regulations for OTC derivatives trading and
                                         clearing. Regulations for exchange traded stocks, bonds and

                                         To prevent conflicts of interest arising from its simultaneous
                                         operation and oversight of BOK-Wire+, the operations and
                                         oversight units are in different departments of the BOK. While the

                                         Given the lack of power at the side of the BOK with regard to the
                                         FMIs that are regulated and supervised by the FSC (see
                                         responsibility B) and the lack of a formal cooperation agreement
                                         (see responsibility E) the BOK is not able to ensure that the PFMI

                                  and the FSC regarding the regulation, supervision and oversight of
                                  FMIs. This formal arrangement should enable the cooperation
                                  between the BOK and FSC at the appropriate technical level and
                                  should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the regulation,
                                  supervision and oversight, in particular in relation to the KRX-CCP
                                  and the KSD. Such a cooperative framework could be in the form
                                  of an MOU having a sound legal basis to ensure effective
                                  coordination between the BOK and FSC where their roles as
                                  regulators overlap. It should enable the BOK to ensure that its
                                  suggestions are implemented and to confirm the authenticity and
                                  completeness of the information submitted by the FMIs. The BOK
                                  and FSC should ‘speak with one voice’ to avoid any inefficiencies
                                  in their communication with the KRX and KSD. It should also allow
                                  the FSC to benefit from relevant information that is obtained by
                                  the BOK during international meetings or meetings with the FMI
                                  operations council.

                                  The BOK and the FSC should define arrangements regarding the
                                  frequency of their information exchange and plan joint meetings
                                  with the FSS, the KRX and the KSD. They should also develop a
                                  crisis management plan and test such a plan to enable timely and
                                  effective cooperation in times of crisis that may affect the safety
                                  and efficiency of the FMIs. Any assessments should be shared.
                                  Before finalizing an assessment the authorities should consult
                                  each other and take comments into account.

THE BANK OF KOREA’S RESPONSE TO THE
ASSESSMENT
While the Bank of Korea (BOK) is in agreement with the IMF FSAP Mission Team’s overall
assessment results in general, the bank wishes to maintain our own views on several items as
follows:

Principle 5 (Collateral)




192
                                                                                  REPUBLIC OF KOREA




The recommendation to increase the frequency of the haircut methodology review seems to
be excessive considering the relevant Key Consideration of the PFMI, which states “An FMI’s
haircut procedures should be independently validated at least annually.”

Principle 19 (Tiered participation arrangements)

The BOK does not consider additional information on indirect participation activities
necessary at this time. This is because the bank believes that the risk stemming from indirect
participation is very low in the BOK-Wire+ system as only a limited number of small and medium-
sized broker/dealers with low settlement volumes are allowed to settle indirectly through direct
participants.

Principle 23 (Disclosure of rules, key procedures, and market data)

The rating of “partly observed” has been assigned with prioritized recommendations for
Principle 23 due to “insufficient disclosure on FMIs in English language.” All of the important
documents available in Korean language, however, have also been available through the English-
language website of the bank in English language even prior to the assessment exercise (please
refer to the links below).

Settlement Systems, Statistics and Publications, New BOK-Wire Development Project, Financial

Responsibilities C (Disclosure of policies with respect to FMIs)

As similar to the assessment of Principle 23 above, the assessment of Responsibility C does
not seem to be fully reflecting the BOK practice of English documents disclosure. Details of
the BOK’s oversight policies and procedures are provided in English to the public through in the
forms of regulations and annual report on payment and settlement systems.

The Financial Services Commission’s Response to the Assessment

The FSC regulates and supervises FMIs in accordance with PFMIs. FMIs such as KRX and KSD
are regulated and supervised by the FSC in accordance with the FISCMA and its subordinate laws
and regulations which have been adapted to reflect PFMIs. The FSC delegates examination duties to




                                                                                               193
REPUBLIC OF KOREA




the FSS which examines the KRX and KSD on their compliance with the PFMIs. The FISCMA
stipulates the legal basis of the duties, corporate governance and etc. of the KRX and KSD. The KRX
is the clearing and settlement institution for securities and derivatives which operates in accordance
with the FISCMA as approved by the FSC.

     The KSD is the settlement institution for securities which conducts deposit and settlement
      business in accordance with Regulation on Settlement Business approved by the FSC.

     The FISCMA provides for governance of the KRX and KSD including qualifications of senior
      executives and board of directors.

     The KRX accumulates and deposits Joint Compensation Fund and margins, makes repayment
      for defaulted members and determines repayment order to ensure stability and integrity of
      transactions.

     The KSD is the central depository institution that conducts business in accordance with the
      Regulation on Depository Business to minimize risks related to deposits and transfers of
      securities.

     The FSC regulates, supervises and is reported by the KRX and KSD on their operations.

     The FSC and the BOK closely cooperate with each other based on the legal and institutional
      framework.

     The Senior Deputy Governor of the BOK is a member of the commissioners of the FSC pursuant
      to article 4 of the Establishment Act whereas the vice-chairman of the FSC may be present and
      speak at the Monetary Board in accordance with article 91 of the BOK Act. These enable both
      institutions to participate in important decision making processes undertaken by each
      institution.

     The FSC, FSS, MOSF and BOK hold Macroeconomic Financial Meeting both on a regular (at least
      once every quarter) and irregular basis to analyze and review macroeconomic soundness
      through information sharing and close cooperation based on the provisions of the Regulation
      on the Establishment and Operation of Macroeconomic Financial Meeting (Presidential
      Directive).

In addition, the FSC and the BOK closely cooperate with each other at working level based on the
MOU.




194
                                                                                     REPUBLIC OF KOREA




The KRX and KSD are providing information requested by the BOK in accordance with the BOK Act,
FISCMA and FSC-BOK MOU.

The FSC and BOK are closely working together to meet the international standards and
Enhance stability of the clearing, payment and settlement system through the arrangement of

Advancement Committee for the Financial Market Infrastructure.

   The FSC and BOK established Advancement Committee for Financial Market Infrastructure for
    the purpose of sharing expertise and information on payment and settlement.

   During the Committee held in March 2013, both organizations shared and reviewed self
    assessment reports produced by the FMIs including the BOK, exchange and KSD.
Although the two organizations closely cooperate, it is clearly stipulated in the FISCMA that the FSC
has the authority to supervise the KRX and KSD. Therefore, there is hardly any overlap in the
supervision authority on both FMIs.

   The FSC supervises and may impose sanctions on the overall work of the KRX and KSD including
    the payment and settlement system in accordance with the articles 306–307 and 410–411 of the
    FISCMA.

   The BOK conducts oversight and may request the operating institution or its supervisory agency
    to improve the operating standards in accordance with the article 81 of the BOK Act.

Finally, the FSC and FSS both disclose relevant laws, regulations, systems, policies and detailed
materials on their web-sites (FSC: www.fsc.go.kr, FSS: www.fss.or.kr).
