 D. Disbursement Profile




At the beginning of the project, disbursements were adversely affected by delays in tendering.
Since this was the first time that a competitive output-based aid (OBA) tendering had been
undertaken in the water sector in Sub-Saharan Africa, actors had no precedents on which to
base their decisions.

1. PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN

1.1        Context at Appraisal

In 2002, just 56 percent of Uganda’s population had access to a safe and reliable water
source.3 Access was especially limited in small towns and rural growth centers (RGCs).
By the time of this project’s appraisal (August 2006), Uganda’s government already had
been implementing reforms in the sector to improve access to safe water. The output-
based aid (OBA) pilot involving private sector participation was welcomed as part of the
reform agenda, with the caveat that participants adhere to the tariff caps set by the
government in June 2006.

The government aimed to provide access to improved drinking water to 70 percent of all
urban residents by 2005, reaching 100 percent by 2015; and to provide access to 77
percent of rural residents by 2015. An estimated US$410 million investment was
required to meet this goal. Government-imposed budget ceilings pertaining to macro-

                                                             9
economic targets limited annual allocations to the water sector, and constrained the
conditions under which the goal was to be achieved.

By 2008, improved water coverage extended to about 46 percent of the population in
160 small towns, with systems functioning an average of 89 percent of the time. Private
water operators began supplying water in small towns in 2001, enhancing the
management of water supply schemes. A significant number of private operators had
efficient operations with unaccounted for water levels averaging 22 percent and
collection efficiencies of 86 percent.

A study of 10 years of public-private partnership (PPP) in Uganda’s small towns shows
that the number of towns under the private sector participation (PSP_ model rose
steadily from only 15 in 2001–02 to over 90 by 2010–11, covering a population of over
1.5 million. The PSP approach achieved the following results:

•   Water Connections expanded from 4,883 in 2002 to over 13,000 in 2010–11.

•   Tariff collection rose from almost zero to approximately US$2 million (U Sh 5 billion),
    collected across the 88 towns reporting in 2010-11.

•   Collection efficiency rose by more than 15 percent on average within three years of
    the introduction of private operators.

•   Private Operators (POs) successfully collected nearly 90 percent of issued bills in
    2010-11, as the metering ratio – the key element of a rational payment based
    system – rose to over 90 percent.

Despite these gains, Ugandans still spent much time collecting water from unprotected
springs and streams, which resulted in disease and even death. There was a desire to
develop a more sophisticated PPP arrangement. An output-based aid (OBA) pilot
project was conceived to leverage private sector finance and expertise in system
design, construction, and operation within the existing institutional framework.

In November 2005, the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) approached the
Bank’s Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) for help in designing and
funding a pilot OBA project in small towns and rural growth centers to provide affordable
safe water to lower income customers.

The project was expected to deliver 2,000 connections (yard taps and public kiosks) to
almost 45,000 people. The cost was covered by a US$3.2 million grant from GPOBA,
co-financing of about 20 percent from user contributions, and, in some towns, a small
number of conditional grants made by the central government to local water authorities.
The small towns included Wakiso, Wobulenzi, Luwero, Kalisizo, Rukungiri, Kachumbala
and Busembatia. RGCs included Sipi, Magale, Masafu, and Namutumba.

1.2      Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

The key project development objectives were to increase piped-water access for
Ugandans living in selected small towns and RGCs in a sustainable manner
through increased participation of local private operators. Indicators of these
objectives included:

•     Local populations would spend less time collecting water at distant water points, and
      therefore potentially spending more resources on other productive activities,
      including attending school. Traditionally, most water carriers are women and young
      girls;

•     There was expected to be a reduction of disease and death related to waterborne
      illness.

•     Localized and cost-effective solutions for system design, including greater
      coordination between system design, maintenance and operation, would be
      implemented.

•     Existing water supply systems would demonstrate improved financial viability,
      including availability of alternative sources of finance for the sector.

•     The use of funds in the water sector would be transparent.

Key Performance Indicators

The overall development objective was to be measured by the number of increased
working connections (the number of yard taps and public water points (PWP)) of a
specified quality in the respective small towns and RGCs.

Success of the competitive tendering process was to be measured by the resulting
lowest subsidy (for the small towns) or tariffs (for the RGCs) required to deliver
outputs and manage systems.

         Indicators, and Justification

The PDO and key performance indicators were not revised during project
implementation.

1.4      Project Design


The OBA pilot for small towns’ and RGCs’ water supply set the following goals:
• PPPs would design, build and operate (DBO) contracts for RGCs based largely on
   the existing institutional framework.

•     Operators’ contracts would include tariffs with simple escalation clauses intended to
      cover at least 10 percent of expected investment costs in RGCs and up to 30
      percent in some small towns.

•     In small towns, where private operators were extending existing systems, operators
      were compensated for investments after targeted connections had been made and
      independently verified. Ten percent of the payment was withheld until bills paid
      demonstrated a six-month period of water delivery. In RGCs, operators received
      compensation in phases for intermediate outputs, with 45 percent withheld until after
      verification of connections and demonstration of six months of water delivery.

•     The private operators were contracted through a competitive process and had to
      pre-finance delivery of outputs. Private operators bore the performance risks. Private
      operators were expected to direct, maintain and manage the water supply systems
      and ensure a safe and reliable supply to all connections.

•     Funding that exceeded the off government budget was channeled through a private
      fiduciary agent, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which had been selected through a
      competitive bidding process. PwC was to disburse funds to the operators based on
      verified and certified outputs, and report to GPOBA. The Ministry of Finance,
      Planning and Economic Development approved this arrangement in a letter dated
      August 10, 2006.

•     The MWE and the Directorate of Water Development (DWD) were jointly responsible
      for the performance of water authorities and procurement and monitoring during the
      project’s implementation. PwC signed an agreement delegating implementation to
      MWE/DWD.

•     An independent verification and monitoring agent/local consultant checked the
      quality and quantity of outputs and reports to the MWE and PwC.

•     Subsidies were to be one-off investment subsidies, and tariffs covered operation and
      maintenance (O&M) costs plus a margin.4 Contracts were set at five years for small
      towns, and seven to 10 years for RGCs.

4The resulting tariff will also demonstrate required cost recovery levels in small towns and RGCs to the new Minister of Water,
who has expressed openness to tariff reform.


                                                              12
•     Private operators were expected to extend networks and provide a specific number
      of connections (yard taps and public water points) in small towns. Operators were to
      expand the production and/or storage capacity where required. All connections were
      to be metered.

•     In RGCs, private operators were expected to construct an entire water supply
      system, including drilling/searching for appropriate water sources, production,
      storage, conveyance, and final connections. All connections were to be metered.

evaluation and contract implementation support; (iii) Consulting services for monitoring and
verification of outputs; and (iv) Auditing services

The grant agreements split the project in two parts, explained below:

Part A: Pilot Subproject in Small Towns and Rural Growth Centers

      Part A consisted of improving water connectivity in six small towns and four rural
growth centers, resulting in the following outputs:

      In small towns, water connectivity was to be achieved via: (i) connection of functional
new yard taps; (ii) establishment of new public water points; and (iii) functionality of
connections and stand posts after a period of 12 months, later revised to six months.

       In rural growth centers, water connectivity would be achieved through: (i)
establishment of raw intake; (ii) installation of pump house and water supply facilities; (iii)
completion of distribution networks; (iv) installation of storage capacity; (v) connection of



                                              13
functional new yard taps; (vi) establishment of new public water points; and (vii) functionality
of connections and stand pots after a period of six months.

Part B: Project Advisory, Monitoring and Audit Services

      Part B involved strengthening the capacity for project management, including
      supporting the DWD in procurement, monitoring and evaluation function, through the
      provision of technical advisory services, and providing auditing services to the
      recipient.

1.7      Revised Components

The components were not changed during the implementation of the project


1.8      Other Significant Changes

Originally, 10 subprojects (six small towns and four RGCs) were targeted for
implementation. One small town, Busembatia, was added to the pilot as a result of the
savings made from the efficiency gains from the competitive tendering process.


2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME

2.1      Project Preparation

Project preparation and Design: The project gestation period took 15 months from
submission of the request to the signing of the grant agreement. Milestones are listed
below:
• The request was submitted by MWE/DWD to GPOBA in November 2005.
• The Project Information Document (PID) was prepared on June 15, 2006.
• The project appraisal was conducted in August 2006.
• The Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development wrote to the World
   Bank (referred to as “the Bank” hereafter) endorsing the private sector as the
   fiduciary agent on August 12, 2006.
• MWE announced PricewaterhouseCoopers as the fiduciary agent on January 16,
   2007.
• The grant agreement was signed between the Bank (GPOBA) and Price Water
   House Coopers Limited on February 12, 2007.

Project preparation involved selecting towns and RGCs for implementation and
determining the subsidy level for each. A total of 19 small towns and RGCs were
identified by the MWE and submitted to GPOBA for consideration. GPOBA engaged a
consultant, COWI A/S to assess the viability of the 19 towns and RCGs. COWI A/S
identified eight towns and four RGCs as potential OBA candidates, however two of the

towns had running contracts and could not be included in the initial pilot. Selected
towns, RGCs and original subsidy levels are listed in table 2.1, below.

   1)   Inclusive of interest on pre-finance and investment loan during the GPOBA disbursement period
   2)   WA = local water authority; CG = Ministry of Water conditional grant; PO = private operator
   3)   Variance in per capita pop dependent on number of PWPs versus yard taps. Official Ugandan estimates 18
        people per yard tap (3 families), and 300 people per PWP.

Since the OBA approach was relatively new, the government and the GPOBA consulted
stakeholders at all levels to secure buy-in. GPOBA also engaged the services of
transaction advisor to assess the viability of towns and RGCs, scope the works and
determine the subsidy levels, as Uganda’s government lacked the internal capacity to
design OBA projects.

Lessons Learned at Project Preparation

Data: Initial bidding had to be repeated due to a dearth of good quality data to make
realistic projections of revenues and subsidy requirements. For example, unreliable data
regarding water resources resulted in unnecessary subsidy allocations to the small
towns of Luwero, Wobulenzi and Kalisizo, and a shortfall in the targeted number of
connections in Rukungiri.

To guide future planning, the sector needs to invest in systematic and continuous
capturing of quality performance data. A water asset management policy should be
developed to guide data collection and sharing.

Communication: An effective communication strategy is crucial at all stages of the
project cycle, and particularly important at project inception. OBA concepts need to be

                                                     15
effectively communicated to stakeholders to allay concerns and improve understanding
of the OBA mechanisms. Since OBA involves off-government budget financing, it was
not featured in major sector discussions or reviews. It was therefore unsurprising that
even after successful implementation of the OBA pilot, skepticism and misconceptions
about OBA remained. Future OBA projects should have a well-resourced
communication strategy.

Tariff: The tariff regime is crucial in the planning OBA schemes since it forms the basis
for determining subsidy levels. Since Uganda’s government had implemented a policy
capping the tariff, the projected tariff had to be embedded in the DBO contracts with
escalation clauses to assure the operators that they would recover their investments.

Risks: The project appraisal document highlighted a number of risks to the project,
which are listed in table 2.2. Most risks did not occur and therefore had no impact on the
project outcome.

Challenges affecting project implementation included the following:

(i) Unanticipated and significant delays: The original timelines were ambitious and did
    not consider the difficulty in undertaking a PPP in the water sector in Sub-Saharan
    Africa involving small, local providers. OBA involved different bidding parameters
    than normal, and the tendering process had to be repeated due to late or no bid
    submissions for some lots, and some bids exceeding the maximum allowed ceiling.

       More time and resources than anticipated for small local providers. Shifting from
       input- to output-based approaches required further capacity development for public
       contracting authorities and the private operators than anticipated.

(ii)    Limited access to finance. Private operators needed affordable access to credit to
        “pre-finance” investments before output-based disbursements were made.
        Financing water projects was new to most financial institutions, which were
        reluctant lend money to operators. The banks wanted MWE to guarantee the loans
        to operators, and that was not possible.

        The International Financial Corporation (IFC) and Acumen Fund tried to address
        financing needs by introducing measures, such as including phasing outputs to
        reduce the pre-finance capital required and providing capacity building for private

                                             17
      operators and local banks. But most operators preferred to avoid high interest
      rates and collateral security, and relied on their own savings and suppliers’ credit
      instead of bank loans. DFCU Bank came on board later and provided a loan to
      Trandint for Busembatia water supply at a 17 percent interest rate.

(iii) Higher advisory and financial intermediary costs (12 percent of the total subsidy
      amount) than traditional projects (four percent to eight percent). Clustering of
      towns might have lowered some transaction costs and lead to additional
      economies of scale.

(iv) Availability of adequate water resource. The unreliability of water resources was a
     particular hindrance to project implementation in Rukungiri town. In Kacumbala,
     the quality of water deteriorated during rainy seasons.

(v)   Unclear authority over land acquisition. Under the project agreement, local water
      authorities were responsible for provision of land. However, some water
      authorities, such as in Sipi, did not have resources to pay for land. Consequently,
      the operator paid for the land, and this payment was not part of the operator’s bid.
      Namutumba also had land issues that delayed project completion. In future OBA
      contracts, land acquisition should be a responsibility of the contractors. This is
      however, contrary to the Water Policy (1996) which vested the responsibility in the
      community to secure the land and meet any compensation to the affected
      landowners.

(vi) Political interference in the location of connections, land acquisition and setting the
     tariff. It took more than a year for Wobulenzi town council to agree on the location
     of the new connections. Land disputes in Sipi and Namutumba were partly fueled
     by politicians. The politicians in Sipi and Magale refused revision of the tariff to
     cover the costs of operation.

(vii) Local fiscal issues. Some towns, such as Kacumbala, had unsettled debt for
      electricity bills. This information was not shared with the operators at the time of
      bidding. The operators had to pay the debts because the water authorities could
      not do so.

(viii) Approval delays. The National Environmental Management Authority’s (NEMA)
       approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment was delayed. The Wildlife
       Authority’s grant for a water abstraction permit in Sipi was delayed.


 Lessons Learned from Implementation

 •    The highly competitive bidding process resulted in efficiency gains but left
      operators with little room to fund unexpected or emergency operational costs. For
      example, pumps in Rukungiri and Wobulenzi broke down and operators had to
      replace them. The replacement cost was not included in their bids. The Ministry of
      Water and Environment needs to explore ways of mitigating such risks in future.

                                            18
    •    Given increasing constraints to available water resources, the risks related to
         availability should be reassessed and shared among providers, authorities and
         users.

    •    Any expansion of the OBA must consider stakeholders’ capacity to monitor and
         regulate private operators throughout the life of their contracts.


2.3        Project Outcome

The immediate project outcome was increased access to clean and safe water supply.
Over 54,000 people were estimated to have access to clean and safe water, compared
to the original target of 45,000. The number of persons served by town/RGC is shown in
table 2.4, below.

Factors that hindered the project’s implementation included:

•       Availability of alternative water sources, including springs (protected or unprotected),
        boreholes and wells or ponds. In the rainy seasons, operators reported a reduction
        in water sales since residents had access to alternative sources. It was
        recommended that improved water sources (boreholes and protected springs) within
        the towns/RGCs be operated and managed by the operator of the scheme.

•       Disconnection for non-payment of water bills. Several reasons explain non-payment
        of water bills:



                                                 19
           -   Poverty was cited as a major factor in RGCs where the majority of people
               depended on agriculture and petty trades. Incomes were seasonal during
               harvest periods.
           -   Men reportedly gave a higher priority to expenditure on alcohol than water in
               some places.
           -   Some government institutions, such as the local police, took a long time to
               pay because of the bureaucracy involved in processing payments at the
               headquarters in Kampala.

The table below shows the functional/active connections by town/ RGC. The percentage
of functional/active connections ranged from 66 percent in Sipi to 95 percent in Luwero.

•       Unreliable water supplies in Rukungiri and Kalisizo. In Rukungiri, households
        received water once in a week. In Kalisizo, the water source was too small to serve
        one section of town. In Busembatia, one community was not regularly receiving
        water due to low pressure.

•       Mismanagement of PWP. Some PWP attendants embezzled revenues and others
        remitted less money than expected. As a result, many PWP were disconnected,
        leaving some households without access to safe water.

        The mismanagement of PWP was not unique to OBA project; DWD and the National
        Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) have experienced similar problems with
        PWPs in the past. NWSC is planning to replace PWP in Kampala with pre-paid
        meters.

The DWD was responsible for the overall monitoring and verification of output deliveries
and for compliance with contractual covenants in the operate-and-manage (O&M)
contracts between the local water authority and the operator.

An independent monitoring and verification engineer oversaw the monitoring and
verification of project outputs. This consultant was mainly responsible for approval of
design and issue of design certificate to the private operators; verification of completion
and functionality of the water distribution system; issuance of the output verification
report (OVR) and reporting on the project's monitoring and verification indicators. The
OVR was certified by the DWD before issuing output verification certificates (OVC) to
the contractors. Operators prepared the disbursement requests after works had been
certified. PricewaterhouseCoopers Limited also conducted due diligence, including
physical inspection of the works done by the operators.

The World Bank carried out quarterly supervision missions to monitor the performance
of the project. The missions involved meeting with project staff, government officials and
field visits to the project sites.

Semiannual reports were prepared by PwC and submitted to the World Bank. The
reports provided the physical and financial progress of the project including challenges
encountered. Indicators used to monitor the performance are shown in table 2.6.

2.5   Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

(i)   Environmental and Social Safeguards

The project’s effect on the environment was classified under category “B”. DWD was
responsible for ensuring that operators comply with environmental and social
safeguards.

NEMA executed and approved environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for greenfield
subprojects. Public disclosures and consultations were carried out during EIAs.

In the case of Sipi, where the intake works were located in a forest reserve, an
abstraction permit (permit to extract and use ground water) was obtained from the
Uganda Wildlife Authority before works could commence.

Resettlement Action Plans were implemented and affected persons were compensated.


2.6   Post-Completion Operation/Next Phase

The pilot project was intended to inform future planning for water supply in small towns
and RGCs. The project was still ongoing because most of the contracts were still
running. DWD will continue to monitor the performance of these contracts. The Water
Regulation Unit in DWD reviews operators’ business plans and receives periodic reports
that are used as the basis for monitoring.

Plans are underway to handover some of the water supply contracts of the OBA towns
to NWSC. At the time of this writing, water supplies in towns Wakiso, Kalisizo and
Rukungiri are due to be handed over to NWSC at the end of the OBA contracts.

The Ugandan government has no immediate plan to expand the OBA project, partly due
to the challenge of ensuring prompt payments given the government’s mainstream
financial cash flows. For example, the government could take over six months to pay
contractors and consultants in the event of a budget cut. The government has asked the
World Bank to consider funding the second phase of the project. Other development
partners have yet to decide whether to adopt an OBA approach.

The government’s next step should be to share the achievements and lessons learned
from the pilot project with all relevant stakeholders, including The Ministry of Finance,
Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED ) and development partners.




                                           25
Replication of the Project

As authorities consider the next phase of the project, local actors are successfully
implementing the OBA approach. For example, the Mpigi Water Authority and the
private operator (Trandint) adopted an OBA approach, with MWE/DWD providing
materials for the expansion of the water supply, and the private operator agreeing to
pre-finance the cost of labor and recover from the tariff.

Such initiatives should be considered in other towns as well as in urban areas.

OBA should be one of the approaches for implementing urban water supply-based
performance-based subsidies and leveraging Uganda’s local private sector expertise
and financial resources. Part of the conditional grant earmarked for small towns
investments could be implemented in an OBA manner through the design, build, and
operate approach.

The lessons and experiences of the OBA in the health, water, and information,
communications and technology (ICT) sectors should be shared with all relevant
stakeholders to inform future OBA projects.

3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1   Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

The PDO was to increase piped-water access for Ugandans living in selected small
towns and RGCs in a sustainable manner through increased participation of local
private operators. The PDO met Ugandan government objectives in the following ways:

(i) The Government’s goal was to provide 70 percent of all urban residents access to
    safe drinking water by 2005, with 100 percent access by 2015; it aimed to provide
    access to 77 percent of rural areas by 2015. The PDO contributed to Uganda’s
    attainment of both these goals and the United Nations’ Millennium Development
    Goals (MDGs).

(ii) The Government introduced local private operators in 2001 in the management of
     small town water supply. Increasing participation of local private operators was
     consistent with the Government Water Policy (1999).

(iii) The PDO was also consistent with the Bank’s Joint Assistance Strategy (JAS) for
      Uganda (2005 – 2009). Pillar 5 of JAS had the objective of improved access to safe
      water supply and sanitation. It is also in line with the Uganda Country Assistance
      Strategy (CAS) FY11-15 Strategic Objective 2 to enhance public infrastructure and
      to increase access to and quality of water and sanitation services.

The implementation challenges related to land acquisition and pre-financing were
overcome through the combined effort of the operators, the MWE and the Bank and did
not affect the achievement of project outcomes other than to delay them.

Intermediary Output Indicators (IOI): the number of increased working connections
and number of people provided with access to improved water supply targets were
surpassed by 21 percent.


3.2   Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The PDO to increase piped-water access for Ugandans living in selected small towns
and RGCs in a sustainable manner through increased participation of local private
operators were achieved: the plan aimed to provide 45,000 persons with access to safe
water, and it surpassed this number by 9,000. Table 3.1 shows the achievement by
town/ RGC against planned targets at appraisal. Since Busembatia was added to the
pilot after initial appraisal, it did not have original targets.

Specific PDO achievements included:

Time savings: The installation of yard connections and PWPs reduced time spent
collecting water at distant water points. Traditionally, children are woken to collect water
for the household before going to school. Many children would arrive late to school and
others missed entire days. Yard taps solved this problem. Women in the towns and
RGCs reported that yard taps also reduced the burden of carrying water from distant
places. In Sipi, women were especially grateful that the project saved them from
climbing mountains to search for water. They reported using the time saved to improve
the hygiene of their homes and for agriculture production.

Reduction in waterborne diseases: Households reported a reduction in the incidence
of diarrheal diseases compared to the situation before the water supply. Households
also did not have to spend as much money and resources on treating diarrheal related
ailments.

Financial viability: Other than in Kacumbala, the project proved financially viable in all
small towns. Three of the seven towns did not need subsidies. Kacumbala reportedly
lacked sufficient connections, reliable water quality (with water quality deteriorating in
rainy seasons), and had access to alternative water sources. Among the RGCs, the
project was not viable in Sipi due to few connections, low tariffs and high overhead
costs. Schemes in the remaining RGCs were breaking even at the time of reporting.

Transparency: Systemic corruption was minimized through separation of verification
and certification works from the payment agency. The overseeing engineer did not have

                                                28
discretionally powers to pay for the water connections, as was the case with
conventional contracts.


3.3      Efficiency

Efficiency gains: The competitive bidding process (based on lowest subsidy required)
resulted in a 20 percent efficiency gain. Three towns did not need a subsidy and the
investment cost was recovered from the tariff revenue.

Investment cost: The subsidy per person gaining access was US$0 to US$36 (for
extension projects) and US$83 to US$108 (for greenfield projects), compared with
US$30 to US$138 and US$37 to US$250 in traditional input-based projects respectively
(COWI 2009). Table 3.2 below shows the investment cost efficiency at appraisal and
completion.

Processing contracts and payment requests from operators improved. The time to
processing payment requests averaged two weeks, compared to more than 30 days
under the conventional system.



                                                   29
Revenue collection became more efficient as operators gave staff targets to meet in
order to recover the investment and meet monthly loan obligations. Average collection
efficiency was 90 percent.

Non-revenue water reduced under most schemes from about 22 percent to 15 percent.

Savings of US$792,998, representing 24.7 percent of the grant total, were obtained by
surpassing output targets by 21 percent.


3.4    Overall Outcome

The project was satisfactory based on the level of achievement of the PDO and the
relevance of the project.


4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT


The risk of not achieving the development outcome was diminished as targets were
surpassed. Operators have continued to connect additional people albeit at higher cost.
For example, Namutumba added 89 new connections after the project’s completion.
Similarly, Masafu added 62, Magale, 43, and Sipi, 9 new connections, respectively.

5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE


5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Bank performance in ensuring Quality at Entry

It took less than eight months from preparing the Project Information Document (PID) in
June 2006 to signing the grant agreement in February 2007. However, project
completion required 28 months beyond initial estimates.

(b) Quality of supervision

The Bank’s team carried out five missions and two reviews during the life of the project.
The team provided timely no-objection requests on procurements and payments. The
government team and fiduciary agent were satisfied with the Bank’s oversight.

(c) Overall performance

The Bank team provided the necessary technical guidance and ensured active
participation of all stakeholders. The project team worked closely with Uganda’s
government in resolving issues that arose during the implementation of the project. The
Bank team was amenable to proposals from stakeholders, as shown by the revision of
the Operational Manual and restructuring papers.


5.2     Borrower Performance


      (a) Government performance

The government (MWE/DWD) performed all the roles outlined in the MoU with GPOBA
and the grant agreement, including procurement of operators for 11 towns and RGCs;
engaging a verification and monitoring engineer; certifying works; signing performance
agreements with all water authorities; ensuring compliance with environment and social
safeguards during project implementation; and monitoring performance indicators and
reporting. The government collaborated with water authorities and operators to resolve
land disputes and other implementation issues that arose.

Stakeholders held a workshop on the completion report, and results from the workshop
are described in Annex 5.

      (b) Other implementing agencies

The Fiduciary Agent fulfilled its obligations as outlined in the Grant Agreement including;
delegation of implementation function to DWD, submission of withdrawal applications to

                                            31
the Bank; disbursements of funds operators based on certified outputs and other
service providers, submission of reports to the World Bank; financial management, and
preparation financial statements.

Water authorities signed agreements with operators, participated in the procurement
and agreed on the tariff, provided land, and monitored the operators.

        (c) Overall performance

(i)        The borrower fulfilled all obligations in the MoU and Grant Agreement;
(ii)       The borrower resolved most of the issues which during implementation and
           achieved the targets;
(iii)      The borrower achieved the PDO and surpassed the target by 21 percent, and
           achieved 25 percent saving on the grant.
(iv)       There was no evidence from mission supervision reports indicating the
           borrower’s performance was unsatisfactory.


6. LESSONS LEARNED

Application of OBA Concepts

Risk: OBA aims at transferring the performance risk to the service provider. However,
in this case the performance risks transferred to the operators were inadequately
defined. As a result, private operators took over unanticipated performance risks as
demonstrated by inadequate ground water resources in Rukungiri, difficulty with land
acquisition in Sipi, and poor estimation of demand in Magale and Masafu. Future OBA
projects should analyze all the performance risks and allocate them to the right party or
share some of them.


Pre-financing: Private operators were supposed to pre-finance the delivery of outputs
and be reimbursed by the project. It was not easy for the private operators to secure
loans because most financial institutions had little experience financing water projects.
The IFC and Acumen Guarantee Fund tried to market the venture, but banks remained
reluctant to lend money to private operators. Meanwhile, operators themselves were
reluctant to borrow at interest rates ranging from 17 percent to 27 percent, and at
collateral values ranging from 105 percent to 120 percent of the value of the loan. MWE
and PwC issued letters of comfort to the banks but this did not sway them. As a result,
operators had to resort to their savings and obtain materials on credit. It was suggested
that financial institutions used to channel OBA funds should be compelled to provide
loans to operators at favorable terms. More advocacy and education about the water
industry is also necessary.

Independent verification: The role of an independent consultant to verify and monitor
the project was extolled by private operators as it reduced systemic corruption
tendencies experienced in conventional approaches. The verification/certification of

                                           32
works was delinked from the payment system, as the verification consultant lacked
discretionary powers to certify works and pay, as was the case in conventional
contracts.

However, independent verification does not guarantee the quality of the works as the
consultant checks the final out (yard tap or PWP). It was difficult to verify the quality of
buried materials and parts. Water supply schemes are designed for 20 years and the
effects of poor quality materials may not manifest in the first five to 10 years, when the
operator is still running the scheme. A proper technical audit is needed to guarantee
quality.

Efficiency: OBA provided incentives for the private operators to be efficient in order to
recoup the returns on their investment. As a result they set performance targets for their
employees, which improved billing and revenue collection efficiency. Non-revenue water
totaled less than 20 percent for most towns, and collection efficiency surpassed 90
percent.

Sustainability: The subsidy was one-off, and the systems were supposed to sustain
themselves based on the tariff revenue. A flexible tariff policy (based on the market
forces) is necessary for the long-term sustainability of these schemes. In addition, the
revenue sharing ratios embedded in the management contracts (95 percent for the
operator and five percent for the Water Board expenses) need to be reviewed because
they do not allow for any savings for major repairs. Future contracts need to consider
longer term financing of major repairs from the revenues generated.

Most RGCs will not break-even in the short term partly because of the small number of
connections and high operational costs. Tariff revenues cannot be relied upon to sustain
these schemes. The subsidy for RGCs had catered for shortfall in tariff revenue.
Government has to plan for O&M grants for these schemes once the OBA contracts
expire.

For the OBA approach to be mainstreamed in the sector, government payment systems
must improve: contractors/operators must trust that they will be timely compensated for
their investments.

Conclusion

The OBA pilot project demonstrates advantages in financing infrastructure services.
Contrary to the view that the private sector has little appetite for taking risk in the water
sector, the pilot has shown that relatively small private companies are willing to take on
pre-finance and performance risk, and have strong incentives to roll out improved
services quickly. By shifting performance risk to the service providers, the project
increased accountability for results and efficiency.

Given the successes and lessons learned, the water sector is in a strong position to
lobby government and development partners to adopt OBA as a method of choice for
financing the expansion and management of small towns’ water supply.

centers.

        APPENDIX C: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

     No detailed cost benefit analysis was taken at project appraisal to determine the net
     present value (NPV) and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project. The
     focus of this section therefore is to analyze the economic and financial viability of the
     towns/RGCs after the expiry of project support.

     The analysis covered the production and sale of water, tariff levels, billing and revenue
     collection and cost of operations for small towns and RGCs as shown below.

     Water production and sales: In small towns, annual production ranged from a low of
     2,395 m3 in Kacumbala to a high of 114,528 m3 in Luwero. Production in the remaining
     towns ranged from 41,725m3 to 69,117m3. In RGCs, the annual rate of water production
     ranged from 12,581 m3 in Sipi to 39,775 m3 in Namutumba.

     The billing efficiency for small towns ranged from 78 percent in Busembatia to 100
     percent in Rukungiri. For RGCs, the billing efficiency ranged from 40 percent in Sipi to
     95 percent in Magale. Details are shown in table C.1 below. It is apparent from table C.1
     that Kacumbala small town and Sipi RGCs did not perform well in terms of the
     production and sale of safe water.

     Revenue: The tariff level in small towns ranged from U Sh 1,469 in Kalisizo to U Sh
     3,273 Kacumbala. The average was U Sh 2000. After discounting for inflation of 15
     percent, the tariff level in small towns was higher than the average level at appraisal of
                                                           39
U Sh 1,000. In RGCs, the tariff ranged from U Sh 1,124 in Magale to U Sh 2,103 in
Namutumba. Sipi and Magale were using gravity flow and therefore had no pumping
costs compared to Namutumba and Masafu. After discounting for inflation, the average
tariff level for RGCs was slightly lower than at appraisal, from U Sh 1,500 to U Sh 2,000.

The annual revenue collected in small towns ranged from U Sh 5.293 million in
Kacumbala to U Sh 135.462 million in Luwero. The average was U Sh 69.7 million. The
annual cost of operation ranged from U Sh 7.680m in Kacumbala to U Sh 74.18 m in
Luwero. The average was U Sh 48.7 million. Kacumbala was experiencing losses.
Improving collection efficiency (81 percent) and non-revenue water (17 percent) may
reduce loss.

The annual revenue for RGCs ranged from U Sh 7.6 million in Sipi to U Sh 60.8m in
Namutumba, with an average of U Sh 28.4 million. The annual operational cost for
RGCs ranged from U Sh 5.5 million in Sipi to U Sh 39.0 million in Namutumba. This
means that the RGCs can meet their operational costs. Sipi could do better if it reduced
non-revenue water from the current level of 60 percent.

Recommendation: Future OBA projects should consider combining a number of towns
and/or RGCs under a single management contract to minimize overhead costs and
facilitate cross subsidies.

APPENDIX D: BRIEF ON IFC WORK


Background
Improved access and use of safe water and sanitation facilities are among the key
priority areas for the government of Uganda. To achieve this goal, the government
decided to decentralize rural water supply delivery. Implementing this plan relied on
local governments, which depend heavily on grants from the central government –
which are financed in turn by donors. Since 2001, the government has implemented
PPPs in suburban and rural areas, and established management contracts with private
operators in over 70 small towns. These contractual arrangements were generally weak
and plagued with capacity challenges, both at the national and regional levels.


IFC’s Work
Uganda’s government leveraged IFC’s experience in public-private partnership
transactions and business development support. The IFC provided support for three
program components: transaction advice, public sector capacity, and access to finance.
IFC also tapped into the resources of its financial markets and small- and medium-
enterprise departments to address financing constraints. IFC also developed a training
program based on the proposed generic management contract to address weaknesses
in the area of contract administration among public sector stakeholders.

Additional elements were built into the program to facilitate continuity upon completion,
including a workshop curriculum that could be easily replicated.

Transaction Structure
As part of its role as lead advisor, the IFC conducted due diligence in 10 small towns,
uncovering contracts of short duration and varying performance indicators. To address
these shortcomings and ensure ease of management and administration, the IFC
proposed a generic contract with a minimum term of five years to appeal to both private
operators and lenders.

The IFC also analyzed the geography of areas in need and proposed clustering towns
within close proximity to one another. Clustering allows for contracts that capture
economies of scale, specifically on human resources and capital investments. However,
since funding was secured for only one of the 10 towns, this approach could not be
implemented and a bidding process was ultimately implemented solely for the town of
Busembatia.

Prior to the IFC’s involvement, private operators in Uganda raised financing by using
overdraft facilities provided by the banks or secured loans using other existing business.
Improving access to financing was a priority.

Post-Tender Results


                                           42
In June 2010, IFC awarded the first five-year management contract to a private operator
for the town of Busembatia. The lowest bidder, Trandint Limited, won the contract with a
bid of US$270,000. Advisory work was supported by the Austrian Development Agency.
The Global Partnership on Output Based Aid provided funding for capital investment
costs to support the private operator. Key project results are listed below.

• Residents of Busembatia are enjoying expanded access to water at the same tariffs
for the next five years.

• Four hundred new water connections were installed.

• DFCU Bank, a Ugandan commercial bank, loaned approximately US$100,000 to the
winning bidder for the Busembatia contract.

• Seventy representatives from local authorities participated in two IFC-designed
training programs for public sector stakeholders.

• USAID is using IFC’s relationship with local banks as a model for developing a risk-
sharing product for banks to lend to private operators. Unfortunately for this project,
access to finance for POs did not work out due to difficulty ensuring timely payments
under the Government of Uganda’s financial cash flow system.

Table E.1 Completion and Results Report for the OBA in Water Supply in Uganda’s Small Towns and RGCs
                                      General Recommendations
                                      • Criteria of measuring outputs ought to be more precise, for instance,
                                         targeted number of people versus served people.
                                      • A percentage of monthly revenue should be saved to cater for corrective
                                         maintenance.
                                      • The critical considerations of the OBA approaches need to be
                                         summarized in the Report.
                                      • Concrete recommendations on what needs to be done next must be
                                         developed.
No.   Questions                       Response to Question
1     Could some of the OBA successes The OBA project did not cover sanitation. However, it is possible to apply
      be translated to sanitation?    the experience and lessons learned from the OBA for water supply to
                                      sanitation, such as solid waste management. The challenge is that most of
                                      the available local operators do not have experience and/or skills in waste
                                      management.

2     To what extent was the OBA project        The technical efficiency of OBA small towns and RGCs was shown in
      evaluated in terms of technical           appendix C (table C.2) of the Completion Report. The parameters evaluated
      efficiency, i.e. inputs versus outputs?   included water produced, water sold, non-revenue water, etc.
3     Why did three of the pilot towns not      The three pilot towns which did not require subsidy included Wobulenzi,
      require subsidies and why was             Luwero and Kalisizo. These towns did not require subsidy because the bid
      Kachumbala town not financially           prices for the successful bidders could be covered by the revenue
      viable?                                   generated from the tariff within the contract period.

                                                Kacumbala was not viable because (a) it had very few customers, (b) the
                                                existence of many alternative water sources particularly during rainy
                                                season, and (c) water quality during rainy season deteriorated and the cost
                                                of treatment was high.
                                                             44
4    What was meant by a flexible tariff?       A flexible tariff refers to the tariff based on market forces. In 2006, the then
                                                Minister for Water capped the tariff at U Sh 2,500 per cubic meter.
5    What does tariff indexation mean in        Tariff indexation means providing for tariff escalation to compensate for
     the OBA environment?                       increase in costs (e.g. power, inflation etc.). OBA contracts had a tariff
                                                escalation clause to cover increases in costs of operations.
6    How did competitive bidding affect         The competition was stiff and the prices of bids returned were low. As a
     performance?                               result, the winning bidders made small profits not adequate for them to
                                                grow.
7    Were there constraints during land         There were challenges pertaining to land acquisition in Sipi (for intake
     acquisition and were beneficiaries         works), and Namutumba (for power transmission line). Sipi did not have
     sensitized. If so, which institution was   money for land compensation and the contractor had to pay his own costs.
     responsible?                               In Namutumba, the problem was caused by local politicians who wanted to
                                                frustrate the project. The communities were sensitized by MWE/DWD during
                                                the inception phase and their contribution in form of provision of land was
                                                highlighted.

8    What should the next steps be to The next steps are included in the completion report subsection 2.6 on page
     move forward?                    28. MWE/DWD should share widely with sector stakeholders including
                                      MoFPED and Development Partners the achievements and lessons learned
                                      from the OBA pilot project, agree on what needs to be improved and how to
                                      replicate the project.
9    How good was the reporting and The reporting on the OBA activities was good because there was the
     were there any aspects that affected Independent Verification/ Monitoring Consultant with the responsibility of
     the OBA approach?                      reporting on subprojects, and PwC responsible for project reporting on a
                                            semiannual basis. The operators also submitted quarterly reports to
                                            MWE/DWD on the performance of the water supply system.
                                            The factors that affected the OBA approach were discussed under Section 2
                                            of the completion report regarding project preparation, implementation and
                                            outcome levels.
10   Will the OBA report be adopted?        The Government and the World Bank will consider the final report and
                                            decide whether to adopt it or not.
11   Will local authorities solicit for new The MWE/DWD will formerly guide the Water Authorities on what to do

                                                              45
     bids after the expiration of the OBA when the OBA contracts expire. However, the government, through the
     contracts?                           MWE/DWD, plans to transfer 89 small towns to National Water and
                                          Sewerage Corporation for better management in the next five years. Three
                                          OBA small towns (Wakiso, Kalisizo and Rukungiri) are among candidate
                                          towns to be transferred to NWSC at the end of the OBA contracts.
12   How do you decide which schemes The decision for which scheme qualified for OBA was based on the
     qualify for the OBA subsidy?         feasibility study done by COWI and bid prices returned. The schemes that
                                          had projected revenues sufficient to recover the investment during the
                                          contract period did not require subsidies.

13   What went well? What did not go What went well included the following: outputs exceeded targets by 20
     well?                           percent and there was a saving on the project budget by the same
                                     percentage. What did not go well was that the operators/ contractors had
                                     trouble securing financing from financial institutions.

14   Can benefits from this business be The benefits will be summarized in a pager and shared with banks and
     documented so that banks can rely other stakeholders. This will be accompanied by informing banks and other
     on that information to give loans? financial institutions of investment opportunities in water supply.

15   How can aid be delivered more OBA provides an efficient way of delivering aid because beneficiaries pay
     efficiently, i.e. performance for for outputs, not inputs and processes. There is a high degree of
     results?                          transparency and low risk of corruption.
