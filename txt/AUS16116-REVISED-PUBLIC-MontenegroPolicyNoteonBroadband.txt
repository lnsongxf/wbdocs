Executive Summary
It is widely recognized that broadband is of fundamental importance to the social and
economic development of all nations. International case studies show that broadband
networks have a strong impact on economic growth and development. Understanding
the importance of broadband, Montenegro has set national broadband targets in the
Strategy for the Development of Information society 2012-2016. As the period of the
Strategy implementation is coming to an end, Montenegrin authorities are now in the
process of evaluation and reconsideration of broadband targets and measures to reach
them.
This report provides a brief evaluation of the Strategy implementation, as well as gives an overview of
high-speed broadband availability and adoption at the national, municipality and locality levels. To
achieve its strategic objectives Montenegro primarily relied on market forces and private investments.
The state was working towards strengthening of a competitive and enabling environment that is
important for the acceleration of broadband infrastructure investments. Despite its efforts, the country
has faced a challenge of achieving broadband objectives. Evaluation of the Strategy objectives has
revealed that broadband coverage goals were only partially achieved (as of March 2016): 79% of
population is estimated to have access to up to 10 Mbps against the target of 100% of population, and
17% of population is estimated to have access to at least 30 Mbps against the target of 50% of
population.
Furthermore, the situational analysis has revealed that the availability of high-speed broadband is not
homogeneous, i.e. varies across the country, thus creating significant differences in terms of broadband
access between urban and rural areas of the country. For example, in the central part of the country, the
broadband coverage in rural areas is slightly above 40% of population, whereas in urban areas it reaches
85% of population. In the coastal part of the country the difference in broadband coverage of rural and
urban areas accounts for 31 percentage points (58% of population covered in rural areas vs. 89% in
urban) and this is the smallest difference throughout the country. The lack of broadband infrastructure
in rural and sparsely-populated areas of Montenegro, together with socio-economic indicators, like low
population density, low potential revenues and monopolistic structure of the telecommunications
market, indicates that there might be a potential market failure in providing high-speed broadband
access, implying a greater need for the state intervention.
State aid is a common approach of addressing market failures and contributing to the achievement of
specific state objectives. Although by March 2016, Montenegro as an EU accession country has
transposed the majority of European Union (EU) State aid rules into its national legislation, the counry
does lack experience in implementing the State Aid framework. So far, the potential existence of a
market failure has not been explicitly identified in the country’s strategic documents, and therefore has
not been consistently addressed. Because the EU State aid framework is quite complex, while having
separate regulations for different economic sectors, and extensive regulations on State aid treatment
and procedures, this report provides an overview of main regulations and goes into analysis of their
practical application.



                                                                                                       8
The European Commission (EC) and Member States have rich experience in the State aid rules
application, including the implementation of State aid for broadband deployment. The Digital Agenda
for Europe sets ambitious broadband targets and requires EU Member States to implement equally
ambitious national broadband plans. At the same time the EC, as well as Member States recognize, that
public support is inevitable in order to achieve these targets and employs State aid extensively.
Montenegrin authorities, therefore, would benefit from learning about relevant country cases this
report. Croatia was selected as a neighboring country, which jointed the EU relatively recently and got
the EC clearance on its State aid measure just a few months ago. Finland was chosen as a country with
the lowest population density in the whole EU. Sweden is on the list due to important role given to local
municipalities in broadband deployment; Lithuania as being a leader in Europe in terms of the fiber-
optic penetration. Romania’s broadband market is relatively competitive (compared to other EU
countries), nevertheless the public funding still plays an important role in broadband deployment.
Finally, the report outlines the only negative EC decision on State Aid taken to date, which is related to
the case of planning of broadband network deployment in Appingedam, the Netherlands.
As a final point, the paper provides a set of observations and recommendations that may facilitate the
achievement of Montenegro’s national broadband targets, as the current performance requires certain
improvements. First, it is recommended that Montenegrin authorities perform the in-depth analysis of
broadband market dynamics and of existing regulatory framework in order to evaluate the potential of
the market forces closing of the existing infrastructure gap. In this regard, a detailed mapping exercise
followed by public consultations with market players is needed to confirm the existence of market
failure (if any) and to determine the amount of private and/or public investments required. Second, it is
recommended that an ex ante assessment of State aid benefits and potential drawbacks should be
undertaken. Third, at the stage of designing a State aid measure, Montenegrin authorities should
maintain the guiding principle of keeping State’s intervention at a minimum possible level to avoid
competition distortions. Finally, it is strongly recommended that the authorities carry out capacity
building with regards to State aid application.

  I.    Introduction
In 2016 the Ministry of Information Society and Telecommunications of Montenegro (Ministry) intends
to perform a review of the national Strategy of Development of Information Society 2012 – 2016 (SDIS),
and is planning its subsequent update. Among other strategic priorities, SDIS is guiding development of
the broadband infrastructure nationwide. At a glance, the implementation status of the SDIS goals,
related to availability of broadband, reveals lower than expected roll-out of high-speed broadband
infrastructure. The Ministry believes that under the updated strategy more proactive measures involving
state intervention (support) may be required in less attractive and (or) most difficult to reach
geographical areas, possibly through the State aid mechanisms. As the EU candidate country,
Montenegro is expected, whenever possible, to follow EU policies and regulations. Therefore, the
Ministry intends to take into account the EU state aid framework while considering its own approach for
a state intervention for broadband development.
Given the aforementioned, the Ministry has requested the World Bank (Bank) support in reviewing the
EU state aid rules, as well as reviewing specific expeciences of State Aid projects in the EU countries.
Both should provide the basis for the Ministry to think through and, if decided so, to design relevant
policy measures under the reviewed strategy that would systematically address broadband
infrastructure gaps across the national territory.
With that objective this paper provides:
         (i) Review of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector strategic
         planning, funding and implementation, with a particular focus on high-speed broadband
         infrastructure;
         (ii) Status quo of high-speed broadband availability and adoption at the national, municipality
         and locality levels; identification of under (un) covered localities;
         (iii) Overview of the EU state aid rules and their application in a particular case of broadband;
         (iv) Review of specific state aid cases adopted across the EU that could be relevant for the
         Montenegrin case; and
         (v) Observations and recommendations on the next steps that may support state efforts in
         achieving the national policy objectives related to roll-out of broadband infrastructure.
Analysis of the current state of broadband adoption and penetration presented in this report builds in
its majority on the data that were collected through the survey of Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
(Survey). The Survey was developed by the Bank team and conducted in cooperation with Electronic
Communications and Postal Services (EKIP). The survey answers were collected and analyzed in March
2016. The Survey covered broadband indicators at a settlement level; the requested data included:
broadband coverage per technology, per settlement and per connection speed; subscriptions per
technology, per settlement and per connection speeds.

    II.   Strategic planning approach, funding and measure
          foreseen towards broadband infrastructure development
Overall development of the ICT sector in Montenegro is guided by the Strategy for the Development of
Information Society 2012-2016 (SDIS) adopted by the Government. SDIS is also a core strategic
document outlining the development outlook and measures for the deployment of broadband
infrastructure under its ICT infrastructure program. Specific activities (projects) dedicated to the
implementation of the program and that are responsibility of the Ministry are being planned each year
as part of the annual Ministerial working program. Similarly, the Ministry adopts progress
implementation reports of its program for each fiscal year.1 The Ministry and sector specific regulator
EKIP are two public agencies responsible for implementation of the ICT infrastructure program under
SDIS (Box 1).
Broadband targets established under the current ICT infrastructure program of SDIS are less ambitious
than those established by the EU ICT strategy “Digital Agenda for Europe”, i.e. coverage – 30 Mbps or
more for all by 2020; and uptake – 50% of households having 100 Mbps or higher subscriptions.
However, as indicated in the Figure 1, many countries in the region have settled broadband deployment
objectives, which are more or less deviating from those of the EU. Montenegrin strategic ICT sector
planning approach is more detailed and aims to reach 2020 in two phases (strategies) – SDIS covering
the period of 2012-2016 and updated SDIS covering the period of 2017-2020 or beyond.

Box 1 Brief outline of ICT infrastructure – program 2 under SDIS
ICT infrastructure program aims to provide high-quality broadband Internet access and ICT infrastructure in
accordance with the needs of end users. In parallel, it should provide adequate, affordable and secure
international Internet connectivity which will meet all current and future requirements and throughput capacities
at the state level, serving current and future interests of all persons interested in ICT sector.
The Program establishes two goals
(i) Act in order to encourage development of the ICT sector and promote access to other business sectors and the
use of ICT services;
(ii) Improve e-Inclusion and help bridge digital gap through an open and permanent access.
And two objectives
(1) High-speed broadband access:
By 2014:         Provide 50% of the population with a minimum of 10Mbps broadband access*;
By 2016:         Reach 100% of the population with a minimum of 10Mbps broadband access; and
                 50% of the population with a minimum 30 Mbps broadband access.
(2) International connection:
Provide technologically divergent, capacitive and multiple international Internet access by 2014, which will allow
open access and affordable international connection to the symmetrical Internet for all interested service
providers.
Action Plan for SDIS implementation outlines three groups of measures:
I. National Broadband Network / Implementing agencies: Ministry and EKIP
Accelerate establishment of a broadband high-speed network and open access, in order to offer connectivity to all
citizens and enterprises in Montenegro, regardless of where they are. Necessary actions include:
(a) Commitment of service providers to symmetric guaranteed speed broadband access as defined in Objectives;
(b) Identification of opportunities for the development of broadband access infrastructure through PPP, EU
structural funds, participation of regional authorities and other special privileges (e.g. reduced taxes, cheaper
loans, subsidies) for service providers from private sector in order to develop necessary infrastructure;
(c) Supplement development by commercial wireless broadband, along with the establishment of Wi-Fi hot-
spots/mesh, networks as part of the project “Wireless Montenegro.”
II. International connection / implementing agencies: Ministry and EKIP
Ensure very fast, highly capacitive, affordable, secure and continuous international Internet connection. Prescribed
measures include:
(a) Identification of the width of connection needs, based on expected demand and identification of optimal
mechanism (e.g. use of national utility networks, expansion of existing capacities for international connectivity
services, etc.) which will provide adequate international connection.
(b) Analysis, based on cost basis, for immediate payment of international connections and take all necessary
regulatory activities in order to ensure affordable access to all service providers providing connection to the
Internet.

III. Facilitation of infrastructure sharing / implementing agency: EKIP
Collect data about the existing passive infrastructure (owned by the operator, but also local government units,
state companies etc.) which can be used to build a broadband network, which would eliminate unnecessary
duplication and thus reduce building costs.

SDIS places a particular emphasis on strengthening of the broadband connectivity as a basic
infrastructure for the development of information society and further economic growth. In line with this
prioritization, in 2013 the Ministry of Finance developed a national economic development strategy
“Montenegro Development Directions 2013-2016” (MDD)3, in which the main emphasis of the ICT sector
development was similarly placed on the expansion of broadband infrastructure.4 In terms of financing,
however, only EUR 1.79 million was dedicated to the ICT sector development from the State budget,
which is the 5th smallest dotation per thematic area (out of 18 thematic areas in total) from the national
budget, and is among four thematic areas that are supported neither form EU funds nor from the loans.5
It may be concluded therefore that the expansion of broadband connectivity in Montenegro mainly
relies on the private sector investments (Box 2).

Box 2 Measures, goals and funding allocated for ICT sector development under the MDD
ICT sector development measures and goals are featured under the Smart Growth pillar of the MDD. In total, MDD
establishes three strategic pillars of Smart growth, Sustainable growth and Inclusive growth. To the Sustainable
growth pillar 93% of the total funding allocated to strategy implementation (EUR 1164.71 million) is attributed,
including state budget, grants, loans and EU funds. To the pillar of the Smart Growth 3% of the total funding is
allocated, the smallest portion of out of three pillars (EUR 7.93 million) (Fig. a).

Smart growth pillar is, in turn, divided into six policy areas: Business environment, SMEs, Competitiveness, Science,
High education and ICT. ICT sector allocation constitutes 7% of total funding allocated to Smart Growth or EUR
1.79 million (Fig. b). Highest allocation within the Smart growth pillar is provided to science policy area (60%).

In its efforts to achieve policy objectives of better and more widespread broadband infrastructure,
during the planning period of 2012-2016, Montenegro has implemented two strategic projects aiming to
extend broadband connectivity: “Wireless Montenegro” and “Promoting Connectivity of Internet
Broadband in the Accursed Mountain Border Area”. A brief summary of both projects is presented in the
Table 1. “Wireless Montenegro” Project is currently providing free Internet access in about 40 attractive
locations in Podgorica and mainly in the coastal municipalities, e.g. airports, education institutions, town
squares, promenades, locations visited by a large number of people (tourists), etc. The Project
objectives are aligned with the strategic goal of provision of basic Internet access and they are not
aimed at supporting high-speed broadband roll-out that would ensure “symmetrical and guaranteed”
connection foreseen by SDIS. In turn, the second project is specifically addressing the lack of broadband
connectivity in Accursed Mountain area across Montenegrin-Albania border on the altitude above
2000m. The Project covered cross-border locations that are eligible for the funding under the EU’s CBC
Albania – Montenegro Program.7

It shall be noted that neither of both projects was specifically aiming to achieve SDIS objectives for high-
speed broadband nationwide. So far, a systematic approach to monitor broadband infrastructure roll-
out per SDIS goals and identify underserved areas has not been established. On its way to achieve
strategic objectives of high-speed broadband adoption and coverage foreseen under SDIS, the state
primarily relied on market forces and private investments. To this end, the state was working towards
strengthening of a competitive and enabling environment that is important for acceleration of
broadband infrastructure investments.
As part of these efforts it could be acknowledged that Montenegro has successfully operationalized
infrastructure sharing across different infrastructure sectors. Such a policy significantly decreases the
costs of broadband deployment. For instance, Electric Transmission System of Montenegro
(Crnogorskog elektroprenosnog sistema - CGES-a) owns optical fiber8 infrastructure with total length of
656 km and offers it to market players (information on availability and prices are provided in Annex 1).

    Optical Ground Wire (OPGW) is installed over its electricity transmission lines

                                                                                                              15
On the other hand, universal service obligation (USO) may also be instrumental to ensure proper supply
of broadband services. With the growing demand for broadband and plans to bring broadband to all, the
inclusion of broadband in universal service is becoming a common practice, as more and more countries
are taking steps to include broadband into the scope of national universal service obligations. These
include Finland, Malta, Spain as well as the UK with its recent announcement.9 However, as of now there
is no accumulated experience and common position regarding the application of the USO instrument for
high-speed broadband (above 10 Mbps).
In Montenegro, EKIP established a nationwide USO scheme in 2015, following a public tender
procedure. Crnogorski Telekom A.D. Podgorica was designated to offer connections and access to
publicly available telephony services, including functional internet access at a fixed location and benefits
for the disabled and the socially vulnerable. MTel d.o.o. Podgorica was designated as a provider for
directory and directory enquiry services. Functional internet access in the case of Montenegro is defined
as a connection providing a guaranteed minimum data-download speed of 384 kbit/s and data-upload
speed of at least 128 kbit/s. In its substance USO framework is aligned with the strategic goal of
provision of basic Internet access and is not designed to support high-speed broadband targets as those
are established by SDIS.
When it comes to direct public support to high-speed broadband infrastructure, in general terms the
state was not excluding the possibility of “identification of opportunities for the development of
broadband access infrastructure through PPP […], subsidies […]”10 per SDIS, but active steps towards a
more systematic and nationwide approach for state intervention, i.e. state aid measures, so have not
been take so far.
While performing the review of the results under the SDIS and planning for its update, the Ministry
seeks to design relevant policy measures that would systematically address broadband infrastructure
gaps across its national territory. At a glance, the status of the implementation of the SDIS goals reveals
lower availability and adoption of high-speed broadband than was initially planned (Figure 2 and Figure
3), and it is a position of the Ministry that new measures may require a more proactive state
intervention (support) in less attractive and (or) most difficult to reach geographical areas as purely
economic rationale is apparently leading to the exclusion of such areas.
More specifically, the evaluation of SDIS 2012-2016 objectives reveals that broadband coverage goals
were only partially achieved. In particular, as of March 2016, 79% of Montenegrin population is covered
by up to 10 Mbps high-speed broadband11, and 17% of population has access to at least 30 Mbps high-
speed broadband12 (Table 2). While evaluating high-speed broadband coverage, 4G mobile broadband

    Coverage of Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) national-wide incumbent’s (Crnogorski
Telekom) network was used as a proxy for this estimate; incumbent offers high-speed packages over this
infrastructure that provide up to 10 Mbps download speed; it shall be noted however that ADSL is not
providing symmetrical connection speeds as it is required by SDIS;
12
   Coverage of Fiber To The x (FTTx) deployed by national incumbent was used as a proxy for national
coverage for speeds at least 30 Mbps; FTTx provides both symmetrical and guaranteed connection;

                                                                                                        16
technology coverage was not taken into account because at the moment of writing of this report it was
not covering areas outside the existing high-speed broadband availability areas.13 3G broadband
connectivity coverage was not considered due to lower connectivity speeds and technical limitations to
comply with the requirements of guaranteed and symmetrical connections.
In terms of penetration (actual adoption of high-speed broadband), 50% household penetration was
achieved on the national level. In the Northern and Central regions, household penetration for high-
speed broadband is lower (20% and 40% in the Northern and Central regions respectively – see Figure
3).

Analyzing availability of high-speed broadband in more detail, it becomes evident that availability and
adoption of high-speed broadband is not homogeneous and levels of both indicators vary significantly
across the country. Despite its efforts and already undertaken initiatives, Montenegro is clearly facing a
challenge of closing the broadband gap both in terms of availability and adoption of high-speed

III.    Status quo of high-speed broadband adoption and
        availability in Montenegro
It is widely recognized that broadband is of fundamental importance to the social and economic
development of all nations. International case studies show that broadband networks have a strong
impact on economic growth and development – studies estimate that the impact of broadband on Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) varies from 0.25 to 1.5 percent for every 10 percent increase in penetration.
For instance, a World Bank study on the impact of broadband concluded that, on average, an increase of
10 percent in broadband penetration can over the long term lead to 1.21-1.38 percentage point increase
in GDP.14 Broadband contributes to a country’s economic growth in multiple ways - through increased
productivity, employment, and foreign direct investments. Some evidence shows that the higher the
penetration of broadband, the greater its contribution to economic growth.15
Furthermore, broadband offers huge opportunities to help raise the standard of living, quality of life and
business competitiveness.16 It may also significantly improve the availability, quality and delivery of
public services, especially in the sectors of education and healthcare. In addition, broadband enhances
opportunities for social networking, community organization and a more active engagement in the civic,
political and democratic life of nations.17
This Chapter will take a closer look at the Montenegrin high-speed broadband availability and adoption
at the settlement (locality) level, and then, while synthesizing the findings, will derive regional and
national trends. It focuses on three key groups of indicators: (i) socio-demographic factors (income
levels, education levels, age pyramid and population trends) that are important preconditions for
broadband adoption; (ii) demand characteristics (Internet usage and subscriber dynamics among
households and businesses) determining current broadband adoption; and (iii) supply factors (market
structure, broadband availability and pricing) affecting high-speed broadband coverage.

        3.1. Socio-demographic analysis
Three main socio-demographic factors influencing broadband adoption are income level, education
level, and distribution of population (by age and geographically). These indicators were analyzed to infer
the structural drivers of residential broadband demand gap. According to the Bank’s Broadband
Strategies Toolkit18, the obstacles to broadband adoption can be grouped into three following
categories:

                                                                                                      20
        (a)   Limited affordability (driven by income levels and number of people per household);
        (b)   Limited digital literacy (driven by education attainment levels and age distribution);
        (c)   Lack of relevance or interest (driven by education, age, and cultural factors).
Following that approach, the following socio-demographic premises for broadband adoption could be
highlighted in the particular case of Montenegro:

      Cost of basic broadband (below 10 Mbps) is currently above the affordability
       threshold of 5% of disposable income established by the International
       Telecommunications Union (ITU)19; while 10 Mbps connection accounts for
       ~10% of monthly household expenses. This is both due to high broadband prices
       and relatively low GDP per capita (the latter is 5 times lower than the EU
       average). Hence, limited affordability seems to be one of the factors limiting high-
       speed broadband adoption;
      The educational attainment profile of Montenegro is favorable for broadband
       adoption, given that 28.3% of 30-34 year olds have tertiary education (below the
       EU average of 37.9%, but above most Balkan countries); Montenegro also
       demonstrates the lowest percentage of early school leavers in the region (5.1%);
      Montenegro follows a similar age pyramid as the EU, but the 30-44 years old age
       group (with the third most widespread usage of internet) is relatively larger,
       adding to the positive dynamics in favor of broadband adoption;
      Montenegro is above the EU average in terms of inhabitants per household:
       average number of people per household of 3.2 is above the EU average of 2.3,
       and is also among the highest in the Balkan region (higher is only in Macedonia –
       3.8 and Kosovo – 5.8 people per household). On one hand, this makes
       broadband more affordable at the household level, but on the other hand it limits
       the size of potential broadband market (which could be greater in terms of
       households);
      Despite having largely urban population (only 36% live in rural areas),
       Montenegro faces rather low population density (46.2 people per sq. km,
       compared to the EU average of 120 people per sq. km). 42% of Montenegro’s
       population is concentrated in two largest municipalities – Podgorica and Niksic,
       while 10 largest municipalities (out of 21) account for 82% of population. This
       uneven distribution of population drives the costs of broadband deployment up
       and impedes broadband investments in scarcely populated regions.20
Visual representation of the above facts as well as their benchmarking against socio-demographic
premises of the EU and Eastern Europe is provided on the Figure 4.

        3.2. Demand analysis
To reveal the trends in demand for broadband, three main factors are analyzed: dynamics of Internet
usage in Montenegro, penetration rates and subscriber growth. The breakdown by rural vs. urban areas,
as well as by household vs. business sectors allow to disentangle the drivers of broadband demand gap.
Comparing the statistics on the Internet usage with that on broadband penetration reveals the unmet
demand for broadband connectivity. As demonstrated in Figure 5, according to ITU with 61% internet
usage in 2014, Montenegro exceeds the Balkans average (59.6%), although it still lags behind the EU,
where 74.5% of people use internet. However, the gap in broadband penetration is wider: Montenegro
lags behind the EU in broadband penetration by 17 p.p. (15% vs. 32%), compared to 13p.p. gap in
internet usage (61% vs 74%). As 61 % of individuals are regularly using Internet and only 15 % of the
population has access to broadband, this indicates that people either are sharing broadband access (one
connection per household) or are using high-speed internet in offices, libraries or public hot-spots. This
suggests the potential unmet demand for broadband connectivity.

Montenegro’s fixed broadband penetration and growth are in line with the Western Balkans averages,
but behind that of the EU and the wider Balkan region average. In particular, Montenegro had 15.2%
population penetration of broadband (compared to EU average of 32.3%) in 2014 – a 4.7 p.p. increase in
broadband penetration, compared to 2010. This growth exceeded the Balkan’s average growth of 4.45
p.p., but lagged behind the EU growth of 6.1 p.p. Montenegro has to achieve substantially higher growth
in penetration rates in order to catch up with the EU average. However, the overall growth dynamics
show that broadband subscription growth on the households’ level is saturating (See Figure 6).22

At the national level, the fixed broadband penetration slowdown stems from two visible gaps in
broadband adoption: between Central & Coastal vs. Northern regions, and between rural vs. urban
households. In particular, broadband penetration in urban areas is up to 4 times higher compared to
rural areas. As shown in Figure 7, urban Coastal region has the highest fixed broadband penetration at
the population level (33.4%), and also the smallest gap between rural and urban areas. Broadband
technologies also vary by region. Central and Coastal regions demonstrate the highest adoption rates of
more advanced technologies (e.g. FTTx), while in the Northern region old-generation technologies (e.g.
xDSL, Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC)) prevail (Figure 8).

Analysis of wireless broadband (limited to computer-dedicated dongle subscriptions only23) shows
similar trends as in the case of fixed broadband, although there is an even wider gap observed between
rural and urban areas. Overall, the wireless broadband penetration is on average just above 7% in urban
areas of Central and Northern regions, and 1% to 1.7% in rural areas of the respective regions (Figure 9).
The Coastal region has a relatively higher number of wireless subscribers – 25% of urban population and
8% of rural population. The demand for broadband in the Coastal region is likely to be stimulated by the
tourism industry.

  In mobile broadband analysis, only dongle subscriptions are considered due to the focus of the analysis
on computer-dedicated broadband connectivity

                                                                                                         24

In the business sector, World Bank Enterprise Surveys indicate widespread demand for broadband
connectivity. Montenegro has a relatively high percentage of firms using e-mail services in everyday
business (81% vs. 73% for the countries surveyed, as shown in Figure 10). However, the percentage of
firms with their own web-sites is lower than the average for the countries surveyed (30% vs. 46%).
Within Montenegro, the Central region hosts the most active users of Internet connectivity for web-site
maintenance (40.8%) and e-mail communication (82.7%), while the Northern region is the least active in
this regard (0.9% of businesses have their own web-sites, although 81% use e-mail for communication),
as shown in Figure 11.
The breakdown by the type of enterprise reveals that service sector firms are relatively more active
users of web services, compared to large and non-exporting firms and non-exporters. Since broadband
connectivity is crucial in high-priority service industries such as tourism, broadband penetration growth
is likely to stimulate business activity and enable economic growth in these sectors in particular.

       3.3. Supply analysis
Supply side of high-speed broadband connectivity market in Montenegro is crucial for understanding the
nature of possible market failures in Montenegrin telecommunications market. Three key aspects
analyzed in this report include: market structure, broadband coverage24, and pricing. Montenegro’s
broadband market is highly concentrated, with Crnogorski Telekom (T-Com) controlling 85% of market
share (by number of subscriptions), as of December 2015. The position of the market leader has
strengthened over time, as T-Com’s market share increased from 73% in 2010 to 85% in 2015. As a
result, Montenegro has one of the most concentrated broadband markets in the Balkan region, as
measured by Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI)25 (Figure 12). This is likely to be a result of a small
potential market size, low population density and unfavorable (for network deployment) terrain

24
  See section II for approach used to estimate broadband coverage
25
  Values of Hirschman-Herfindahl index can range from almost 0 (perfect competition) to 10 000
(monopoly)

                                                                                                   26
(mountainous), all of which are severe obstacles for achieving economies of scale and scope in the high-
speed broadband market. Market concentration is high and is following similar dynamics as in other
small countries such as Malta, Luxembourg or Estonia, although absolute increase in HHI value is lower
in those countries.

Less intense competition is among the likely reasons behind slower introduction of new connectivity
technologies in Montenegro. Since the nationwide launch of xDSL network (operated by Crnogorski
Telekom) in 2005, 2-10 Mbps26 ADSL connection remains the most prevalent in Montenegro, accounting
for 59.2% of all subscriptions (Figure 13). In 2011, Crnogorski Telekom launched its EUR 7.4 million Fiber
To The Home (FTTH) network, which covered 10 cities (37 000 properties) as of 2015. As a result, the
number of T-Com FTTH users grew from 0 to 15% of all subscribers. With the rise of more modern
connectivity technologies such as FTTH, more subscribers will potentially have access to high-speed
broadband connectivity of at least 30 Mbps. However, as of now, only 3% of broadband subscribers are
actually subscribed to 30 Mbps. The gap in connectivity speeds is especially pronounced between rural
vs. urban areas. For example, 13% of urban subscribers use from 10 to 30 Mbps broadband, compared
to only 3% of subscribers in rural areas (Figure 14).




26
  In Figure 10 and thereafter, the range of connectivity speeds includes the upper limit, but does not
include the lower limit. For example, the 2-10 Mbps connectivity range refers to connectivity speeds larger
or equal to 2 Mbps, but smaller than 10 Mbps, 10-30 Mbps range refers to connectivity speeds larger or
equal to 10 Mbps, but smaller than 30 Mbps. Above 30 Mbps range includes 30 Mbps speed.

Current deficiencies in the broadband coverage result from the potential market failure to incentivize
the provision of broadband (aka public good) in hard to access, scarcely populated areas of the country.
Under the current market structure, the market discourages expansion of broadband infrastructure
whenever marginal revenue from additional subscribers is below marginal costs of network expansion.
What it means in practice is that profit-maximizing broadband operators are discouraged from investing

                                                                                                     28
in broadband infrastructure in rural areas and hard to access mountainous areas of the country. This
amplifies the problem of coverage gap between urban and rural areas, especially when the latter are
facing low population density. Regional analysis reveals that it is indeed the case that rural areas widely
lack not only access, but also backhaul connections27 (see Figure 15). Connectivity is also unequally
distributed among regions, with the Northern region lagging behind. For example, 19% of population in
the Northern region (368 out of 578 settlements) does not have backhaul connectivity, compared to 5%
in the Central region (301 out of 405 settlements) and 5% in Coastal region (88 out of 217 settlements).
Overall, 9% of Montenegro’s population (757 settlements in total) lives in settlements without backhaul
connection.

Underinvestment in broadband infrastructure results in nearly the slowest broadband connections
when the entire region is concerned (Figure 16). In terms of speed, 12.28% of population uses 2-10
Mbps connectivity, with the second most used speed being 10-30 Mbps (1.71% of population). Above 30
Mbps connectivity is used only by 0.44% of population. The urban vs. rural gap prevails in the dominant
connectivity speed – 2-10 Mbps; in rural areas, high-speed penetrations are 2-3 times lower, compared
to urban areas. The gap is relatively lager in the Central and Northern regions.
T-Com ADSL broadband has the widest coverage in Montenegro, and it can be used as a proxy for fixed
broadband coverage overall. Even though the Montenegro country-wide average coverage is 79%, the
gaps still remain: in rural areas only 41% (Central region) to 58% (Coastal region) have ADSL access
(Figure 17). In terms of 4G coverage, the dynamics resembles ADSL coverage, but with an even wider

  The Survey launched by EKIP has collected the information on the backhaul connectivity per
settlement and per technology, i.e. fiber optic, microwave, other. In a number of occasions it was found
that some settlements lack any sort of backhaul connectivity and therefore are not connected to high-
speed broadband Internet.

In terms of affordability, Montenegro’s broadband connectivity is more expensive compared to the
regional averages (Figure 19). For example, 1Mbps connectivity accounts for 4.99% of household
monthly expense, above most countries in the region, and just below the ITU threshold of 5%. 10 Mbps
broadband connectivity constitutes 10% of monthly household disposable income, above the 5% ITU
threshold, and above all regional peers, apart from Bosnia and Herzegovina. One driver of this dynamics
is likely to be monopolistic price-setting behavior of Crnogorski Telekom. Another factor is relatively low
disposable income in Montenegro, which weighs on broadband affordability. The latter is consistent
with the fact that Montenegro has significantly higher broadband penetration (50% household
penetration) compared to the average for the countries in the respective GDP / capita decile (28%
household penetration).

In line with the indications of coverage deficiencies and affordability barriers, the Gaps model of Stern &
Townsend (See Box 3) reveals that Montenegrin broadband market suffers from access gaps, which
means that broadband service provision cannot be achieved by market alone; hence the state
intervention is needed.
To sum up, the analysis performed has established that 757 localities (accounting for 9% of the
population) have no backhaul connection (list of those settlements in provided in the Annex 1), while
802 localities (accounting for 10.4% of the population) are not connected to the backbone infrastructure
over the fiber optic backhaul which limits their technical possibility to provide high speed broadband
access in those settlements. Some of those settlements are however connected over the microwave
links. 21% of population is not covered by ADSL connectivity of up to 10 Mbps, and in 869 localities this
ADSL connectivity passes through less than 50% of homes (list of locations not covered by ADSL
connectivity of up to 10 Mbps is provided in the Annex 2). At the same time, 82.6% of population does
not have access to high-speed broadband connectivity above 30 Mbps, as 1245 localities (out of 1269
localities in total) are not yet connected to high-speed FTTH infrastructure.

Box 3 Stern & Townsend Gaps model of broadband
The theoretical model of Stern & Townsend (2007) could be applied to analyze the economic foundations of
telecommunications development in Montenegro. The model outcome is likely to confirm the existence of a
broadband access gap in Montenegro; the Ministry may wish to undertake this exercise in collaboration with
EKIP using the most recent data from all operators. Below is an estimate for which the data were used, which
had been collected during the Survey.
As demonstrated in the Figure below, the access gap is an area outside the market efficiency frontier and
affordability frontier, as telecommunications services in this area cannot be achieved by the market alone. To
bridge the access gap, two types of measures may be required: a one-time capital subsidy to reach the
sustainability frontier, and regular subsidies to ensure universal access beyond sustainability frontier. These
state interventions are typically required to ensure broadband access in rural areas with low population density,
as well as to stimulate usage by low-income population.

        3.4. Conclusions
Perhaps the most important conclusion from the above analysis is a likely presence of a market failure in
Montenegrin high-speed broadband market: i.e. there is an unmet demand for broadband services,
which is currently not being satisfied by market players. Firm confirmation of the presence of the market
failure can only be established through in-depth consultations with the market players. To further
substantilate potential market failure it is suggested to undertake a comprehensive review of the
regulatory tools, potential and already used, in order to understand the efficiency of their application
and limits to which they could potentially support high-speed broadband infrastructure expansion by
private sector. This analysis would allow to adjust and optimize utilization of the regulatory instruments;
and to minimize the expenditure of public funds to strictly necessary amount.
From the information collected so far, it is likely that the growing demand for high-speed broadband will
not be satisfied in the near future (this, however, should be confirmed by market players). Identified
gaps (coverage and connection speeds) in high-speed broadband supply are likely to result from the fact
that ISPs are not entering into potentially unprofitable settlements with low economies of scale. The
state intervention might therefore be rightly considered to confirm and, if indeed present, to correct
this market failure through incentives for broadband availability and adoption in less densely populated
areas.
The localities with the lowest take up of high-speed penetration are concentrated in rural areas, with
only 3.4% population penetration in rural Northern region (compared to 12% in urban Northern region),
4.1% - in rural Central region (comp. to 17.4% in urban Central region), and 15.8% in rural Coastal region
(comp. to 33.4% in urban Coastal region). Taking into account the saturating growth in new broadband
connections, it is advisable for the state to better understand the willingness of the private sector
operators to invest in those specific localities through comprehensive public consultations, including
validation of possible regulatory instruments that could potentially resolve market failure. In the case
case when no concrete investment plans are being put in place in the near future, (even in case relevant
and efficient regulatory intruments would be applied), it would be recommended to consider a more
pro-active intervention from the state to address persistent broadband availability gaps in those areas.
The following Chapter will elaborate on existing EU state aid legal and regulatory framework that is
relevant for the Ministry in its design and thinking about the policy measures under the new sector
strategy.

IV.     Main features of the EU State aid framework
State aid, which distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member
States, is in general prohibited in the EU by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
(formerly called the Treaty establishing the European Community; hereinafter – the Treaty). State aid
policy is an integral part of EU competition policy, mainly aiming at controlling aid, which distorts (or
potentially can distort) competition in the internal EU market. The main reasoning for controlling State
aid granted by Member States at the EU level is the potentially negative effects of national subsidies (or
alternative remedies) on the EU market. Negative effects (or externalities) occur, because national
governments rarely build on their State aid decisions on cost-benefit analysis or international impact
evaluation. State aid decisions quite often are biased by political influence, tend to support potentially
inefficient national companies (which under normal circumstances would exit the market) or increase
their market power. This is why the prohibition of State aid exists in the first place.
The Treaty prohibition of State aid is, however, not absolute. It leaves room for a number of
exceptions. The EU competition policy (including State aid rules) is broadly based on the laissez-faire
approach, whereby demanded goods are expected to be brought by the free market. However, in some
cases the market fails to deliver expected results, and specific interventions become necessary.
Therefore, the Treaty allows some exceptions where the proposed State aid is justified by reasons of
economic nature and may have a beneficial developmental impact.
Generally, the main economic rationale for granting State aid is to correct market failures (market
power, information asymmetries, inefficient allocation of resources, public services), the main
political rationale is that it helps to achieve common policy objectives (like social and regional
cohesion, employment, research and development, sustainable development). In the "State Aid Action
Plan — Less and better targeted state aid: A roadmap for state aid reform 2005-2009"28 the European
Commission (EC) also recognizes these two types of positive effects of State aid measures: i) State aid
can become an effective tool for achieving objectives of common interest; ii) State aid can correct
market failures, by improving the functioning of the market and its competitiveness. Economic
development (general, regional or sectorial) and common European interests are the allowed exemption
areas, where State aid can be considered compatible with the EU policy.
The EC has a mandate to assess State aid compatibility, and it is responsible for enforcing the EU State
aid policy. In exercising its discretionary power to assess State aid’s compatibility, the EC has to find a
balance between State aid’s necessity, proportionality, and its abili ty to contribute in achieving
common EU objectives versus the distortion of competition that the aid may bring. 29 The legislation,
which the EC adopts in close cooperation with Member States, stipulates the exemptions, i.e. specifies
which State aid measures may be compatible with the Treaty. It also describes the procedures on State
aid verification. For this purpose the EC has issued a number of documents in the form of regulations,
communications, notices, frameworks, guidelines (See: the Compilation of State aid rules in force30).

The EU State Aid Scoreboards31 (periodical surveys on State aid in the EU) show, that State aid may be a
significant contributor to EU Member States economies. In 2014, EU Member States spent 101.2 billion
EUR, i.e. 0.72% of GDP on State aid (0.49% in 2013), ranging from 2.08% in Latvia to 0.3% in Spain32. It is
also commonly acknowledged that State aid helped to contain the financial crisis (in 2010, crisis aid
accounted for 9.9% of EU GDP)33.
Despite the importance and wide application of State aid, its definition remains a subject for
discussions, with a great number of attempts to interpret it. It is so because the Treaty34, by which the
State aid is governed, gives a very broad definition of the concept. Moreover, in a legally binding
manner, the Treaty can only be interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the European
Court).
As a candidate country for membership in the EU, Montenegro has to implement the EU law (acquis) in
35 policy areas. Competition policy, which mainly covers anti-trust and State aid rules, is one of them. As
the EC stated in its Montenegro progress report of 2015, the country is moderately prepared on
competition policy and State aid policy remains an issue of concern.35 The country should complete the
alignment of the State aid rules with the acquis, ensure the operational independence of its State aid
authority and improve administrative capacity. Even though by March 2016, Montenegro had
transposed the majority of EU State aid rules into the national legislation36, the country still lacks
experience in operationalizing it. According to one local law company, “the majority of aid given so far
by the grantors in Montenegro falls into the category of de minimis” 37. Therefore, “the entire field of
State aid law is still a terra incognita in Montenegro” 38.
The objective of this task is to provide an overview of the basic State aid concepts and rules
(particularly, in the broadband area). The notion of what constitutes State aid is fundamental to being
able to discipline it. Domestic policymakers must make some a priori assessment in order to decide what
steps to take, since definitional issue also determines which procedures have to be followed.

           4.1. State aid: formal definition and main concepts
As already mentioned, the State aid in the EU is governed by the Treaty, mainly Articles 107-10939. The
Treaty says that "any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever
which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of
certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the
internal market" (Article 107(1) of the Treaty)40. This paragraph of the Article 107 provides us with a
formal definition of State aid and discloses a general approach towards State aid, i.e., it contains a
general prohibition of State aid.
While trying to understand the concept of State aid, it has to be stated first, that the term State aid is
not of an economic, but a legal nature. It is so because in a legally binding manner it can only be
interpreted by the European Court. It has to be noted that some aspects of the State aid definition have
been a subject for European Court cases and interpretation of them are already available (e.g.
undertakings41). However, a concrete State aid definition remains elusive: “the European Court has not
yet provided a consistent and comprehensive interpretation of the conditions for State aid”.42
The role of the EC is limited to clarifying how it understands and applies the Treaty provisions in line
with the case law. For this purpose, in 2014 the EC issued a communication “Draft Commission Notice
on the notion of State aid pursuant to Article 107(1) TFEU”, where it provides “further clarification on
the key concepts relating to the notion of State aid provided for in Article 107(1) of the Treaty” 43. The
document is quite extensive and aims to cover all of the elements of the notion of State aid. A public
consultation on the communication took place in 201444, the final document was published in May,
201645, whereas the clarification and interpretation of basic concepts and principles are provided
hereafter (based on available documentation).

       -   Cumulative approach. “According to the case-law, classification as State aid
           requires that all the conditions set out in Article 107(1) TFEU are fulfilled”.46“A
           measure will constitute ‘State aid’ if four cumulative conditions are met: (i) there
           must be an intervention by the State or through State resources; (ii) that
           intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States; (iii) it must
           confer a selective advantage on the recipient; and (iv) it must distort or
           threaten to distort competition.”47 I.e. the provisions of the Article have been
           broken down into four cumulative criteria, and State aid will only exist if all four
           are met.

     -   State resources include all resources of the public sector48, including central
         and all local governments, together with public or private bodies that use or
         administrate State resources or are controlled by the State. This means that
         resources of public undertakings also constitute State resources, because the
         State is capable of directing the use of them.49 What is also important to notice in
         this context is that “resources coming from the Union (e.g. from structural funds)
         or international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund
         (IMF) or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
         should also be considered as State resource if national authorities have
         discretion as to the use of those resources (in particular the selection of
         beneficiaries)”50. In such case resources coming from the World Bank should
         also be considered as State resources.
     -   An undertaking is an entity in any legal form whatsoever which is engaged in an
         economic activity, or as defined by the European Court - “entities engaged in an
         economic activity, regardless of their legal status and the way in which they are
         financed”51. It could be a publicly owned company, a non-profit company or even
         a charity, if it is engaged in an economic activity in competition with othe rs. “Any
         activity consisting in offering goods and services on a market is an economic
         activity”52, meaning that if a market, even very limited, for given goods or services
         exists, it will be treated as economic activity. Police, armed forces, air traffic
         control may be examples of non-economic activities, but the scope of them are
         rather limited and may depend on the way how these services are organized in a
         certain country.
     -   An advantage on the recipient is any economic benefit which an undertaking(s)
         would not have obtained under normal market conditions, i.e. in the absence of
         State intervention53. Not only the granting of positive economic advantages
         relevant for the notion of State aid, but relief from economic burdens can also
         constitute an advantage.54 The EC in its draft communication on the notion of
         State aid also advices to pay attention on possible indirect advantages, i.e. if a
         State aid measure is “designed in such a way so as to channel its secondary
         effects towards identifiable undertakings or groups of undertakings”55.
         To answer the question, whether an economic advantage has been given by the
         State aid, the 'Market Economy Operator' (MEO)56 test can be used. It seeks to

investor would have made the same investments under normal market economy conditions; Private
Creditor Test – to compare the behavior of public creditors with hypothetical private ones in similar

                                                                                                     40
        evaluate if a private and public entity would have come to similar results under
        comparable circumstances if it were operating under normal market economy
        conditions. The key element is “whether the public authorities acted as a market
        economy operator would have done in a similar situation”57. The burden of
        proving, that a measure is in line with MEO, would fall on a Member State issuing
        a measure.58
    -   Selectivity - an advantage (direct or indirect) should be given on the selective
        basis, i.e. only to a certain/specific undertaking(s) or categories of undertakings
        or to certain economic sectors.59 The measures, which are equally open to all
        undertakings operating within a Member State, would not be selective, thus,
        would not create a selective advantage.
    -   Although the distortion of competition and effect on trade are two distinct
        elements of the notion of State aid, in practice, they often seem to be treated
        jointly as they are considered to be closely linked. As a general rule, as soon as
        a State grants an advantage to an undertaking in a liberalized sector, the
        measure is treated as distorting (or having a potential to distort) competition.
        Similarly, most products and services are traded between Member States and
        therefore State aid for almost any selected business or economic activity is
        capable of affecting trade between Member States. Exceptions are very rare,
        purely local and very specific markets (e.g. hospitals and other health care
        facilities aimed at a local population only60). As in practice there are no
        requirements for an actual distortion or effect to be proved, this part of the State
        aid definition is therefore easy to satisfy.61
To sum it up, if a measure meets all four criteria mentioned above, it has to be treated as a State aid
(i.e. State aid rules applies and formal notification to the EC may be required, see Figure 20). Examples
of State aid are extensive and include direct state grants and subsidies, tax exemptions, loans at
preferential interest rates, guarantees, disposal of land or buildings at lower than market price and etc.
Less obvious examples where State aid might arise include: consultancy advice, assistance to help
companies invest in environmental projects, legislation to protect or guarantee market share, public
private partnerships and contracts not open to competitive tendering, infrastructure projects benefiting
specific users.62




circumstances; Private Vendor Test – to assess if private vendor under normal market conditions would
have obtain the same price as a public body in question.

          4.2. Measures not constituting State Aid

 Box 1 Article 107 of the Treaty

 1. Save as otherwise provided in the Treaties, any aid granted by a Member State or through State
 resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain
 undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member
 States, be incompatible with the internal market.

 2. The following shall be compatible with the internal market:
         (a) aid having a social character, granted to individual consumers, provided that such aid is
         granted without discrimination related to the origin of the products concerned;
         (b) aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;
         (c) aid granted to the economy of certain areas of the Federal Republic of Germany affected by
         the division of Germany, in so far as such aid is required in order to compensate for the
         economic disadvantages caused by that division. Five years after the entry into force of the
         Treaty of Lisbon, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt a decision
         repealing this point.

 3. The following may be considered to be compatible with the internal market:
         (a) aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is
         abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment, and of the regions referred to in
         Article 349, in view of their structural, economic and social situation;
         (b) aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to
         remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State;
         (c) aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain economic areas,
         where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the
         common interest;
         (d) aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect trading
         conditions and competition in the Union to an extent that is contrary to the common interest;
         (e) such other categories of aid as may be specified by decision of the Council on a proposal
         from the Commission.

State aid rules apply only to aid that has all four elements set out in Article 107(1).63 Some examples
when not all criteria are fulfilled will be provided in the following paragraphs. However, it should be
noted, that they are provided just for introductory purposes, because each case should be analyzed
separately in more detail.

      a. Measures not meeting definition criteria: no state resources
Intervention by the State or through State resources is one of the primary criteria in the State aid
definition. Only advantages granted directly or indirectly through State resources are to be considered
State aid within the meaning of the Treaty. In the Case PreussenElektra AG v Schhleswag AG64, the
European Court recognized that the German electricity feed-in tariff system (financing system
supporting electricity from renewable resources) not constitute State aid, as it was not the State, but the

German system operators themselves, allocating the money to the recipients6566. However, many other
renewable energy support schemes in other countries have been found to meet the criterion, as they
have chosen different financing and administration schemes (e.g. specific fund-like institutions directly
or indirectly controlled by the State).67

     b. Measures not meeting definition criteria: no selective advantage
General measures available to all economic undertakings in all parts of the Member State are normally
outside the scope of State aid, since the criterion of selectivity is not fulfilled.68 One of very common
examples includes general tax exemptions.
In two recent cases69 on fiscal State aid, the European Court found that certain aspects of the Spanish
tax system did not constitute State aid. The Spanish law determined that if a Spanish company acquired
of at least 5% of the shares of a foreign company and the shares were kept for at least a year, the
goodwill arising from this investment could be deducted from the tax liability of the acquiring
company.70 The EC argued that the tax measure constitutes State aid, which is incompatible with the
internal market. According to the EC, the measure gave an advantage to Spanish companies investing in
non-Spanish entities over Spanish companies investing in Spanish entities, i.e. it created a selective
advantage. However, the European Court decided that the EC failed to show that the measure creates a
selective advantage for a particular category of undertakings.71 The European Court acknowledged that
the measure can be applied to all acquisitions by at least 5% of foreign companies that were held
without interruption for at least one year, i.e. in order to take advantage of the measure, a company had
to purchase shares in a foreign company. The measure did not refer to a particular business or
production category, but to a particular category of economic operations or transactions. This implies,
that for a measure to be selective, it is not enough to be an exemption of general system. It still has to
favor certain undertakings.
Additionally, if a State is acting in a way that a private investor would in a market economy, this means
that it is not providing State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1). This usually applies when the
State is the main shareholder of an undertaking. When it is a State-controlled company, the key
question is whether a private investor - who would not take into account regional development or
employment concerns, but who would expect to make an eventual return - would invest/ behave in this

65
    Operators first paid the minimum prices and then equalized their costs among themselves in the
market. “Statutory provisions of a Member State which, first, require private electricity supply undertakings
to purchase electricity produced in their area of supply from renewable energy sources at minimum prices
higher than the real economic value of that type of electricity, and, second, distribute the financial burden
resulting from that obligation between those electricity supply undertakings and upstream private
electricity network operators do not constitute State aid”

way.72 If it is proven that the State acted under the same terms and conditions as a commercial investor
when providing the necessary funding, then State aid is not involved. One very common example is
airport fees. Since many airports are State-owned, it is indeed possible that they may not charge fees at
commercial rates which are MEO compliant73. Such actions may be considered as State aid.
Support for general infrastructure projects that do not benefit specific users would also normally fall
outside the scope of State aid. Public funding of infrastructure, which is open to any user does not
constitute State aid. Fees charged to users of publicly-funded infrastructure must cover incremental
costs and include a reasonable margin.74 In the case of German investment aid to an enterprise
(Propapier) for a project to build a paper production plant in a disadvantaged region, the EC found that
not only the aid measure was in line with the EU State aid rules, but also the surrounding infrastructure
built by the German state did not involve State aid, as they were general infrastructure, not dedicated
specifically to a particular market player. Charges for the use of this general infrastructure covered
incremental costs75.

      c. Measures not meeting definition criteria: no economic activity
State aid refers to public assistance given to a certain undertaking(s). According to the case law, an
undertaking is any entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of its legal status and of how it is
financed76. Thus, aid to public bodies not involved in economic activities will not constitute State aid. For
example, in the case of Welsh Public Sector Network Scheme the EC recognized that the suggested
measure did not constitute State aid, as it intended to support public bodies not involved in economic
activities.77 The measure aimed at providing public sector organizations in Wales with high bandwidth
network services, by procuring one public service contract for the provision of consolidated network
services.78 The EC concluded, that the end users of the measure are public sector organizations, which
do not carry out economic activities, thus do not qualify as “undertakings”.

      d. Measures not meeting definition criteria: no potential effect on competition
         and trade
As already mentioned, effect (or potential effect) on competition and trade within the EU
are criteria, which seem to be relatively easy to fulfill. However, seeking to simplify State
aid rules, the EC has adopted a de minimis Regulation on small aid amounts that fall
outside the scope of EU State aid control because they are deemed to have no impact
on competition and trade in the internal market.79 Support granted under the de minimis

   Public organisations in Wales had their own networks, which were procured separately by the different public
service organisations. This resulted in higher costs, lack of sufficient connectivity and duplication of resources. See:

Regulation is not regarded as State aid, if no more than EUR 200 000 is granted to a
single undertaking over a period of three years.
Other examples of low impact on competition and trade might be very local and specific markets. For
example, in the case of State support for developing a certain historic site in Poland, the EC recognized
that the local and very small scale character of the commercial activities ensure that an effect on intra-
Union trade “can for all practical purposes be excluded”.80

     e. Service of General Economic Interest
Another group of services, which will be treated separately by the EC, are so called Services of General
Economic Interest (SGEI).
SGEI are services of an economic nature that public authorities identify as being of particular importance
to citizens, but which are not supplied by market forces alone, or at least not to the extent and under
the conditions requested by society. Examples of SGEI range from providing large commercial services
(such as postal services, energy security of supply) to the entire population at affordable conditions, to a
wide range of health and social services (such as care for the elderly or people with disabilities). 81
Member States are basically free to define which services are of general interest. However, as these
services usually are commercially unjustified (profitless or lossmaking), they often include some
compensation or State funding mechanisms. This public funding or compensation granted for the
provision of such services still has not to unduly distort competition in the EU. The renewed package of
legislation related to SGEI was adopted in 2011.82 It not only clarifies key concepts of SGEI, but also
identifies criteria, that should be met for financing of such services not to be treated as State aid. Four
so called Almark criteria should be fulfilled (see Box 5), otherwise - the public service compensation will
be examined under State aid rules.
Box 5 Altmark criteria for SGEI compensation
In its Altmark judgment of 24 July 2003, the European Court provided clarification as to when public service
compensation does not constitute State aid. According to the judgment four cumulative conditions have to be
satisfied:
- there must be an entrustment act clearly defining the public service obligation;
- the parameters for calculating the compensation must be established in advance in an objective and transparent
manner;
- the compensation cannot exceed the relevant costs and a reasonable profit (i.e. there is no overcompensation);
and
- the provider is either chosen through a public procurement procedure or the level of compensation is determined
based on an analysis of the costs of an average "well-run" undertaking in the sector concerned.
The Altmark ruling highlighted the fact that many instances of public service compensation for SGEI providers
represent State aid. In order to provide legal certainty, the EC adopted in 2005 a set of specific rules for the
compatibility of such State aid with the internal market. In 2011, a renewed set of legal acts were adopted.

Source: http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/overview/public_services_en.html

In 2005, for example, the EC decided that, the public co-funding of an open broadband infrastructure in
Limousin, France constituted compensation for the provision of SGEI and was not considered to be a
State aid, as the project fulfilled the Almark criteria83. Similarly, in 2009, the EC adopted a decision
declaring that the compensation for public service charges for the establishment and operation of a very
high-speed broadband electronic communications network in the French Hauts-de-Seine department
did not constitute State aid.84

         4.3. Objectives and measures compatible with the State aid
The Treaty leaves room for a number of policy objectives for which State aid can be considered
compatible.85 Articles 107 (2) and 107 (3) of the Treaty list exceptions that are not part of the general
ban on State aid, as in some circumstances government interventions are necessary for a well-
functioning and equitable economy.

Article 107(2) specifies three types of aid that it declares compatible (see Box 4), although it should be
noted that in practice these categories will seldom arise:

     -   Social aid granted to individual consumers, i.e. the ultimate beneficiary of the aid
         must be an individual, rather than an undertaking, and has to be of social
         character (covering only certain groups, like children, elderly people);
     -   Aid to make good damage by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences;
     -   Aid to certain areas of Germany affected by the division of Germany.
Although these categories are automatically considered as being compatible with the internal market,
they still have to be satisfied prior to being put into effect, so as to allow the EC to verify that the
conditions laid down in the Treaty are met.86
Article 107(3) defines categories that may be considered compatible with the common market:

     -   Aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living
         is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment87;
     -   Aid to promote the execution of an important project of common European
         interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State88;
     -   Aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or of certain
         economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to
         an extent contrary to the common interest89;

   According to the guidelines on regional aid, this point applies to regions having a per capita GDP of
less than 75% of the EU average. See: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52014XC0405%2802%29
88
   To satisfy this criterion, a measure/ project normally should involve more than one Member State and
benefits from it should be extended to a wide part of the EU. It also should clearly contribute to one or
more EU objectives. See Communication on State aid to promote CIP: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-
content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.C_.2014.188.01.0004.01.ENG

                                                                                                        46
     -   Aid to promote culture and heritage conservation where such aid does not affect
         trading conditions and competition in the Union to an extent that is contrary to the
         common interest;
     -   Such other categories of aid as may be specified by decision of the Council on a
         proposal from the Commission.

The Treaty gives the EC the sole competence to determine whether the
conditions for compatibility are fulfilled90, i.e. the EC is authorised under Article 108
of the Treaty to control State aid. The EC has to evaluate both positive and negative
effect of a measure in question, in order to approve/disapprove giving of the State aid
(even if it could have some effect on competition). For that purpose, the EC has issued
a number of different documents, explaining how and on what basis decisions are
taken. So that the EC may adopt a position on State aid measure and its applicability,
Member States are obliged, under Article 108 (3) of the Treaty to inform in sufficient
time of any plans to grant new aid or alter existing aid (i.e. to notify the EC) 91. Aid may
not be granted by Member States until the EC has taken a final decision on it. The EC
decisions can be appealed in the EU courts.




89
   The disturbance must affect the economy of a Member State as a whole and it should be serious
compared to the general situation in the EU.

         4.4. Measures not requiring formal notification

The underlying principle of the State aid procedures is that the EC must be notified in
advance of all planned aid schemes, unless it falls under a few possible exemptions.

     a. General Block Exemption Regulation

In a General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), the EC declares that certain categories of State aid
are compatible with the internal market and shall not be subject to the requirement of prior
notification. Consequently, Member States may implement State aid measures, which fulfill the
conditions of the GBER without having gone through the notification procedure. It should be noted,
however, that the EC may withdraw the benefits of the GBER if a Member State does not comply with
any of common or specific conditions.92
In 2014 the EC renewed GBER, with one of the objectives to induce Member States to use the GBER for
most of the State aid measures, which have limited budgets.93The first version of GBER was published
in 2008, while amended version of the GBER94 entered into force on July 1, 2014. It considerably
broadens the scope of pre-approved aid and encompasses several new categories of aid. The EC
estimates that about 3/4 of State aid measures will be exempted under the revised GBER.95 Some state
that up to 90% of aid measures could potentialy fall under the GBER.96
The GBER sets out categories of aid and the conditions under which aid measures can potentially
benefit from such an exemption. Many categories and types of aid measures are covered by the GBER
and these include among others: regional aid; SME aid; aid for environmental protection, aid for
research, development and innovations, as well as aid for broadband infrastructure (detailed analysis of
this specific type of aid is provided in the Section 5.4 of the paper) or local infrastructure.97 The
regulation also sets sectors98 and measures, for which GBER cannot be applied, including:

        State aid schemes with average annual State aid budget that exceed EUR 150
         million for following categories: regional aid, aid for SMEs, aid for access to
         finance for SMEs, aid for R&D&I, aid for environmental protection and aid for
         broadband infrastructures. Schemes in other categories will not be exempted
         from GBER, regardless of their budget, if other conditions are fulfilled 99;
        Export-related activities;
        Primary agriculture production & fisheries;

   In general, GBER applies to all sectors of the economy with some exceptions. Sectoral restrictions are
set out in Article 1, paragraphs 3-5 of the Regulation: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-

          Closure of coal mines;
          Undertakings in difficulty.
The GBER not only determines eligible beneficiaries, but also maximum aid intensities (i.e. the maximum
proportion of the eligible costs of a project that can benefit from State aid) and eligible expenses.100
These are determined for each category separately. Basic requirements for a measure to fall under GBER
include: aid must be transparent, must have incentive effect, must be cumulated101, aid measures must
be published. Other requirements are set for each category separately.
It is important to notice, that in general measures adopted on the basis of the GBER do not have to be
notified. Member States have to submit to the EC a summary information within 20 working days of
adopting a measure and also to submit annual reports. However, when the amount for an individual
award or when the cost of a project exceeds some determined thresholds, individual notification is
necessary, e.g.:

          Regional investment: EUR 100 million
          Regional urban development: EUR 20 million/project
          Broadband infrastructure: EUR 70 million /project102
The EC can withdraw the benefits of the GBER if a Member State does not comply with any of common
or specific conditions.

       b. De minimis Regulation

In 2006, the EC adopted a de minimis Regulation - a regulation exempting small
amounts of State aid (under EUR 200 000 in any rolling three-year period) from
the obligation to notify the EC in advance for clearance under the State aid rules.
On January 1, 2014, the new de minimis Regulation entered into force, the main idea of
which remains the same. i.e. small amounts of State aid have a negligible effect of the
EU trade and competition, therefore there is no requirement to notify it. 103

Small amounts of aid to one undertaking, i.e. less than EUR 200,000 in any rolling three-year period, are
considered as having no appreciable effect on competition or trade. This aid may be given without the
need for notification or approval, though records of the aid granted must be maintained. All terms of
the de minimis Regulation must be followed (e.g. cannot be given to export related activities).

       c. Existing aid scheme

If State aid is granted under an aid scheme already authorised by the EC, no additional notification to
the EC is required. Member States may grant aid in conformity with the conditions established in the

relevant EC decision. Example of such case may be a recently approved State aid scheme for broadband
roll-out in Germany.104
In February 2014, Germany notified plans to support Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband roll-out
with EUR 3 billion over the coming seven years.105 Private operators and municipalities can apply for
funding in target areas where only basic broadband access106 is available and where there are no private
investment plans to develop NGA for the coming three years. The objective was to establish networks
that are capable of delivering download speeds of at least 30 Mbit/s for 95% of the population and 50
Mbit/s for 75% of the population in the target area. As a general rule, download speeds have to be at
least doubled by the intervention and upload speeds need to increase at least by the same proportion as
download speeds.107 The EC has found that the Germany's proposal “meets the compatibility criteria set
out in the Broadband Guidelines and is thus compatible with Article 107(3)(c) TFEU”.108 It recognized
that the measure will contribute greatly to achieve the objectives of the Digital Agenda for Europe and
will have limited negative effect on competition in the EU.

The approval means that any State aid granted under this particular scheme will not
require an additional notification to the EC. Germany will have to submit annual reports
on the application of the measure and to inform the EC of any plans to amend or extend
the measure.

          4.5. Verification procedures
As already mentioned, the EC has a sole competence to assess the compatibility of the
State aid. In order to complete this task, the EC must be informed in sufficient time
of any plans to grant new State aid or alter the existing one, i.e. if a measure
constitutes State aid and does not meet the conditions allowing an exemption, a
notification to the EC for State aid clearance is required. The objective behind the
notification procedure is to allow the EC to verify the compatibility of aid with the
common market.
New (or altered) aid schemes or individual aid cannot be introduced or
implemented before the EU authorization is granted. This is known as the
suspension obligation or standstill clause. It means that the measure may not be
put into effect prior to the decision by the EC explicitly authorizing it. 109 Aid granted
without prior notification is unlawful or illegal (except for the foreseen exemptions, i.e, de
minimis or GBER).110
In preparing aid schemes, the authorities should take into account that the notification procedure takes
around 4 - 6 months.111 Furthermore, anyone can make a complaint to the EC provided they can
demonstrate that they have an interest in a particular case (e.g. potential beneficiaries of a State aid,
competitors or others). As a result, complaints are usually made by a competitor to the aid recipient.
This also makes a process lengthy and sometimes complicated.
Detailed procedural regulations for notification are provided in the Council Regulation (EU) 2015/1589
of 13 July 2015 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 108 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union.112 To put in a simplified way, under regular circumstances, the
notification entails two phases:
Step 1. Pre-notification phase. This phase is not “officially” part of the notification procedure under
Article 108, but it has emerged from the practice. All Member States are invited to submit a draft
notification of their plans for State aid measures. After examining the case, the EC will inform the
Member State if a simplified or normal procedure have to be followed.
Step 2. Procedural phase. It may took two different ways, as described in Table 3. State aid notification
procedures

                                                 and the measure may be implemented;
                                             - the aid is compatible with EU rules, and may be
                                                 implemented;
                                             - serious doubts remain as to the compatibility of the aid
                                                 and the EC opens an in-depth/formal investigation. In
                                                 this case, the measure may not be implemented until the

                                             the internal market), a conditional decision (imposing certain
                                             conditions on the measure in order to make it compatible) or a
                                             negative decision (the measure in incompatible and may not be put

In case the EC decides that the measure may not be implemented but the aid has already been
granted, the Member State usually has to take all measures necessary to recover it, i.e. the aid
granted must be actually paid back.114 In case a Member State would decide to implement aid
measures prior to notification, a full, and often lengthy, assessment of the compatibility of the aid would
normally be still required before the EC can order the recovery of that aid (unlawful aid). It is considered
that national courts could potentially ensure a swifter aid recovery process than the EC can achieve.115

         4.6. Summary
The EU State aid framework is quite complex, having separate regulations for different economic
sectors, extensive regulations on State aid treatment and procedures. A list of some important
regulations is provided in Annex 4.
The framework is being frequently reviewed and improved. The attempts of the EC to shape the State
aid policy to be more targeted towards achieving common EU policy objectives, were most likely the
main reasons why the EU’s State aid policy has undergone several serious reforms in past decades. In
2000 the EC asked Member States to reduce the level of State aid (as percentage of GDP) 116 and to
promote horizontal aid instead of benefiting individual companies or sectors117, seeking to shape State
aid policy to target more effectively the Lisbon Strategy goals, i.e. “to become the most dynamic and
competitive knowledge-based economy in the world”118. In 2005, the State aid action plan was
launched. It covered the period of 2005-2009 and brought about further changes, in line with the
midterm review of the Lisbon Strategy. Finally, State aid modernization initiative was issued in 2012 with
the main goal to support EU growth strategy for 2020119. The summary of the latest modernization and
its implications are provided in Box 7 and Box 6. The summary of State aid notion (main criteria) and
notification requirements are provided in Figure 20.
Box 6 Implications of State aid modernization
One of the main objectives of State aid modernization was the simplification of State aid procedures, especially the
ones concerning aid with limited effect on EU internal market. I.e. the EC aimed at focusing its enforcement on the
cases with the biggest impact on the internal market, allowing greater part of State aid decisions be taken by
Member States following the renewed regulations, in particular GBER and de minimis regulation.
As State aid modernization mainly took place in 2014, the evaluation of real implications of this initiative is still
premature. However, the first data show the total amount of State aid has increased along with the amount of
State aid granted under the GBER in 2014, although a number of State aid decisions taken by the EC decreased (at
least in the case of broadband). This means that the reform shows the first positive results.

   Historically, State aid has been used by Member States in the past explicitly and extensively in defense of their
national industries. See: Ganoulis, http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/41131/1/338182462.pdf
117
    Sectorial and individual aid is considered to have potentially the strongest distortive effects on the
allocation of resources and competition or trade. See: Ganoulis,

Box 7 State aid modernization
In May 2012, the EC issued the Communication on State aid modernization, where it set out an ambitious State aid
reform programme. The programme had three main objectives: (i) to foster sustainable, smart and inclusive
growth in a competitive internal market; (ii) to focus Commission ex ante scrutiny on cases with the biggest impact
on internal market; (iii) to streamline the rules and provide for faster decisions.
In 2013-2014, the EC revised existing rules on State aid and adopted new ones in line with identified targets and
principles. A number of documents were renewed, including:
-   Guidelines on regional aid for 2014-2020. Key features of the new guidelines include increased
    coverage of regions where regional aid may be granted, more aid categories to be exempted from
    notification procedure, increased transparency of granted aid.
-   Broadband Guidelines. The new guidelines focus more on technological neutrality principles and
    open access availability, add possible support for ultra-fast broadband networks, and stress
    importance of transparency.
-   General Block Exemption Regulation. The EC has considerably extended the scope of exemptions
    from prior notification of state aid granted to companies. The key improvements are increased
    thresholds, additional categories of aid, simplified conditions to meet GBER requirements.
-   De minimis regulation. Though the exempts aid amounts of up to €200 000 per undertaking over a
    three-year period, remain unchanged, the treatment of small aid measures were simplified. I.e.
    companies undergoing financial difficulties are no longer excluded from the scope of the regulation,
    the definition of what constitutes an "undertaking" has been simplified and clarified, subsidized loans
    of up to €1 million may also benefit from the de minimis Regulation if certain conditions are met.
-   Notion of State aid was explained in details for the first time.
-   Enabling regulation. It introduces new categories of aid that the Commission may decide to exempt
    from the obligation of prior notification and allow the EC to focus more on the most important State
    aid cases.
-   Procedural regulation. It improves the handling of complaints, leading to a swifter, more predictable
    and more transparent investigation of complaints.
The reform also included the revision of Guidelines on aid for research & development & innovation, Guidelines on
environmental aid, Guidelines on risk finance aid, Aviation guidelines.

V.      Broadband specific State aid rules
        5.1. Overview
Better, faster broadband is one of the top priorities in Digital Agenda for Europe, which
constitutes one of seven pillars of the Europe 2020 Strategy aimed at fostering economic
growth.120 The Digital Agenda sets ambitious objectives for broadband infrastructure
development. By 2020 it aims that (i) all Europeans have access to broadband of above 30 Mbps
and (ii) 50% or more of European households subscribe to internet connections above 100
Mbps.121 Ubiquitous availability of access to broadband networks is widely recognized as one of
the most important prerequisites for a knowledge-based society and economic growth.122
“EU Guidelines for application of State aid rules in relation to the rapid deplo yment of
broadband networks” (Broadband Guidelines) together with State aid provisions of the Treaty
and documentation on procedural requirements form the main framework of State aid for
broadband. Deployment of broadband (especially ultra-fast) networks requires significant
investments. 123 Although the EC first tends to rely on private investors and market players, it
recognizes that in some cases support from public sector and public funds will be inevitable. At
the same time it means, that active governmental involvement in the rollout of broadband may
bring a risk of crowding out private investment. Therefore, a State aid control framework was
put in place to prevent this. Until 2009, the State aid for the broadband development was
assessed directly under the State aid rules of the Treaty on a case-by-case basis.124 In 2009, the
EC issued Broadband Guidelines, based on its experience and case practice. The guidelines were
revised in 2013 (came into force in 2014) to be better tailored for achieving the objectives of
Digital Agenda for Europe and to make the State aid granting more transparent and effective.125
Significant amounts of State aid to broadband were approved over the last 5-6 years (see
Figure 21). These amounts, however, do not include all of the government support to the sector,
as not all State measures fall under the definition of State aid and not all measures requires the
clearance from the EC. Since 2009 (after approval of initial Broadband Guidelines) an increase in
approved broadband support measures (in terms of numbers as well as amounts) has been
observed, especially during the period of 2010-1012. According to the EC, until 2011, more than
5 billion EUR of State aid to broadband were authorized, that generated up to 10 billion EUR

    To achieve the objective of access to Internet speeds of above 30 Mbps it is estimated that up to EUR
60 billion of investment would be necessary and up to EUR 270 billion for at least 50 % of households to
take up Internet connections above 100 Mbps. See: http://eur-

estimated investments.126 In 2012 alone, more than 6 billion EUR of State aid to broadband were
approved. The decline in a number of the EC decisions on State aid for broadband since 2014
can be explained by the modernization of State aid (See Box 7). In 2014, the renewed
Broadband Guidelines (as well as GBER, de minimis regulation) came into force with one of the
main objectives to simplify the decision making process and to focus more on the cases with the
biggest impact on the internal market only. As a result Member States were able to support
broadband deployment without going through lengthy notification and verification procedures.
Therefore the Figure 21 shows decreased number of EC decisions in 2014-2015. (See Box 6 for
more information on implications of State aid modernization).

It is also worth mentioning that the majority of State aid measures for
broadband, approved by the EC, fall under 107(3)(c) of the Treaty, i.e. they
are usually considered to be compatible with the internal market, because they
aim at facilitating “the development of certain economic activities or of certain
economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to
an extent contrary to the common interest”.129A guiding principle is – a
broadband deployment activity should be targeted at market failures, i.e. Member

States have to demonstrate the existence of market failures and to make ex ante
assessment if State aid in the particular case will generate more benefits than
potential drawbacks.130 Broadband State aid projects may be implemented in
assisted areas within the meaning of Article 107(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty, i.e.
under the Regional Aid specific rules. In this case, a Member State is responsible
for demonstrating that the conditions of the regional aid rules have been fulfilled.
In general, there are a few common options how State aid for broadband could
be granted. Usually it is either done under the SGEI framework or under the
State aid framework. The latter is more common. Depending on the area covered
by a measure in question, existing level of connectivity and amount of intended
State aid, de minimis, GBER, Regional aid rules or Broadband Guidelines shall
be followed. The options are summarized in the Figure 22.
The decision whether a concrete governmental intervention is compatible
with the Treaty is taken solely by the EC. Therefore, while evaluating or
designing a State aid measure, a Member State first have to consider what is the
principle objective of this aid (which Article it may be compatible with) and which
guiding rules it has to follow. Since the Broadband Guidelines form the
fundamental reference for State aid assessment for broadband, the requirements
of it will be analyzed first, followed by short description of other options.

        5.2. Broadband Guidelines
The Digital Agenda for Europe sets ambitious broadband targets and requires EU Member
States to implement equally ambitious national broadband plans defined by their own
National Broadband Strategies.131 When setting their own national broadband targets, Member
States generally were following the ones set at the EU level. The same could be observed in the
Western Balkans where most of the countries are following the EU approach when it comes to
broadband targets setting (Figure 1).
However, similarly to the EC, Member States recognize that investments in broadband
networks, particularly in Next Generation Access (NGA) networks, may require some public
support in order to achieve national and EU targets. The cost structure of broadband
deployment is such that usually there are regions within a given country (in particular those with
a low population density) that lack a rollout of broadband infrastructure (especially NGA) if to
rely on private investors only. In other words – it may be considered as a market failure.
Understanding that State aid for broadband may help: i) to implement common EU objectives
and ii) to correct market failures, the EC allows (at the same time setting strict rules) State
intervention into the market. A guiding principle, however, is that any State intervention should
be limited as much as possible, in order to minimize the risk of crowding out or replacing private
investments, of altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately of distorting
competition.132
After clarifying what constitutes State aid, the Broadband Guidelines set out the conditions
under which aid could be declared compatible. First, it sets seven necessary conditions that
every measure in question has to comply with. “Failure to comply with one of the following
conditions will result in declaring the aid incompatible with the internal market.”133 The
conditions are provided in Table 4.

instrument                               proposed measure must be an appropriate instrument at
                                         the same time being the least distortive to competition. The
                                         chosen measure must be duly assessed and justified ex
                                         ante. The EC stresses the importance of avoiding
                                         duplications or incoherence between different schemes and
                                         coordination between different authorities (e.g. NRA,
                                         Competition Authority and etc.).

Existence of incentive effect            Member States must demonstrate that broadband
                                         investments would not be done without State intervention.

Aid limited to the minimum necessary     Suggested measure should be proportional.

Limited negative effects                 Suggested measure must be the least distortive to
                                         competition and competitors.

Transparency                             Aid shall be awarded in a transparent manner, requirements
                                         for transparency are specified in Broadband Guidelines.

The second step is the so-called balancing test. It weighs the positive impact of the aid measure
against its potential negative effects such as distortion of competition or trade.134 If the negative
effects outweigh the benefits, the EC may not approve it or ask for remedial action.135 The
balancing test is performed for every suggested State aid measure. Examples of such evaluation
may therefore be found in every EC’s decision on State aid for broadband.136
The third part of Broadband Guidelines goes into details on the assessment of State aid for
broadband. For the purposes of the assessment, the EC makes a distinction between Basic and
NGA networks and identifies three types of existing level of connectivity. The distinction is
important, as different requirements for State aid measure will apply in each case (See

         Basic and NGA networks. Asymmetric digital subscriber lines (up to
          ADSL2+ networks), non-enhanced cable (e.g. Data Over Cable Service
          Interface Specification 2.0, DOCSIS 2.0), mobile networks of third
          generation (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, UMTS) and
          satellite systems are considered to be basic broadband. NGA networks
          are: “(i) fibre-based access networks (FTTx); (ii) advanced upgraded cable
          networks (DOCSIS 3.0); and (iii) certain advanced wireless access
          networks capable of delivering reliable high speeds per subscriber”.137
         Types of areas that may be targeted depending on the existing level
          of connectivity. The areas may be classified into “white, “grey” and
          “black” areas according to the current level of broadband provision –
          where white indicates no network (currently and in the near future138), grey
          indicates one existing network and black indicates that more than one
          network exists. Different requirements apply to each area. To sum them
          up, in white areas it is easier to satisfy requirements than those in grey or
          black areas where the market already provides a service and the potential
          for distortion of competition greater. Black areas in general are considered
          to be as not requiring State intervention. The exception may be done in
          the case of ultra-fast (well above 100 Mbps) broadband networks.
The Broadband Guidelines then set down a number of design features required in all
measures in order to limit distortions of competition. These include a detailed mapping and
coverage analysis, public consultations, an open tender process, acceptance of most
economically advantageous offer, technology neutrality, use of existing infrastructure where
possible, wholesale access to third parties for at least seven year at prices estimated using
benchmark and a claw-back mechanism139 to avoid over-compensation.
Additionally, the guidelines set obligations which will apply when granting State aid for NGA
networks. The EC specifies, that in the case of NGA deployment support, a State aid measure
should not only comply with seven general requirements (Part I in Table 5) and features to limit
possible distortions (Part II in Table 5), but also has (Part III in Table 5) stricter wholesale access
and non-discrimination requirements. The guidelines also cover the exceptional circumstances
in which State aid to ultra-fast broadband networks might be permitted (Part IV in Table 5).

    Near future is considered to be 3 years period, according to the Broadband Guidelines.

    Claw-back refers to the repayment of any excess aid that may have been granted to a
beneficiary.

        5.3. Support of broadband networks deployment under
             Regional aid or SGEI frameworks
As indicated in Figure 22, State aid for broadband deployment may also be granted following
Regional aid guidelines140 or SGEI framework141 provisions.
Aid to broadband infrastructure may be considered as the aid for an initial investment and it can
be assessed on the basis of the compatibility conditions set out in the Regional aid guidelines. 142
Besides general conditions laid down in the Regional aid guidelines, broadband support
measures shall comply with the following conditions: (i) aid should be granted only to areas
where there is no network (and will not be developed in the near future) of the same category
(either basic broadband or NGA); (ii) the subsidized network operator offers active and passive
wholesale access under fair and non-discriminatory conditions with the possibility of effective
and full unbundling; (iii) aid should be allocated on the basis of a competitive selection.143
The deployment and the operation of a broadband infrastructure can also qualify as a SGEI (see
the first part of the paper). Broadband deployment as a SGEI should normally be based on the
provision of a passive, technologically neutral and open infrastructure that provides universal
service coverage for the given area.144 Four Altmark criteria should be also fulfilled (see Box 5).

        5.4. General block exemption regulation (GBER) for
             broadband
As discussed in Section 4.4 of the paper, State aid measures may be exempted from
notification if it is granted in conformity with the conditions of the GBER. This also applies for
broadband support measures. In particular, the GBER allow investment aid for broadband
infrastructure up to 70 million EUR of total costs per project. It is also important to stress, that
the GBER covers aid to “white” and “white NGA” areas (i.e. no broadband operator exists and is
not likely to occur within the next three years), but excludes exemption for aid to “grey” and
“black” areas. The requirements of an open tender for selecting the beneficiaries of aid, fair and
non-discriminatory wholesale access to the supported network and full and effective unbundling
to ensure maximum competitive benefits are set in the regulations.145 A detailed list of
requirements for broadband aid set in the GREB are provided in Box 8.
The GBER also allow support to broadband projects under regional aid conditions, if the
investment takes place in an assisted area and aid intensities established in the regional aid
map are not exceeded. Regional investment aid should not exceed 100 million EUR and shall
fulfill the same three conditions: (i) aid should be granted only to areas where there is no

fair and non-discriminatory conditions; (iii) aid should be allocated on the basis of a competitive

provisions on regional aid will apply as well.

           5.5. Summary
Typically State aid for broadband is evaluated and analyzed in compliance with Broadband
Guidelines. Unless it satisfied the GREB provisions for broadband or de minimis146 regulation,
State aid for broadband can also be treated as Regional aid and evaluated under Regional aid
regulation. The notification in this case is not necessary if a State aid measure in question fulfills
GREB provisions on regional aid or, again, satisfies de minimis regulation. Finally, if broadband
deployment is considered to be SGEI, requirement of SGEI framework will apply.
The notification of Broadband support measures is also not necessary, if i) four cumulative
definition criteria are not met (see Section 4.1 of the paper) or ii) State aid is granted under
existing scheme, i.e. the EC has approved a scheme allowing aid for broadband infrastructure
and aid is granted in conformity with the conditions or approved scheme.147

VI.       Case studies
          6.1. Choice of case studies
The objective of this part of the report is to identify and analyze selected cases of State aid in
the EU, which may demonstrate valuable lessons for Montenegro. As there is a great variety of
approved State aid to broadband measures148, five country cases were chosen for this purpose.
These are as follows:

      -   Croatia. It was selected as a neighboring country, which jointed the EU
          relatively recently and got the EC clearance on its State aid measure just
          a few months ago. A recent experience with the aim to become an equal
          member of the EU may bring some valuable insights for Montenegro.
      -   Finland. Very often population density is considered to be one of the most
          important obstacles for smooth broadband deployment. It is because in
          such a case the deployment of broadband networks (especially in rural
          and sparsely populated areas) requires high investments, whereas a
          potential revenue for Internet Service Providers is low. Finland was
          chosen as a country with the lowest population density in the whole EU to
          see how it is addressing the broadband coverage gaps. Montenegro has
          the lowest population density in the Balkan region, therefore the issue
          should be taken into account in the preparation of broadband deployment
          plans (targets) and/or State aid measures.
      -   Sweden. The country was chosen due to its approach to broadband
          deployment, where the biggest initiative to deploy high-speed broadband
          networks comes from local municipalities. Facing a challenge of
          connecting any local fibre networks, the country has also chosen to use
          utilities infrastructure for backbone network throughout the country. As
          utilities in Montenegro are engaged in fibre sharing activities, the country
          may also consider Sweden’s experience to extend broadband availability.
      -   Lithuania. For seven years in a row, Lithuania has had the leading
          position in Europe in terms of the fiber-optic penetration. Obviously, there
          are many factors influencing this result (like competition in the market,
          prices, demand and supply for ICT services), although it is important to
          see if and how State resources are being used to contribute to this
          success. Additionally, Lithuania’s population density (47 people per sq.
          km. 149) is similar to the one of Montenegro (46 people per sq. km 150),
          though GDP per capita is more than twice higher. GDP per capita is an
          important indicator for two main reasons: first, if regional aid is considered

      -     Romania. The country was chosen, as it has one of the lowest
            incumbent’s broadband market shares in the EU (26% vs 40 % in the EU
            on average, as of 2015) and a dynamic competitive environment. It also
            has one of the lowest GDP per capita in the EU. Nevertheless, public
            funds are still being used to deploy broadband networks.
      -     Netherlands (the case of broadband network in Appingedam) - as this is
            the only negative EC decision on State aid so far.
For the analysis of case studies, we indicated several main questions that would help to see
State aid to broadband from different perspectives.

                                    Does it cover “white”, “grey” or “black” areas?

2         Technologies              Does a measure in question support:

                                       - Basic broadband
                                       - NGA
                                       - Ultra-fast NGA?
3         Part of network           Does a measure in question support the deployment of:
                                                               152
                                       - Access network
                                       - Backhaul network
                                       - Core network
4         Market failure            How a market failure is justified?

5         State involvement         What kind of State involvement is foreseen in a suggested
                                    measure?

                                        -    Direct (when State decides directly invest into
                                             broadband infrastructure and the ownership and
                                             operation activities belongs to the State. Usually it is
                                                                                      153
                                             implemented in the form of public DBO )
                                        -    Indirect or Gap funding (when State only provides
                                             finances for the deployment of the network, the
                                             ownership, implementation and operation belongs to


151
    According to the EC, to be eligible for regional State aid, the GDP per capita in purchasing
power standards (PPS) in a region should be equal to or less than 75% of the EU average.
Maximum aid intensity would also depend on GDP per capita in the region.
152
    Roll-out of access infrastructure - This is probably one of the most common type of intervention in the
basic broadband field, with public funding being used to roll out the missing last-mile infrastructure. See:
http://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/cpn/2011_1_10_en.pdf

    Public design build and operate – the public sector constructs the network itself, retaining
full control and offering services on a retail or wholesale basis.

      scope                      financing scheme?

7     Financing option           In what form State aid will be transferred to beneficiaries (e.g. loan,
                                 direct grant, tax exempt)?

In designing a State aid measure, responsible authorities first have to find answers to the first
four questions. According to the EC practice, the best way in doing this is to undertake mapping
exercise, followed by public consultations with market players. Where possible, the link to the
results of this exercise will be provided.




154
    Private design builds and operates– a private company receives funds (often a grant) from
the public sector to assist in network deployment, but the private company retains full ownership.
155
    Public outsourcing – a public sector body outsources network build and operation to the
private sector under a long-term agreement, but the public sector body retains ownership of the
network.
156
    Joint venture – public and private sector bodies both retain a stake in the networks

Croatia has been chosen for a case study, as a neighboring country, which recently received
clearance from the EC for its suggested State aid to broadband measure.
National targets. In its Strategy for Broadband Development in the Republic of Croatia for 2012
– 2015157 Croatia has set two main objectives concerning the coverage of broadband networks,
i.e. the country aimed that by 2015 to acheive:

      i)        Coverage of fixed broadband (over 30Mbps) for at least 35 % of
                inhabitants;
      ii)       Coverage of total (fixed and mobile) broadband connectivity (over 30
                Mbps) for 50% of inhabitants.
      iii)      500,000 fixed connections (subscriptions) with a speed over 30
                   Mbps158.

In November 2014 for the review of the Strategy was set up a working group for preparation of
a new Broadband Development Strategy 2016-2020. The current Strategy for Broadband
Development until 2020 has the following main objectives:

157
      http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=4848
158
      ~12% of population or ~26% of households

                                                                                            56
        “- coverage with Next Generation Access Networks (NGA), which enable Internet access
        at a speed exceeding 30 Mbit/s for 100% of the Croatian population;
        - 50% of Croatian homes using Internet access at a speed exceeding 100 Mbit/s or
        more”.159
In other words, Croatia transposed broadband targets of the European Digital Agenda, which is
the case for most EU Member States.
Broadband market. According to the EC, in 2015 fixed broadband coverage in Croatia was 97%
of households. Fixed broadband connections were available to 81% of households in rural areas
(91% of European households in rural areas). NGA coverage in Croatia amounted at 57% of
households (when EU average was 71%).160
Fixed broadband take-up in 2015 was 70% of households, almost the same as the EU average
(72%). However subscriptions to broadband services over 30 Mbps constituted only 2.8% out of
total fixed broadband subscriptions (or 2 % of households), compared to 30% in the EU on
average (see Figure 23).161 One of the possible reasons for the low take-up (subscriptions) might
be affordability, since the standalone fixed broadband subscription in Croatia costs as much as
2.5% of the average gross income, when the overall EU average was 1.3%.162 Another reason is
likely to be that predominant technology in Croatia’s fixed broadband market remains to be
xDSL (see Figure 24). Without the upgrade of the access infrastructure higher speeds cannot be
ensured.

In its strategic documents, Croatia has foreseen that broadband access in areas lacking sufficient
commercial interest for investment may be achieved through targeted projects at the regional
and local levels. State’s financial incentives partially provided through the EU funds, i.e. State
aid, was one of the financing options.

Notified State aid measure. In fact, Croatia has developed two national programs for NGN
development: i) for access and ii) for backhaul.163 Both programs are intended to be
implemented in parallel at the same time period until 2023. In April 2014, Croatia pre-notified to
the EC services the program for NGA deployment, and in February 2015 - the program for
backhaul broadband infrastructure covering State aid for backhaul part of NGN. The final
decision for the latter one has not yet been taken at the time of writing this report. However, in
March 2016, the EC approved Croatia’s State aid measure for NGA, which is reviewed in the
following paragraphs.
The main aim of the State aid measure. The measure aims to promote the development of NGA
networks in Croatia.

                                      Target areas are mainly rural or suburban.

3     Part of network                 NGA

4     Market failure                  Lack of investments into NGA networks in rural and suburban
                                      areas.

                                      Until mid-2013, investment into NGA broadband
                                      infrastructure was limited to parts of large cities, such as
                                      Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. The incumbent made known
                                      its plans to invest in the upgrading of active network
                                      equipment in its existing exchanges only (offering 30 Mbps
                                      speeds), meaning that these services will be available to 32,5
                                      % of households (or 16% of the Croatian population). Beyond
                                      this, the incumbent did not express any intention to invest
                                      into the deployment of new and/or upgrade of existing
                                      network.



                                      As stated in the EC decision of the State aid measure,
                                      “because telecom undertakings have not been willing to
                                      invest in NGA networks in sparsely populated areas or in
                                      deprived areas in cities, 75.3% of the population of Croatia


163
    The EC cleared the measure concerning the access NGA network and is now evaluating the
backhauling network. Because Montenegro lacks of NGN backhauling as well as of access NGA
infrastructure it maight be a relevant example.

                                                                                                     56

                                         less than 30 Mbit/s.”

5       State involvement                State aid measure in question foresees three options.

                                         Three main investment models may be used within the
                                                165
                                         program :

                                          -    private DBO model: a private operator is
                                               responsible for the design, building and operation
                                               of the network and is the permanent owner of the
                                               developed network.
                                          - public DBO model: public sector is responsible for
                                               the design, building and operation of the network
                                               and the developed network will permanently remain
                                               in public ownership.
                                          - public-private partnership (PPP): in the context
                                               of projects for building of broadband access
                                               infrastructure, a private partner in the PPP model
                                               usually takes the responsibility for design, building,
                                               operation and management of the network, and in
                                               practice also partially finances network building (the
                                               remaining part of the network financing is ensured
                                               by a public partner, fully or partially, through state
                                               aid).
                                         As the intension is to involve local administrative authorities
                                         (municipalities) into the implementation of the program, the
                                         concrete investment model and State’s involvement will vary
                                         case-by-case. The guiding principle is to keep State’s
                                         intervention at minimum possible level to avoid competition
                                         distortions.

6       State aid measure’s scope        A financing scheme.

                                         The measure is designed as a national scheme – ensuring
                                         consistency and coordination of local initiatives at national
                                         level. It will serve as an umbrella State aid scheme, providing
                                         guidance to local municipalities.

Compliance with Broadband Guidelines. The decision regarding Croatia’s State aid measure was taken
in 2016. The notification took place in 2015, meaning that the measure in question had to follow the
requirements of the renewed version of Broadband Guidelines. As Croatia intends to support NGA with
speed up to 40 Mbps, the designed State aid measure had to comply with requirements of Part I, Part II and
Part III in

Contribution       to   common    √   National broadband targets are in line with European Digital Agenda
interest                              targets.

Absence of market delivery        √   Lack of investments into NGN networks in rural and suburban areas.
due to market failures

Appropriateness of State aid      √   Croatia demonstrated that without further public intervention, it
as a policy instrument                would seem impossible to national objectives.

Incentive effect                  √   Authorities showed that the investment would not be made within
                                      the same timeframe without the aid, which produces a change in

                                      incentive effect.

Aid limited    to       minimum   √   Croatia has designed the measure in such a way as to minimize the
necessity                             State aid involved and potential distortions of competition. In other
                                      words, the requirements of Part II and Part III of Table x are fulfilled.



                                      The Croatian authorities have undertaken a mapping exercise, i.e. a

                                      based on the Croatian NRA’s (HAKOM’s) interactive map of
                                      availability        of           broadband            infrastructure:

                                      existing infrastructures that could be used for broadband rollout to
                                      encourage the use of existing infrastructure.

                                      After a mapping exercise a national public consultation took place.
                                      The second public consultation is foreseen to be carried out by local
                                      authorities before the start of implementation of each project. The
                                      tender documents for them must be technology and provider

Limited negative effects      √     The measure is confined to deploying a network in NGA white areas,
                                    where no operator is willing to invest. The subsidized infrastructure
                                    therefore brings new capabilities and limited negative effects.

Transparency                  √     As indicated, all relevant documents shall be published at NRA
                                    website.

Results. As the EC just recently approved the suggested State aid measure, the results are not
yet available. However, it demonstrated the ability of the Croatian authorities to design a proper
State aid measure.
Montenegrin authorities may use it as one of the examples, if they decide to use an umbrella
principle (active involvement of local authorities, supervision of national authority) for financing
broadband deployment. The main concern in choosing this approach may be competencies of
local authorities, i.e. if local municipalities in white areas have enough awareness in preparation
and management of projects for the development of broadband infrastructure in their
communities.

Finland has been chosen for a case study, as it has almost absolute basic broadband coverage169
and never used public funds to finance it. The support to basic broadband has not been
considered necessary (as universal basic broadband coverage could have been achieved by
market forces complemented with regulatory measures). However public funds have been used
to achieve the goal of universal NGA coverage. Furthermore, it is a country with the lowest
population density in the EU, which makes broadband deployment business cases even more
complicated.
National targets. In 2008, the Finnish Government approved a national Plan of Actions for
improving the infrastructure of the information society. The plan had set targets for years 2010
and 2015. Finland aimed that:



169
   Finland was one of the first countries in the world to define basic broadband as connections
with speed of at least 1 Mbps. In 2010, it introduced a universal service of 1 Mbps to ensure full
coverage with basic broadband. In 2015, the Finnish Government decided to double the required
speed and to have the universal service broadband speed doubled to 2 Mbps from the beginning
of November in 2015. A long-term goal is to increase this speed to 10 Mbps by 2021.

                                                                                                56
      -   By 2010 country had almost absolute coverage of basic broadband
          services with a minimum average downstream rate of 1 Mbps;
      -   By 2015 country had almost absolute coverage (more than 99 % of the
          population) of NGA with a minimum average downstream rate of 100
          Mbps.

Finland was not considering to use public fund to achieve the first goal; as basic broadband was
included into the scope of USO, i.e. the universal service provider shall provide basic broadband
services to end users at a reasonable price. State aid measure was designed to achieve the
second target related to the high-speed broadband.
On 17 February 2010, Finland notified a State aid measure “High-speed Broadband Construction
Aid in Sparsely Populated Areas of Finland”170. The EC approved the measure by decision of May
2010, amended by decisions of September 2012 and February 2014. Finally, the measure was
prolonged by the EC decision of December 2015. Before the notification of this particular
measure, State aid measure for high-speed broadband pilot projects in Finland was approved.171
It covered 10 pilot projects, on the basis of which the analyzed State aid measure was designed.
Broadband market. According to the data of the EC172, fixed broadband is available to 97% of
Finnish homes, which is remarkable given the geographical characteristics of the country and
the definition of basic broadband. Fixed broadband connections were available to 91% of
households in rural areas (71% of European households in rural areas). NGA coverage amounted
at 75% of households (when EU average was 71%).
Finland has the second most affordable broadband in the EU (the first place belongs to
Lithuania). However, fixed broadband take-up is only 59% of households, compared to 72% in
the EU on average.



At the same time it should be noted that Finland is the number one in the EU in mobile
broadband take-up (see Figure 25 ).

nearly all residential, business and public users were no more than within 2 kilometers’ reach to
a fibre, cable or other by capacity and other characteristics equivalent network.

                                     Finland is a sparsely populated country with around 5.5 million
                                     people. It is the most sparsely populated country in the EU,

                                     commercial operators are to provide NGA coverage for 95% of
                                     the country, but the remaining 5% of the population may be

                                     covered only with the help of public funds.    The State aid
                                     measure analyzed in the following paragraphs is dedicated to
                                     provide NGA coverage in these 5%.

                                     operate a network in the area specified in the tender. The
                                     additional requirement was that the selected operator will
                                     have to provide retail services to end users (through its own
                                     retail branch or by entering into agreement with other
                                     operator) for 10 years after the last payment of the aid.

                                     The measure is designed as a national scheme – ensuring
                                     consistency and coordination of local initiatives at national
                                     level. It will serve as an umbrella State aid scheme, providing
                                     guidance to local municipalities.

Compliance with Broadband Guidelines. The measure was notified to the EC in 2010. This
means that it had to comply with the older version of Broadband Guidelines. Though the
renewed version added some additional features, the main guiding principles and requirements
for State aid to broadband remained the same.

Results. The implementation of the Finnish Broadband Measure started immediately after the
EC’s approval in May 2010. In approximately 230 projects the Finnish authorities managed to get
to the stage of the selection procedure for building the broadband networks. However, half of
the selection procedures were unsuccessful due to the lack of applicant operators interested in
building the subsidized networks. Operators displayed a lack of interest in building new
broadband networks there, despite the available public subsidies. Therefore, the aim of the first
amendment of the measure was to increase the aid intensity (amount of the possible subsidy)
and improve access to finance.180 Additional 28 million EUR were dedicated by the Finnish
government, aid intensity increased, prepayment for operators introduced and new financing
instruments, like loans, guarantees and interest subsidies were included into the State aid
measure. These amendments were justified and approved by the EC.
The main reason for the second modification of the State aid measure in question was to
increase the threshold of State aid claw-back mechanism from 1 million EUR to 10 million EUR
per project. Finnish authorities, again, were aiming at reducing the administrative burden for
participating operators. This amendment was notified to the EC in November 2013, i.e. when
renewed Broadband Guidelines have entered into force, meaning that in assessing the amended
scheme, the EC applied Broadband Guidelines of 2013. The EC decided not to raise objectives, as
the measure was designed well enough to fulfill the requirement of renewed Broadband
guidelines.
As according to the initial evaluation, 130 000 Finnish subscribers had to be reached by
subsidized NGA networks in sparsely populated areas in order to reach the initial objective (99 %
of population by 2015), by the end of 2015 Finland roughly was on its midway. Therefore, Finish

prolongation.181
By the end of 2015 the approved State aid measure provided182:

      -   a total of EUR 72.3 million of state and EU aid has been granted for the
          building of broadband networks;
      -   17,300 km of broadband network has been built;
      -   about EUR 4.2 of state and EU aid has been granted per built network
          meter;
      -   about 27,000 new optical fibre lines have been established (77% of them
          had a connection speed of 100 Mbps);
      -   the networks provide access for 70,000 subscribers.

Sweden was chosen for a case study for two main reasons. The first one – Sweden is one of the
leading FTTx countries in Europe. According to the latest data of FTTH Council, in terms of
penetration, while Lithuania (a separate case study is dedicated to it) is number one in the
ranking with a penetration rate of 36.8%, Sweden is quickly caching up (35.2%) and stands at the
3rd place.183 The second reason is the unique approach of Sweden, when local municipalities for
a long time already are important (if not the main ones) drivers for broadband deployment. A
recent OECD study recognizes, that the extensive municipal broadband development across
Sweden has contributed to a remarkably high level of nationwide fiber penetration.184 There are
some 200 metropolitan networks in more than 100 towns owned and run by the local
authorities. According to the OECD report, municipal networks accounted for 23% of the fixed
broadband investments in Sweden during 2014.185

However, the contribution of national government is also important in terms of attributed funds
and infrastructure sharing encouragement. Swedish government assigned Svenska Kraftnät, a
national electricity utility company, to build a backbone network to link all of Sweden’s
municipalities on commercial grounds.186 Furthermore, to assist the government’s broadband
objectives, the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) is likewise aiming to offer
wholesale access to its extensive fibre broadband network, plus colocation in its ducting along
its road network, both in existing ducts and in new construction or reconstruction of roads.187
To sum it up, the Swedish broadband expansion model is based on a state-owned fibre
backbone and is combined with municipal networks.
National targets. The National Broadband Strategy of Sweden aims to achieve the following
objectives:
        (1) By 2020, 90% of all households and businesses should have access to broadband at a
        minimum speed of 100 Mbps,
        (2) By 2015, 40% of all households and businesses should have access to broadband at a
        minimum speed of 100 Mbps and
        (3) All households and businesses should have good opportunities to use electronic
        public services with broadband access.
Broadband market. According to the services of the EC188, in 2015 fixed broadband was
available to 99% of households in Sweden (97% in the EU). In rural areas it covered 94% of
homes. In terms of fixed broadband access technologies, xDSL connections declined for several
years in a row, giving their positions to fibre (See Figure 26).
The EC estimates, that NGN access was available to 76% of homes across Sweden (71% in the
EU). Other sources claim, that 61% of households and workplaces had access to 100 Mbit/s, and
54% of the population had coverage of fibre by the end of 2014.189 21% of rural households able
to access direct fibre by end-October 2015.190 Knowing that Sweden is a country which is large in
area, with the majority of population living in urban area (~ 85% of population live in urban
areas), the results are noteworthy. Similarly to the case of Finland, Sweden also has a very low
population density (24 inhabitants per sq. km.)

It should be noted that Swedish government has recognized the importance of broadband back
in 2000 and decided to provide financial stimulus to broadband deployment by creating a Rural
Development Programme. This was the start of a strong development of fiber networks. Before
the Rural Development Programme there was no real broadband investment in Sweden’s rural
areas due to the lack of commercial interests, and although most areas had DSL, the quality was
an issue.191 The Programme was extended for the periods of 2007-2013 and 2014-2020. As the
Programme foresees State resources to stimulate broadband development in the country, it had
to receive the clearance from the EC. The State aid to broadband within the framework of the
rural development program was notified to the EC in January 2010.192 In 2011, Sweden notified
and received clearance for the increase in the budget of measure in question.193 The budget was
increased one more time in 2013.194



The main aim of State aid measure. Its aim is to help to achieve the objectives of Swedish
Broadband Strategy by increasing broadband availability in rural areas. The measure aimed to
cover both: i) areas where basic broadband is still not available and will not be in the nearest
future – white areas; ii) areas where NGA networks do not exist and will not in the nearest
future – white NGA areas.

                                              themselves in for example a non-profit organization.

                                              comparison with the potential revenues that could be
                                              generated). In such circumstances, the Swedish
                                              authorities foresee the possibility for the project owners

Compliance with Broadband Guidelines. The measure was notified to the EC in 2010. This
means that it had to comply with the older version of Broadband Guidelines. Though the
renewed version added some additional features, the main guiding principles and requirements
for State aid to broadband remained the same.

                                            resources, the Swedish authorities encourage the use of
                                            existing infrastructure. The wholesale access to the

Results. Under the Rural Development Programme in Sweden, a typical local investment project
was initiated by residents and enterprises showing interest and forming into co-operatives or
economic associations.196 They applied to the local authority for support, making significant
contributions by themselves (in a form of investments or work done, e.g. digging to install new
ducts). Municipalities were actively involved as:

      -   They are responsible for providing a majority of public services (potential
          for exploiting synergies);
      -   Have a considerable degree of autonomy, may engage into business
          activities;
      -   Provide e-services;
      -   Regarded by the end-users as reliable service providers.197

Such municipal networks are predominately providing basic (passive) infrastructure, operator
neutral networks, based on fibre technologies, usually having more than one ISP using the
network to provide broadband services to the end users.



There are more than 1000 community broadband networks in Sweden, either under
construction, completed or planning to expand, according to the Swedish Broadband Forum.198
This, together with the fact that the budget of the State aid measure was increased twice, with
the number of applications for the grant money being much higher than anticipated, shows that
Sweden’s Rural Development Programme was successful, which may be measured not only by
kilometers of the networks deployed. The OECD study revealed that at least in the case of
Sweden, a 10% higher fibre penetration is correlated with:

      -   Reduced car use of 135 km per year and inhabitant (250 km for highly
          urbanised municipalities);
      -   1.1% higher employment (1.7% for highly urbanised municipalities);
      -   Increased business creation by one additional company per 12000
          inhabitants per year.199


Sweden is a good example of state support with positive spillovers leading to broader economic
development outcomes. At the same time, it should be noted that many rural broadband
networks in Sweden have been built without governmental support.200

Lithuania was chosen for a case study due to the following reasons. For seven years in a row,
Lithuania has had the leading position in Europe in terms of the fiber-optic penetration.201
Obviously, there are many factors influencing this result (like competition in the market, prices,
demand and supply for ICT services), though State resources were also being used to contribute
to this success. Additionally, Lithuania’s population density (47 people per sq. km.202) is similar
to the one of Montenegro (46 people per sq. km203), though GDP per capita is more than twice
higher.
The history of broadband deployment with support of public resources in Lithuania goes back to
2005. Then, a public non-profit entity “Placiajuostis internetas” was established with the mission
to bring broadband access to unserved areas of the country. In the same year it started to
implement the first project - Development of Rural Area Information Technology Network
(abbreviated as RAIN)204, which initially focused on providing broadband access to public

administrations in rural areas. Later, in 2008, Lithuanian government started discussions about
the need to support further development of broadband networks in rural areas. At that time
only 39% of Lithuanian population was covered by broadband networks in rural areas
(compared to almost 100 % in urban areas). Around one third (1.1 million inhabitants) of
Lithuanian population lived in rural areas, additionally, governmental, educational, healthcare
institutions, libraries, public internet access points, local activity groups, businesses, in total
about 11.000 institutions or entities were lacking a reliable access to broadband internet. This
unmet demand was the main stimulus to initiate a support programme for Development of
Rural Area Information Technology Network. Lithuania notified the initial measure to the EC in
2009 (later it was amended several times: in 2012 expanding geographical scope205 and in 2013
prolonging the duration and increasing the budget206), when the economic downturn in the
country was at its peak. This indicated that the government understood the potential benefits of
broadband deployment for society and economy and was ready to allocate resources to it.

National targets. National objectives for broadband deployment are determined in Lithuania’s
Digital Agenda approved in 2014. The national targets are in line with the European Digital
Agenda, i.e. aims for:

        -       at least 30 Mbps for 100% of the population until 2020 and
        -       50% of households using 100 Mbps or faster internet access until
                2020.

In the areas of broadband development, Lithuania’s Digital Agenda focuses on providing
incentives for investments in broadband infrastructure and intervenes where market operators
fail to satisfy the demand.207
Broadband market. According to the latest EC report, broadband is available to 98% of
households in Lithuania.208 Almost all connections are capable of providing at least 30 Mbps,
which makes Lithuania one of the European leaders in NGA deployment. As in the other Baltic
countries, telecoms operators have been traditionally focused on FTTx deployments rather than
upgrades to VDSL. VDSL technology is absent in the country. As a result, in terms of fixed
broadband technologies, Lithuania may be characterized by relatively low DSL coverage, with
69% homes (with only 15% in rural areas) passed by DSL networks, compared with 94% in the
EU, on average.209 Though, Lithuania’s FTTx coverage has already reached 95% in 2015 and is the
highest in the EU (EU-28 average is 18.7% of homes).210 Although Lithuanian consumers also

The main aim of State aid measure. The main aim is to develop an ICT infrastructure offering
wholesale broadband services in rural areas of Lithuania which are not being served, and where
there are no plans for coverage in the near future. The ultimate goal of the project was to
provide opportunities for residents, public institutions and businesses to use broadband in the
country’s rural areas. In addition, three socio-economic goals were identified:

      -     Reducing of Lithuania’s digital divide by creating favorable broadband
            infrastructure conditions throughout the country.
      -     Promoting competition in the broadband sector through an open-access
            policy of the subsidized network
      -     Accelerating the development of an information society in Lithuania and
            contributing to State‘s economic growth.
The country has chosen to tackle the lack of necessary backhaul broadband infrastructure and
not to invest into the last-mile infrastructure, hoping to create the right stimulus for private
sector to engage into the last-mile provision.

                                  of basic broadband connections is lagging behind in rural and remote
                                  areas. In 2008 rural areas in Lithuania (32% penetration) were far behind
                                  urban areas (99% penetration) in network connectivity. The rural areas
                                  have received little private investment in previous years due to their
                                  commercial unattractiveness (low subscriber density), creating a digital
                                  divide. Although it is important to have wide-spread broadband networks
                                  across the whole country, including rural areas, in order to gain potential
                                  benefits that broadband could bring.
                                  The Lithuanian authorities have identified that the necessary
                                  core/backhaul network infrastructure and capacity were missing across
                                  Lithuania.

   Additionally, a project of broadband infrastructure deployment in Lazdijai and Alytus was
covered by the scheme, however this was a relatively small project (in terms of geography and
funds) compared to RAIN and its extensions

                                        in rural areas.
                                        The EC recognized, that the measures did not narrow the
                                        digital gap between urban and rural areas, therefore the
                                        suggested State aid measure was considered to be appropriate
                                        and proportional.
                                        It was expected that that the creation of a backhaul network in
                                        the unserved areas would reduce the entry barriers for
                                        commercial operators, thereby encouraging them to extend
                                        their broadband network coverage in rural areas.

Has limited negative effects and    √   The Lithuanian authorities aimed to improve broadband
distortions of competitions             availability in rural areas by tackling the lack of necessary
                                        backhaul broadband infrastructure. The network was expected
                                        to offer open wholesale access to third-party operators to
                                        deliver broadband services to end-users.
                                        The Lithuanian authorities conducted a detailed mapping and
                                        coverage analysis to identify the target areas. Operators
                                        provided information about the infrastructure they managed,
                                        to help planning of the fibre routes. In return, Placiajuostis
                                        internetas revealed planned fibre routes to any interested
                                        parties (to avoid duplications and to employ existing
                                        infrastructure).
                                        The built infrastructure may be employed by all operators as
                                        network topology ensures technological neutrality. The State
                                        aid measure is considered to promote development of a
                                        competitive environment, as end user is allowed to freely
                                        choose the service provider and services.

Results. Under the analyzed State aid measure the RAIN-2 project was the main
receiver of allocated funds. However, as it is a continuation of the initial RAIN-1
project, the results are best to be evaluated jointly. See Box 9 for the details of
the results of each project.
Altogether, the infrastructure created during the projects gives operators the
opportunity to provide broadband services in at least 97% of the country’s rural
areas. The infrastructure built during RAIN-1 and RAIN-2 projects is used by 51
operators.216 It reached ~ 1 000 000 inhabitants – 1/3 of Lithuania‘s population,
which was the initial intention of the project, i.e. objectives were achieved.
Changes in broadband coverage during the implementation of projects are
provided in Figure 29. The increased coverage resulted in increased penetration
(see Figure 30). As fixed broadband take-up in Lithuania is still lagging behind
the majority of EU countries, this indicates that even almost absolute coverage of
broadband networks will not necessary mean that objectives of penetration
(subscriptions) will be reached easily. This implies that demand stimulation
measures shall be considered strongly.

Additional lessons that could be learnt from the case of Lithuania are the ones, concerning
project cost control. The RAIN project provides a good example of how to control infrastructure
costs. First, the cables were laid only in the areas where no other cables exist. Second, to avoid
any duplications, the information on the planned routes were shared with the market players.
Third, the fibre connection points were installed in all the settlements that a route passes,
ensuring future connections. Fourth, existing public infrastructure was used, e.g. protective
zones under roads, to minimize the total distance of the cables.
As a result, in 2015 the EC awarded RAIN-2 project as the Winner of European Broadband
Award 2015 in the category on socio-economic impact and affordability219
Box 9 Deployment of broadband networks in rural areas of Lithuania


There are several main phases that may be distinguished in the development of broadband networks in
rural Lithuania:

     1st phase (2005-2008): RAIN -1 project was initiated. The model of public DBO was chosen
      to implement the project. A non-profit public entity “Placiajuostis internetas” was established.
      During this phase it designed and constructed ~ 3400 km of fiber lines, 467 rural settlements
      connected to broadband infrastructure. Total value of the project ~ 21 million EUR.
     2nd phase (2009-2015): RAIN-2 project. The project covered the design and construction of ~
      5800 km of fiber optical lines, 982 rural settlements connected to broadband infrastructure;
      Total value of the project ~60 million EUR.
     3nd phase (2014-2015): “Development of broadband network infrastructure in rural areas”
      (PRIP) project. It aimed at designing and constructing additional 485 km of fiber lines,
      connecting rural 440 entities, like biggest farms, agricultural institutions and organizations, to
      the lines already constructed by RAIN project. Total value of the project ~ 6 million EUR,

       th
      4 phase (foreseen for 2016-2020): the continuation of PRIP project with teh aim to construct
      additional 340 km fiber optical lines and connect additional 400 or more rural entities.

Romania is at the bottom of the list of EU countries in terms of digital performance, according to
the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) – a composite index that summarizes relevant EU
indicators and tracks the evolution of EU Member States in digital competitiveness.220
Connectivity is the DESI dimension where Romania performs best and ranks 23rd among EU
countries (other dimensions like the use of Internet, human capital brings the country at the end
of the total rank). This indicates that the country puts a lot of emphasis on connectivity issues,
compared to others.

The country’s second lowest GDP per capita in the EU, a relatively high proportion of rural
population (~47%), and particular landscape (mountains, plains, hills) are making broadband
infrastructure roll-out more complex and costly. Nevertheless, Romania belongs to the catching-
up group of countries in terms of broadband penetration because, although it still performs
worse than the EU as a whole, it has developed fast over the last year and got closer to the EU
average.221 The case of Romania is even more pertinent to this report, as it has one of the lowest
incumbent’s broadband market shares in the EU (26% vs 40 % in the EU on average, as of 2015)
and a dynamic competitive environment. As a result, Government of Romania even decided to
deregulate fixed wholesale product markets (local and central access). This means that market
and regulatory potential is almost fully exploited. Therefore, the country was chosen to see how
State’s intervention through State aid is helping to get closer to the EU average. In 2014, the EC
approved a State aid measure called “Ro-Net project”, which mainly aimed at deploying
broadband backhaul networks in 783 localities of Romania with no existing or potential
broadband infrastructure.

National targets. With regards to the broadband targets, the Romanian Strategy (National
Strategy for Romanian Digital Agenda 2020222) aims at achieving:

         100% households with fixed broadband coverage by 2020;
         80% households with over 30 Mbps broadband coverage; and
         45% households being connected with subscriptions over 100 Mbps.223

According to the Strategy, NGN infrastructure (backbone, backhaul and access network)
development costs, accomplishing those targets, are estimated to reach the level between 3.1
and 5.5 billion EUR, out of which 0.7 to 1.7 billion EUR is expected to come from public
funding.224 A special attention is given to rural and disadvantaged areas, stimulation of
competition, and promotion of the development of mobile broadband, which is seen as one of
the solution for addressing Romania’s broadband development issues.

Broadband market. Romania lags behind the EU average in terms of overall fixed broadband
coverage on a national and rural level, but performs better than the average with regards to the
availability of NGA technologies. According to the latest EC report, fixed broadband is available
to 89% of households in Romania, compared to the EU average of 97%.225 In rural areas, fixed
broadband coverage services were available to 81% of rural households, compared to 91% rural
homes passed on European level. 226 Meanwhile, NGA connections are available to 72% of
Romanian households (71% of European households), connections based on FTTx technologies
make up the biggest part (53.8% of homes were covered by FTTx networks in 2015).227

Having one of the highest subscription prices228 (an individual seeking to subscribe to a
broadband connection must spend on average 2.7% of his/her gross income, compared to the
EU average of 1.3%, see Figure 27), Romania is one of the leaders of fast (> 30 Mbps) broadband
take-up (63 % of fixed broadband subscriptions are fast broadband subscriptions), as well as
ultrafast (>100 Mbps) broadband penetration (see Figure 31).

least 100Mbps) subscription, July 2015

The main aim of State aid measure. The objective of the State aid measure is to support the
construction of backhaul networks for the use of operators in the areas where broadband
services are not available and there are no investment plans in the near future.

Romania conducted a detailed mapping and coverage analysis to identify the target areas where
State intervention is necessary. It identified areas where no operators offer broadband
connectivity at a speed of above 4 Mbit/s for business users and 1 Mbit/s for residential users.
Out of the initially identified 2,287 rural localities without any broadband infrastructure at all,
783 were selected where the provision of backhaul may result in the development of last-mile
broadband investments. Localities were grouped into 7 regions, and a tender was organized for
7 lots (each per region).

4    Market failure           In Romania, around 47 % of the population lives in rural areas, where the
                              population density is low. Together with economic factors (such as low
                              GDP per capita, low ARPU), it makes these regions very unattractive for
                              private investors. Furthermore, the variety of landscape and complex
                              topology is not favorable to civil works (digging trenches, erecting
                              towers) and makes networks’ deployment costs even higher.
                              Low PC penetration rate and digital literacy reduced even more the
                              attractiveness for investment, creating a significant infrastructure gap
                              between urban and rural areas of Romania.
5    State involvement        Public outsourcing: An open tender, divided into 7 lots corresponding to
                              the grouped regions was organized to select operators to design, build
                              and operate infrastructure.
                              The infrastructure, however, shall remain in public ownership. The
                              infrastructure operators (concessionaires) shall pay a concession fee for
                              the subsidized infrastructure and have the right to retain revenues from

                              Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (EUR 68.5 million) and the remainder
                              from the State budget (EUR 15.5 million).

Compliance with Broadband Guidelines. The notification of Romania’s State aid measure, called
Ro-NET, took place in 2013, meaning that the measure in question had to follow the
requirements of the renewed version of Broadband Guidelines (see Table 16). As Romania
intends to support backhaul networks construction for the delivery of primarily basic broadband
services, the designed State aid measure had to comply with requirements of Part I and Part II of
the                                       Guidelines                                        (see

Requirement                           Compliance

Contribution       to   common    √   By extending broadband coverage to unserved areas of Romania
interest                              the measure contributes to the achievement of greater cohesion
                                      and economic development objectives, in line with the Digital
                                      Agenda.

Absence of market delivery        √   Lack of commercial investments into broadband networks in rural
due to market failures                areas: 783 localities were selected with no broadband coverage and
                                      no investment plans in the near future (3 years’ time horizon).

Appropriateness of State aid      √   Romania demonstrated that without further public intervention, it
as a policy instrument                would seem impossible to national objectives:
                                          Demand –side measures are insufficient to solve the
                                           systemic problems illustrated on the supply side in
                                           Romania's rural areas.
                                          Regulatory measures did not solve the problems related
                                           to the lack of broadband infrastructure and services in the
                                           targeted areas.
Incentive effect                  √   During public consultations operators indicated having no
                                      investment plan in the targeted areas without public support, hence
                                      the aid produces a change in the investment decisions of the
                                      operators. Moreover, open access to subsidized infrastructure to
                                      third party operators is expected to encourage investments in last
                                      mile networks.

Aid limited        to   minimum   √   Romania has designed the measure in such a way as to minimize
necessity                             the State aid involved and potential distortions of competition.
                                      The Romanian authorities carried out a mapping exercise as part of
                                      a broader Feasibility Study. Following several rounds, the country
                                      identified 783 localities with no existing or potential backhaul
                                      network. At least three public consultation rounds were
                                      undertaken along with mapping exercise.
                                      Open and technology-neutral tender, in line with national and EU
                                      procurement rules, was foreseen for 7 lots (regions). The contracts
                                      intended to be awarded to the applicants presenting the most
                                      economically advantageous offer (for each lot), where the most
                                      important award criteria was - the lowest amount of public aid
                                      requested.
                                      Although the measure supports only white areas where no
                                      broadband infrastructure is available, it encourages the use of
                                        existing infrastructure wherever possible. For this purpose, existing
                                        infrastructure and its availability was identified (e.g. towers,
                                        overhead optic fibre, roads, ducts, roofs of existing buildings, other
                                        infrastructure, etc.). The inventory shall be made public on national
                                        regulator (ANCOM) website. A third of the network planned for the
                                        initiative will be built on the basis of support infrastructure that
                                        already exists.
                                        Wholesale services are an essential requirement of the project.
                                        The selected operators will offer wholesale services, i.e. access to
                                        the subsidized networks to other operators in an open, transparent
                                        and non-discriminatory manner for entire concession period (18
                                        years). The price for wholesale access shall be based on the prices
                                        already set by ANCOM for similar regulated (i.e. benchmarked
                                        prices)
                                        The monitoring and claw-back mechanisms are foreseen.
                                        All relevant documentation concerning the State aid measure shall
                                        be published to ensure transparency. Periodical reporting to the EC
                                        services foreseen.

Limited negative effects         √      Given the design of the project, it is unlikely to have a crowding out
                                        effect on potential future investments of private operators.

Transparency                     √      It shall be ensured that the public authorities, economic operators,
                                        the interested public and the EC have easy access to all relevant
                                        acts and pertinent information about the aid.

Results. Fixed line incumbent RomTelecom (an incumbent, in 2014 renamed as
Telekom Romania Communications) and sister mobile operator Cosmote
Romania (in 2014 renamed as Telekom Romania Mobile Communications )229
were selected as the winners of the tender organized by the Ministry for
Information Society. RomTelecom was designated winner for 4 of the lots, and
Cosmote Romania for 3 lots. For the 4 lots, RomTelecom will be financed with up
to approximately 37.2 million EUR, while Cosmote Romania, with up to 27.9
million EUR.

The Ministry gave concession for a period of 18 years to the winning companies.
For this period, two companies will have to ensure the operation and
maintenance of the subsidized infrastructure. It is estimated that the
783 localities covered by the project would ultimately result in some
400 000 residents, 8,500 businesses, and 2,800 public institutions covered by

completion of the project.230

By end-2015, the investments were completed in 99 localities, absorbing EUR 15 million out of
the total budget of EUR 69 million.231 The rest is expected to be completed by the end of 2016
(with at least one year delay).



As the Ro-Net project covers 783 out of over 2000 initially identified localities with no
broadband access, the Romanian authorities are already thinking, how other “white” areas will
be reached in order to achieve national broadband targets by 2020.232

        6.7. Case study: Appingedam, Netherlands

The case was chosen for the analysis, as this is the only one negative EC
decision on notified aid so far.

In 2004, the EC received a complaint from one Dutch cable operator. The complaint concerned
the public funding of a fibre access network in Appingedam, a town in the north of the
Netherlands. At the same time the operator also lodged an appeal in a Dutch court, which later
ordered the municipality to notify to the EC its plans of building network and granting aid. The
Dutch authorities notified the measure to the EC in 2005. The EC initiated an in-depth, which the
aim to analyze whether there could be an objective justification for the public funding.



The main aim of State aid measure. The municipality of Appingedam intended to part fund the
deployment of a fibre access network.

                             needed to address the insuffienet supply of advanced broadband services
                             by supporting the deployment of a fibre access network in Appingedam.
                             According to the municipality, two operators provide broadband access
                             in Appingedam, but they do not provide “advanced broadband services”.
                             The municipality decided to participate financially in the project.

5    State involvement       The passive layer of the planned fibre network (rights of way, ducts,
                             fibres, etc.) would be owned by a public foundation set up and controlled
                             by the municipality.
                             The concession for the active layer was expected to tender out.

Compliance with State aid rules. The EC considered the Dutch broadband market at that time as
being one of the most advanced in Europe in terms of service coverage, innovation and
competition. In Appingedam, broadband offers are already provided over two existing networks
(KPN and cable), at prices similar to those of other regions of the Netherlands. Consequently,
the construction of an additional network with state funding would address neither a market
failure nor a cohesion problem. The EC considered that the planned aid would distort
competition and harm private investment to an extent which would outweigh the positive
effects of the project. The measure was considered as not fulfilling the criteria for granting aid to
the development of certain economic activities or regions (Article 107 (3) (c) EC Treaty).



Results. The EC has decided to prohibit public funding for the planned
construction of a fibre access network in Appingedam. As the construction of the
network has not yet started, no aid will have to be recovered. This was the first
time that the EC has declared a subsidy for a broadband network incompatible
with the state aid rules.233

VII.       Conclusions and Recommendations
 The evaluation of SDIS 2012-2016 objectives reveals that broadband coverage goals were only
 partially achieved (as of March 2016): 79% of population is estimated to have access to up to 10
 Mbps against the target of 100% of population234 and 17% of population is estimated to have
 access to at least 30 Mbps against the target of 50 % of population. As Montenegrin authorities
 are in the process of setting up the targets for the next planning period, it is recommended that
 they first identify the reasons of this moderate performance.
 The results of the analysis performed imply that one of the reasons is may likely be explained by
 a presence of market failure in providing high-speed broadband access, especially in rural and
 sparsely populated areas of Montenegro. The potential market failure was not explicitly
 identified in the current strategic documents and therefore was not addressed, i.e. usually it is
 expected that the maket failure be tackled through the focused State intervention.
 So far, the state efforts have been dedicated to strengthening of the competitive and enabling
 environment, which is important for acceleration of broadband infrastructure investments.
 Among positive developments one could mention the operationalization of the infrastructure
 sharing and ongoing infrastructure mapping activities. Montenegro was also tackling the issues
 of availability of basic (functional) Internet access through establishment of USO and selecting
 Universal Service provider. Those efforts have allowed to accelerate broadband availability and
 adoption in the areas of commercial viability and increase overall availability of the Internet.
 Modest funds, i.e. EUR 1.79 million, were dedicated to the ICT sector development from the
 State budget (one of the smallest dotation per sector); sector was supported neither from EU
 funds nor from the loans. At the moment, however, broadband penetration is reaching its
 saturation point and its growth is slowing down considerably. Addition of new fixed broadband
 connections is low. Those are the indications that limits of commercial viability for broadband
 investments are likely to be approached, and that state support may be required to provide
 high-speed connectivity to the households outside of economically attractive areas.
 Taking into account the above mentioned, the following is recommended:

       -   In-depth analysis of broadband market and existing regulatory framework
           to evaluate the potential of the market to close existing infrastructure gaps.
           In particular, it is recommended to consider the transposition of the EU
           Directive 2014/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on
           “measures to reduce the cost of deploying high -speed electronic
           communications networks”235, which aims at facilitating and encouraging
           the roll-out of high-speed networks by reducing their cost. The Directive

 234
     SDIS goals require a broadband connection to be symmetrical and guaranteed; ADSL
 technology does not provide a symmetrical connection; at the same time connection speed of up
 to 10 Mbps cannot be guaranteed for all the subscriber lines (it will depend of the quality of each
 particular line and its length); therefore the achievement against this goal shall be validated with
 caution.

          includes the measures such as the sharing and re-use of existing physical
          infrastructure, which are expected to create conditions for a more cost
          efficient network deployment.236 Moreover, it significantly facilitates access
          to information: it foresees the right for market players to access
          information on the location and routes of the existing physical
          infrastructure of any network operator as well as on the type and use of
          infrastructure and to an appropriate contact point before 1 January 2017.
      -   It is alo recommended to conduct a detailed mapping and coverage
          analysis to identify the target geographic areas, existing and required
          resources. The Government may consider the development and
          implementation of an interactive map allowing the analysis of investment
          opportunities in infrastructure networks. Such a map could be used as a
          policy instrument that would help, on one hand, to establish right
          objectives for any interventions, and to reduce the cost for operators – on
          the other. Montenegro could consider the experiences already
          implemented in a number of EU countries. Germany, Portugal and
          Slovenia have well established infrastructure mapping tools, while new
          mapping projects are being carried out in several Member States, namely,
          Poland, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary,
          Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and Sweden. Public consultations with
          market players are recommended in order to confirm the presence of a
          potential market failure (if any) and to reveal specific investments plans in
          the nearest future (3 years ahead) per geographic area where the high-
          speed broadband is not available so far (white NGA and or backhoul
          areas). This exercise will help to understand how ambitious new strategic
          objectives may be (in line with Digital Agendafor Europe as in many EU
          countries237 or deviating from it, as in some countries of the Balkan
          region), and what (if any) State intervention will be required to achieve the
          newly identified objectives.
      -   If public consultations confirm the presence of the market failure, a state
          intervention to address it should be considered. State aid measures would
          be more effective when they are part of a more comprehensive strategy,
          containing not only a vision / targets, but also a clear action plan. Actual
          success of the new Strategy will depend not so much on targets set, but
          more on the choice of appropriate means, including legal, regulatory,
          administrative measures, and financial resources. Therefore, it is
          important to have both the necessary resources and tools in place to
          facilitate the rollout of broadband infrastructure.
      -   To make an estimate of the funds required in order to close the
          infrastructure gap and to consider scale and scope of potential State
          intervention. The approximate amount of State aid resources will give an

          indication which regulation of EU State aid framework shall be followed. It
          is advisable first to see if the State aid within the GBER or de minimis238
          regulation may be considered. It is unlikely that the issue of high-speed
          broadband could be efficiently tackled through SGEI. This would require
          the definition of high-speed broadband as a universal service and the
          inclusion of delivery of broadband of target speeds into USO. EKIP has
          designated nation-wide USO relatively recently, i.e. in 2015, following a
          public tender procedure. Crnogorski Telekom A.D. Podgorica was
          designated to offer connections and access to publicly available telephony
          services, including functional internet access at a fixed location. The
          current speeds that are being provided by the universal service provider
          are not close to those foreseen in the SDIS as goals. This means that
          USO, as it is defined today, will not substantially contribute to the
          objectives of the SDIS. The increase of a minimum guaranteed speed
          would require a new tender and substantially greater compensations for
          the provision of such services. This may put potentially inadequate
          financial burden on market players;
      -   To evaluate the availability of public funds. As State resources are scare,
          the use of complimentary funds (direct financial incentives: grants, low
          interest loans) may be considered, together with indirect financial
          incentives (e.g. guarantees, tax incentives) and non-financial remedies
          (e.g. infrastructure sharing obligations for public utilities). However, the EU
          experience accumulated so far239 suggests that the most prevailing form
          of State aid support for broadband is direct grant;
      -   In designing State aid measures, Montenegrin authorities are encouraged
          to make use of EU Member States examples. The recently approved State
          aid scheme for Croatia may serve as one of such examples of a broad
          scheme, allowing a different level and forms of State intervention. The
          example of Finland shows that a State aid measure may be directed to
          very specific areas and only for NGA technologies. Sweden’s State aid
          measure resulted in broadband deployment based on a state-owned fibre
          backbone combined with municipal networks. Lithuania is a good example
          when deployment of a fibre network was dedicated to public entity, which
          now successfully operates the network. It is recommended that the
          Government discuss possible schemes with market players and other
          relevant stakeholders. This would help identify the most appropriate
          design for all of the parties involved in implementation. An ex ante
          assessment of benefits and drawbacks of potential State aid is strongly
          recommended.
      -   Capacity building and adequate legal expertise on state aid matters is
          essential in order to design and comply with complex state aid framework.
          Being an EU candidate country, Montenegro has recently (beginning
238
    Though it is unlikely the possibility to use the de minimis regulation due to the small amount
allowed
239
    at least under notified State aid measures

                                                                                                108
          2016) transposed the majority of EU State aid rules into the national
          legislation, yet it lacks experience in applying them. It is therefore
          advisable to get use of available EU technical experience, among others,
          through the requests for methodological and practical help, e.g. via TAIEX
          instrument.240 Successful implementation of State aid measures will
          strongly depend on competencies of staff dealing with the matter.
          Advance identification of such staff and preparation of training plans are
          strongly recommended as part of the actions foreseen under the updated
          SDIS.
