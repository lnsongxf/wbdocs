EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A. CONTEXT

The country is a leading exporter of information-technology services, including knowledge-
intensive chip design. Yet electronics manufacturing in India is struggling despite a huge and
growing domestic market and pockets of world-class capabilities.

To examine the prospects for India to meet its potential, the World Bank commissioned this study
in May 2013 on behalf of the Chief Economic Advisor, Government of India. Drawing on
extensive survey questionnaires and interviews with key industry players (both domestic and
foreign) and relevant government agencies, this study identifies major challenges India-based
companies face in engaging in electronics manufacturing. The analysis culminates in detailed
policy suggestions for regulatory reform and support policies needed to unblock barriers to
investment in this industry and to fast-track its upgrading through innovation.

While the National Policy on Electronics (NPE) is moving in the right direction, it is only a first
step. Both the Indian government and the private sector would need to join forces and develop a
decisively longer-term industrial development strategy that combines smart regulatory reform and
structural industry support policies.

Surging Demand, Struggling Supply
Electronics manufacturing in India is struggling, despite a huge and growing domestic market and
pockets of world-class capabilities. Local production faces cost disadvantages which constrain
investment in plants and equipment, technology absorption and innovation. Local production is
also disconnected from India’s design capabilities, which are integrated into global networks of
innovation and production, using existing production locations.

Given this, India’s growing domestic demand for electronic products results in rising imports of
final products and high import dependence for key components. Those imports have become the
third most important driver of the country’s record current account deficit, after petroleum (crude
and products), and gold.

Unless this is addressed soon, the sector is unlikely to achieve the targets set for it in the 12th Five
Year Plan: an output of US$120 billion and millions of jobs by 2017. Bold action is required to
initiate a break with the anemic growth of electronics manufacturing, as well as with outdated
patterns of policy responses, particularly in light of fast-changing dynamics in the industry.

Vertical Specialization defines India’s New Manufacturing Imperative
Such a response must take into account, first of all, the new manufacturing imperatives created by
a fast-changing industry, with more change on the horizon. Geographically dispersed networks of
production and innovation have fragmented electronics manufacturing, while product life cycles
have been and are being drastically reduced. The locations that have dominated “high-volume,
low-value” manufacturing have created capabilities to scale up new production lines at speed, but
even they are struggling to keep up with the pace of product change. At the same time, new
advanced manufacturing technologies, especially additive manufacturing (often called “3D
                                                                                                      8
printing”) may facilitate mass customization based on “low-volume, high-value” production, and
challenge existing distributions of competitive advantage.

These trends create an important strategic challenge for India’s electronics industry. Unlike China
and earlier industrial latecomers from Asia, India can no longer rely exclusively on “high volume,
low cost” manufacturing for rapid growth in electronics manufacturing, but also needs to pursue a
niche market strategy that focuses on “higher-value, low-volume” products.

In principle, India seems to be well qualified to address this imperative. Accumulated strengths in
electronic systems and integrated circuit design could provide the basis for such “low-volume,
high-value” electronics manufacturing. However, deep integration of electronic design capabilities
into global R&D networks is paired in India with little integration into the domestic electronics
manufacturing value chain.

In order to reap the benefits of value chain integration, India would need to devise means to link
circuit design and development capabilities that are now trapped within the R&D labs of
multinational corporation (MNC) affiliates, back to India-based companies that serve India’s
domestic markets. That task is made more difficult by India’s fragmented innovation system,
characterized by weak links between education, research and industry, a challenge of which many
in India are acutely aware.

India thus faces domestic challenges that constrain the capacity for the productivity-enhancing
innovation of India’s electronics industry just when the global electronics industry is going through
rapid change that is closing off historical strategies for growth. The industry itself is aware of
these constraints, and policymakers have begun to respond. Before turning to those, however, it
is important to understand the constraints imposed by the global market structure, in particular that
defined by trade policy and global oligopolies.

B. POLICY PARAMETERS

Trade Policy
India’s experience with trade liberalization through international trade agreements has two sides.
Some sectors like information technology (IT) services, car components and generic
pharmaceuticals are often seen to have benefitted from India’s WTO membership. As far as
electronics manufacturing is concerned, however, WTO membership obliges India to ensure
“compliance” of its industrial and innovation policies with increasingly complex trade rules,
constraining India’s options for national support policies that were available earlier to Japan, Korea
and Taiwan.

The most important of these rules are those defined by the Information Technology Agreement
(ITA). It is likely that in India’s experience with the ITA the gains from trade liberalization were
overshadowed by substantial costs, especially stalled or declining domestic production.

India joined the ITA in 1997 from a position of weakness, with its electronics sector liberalized
barely a year earlier and still finding its feet. With an inverted tariff structure in place thereafter,
finished products being duty free but their components not, domestic production had little chance

                                                                                                      9
of building capabilities or investing at scale. This contrasts with China’s approach, which joined
from a position of strength. When China entered the ITA in 2003, six years after India, it was
already the third largest exporter and the fourth largest importer of ITA products.

As a result of India’s entry into the ITA, India’s imports of key electronics products have grown
much faster than domestic production, with the result that imports now account for almost two
thirds of India’s consumption of electronics products. India’s imports grew especially fast for
integrated circuits and other core electronics components, with the result that local value-added of
electronics manufacturing is now down to less than 10 percent.

The inverted tariff structure, coming on top of the early exposure of an unready sector to the full
pressures of a globalized industry, is now being exacerbated by the erection of non-tariff barriers
in developed markets, which may neutralize any positive effects of ITA-induced tariff reductions
in target markets. These trade constraints are further neutralized by the structure of the global
market. That, far from being a field of unfettered competition, has over the last twenty years
become more and more concentrated in oligopolies.

Global Oligopolies
A market segment is said to be controlled by a loose oligopoly when the four largest firms hold
more than 25 percent of sales, and a firm oligopoly when this ratio rises above 50 percent. Over
the last two decades one after the other segment in the global electronics industry has crossed this
threshold, from PC platforms to hard disks to smart phones today. Likewise, a defining
characteristic of India’s electronics markets is that a handful of MNCs dominate as oligopolists
without engaging in substantial domestic manufacturing in India (whether directly or through
contractors), with the exception of low-value-added final assembly.

Of course, oligopolies do not necessarily mean an absence of competition, and often the opposite
can be true (such as Apple and Google/Samsung today). But it is important to understand the
barriers to entry they create for manufacturing in India, whether by themselves or by Indian
challengers.

These MNCs can rely on their extended global production networks to source the relevant products
for the Indian market from their preferred production sites, primarily in China. In addition to cost
advantages, what matters most for MNCs is that they can benefit from the accumulated capabilities
in China for rapid and low-cost scaling up of sophisticated production lines. These capabilities to
scale-up at speed imply Indian firms would not only need to match Chinese prices, but to beat
them, perhaps by as much as 15 percent.

At the same time, global oligopolists can erect high entry barriers for Indian firms who might seek
to enter or re-enter the industry. Global oligopolists can set lower prices than challengers, not only
because they can source the relevant products from low-cost production sites through their global
production and innovation networks, but also because of their control over leading-edge
technology and their superior innovation capacity.

Finally, oligopolistic control gives rise to a “commoditization” of electronics products across the
globe, imposing substantial constraints to local innovation efforts that would seek to address

                                                                                                   10
specific needs of India’s domestic market through “frugal innovation.” Successful entry into those
markets would require quite extraordinary efforts by Indian firms to develop superior business
models and new technologies. For that to happen, both the Indian government and the private
sector would need to join forces and develop a decisively longer-term industrial development
strategy that combines smart regulatory reform and structural support industries.

C. RESPONSES AND RECOMMENDATIONS

These findings are elaborated in detail in the main body of this report, and should not be taken to
mean that international factors dominate domestic ones. The constraints on manufacturing in India
are as much made at home as made abroad, and India’s policymakers and the industry’s
stakeholders have many pathways to overcoming them, at least enough to catalyze growth. In fact,
regulatory reform together with a sustained set of support policies could help to quickly unblock
many barriers to investment and growth in electronics manufacturing.

Many of the elements of such a strategy are known to domestic firms and to policymakers. The
Government of India has already incorporated many in the 12th Five Year Plan as well as the NPE,
which is in the initial stages of implementation.

However, one of the principal findings of a survey of electronics firms is that many remain either
unfamiliar with the NPE, or skeptical of the details of its implementation. On the other hand, a
range of industry associations were involved in its formulation and their leaders did know it
intimately. This may imply that communication within some of the associations needs
strengthening, but also that the next stage in improving industrial dialogue is to complement the
associations by reaching down to firms themselves.

In that vein, this report complements the NPE on two fronts: with specific policy recommendations
that reach beyond electronics to the business environment in general, including specific trade
actions; and fundamental process changes, such as in industrial dialogue, standards and trade
diplomacy, to improve policy outcomes over the long-term.

These implications are summarized under the following three headings. Note that, while discrete
changes in regulation or support policies should be a starting-point, parallel efforts under headings
II and III are required to enhance the impact and sustainability of such policies.

I. Discrete changes in regulation or support policies
1. Necessary first steps: quickly unblock barriers to investment through regulatory simplification
   and national market integration. In particular:
   o Speedy transition to a unified Goods and Services Tax (GST) system, the single most
      commonly cited “reform wish” from electronics manufacturers
   o Drastic simplifications in business regulatory environment, in particular on dispute
      resolution in customs, as well as formal and informal penalties for growth
2. Devise and enforce quality standards on high priority products (e.g. medical devices, set-top
   boxes) to protect against dumping
3. Cut tariffs all the way up the supply chain to remove the inverted tariff structure. This requires
   addressing domestic and international implementation constraints:

                                                                                                  11
   o Conflicts of interest between one segment of the value chain and another, and potentially
      between Centre and States
   o Constraints from existing international trade agreements (see below)
4. Reduce short-term infrastructure bottlenecks, such as power and transportation
   o As part of general reforms in these sectors
   o Through specialized clusters, delivered in ways that respond to organic firm demand to get
      locations right (e.g., through tweaking the Electronics Manufacturing Cluster model)
5. Concerted effort to strengthen both vocational training and curricula for higher-level skill
   development required for electronics manufacturing.

II. Facilitate policy implementation through process changes and institutional innovations
1. Focus, simplify and improve communication through transparent and user-friendly support
   policies (e.g., starting with focused awareness building directly with firms about the NPE)
2. Encourage “industrial dialogues” that involve not only large flagship firms, but also:
   o Young firms that seek to create and commercialize new products and processes
   o University and public R&D labs
   o Industry associations that seek to enhance the scope for such dialogues.
3. Link these participants not only to “talk shops”, but to meaningful, action-oriented committees
   (e.g., review the composition of the assessment committees for the NPE)
4. Strengthen India’s capacity to develop critical technical standards (especially for inter-
   operability) and to improve the management and development of standards-essential patents

III. Overhaul international investment and trade diplomacy
1. Shift the environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) from zero-sum to positive-sum by
   combining:
   o Reduction of de facto barriers to FDI, such as fiscal and policy uncertainty, with
   o Incentives for foreign firms to engage in industrial upgrading, over and above mere final
       assembly,
   o Incentives to integrate India-based electronic design capabilities with domestic electronics
       manufacturing
   o Monitoring and problem-solving processes and institutions to ensure and facilitate such
       upgrading and linking (e.g., through the restructured industrial dialogs mentioned above)
2. Use India’s strong position in the WTO to co-shape the design of a “New ITA” (and other
   plurilateral trade agreements and free trade agreements (FTAs) beyond the entrenched
   defensive positions of the major trading powers
   o Improve the distribution of benefits from international trade agreements through “special
       and differentiated treatment” requirements
   o Request a reform of ITA that reflects that ITA participants differ in their stage of
       development, their institutions, and their resources and capabilities
   o Extend ITA and other plurilateral trade agreements to include technical barriers to trade
       (TBTs) and non-tariff barriers (NTBs)
3. Strengthen India’s participation in international standards development organizations and
   private standards consortia, and its capacity to co-shape the development of important
   international standards for electronics manufacturing.

CONCLUSION

It is clear that India’s electronics manufacturing industry currently lags behind global industry
leaders. Catching up and forging ahead through an upgrading of domestic production and
innovation capabilities therefore poses difficult challenges. Yet India also has enormous potential,
as it can exploit a number of advantages that many competitors lack: a growing and huge domestic
market and private sector, a globally competitive and dynamic information and communication
technology (ICT) services sector, a young, abundant and trainable workforce, the human capital
resources of a formidable global Indian diaspora with deep knowledge and extensive networks in
the global electronics industry and pockets of domestic scientific and technological excellence
which can be leveraged – this is a country that has a space program, as well as nuclear and domestic
missile development programs.

In fact, global transformations in technology and markets that make prior strategies unavailable
may open up alternate strategies that play to India’s strengths, notably its strong base of high -end
capabilities and its large domestic market.

To achieve its potential, though, electronics manufacturing in India needs an adjustment in its
industrial growth model: from one of fragmentation, chasing “high volume, low value” activities,
towards one of integration, with a greater focus on “high value, low volume” and, for high-volume,
on frugal innovation for the domestic market.

The NPE is an important first step on this path. It needs to be communicated more directly to
firms themselves, and its implementation needs to be focused on its key components and sustained
over the coming years. It then needs to be complemented, on the one hand, by reforms beyond the
industry, especially those relating to GST, customs, compliance and inspections; and, on the other,
by process changes, especially the strategic use of standards. But most importantly, it is important
to develop industrial dialogues and public-private partnerships among diverse players in the
industry (including small and medium enterprises) in order to fine-tune the analysis of capability
gaps across the electronics manufacturing service (EMS) value chain in India. Such a longer-term
industrial development strategy needs to complement regulatory reforms, so that barriers to
investment can be reduced. This strategy obviously needs to draw on a deep understanding of the
rapidly evolving technology roadmaps and the dynamics of global competition.

To end with an example, consider medical equipment. Here, India has demonstrated the capacity
for “frugal innovation”, perhaps most famously with the development of General Electric’s low-
cost electrocardiogram (ECG), which subsequently disrupted developed markets. India also has a
wide base of capabilities, from its life-sciences researchers to its pharmaceutical firms.

In one scenario, this medical equipment eco-system could remain fragmented, offered some
incentives but swamped by low-quality dumping. In another, they could be integrated in
permanent groups and committees, shaping international standards for low-cost as well as high-
end devices, with young start-ups released from constraints to growth and foreign MNCs investing
in domestic R&D and manufacturing. At present, there are conflicting signs in each direction. To
take but one small example as of this writing, on the one hand the NPE is pushing the development
of twelve standards for medical equipment; on the other, this must be done still through an

                                                                                                  13
institutional structure such that two Union Cabinet Ministers must discuss the font size on the
labels of such equipment.1

Overall, then, the NPE – and the sophisticated process that has devised it – is a first step in the
direction of the more hopeful scenario, but it urgently needs buttressing with broader reforms and
permanent process improvements that spill over into other domains (particularly trade diplomacy
and standards). With the NPE’s sustained implementation, however, complemented by broader
reforms and process changes, a fast-track for electronics manufacturing in India is possible.

CHAPTER ONE: PROSPECTS FOR INDIA TO MEET ITS POTENTIAL
1. Electronics Manufacturing in India Lags Behind Its Potential
India faces a fundamental challenge. The country is a leading exporter of information-technology
services, including knowledge-intensive chip design. Yet electronics manufacturing in India is
struggling despite a number of advantages that many competitors lack: a growing and huge
domestic market and private sector, a young, abundant and trainable workforce, the human capital
resources of a formidable global Indian diaspora with deep knowledge and extensive networks in
the global electronics industry and pockets of domestic scientific and technological excellence
which can be leveraged – this is a country that has a space program, as well as nuclear and domestic
missile development programs.

Why is it that India keeps lagging behind in this important industry, while other countries which
have started out from a much weaker position have forged ahead and established themselves as
new global players in electronics manufacturing exports? What precisely are the fundamental
barriers that constrain the development of an Indian electronics industry? And what policies are
needed to unblock the barriers to investment in this industry and to fast-track its upgrading through
innovation?

To answer these questions, Chapter One examines the current weaknesses of India’s electronics
manufacturing industry and identifies the strategic challenge in realizing its potential. A defining
characteristic is that struggling supply is unable to keep up with surging demand. Local production
faces substantial cost disadvantages (“disabilities”) which constrain investment in plants and
equipment, technology absorption, capability development and innovation. There is a huge gap
between the rapid growth of domestic demand and the practically stagnant domestic production,
and this gap is projected to increase further (see Figure 1 in Appendix One).

At the current growth rate, the demand-supply gap is projected to increase from US$25 billion in
FY2009 to US$298 billion in FY2020. Such a growing gap is unsustainable – the result would be
an increase in India’s trade deficit to US$323 billion by 2020, equaling 16 percent of GDP.2
However, in order to reach a value of US$400 billion in FY2020, domestic production would need
to grow by 31 percent annually for the FY2009-2020 period.

Given the weakness of domestic production, India’s growing domestic demand for electronic
products results in rising imports, while bottlenecks abound across the industry’s value chain,
causing excessive import dependence for key components. In 2011, imports counted for 63.6
percent of India’s consumption of electronics products, and 51 percent for electronic components.
By 2015, the share of imports is expected to increase to 65 percent and 61 percent respectively.3
According to the latest Ministry of Commerce data, electronic imports have increased by almost

21 percent from FY2011 to FY2012.4 As a result, the electronics industry is the third most
important driver of the country’s record current account deficit, after petroleum, crude and
products, and gold (see Table 1 in Annex One).

1.1. A narrow and eroding domestic component base
A patchy value chain limits the scope for expanding and upgrading India’s electronics
manufacturing industry. While India has significant capabilities in digital integrated circuit (IC)
design, most of these capabilities are not linked to the domestic market.5 India lacks strong
capabilities in semiconductor fabrication, component manufacturing, system design and systems
manufacturing and supply chain management. Each of these weaknesses will be examined in some
detail later in this study.

A particular concern is a narrow and eroding domestic component base. Take printed circuit board
(PCB) manufacturing, an essential building block for any electronic equipment. According to the
India Printed Circuit Board Association, roughly two thirds of India’s PCB market is served
through imports. India has a meager share of 0.7 percent of the world PCB output.6 According to
a PCB industry expert, “it will be difficult for India to compete against volume producers in China
and Taiwan and even those in Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, unless makers are prepared to
spend more than $100 million.”7 In the strategically important telecom equipment industry, PCBs
and a variety of electronic components account for around 90 percent of the product cost. However,
with the exception of cable harnesses and packaging, no components are currently made in India.8

In fact, the liberalization of telecom services has boosted the demand for telecom equipment, but
this has not led to the development of a domestic telecom manufacturing industry. Instead, global
telecom equipment vendors such as Alcatel, Ericcson, and increasingly Huawei and ZTE have
been the primary beneficiaries.

Consumer electronics, the largest segment of India’s electronics market is largely dominated by
MNCs, especially Panasonic, Sony, LG, Samsung. Over the last few years, these companies have
substantially decreased domestic production, and rely now overwhelmingly on imports from
China. Take TV sets, the largest segment of India’s consumer electronics market. With the
transition to LCD TVs, local production in India has virtually stopped. It is important to emphasize
that domestic vendors are even less reliant on domestic production – they almost completely source
from China.9

A particularly telling sign of the status of India’s electronics industry is that India does not even
show up in McKinsey’s list of top-ten countries of global value-added in the electronics industry.10

Finally, FDI in India’s electronics industry has been extremely low, even relative to other sectors
– the industry ranks 26 out of 64 sectors in terms of the cumulative FDI received from April 2000
to April 2013.11

1.2. A challenging resource environment
Only a few years ago, India seemed to be well placed to mobilize the resources needed to unblock
the barriers to investment in electronics manufacturing and to fast-track the industry’s growth. In
2009, for instance, India’s current account deficit (CAD) was US$26 billion (in current US
dollars), and GDP was growing at above 8 percent.

Today, the constraints on government policies are severe. The Indian government faces the
difficult task of bringing the CAD down to US$70 billion in the current FY2013, from US$88.2
billion during FY2012.12 Impacted by the high CAD, the rupee has declined sharply, touching an
all-time low of 68.85 to a dollar in late August 2013. Even though the currency has since stabilized,
the rising cost of crude oil imports and electronics imports is likely to continue to put pressure on
the CAD, as will India’s weak manufacturing capabilities, especially in electronics.

As a result, India now runs a CAD of about 5 percent of GDP and a record fiscal deficit
approaching 10 percent of GDP if state governments’ debt is included.13 In other words, India
faces a serious vicious circle of intensifying economic policy constraints. Of necessity, the analysis
and policy recommendations of this study will need to take these constraints into account.

1.3. Overdue change
Bold action is required to initiate a break with the anemic growth of electronics manufacturing, as
well as with outdated patterns of policy responses. Something needs to change, and it needs to
change soon. In order to identify realistic options for the development of India’s electronics
manufacturing industry, it is imperative first to analyze how much electronics manufacturing in
India lags behind its potential.

Chapter One of this study therefore explores where India stands compared to main competitors.
The chapter first highlights the dual challenge that India faces as a latecomer to the electronics
manufacturing industry. The analysis then sheds light on global transformations in technology and
markets that define India’s new manufacturing imperative; highlights a weak industrial innovation
capacity that constrains productivity growth; and points specifically to the disconnect that
separates manufacturing from India’s design capabilities.

As a latecomer to electronics manufacturing, India is facing a dual challenge. Substantial barriers
to entry (“latecomer disadvantages”) result from being behind in production volume and
sophistication and in the level of technology.14 Such entry barriers include but are not restricted
to:
     Production-related scale economies, including learning economies, threshold barriers and
        economies of scope;
     Barriers related to intangible investments required for developing the knowledge and
        competence base as much as complementary support services;
     Barriers to entry and exit of network transactions, particularly in the context of sourcing
        arrangements for core components;
     Barriers related to customer relations, including market intelligence, sales channels, and
        maintenance and repair;
     And the growing number of regulatory barriers (including standards) which, directly or
        indirectly, affect the costs of entry.

Case studies of latecomer industrialization however have shown none of these entry barriers are
absolute – they can be reduced under certain conditions. Take economies of scale which can
constrain the entry of latecomers for at least three reasons: the existence of learning economies,
the lumpiness of investment and the need to reduce the cost of increasing product variety.15 In
principle, this could be avoided, if the market expanded rapidly, which clearly is the case for
India’s electronics industry.

The distinction between “latecomers” and incumbent “leaders” who have accumulated “first -
mover advantages” goes back to debates among economic historians on how “relative economic
backwardness” in the 19th century has shaped the patterns and strategies of industrialization of
countries such as the US, Germany, Japan and Russia.16 It was argued that, under certain
conditions, economic advantages are conferred on countries which are latecomers to industrial
development. The basic idea is that those who are behind have the potential to make a larger leap.
According to a classical study, “the larger the technological and, therefore, the productivity gap
between leader and follower, the stronger the follower’s potential for growth in productivity: and,
other things being equal, the faster one expects the follower’s growth rate to be. Followers tend to
catch up faster if they are initially more backward.”17 In one of its more sophisticated versions,

this argument contents that, since the cost of changing to each more advanced level of technology
progressively increases, latecomers do have a chance of bypassing industrial early starters.18

In short, India can exploit new opportunities as it is facing fewer legacy constraints to technology
development, strategy and organization (“latecomer advantages”). Most importantly, India could
reap the latecomer advantage of not repeating the public policy mistakes that others made and
learning from the considerable body of knowledge and experience of the East Asian countries over
the past 40 years to develop and upgrade its electronics industry.

3. India’s New Manufacturing Imperative
The plight of India’s electronics manufacturing industry in fact is part of a broader challenge. As
highlighted by the Planning Commission, “…[t]he slow pace of growth in the manufacturing
sector at this stage of India’s development is not an acceptable outcome. … While the services
sector has been growing fast, it alone cannot absorb the 250 million additional income-seekers that
are expected to join the workforce in the next 15 years. Unless manufacturing becomes an engine
of growth, providing at least 100 million additional decent jobs, it will be difficult for India’s
growth to be inclusive.”19

At the same time, drastic gains are required in India’s manufacturing productivity: “…[T]o
increase exports as well as provide its internal market with domestically produced manufactured
goods that compete with imports, India must manufacture a much larger volume of products at
competitive costs and quality.”20

It is important however to emphasize that India, unlike China and other earlier industrial
latecomers from Asia, can no longer rely exclusively on “high volume, low cost” manufacturing
as the main strategic option for expanding its manufacturing industry. This traditional
manufacturing paradigm has ceased to be the only viable strategy for India, and has important
constraints on its viability at all.

Vertical specialization through geographically dispersed global corporate networks of production
and innovation has fragmented industrial manufacturing; product life cycles are being drastically
reduced; and mass customization based on “low-volume, high-value” production is gaining in
importance relative to traditional forms of “high-volume, low-cost” manufacturing.21

Current challenges faced by the global EMS industry illustrate the limits to “high volume, low
cost” manufacturing. Falling PC sales and slowing smartphone sales are squeezing profit margins,
while growth in tablets and servers used in giant data centers are insufficient to compensate for
this loss. Global brand leaders in computing and mobile devices are all experimenting with new
and unfamiliar products – big tablets, small tablets, hybrid notebook-tablets, ultra notebooks and
wearable devices, resulting in a proliferation of new models that individually ship in low volumes.
As a result, profit margins of an EMS provider like Taiwan’s Foxconn are squeezed, since the
company must now spend time testing how best to make each of the above new products and as
massive investments are required in restructuring the company’s product lines.

In short, while “high-volume, low-cost” manufacturing remains important, this traditional form of
electronics manufacturing is facing increasing pressure. At the same time, new opportunities are
opening up for “low volume, high value strategies”. New Advanced Manufacturing technologies,
such as new materials, nanotechnology, and additive manufacturing (often called “3D printing”)
are transforming the economics of industrial manufacturing and innovation, and are challenging
existing distributions of competitive advantages.22 Companies and governments in the United
States (US), the European Union (EU) and in Japan are all searching for ways to strengthen their
capacity for “low-volume, high-value manufacturing” and related services.23

Take “3D printing” (3DP), a group of emerging technologies that create objects from the bottom-
up by adding material one cross-sectional layer at a time, similar to creating an object using Lego
building blocks. 3DP differs fundamentally from established approaches to manufacturing, where
material is subtracted from a larger piece of material - that is, “subtractive” manufacturing.24

3DP may well change fundamentally the economics of industrial manufacturing. Massive cost
reductions in process technology become possible, as 3DP reduces scrap, shortens production
cycles and increases flexibility in design and product development. The result will be a new
geography of industrial manufacturing - assembly lines and supply chains can be reduced or
eliminated for many products that are today sourced from plants around the world and assembled
in specialized global assembly lines.

As a potentially disruptive technology, 3DP could have negative implications for the established
high volume-low value manufacturing model that is focused on export-led growth. As the
technology begins to be perfected and deployed, the production of goods could shift back to
consumer countries, like the US, leading to falling demand for imports from Asian emerging
economies.
This poses a major challenge for high volume, low cost export production factories across Asia,
but especially so in China. According to one observer, the transformation of industrial

might potentially reverse the great transfer of wealth and jobs to Asia brought about over the last
decades by offshore outsourcing of manufacturing.

However, leading Asian exporting countries are not sitting still and are searching for ways to co-
shape the development of transformative Advanced Manufacturing technologies. China for
instance is aggressively developing a complete laser industry chain as a basis for 3DP, covering
crystal, component, accessory, laser, system, R&D, application and service. China also is very
active in new materials, nanotechnology, advanced computing and new energy technology.

From India’s perspective, it is important to emphasize that 3DP is one of the priority targets of
China’s innovation policy, as codified especially in the Strategic Emerging Industries (SEI)
initiative. This includes creating a medium- and long-term development strategy for 3DP,
promoting the formulation of codes and standards, and increasing efforts to support 3DP
technology development and commercialization through special fiscal and taxation policies.26

As a result of those efforts, China today has the fourth largest installed base of 3DP users with 8.7
percent of all industrial 3DP installations.27 According to Luo Jun, CEO of the Beijing-based Asian
Manufacturing Association (AMA), revenues for the 3D printing industry in China are likely to
reach Y10 billion (US$1.6 billion) within three years. A leading industry expert expects that China
may become the biggest 3DP market within three to five years.28

Of particular interest for India’s electronics industry is that the potentially most important
application for 3DP is to produce parts and components for final products. In China, this is
happening right now in the defense and aviation industry for low-volume, high value
components.29

As this study demonstrates, the lack of a vibrant domestic component industry is one of the most
fundamental weaknesses of India’s electronics industry. This raises the question whether India
could catch up in 3DP manufacturing, in order to enable India-based manufacturers to domestically
produce components that otherwise would have to be imported at high cost.
There is no doubt that the costs and risks involved in such technology leapfrogging would be
substantial, given that 3DP manufacturing technology is still at an early stage, with many

unresolved technical problems.30 However, it may be worthwhile exploring to what degree India’s
defense and aviation industries are suited to be early adopters of 3DP.

The basic message is that India’s manufacturing imperative is shaped by emerging new advanced
manufacturing technologies. For India’s electronics industry, this raises an important strategic
challenge: Can Indian electronics manufacturing firms develop the necessary capabilities to
substantially expand their presence in “high-volume, low-cost” manufacturing, while at the same
time pursuing a niche market strategy that focuses on higher-value products that may generate
premium prices and hence enable sufficiently large profit margins to support R&D investment?
Failing to meeting this challenge will pose risks to both the industry and to India’s goals for job
creation, but the key factors driving the challenge are beyond India’s control.

4. Disconnect between Manufacturing and Design Capabilities
In principle, India seems to be well qualified to address this new manufacturing challenge.
Accumulated strengths in electronic systems and integrated circuit design could provide the basis
for such “low-volume, high-value” electronics manufacturing. However, these strengths are
unevenly distributed.

While design skills in India are well developed for digital design, embedded software and reference
board design, they lag behind global standards in analog and mixed signal design. According to
the 12th Five Year Plan Working Group on the Information Technology Sector, Indian electronic
design engineers “[lack] the breadth and the depth of experience, where breadth indicates the
knowledge of all the aspects of a design flow and depth indicates an extensive knowledge of a
particular aspect of the design flow.”31 Of particular concern is that India lacks sufficient
capabilities in end-to-end chip design and, most importantly, in the critically important area of
design-for-manufacturing. Systems management still continues to be driven by the overseas
headquarters of MNCs.

Moreover, India’s thriving integrated circuit design sector remains largely disconnected from the
India market. Most of the design work is done for MNCs and the design is taken back to their
home country, where decisions are made on where to locate manufacturing, many times ending up
in places like Shenzhen.

In short, deep integration of electronic design capabilities into global R&D networks is paired in
India with almost no integration into the domestic electronics manufacturing value chain. For
instance, all major electronic design automation (EDA) tool providers for chip design have large

facilities in India. But all of them are 100 percent focused on export markets. Hence, little of these
capabilities are likely to disseminate within India.

As a result, Indian manufacturing is not benefiting from its rich pool of sophisticated IC design
engineers. This creates a lack of engineering talent for product conceptualization and product
management of the Indian market and for emerging markets. In order to reap the benefits of value
chain integration, India needs to devise a way to link circuit design and development capabilities
that are now trapped within MNC R&D labs back to India-based companies that serve India’s
domestic markets. A related challenge is how to strengthen interactions and knowledge flows
between the MNC R&D labs and India’s university labs and public research labs. At the moment,
these capabilities for innovation and production are fragmented where they need to be connected.

5. A Fragmented Innovation System
The result of this fragmentation is that India’s weak innovation capacity constrains the necessary
growth of productivity gains. As emphasized by the Planning Commission,
       …[t]he lacklustre growth of manufacturing …[is due]… to the low technological depth
       of the Indian manufacturing sector. In India R&D has not been sufficiently exploited
       and needs an overhaul in terms of its focus and its organization. Most Indian
       manufacturing firms appear to be stuck at the basic or intermediate level of
       technological capabilities. Creating conducive environments to increase business
       expenditure on R&D complemented by institutional measures around skill
       development, regulation and standardisation need to be key areas of emphasis.32

The question is then what are the sources of this fragmentation, as they pertain specifically to
electronics manufacturing. Chapter Three of this study will show that for many domestic firms,
inadequate size prevents economies of scale and scope, while high costs of doing business and
complex regulations constrain profit margins and hence investment in production and R&D. In
addition, larger foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and EMSs typically conduct
only final assembly in India, and are reluctant to invest in full-scale manufacturing and R&D.

Industrial research outputs in terms of patents and non-technological innovation, as reflected in
trademark counts, remain limited. No company in our interview sample has developed and
successfully launched a radical breakthrough product innovation over the last three years. A few
companies in our interview sample have introduced new products, but these are based on foreign
technology and include mostly incremental adaptions or derivate product variations. Those
companies however are reluctant to file for patents with the Indian Patent Office, as its response
time is much too slow for the needs of the fast-moving electronics industry. As a corollary, most
companies that we interviewed have not actively filed patents.
Government policies, thus far, have had a mixed impact. Indian government funding of R&D
accounts for more than two-thirds of the total funding sources,33 but it has not been able to
compensate for the weakness of industry R&D. Industry funding of R&D has steadily increased
over the past 20 years, but remains less than a third of the total, whereas in the US and China
industry accounts for more than two-thirds of all R&D funding.

More broadly, compared to US and Asian competitors the Indian Government provides only
limited support for industrial R&D. A significant portion of India’s R&D focuses on support for
its services sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of India’s GDP. India’s pharmaceutical
industry also accounts for a sizable portion of its R&D, while electronics manufacturing is
practically absent from the national R&D scene, with the exception of Bharat Electronics Limited
(BEL), the public sector enterprise.

The most recent Global Innovation Index 2013 provides ample evidence of India’s weak industrial
innovation capacity.34 India ranks 66, out of 142 countries, with a total score of 36.2. China on the
other hand ranks 35, with a total score of 44.7. According to the OECD, “India shows a relatively
low capacity in science, technology and innovation (STI), in comparison to advanced OECD
countries and emerging economies like China.”35

According to the Battelle Institute, a primary source of international R&D data, India’s gross
expenditure on research and development was 0.85 percent of GDP in 2012 (compared to 1.6
percent in China), a figure essentially unchanged since 2000.36 While India is on par with France,
the UK and Russia in its total annual R&D expenditures, it substantially lags not only the US and
Germany, but also Korea and China (Figure 2 in Appendix One). For critical indicators, such as
R&D intensity and the relative number of scientists and engineers, India’s R&D system is stuck
in a lower league, together with smaller countries like Iran, Turkey, South Africa and Malaysia.

India’s industrial innovation capacity today contrasts with its long tradition, with advanced
technology development dating back to 2500 BCE.37 For centuries, India was the world’s largest
economy, producing a third of the global gross domestic product.38 By the end of the 17th century
it controlled a quarter of the world trade in textiles,39 and as late as the 18th century, the British
government dispatched observers to India to study innovations in steel, textiles and medicine.

Today, India’s innovation system is characterized by persistent heterogeneity. One economy is the
high-productivity, knowledge-based organized sector that produces 41 percent of GDP, but
absorbs only 8.6 percent of the workforce.40 The other vastly larger economy is the informal sector
that absorbs 91.4 percent of the workforce, but contributes only 59 percent of GDP. Both
economies coexist, but remain separated by a huge divide in productivity, capital intensity and

skills, and hence are moving at different speeds. As a result, India’s innovation system is complex
and fragile, and it is difficult to predict its future development.

India’s economic institutions, both public and private, were largely designed for a time before
India was opened to the global economy. These institutions must be strengthened to cope with the
requirements of transforming India into an internationally competitive industrial economy.41 The
task of modernizing India’s economic institutions has only just begun.42

The result is a deep fragmentation of India’s innovation system, resulting in weak links between
education, research and industry.43 With but few exceptions, India has a poor track record in
commercializing ideas, discoveries and inventions, and policies have emphasized self-reliance and
techno-nationalism, but neglected applied research and commercial product development.

The country has one of the smallest ratios of scientists and engineers per million people
(137/million people), with “an estimated 25% shortage of engineers in the country.”44 This is quite
different from other countries in Asia, such as China and South Korea, which produce larger
numbers of engineers each year than any other countries in the world.

Part of this skill shortage is due to the highly variable quality of India’s higher education
institutions, ranging from excellent to inadequate. Elite institutions like the India Institutes of
Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) cannot provide all the answers.
For instance, all of India’s IITs just educate 8,000 people – a tiny fraction of the country’s student
population. All IIMs, taken together, have a smaller intake than Harvard Business School.45 Of
particular concern is the dearth of qualified faculty, as top graduates prefer to go abroad or work
for the affiliates of global corporations.

In short, India’s higher education system appears to be one of the weakest links in its innovation
system. With tuition fees and self-financing courses, the cost of higher education is shifting from
the government to private households. In addition, there are the well-known deficiencies in
primary education, hit by high teacher absenteeism and high drop-out rates.46 Recent research
shows that “the persistently high illiteracy rate is falling … and almost none of the new entrants to
the urban labor force is illiterate but a majority of them do not complete school.”47 Overall, these
shortfalls in general education indicate severe limitations to the quality of India’s workers who are
needed to translate innovations into competitive products and services.

A final element of concern is engineering and vocational training. Research for the Working Group
on Information Sector for the 12th Five Year Plan documents quite pervasive general skill gaps in
India’s electronics industry: “While electronics engineers lack skills and exposure to production
processes, mechanical engineers lack sufficient exposure to electronics, but the industry/shop floor
expects multiskilling in both these areas.”48

The Working Group reports widespread skill bottlenecks that include surface-mounted
technologies (SMT), LCD technologies, semiconductors, nanotechnology, programmable logic
controllers and robots, and quality control practices and tools. In addition, serious skill bottlenecks
are also reported for the following basic manufacturing tasks: precision welding and soldering
techniques; safety norms; meeting pollution control laws; reading circuit diagrams and populating
boards; and awareness of shop floor concepts of electrostatic discharge (ESD). These skills are
complex and take time to train, and may therefore be precisely the skills neglected in attempts to
reach exceedingly ambitious targets to train hundreds of millions of workers in just a decade, which
privileges short, simple courses that fit easily in government procurement norms.49

So, beyond electronics manufacturing, but of vital importance for it, India faces a challenge of
historic proportions. To convert its demographic surplus into a source of sustained economic
growth, India needs to repair its education system, and it needs to link education and research
together, so that both can foster the development of domestic industry. This is necessary to improve
India’s competitiveness and its innovative capabilities in industrial manufacturing. If this does not
happen, India’s electronics industry cannot count on a vibrant industrial innovation system which
in turn constrains its capacity for productivity-enhancing innovation.

This is the context that shapes this study: a weak industry with a fragmented innovation system
facing an industry going through rapid global change that is closing off historical strategies for
growth. The next chapter turns to the parameters constraining any potential policy response.

CHAPTER TWO: POLICY PARAMETERS
1. Institutions, Markets and Trade Agreements Define the Scope for Regulatory Reform
   and Industry Policy
To identify ways to unblock the development of India’s electronics manufacturing industry, the
study examines restrictive regulations imposed by the central and state governments and their
support policies, with a particular focus on implementation capacity.

We define “regulations” broadly to include laws (such as subordinate legislation, bylaws and
amendments); supported by policies that are implementing regulations; and rules, technical
standards, directives, guidelines and administrative procedures at the Central, State and Local
levels of the Government.50 Based on interviews with a sample of over 45 companies, the study
examines the impact on firm behavior of fiscal regulations (taxes, tax breaks and other fiscal
incentives), trade-related regulations (tariffs, technical barriers to trade, and customs clearance),
technical standards and certification, competition policy (preferential market access schemes and
insolvency regulations), as well as labor laws and regulations.51

In subsequent chapters, this study will show that smart regulatory reform can help unblock the
barriers to investment and growth in electronics manufacturing, through a pragmatic focus on
many incremental improvements. Such an approach would be in line with a report by Raghuram
Rajan arguing that rather than politically controversial big bang reforms, India should “… take a
hundred small steps that will collectively…. [e]nsure inclusion, growth and stability by allowing
players more freedom, even while strengthening the financial and regulatory infrastructure.”52

However, though necessary, smart regulatory reform will not be enough. To address the root
causes of India’s lagging performance, a longer-term and structural industrial development agenda
is also required. An important step in this direction is the National Policy on Electronics (NPE),
which seeks to improve India’s international competitiveness through incentives for capability
development, cluster formation, R&D, and technology transfer through FDI.

Before turning to the specifics of both this regulatory reform and needed support policies, though,
it is important to understand the institutional and structural constraints on them.

Recent research on liberalization in India and elsewhere finds that the strength of a country’s
economic institutions conditions the success or failure of regulatory reform attempts,53 and

Dismantling the License Raj in India, NBER Working Paper No. 12031, February: 31 pages. Focusing on
differences in labor regulations across India’s states, these authors argue that “local institutions and policies matter
for whether a region benefits or is harmed by nationwide liberalization reforms. This is in line with a small but
growing trade liberalization literature which points to heterogeneous effects depending on the local institutional
setting in which liberalization takes place.” (p.24)


                                                                                                                       27
regulatory reforms need to be appropriate to other elements of the economic environment, such as
the state of technology and the organization of credit and labor markets.54 In line with this
emphasis on domestic economic institutions, Raghuram Rajan argues in a recently published essay
that India’s economic growth has slowed because:
        …India probably was not fully prepared for its rapid growth in the years before the
        global financial crisis. … [S]trong growth tests economic institutions’ capacity to cope,
        and India’s were found lacking….[And]… because India’s existing economic
        institutions could not cope with strong growth, its political checks and balances started
        kicking in to prevent further damage, and growth slowed….To revive growth in the
        short run, India must improve supply, which means shifting from consumption to
        investment. And it must do so by creating new, transparent institutions and processes,
        which would limit adverse political reaction.55

In Chapter Two of this study we will thus first highlight how the legacy of the License Raj has
shaped the transition from State-led mission-oriented planning to Liberalization, with the result
that persistent restrictive regulations continue to stifle private investment and innovation in India’s
electronics manufacturing industry (see section 2). While the story of the License Raj is well
known, it is important to understand its persisting legacy for the electronics industry, one of the
last to be liberalized.

While the link with domestic economic institutions matters, it is also important to broaden the
analysis beyond the role of domestic economic institutions. Equally important is an analysis of
two inter-related international transformations:
    Constraints to India’s industrial and innovation policies that result from increasi ngly
       complex international trade agreements and their rules (see section 3).
    Entry barriers to Indian electronics manufacturing firms that result from the prevalence of
       global oligopolies in the electronics industry (see section 4).

This conceptual framework will then be used in Chapter Three to interpret the research findings
on firm strategy and regulatory barriers. The framework also serves as a guide for examining in
Chapter Four implications for support policies (especially NPE) and for evaluating
recommendations received during extensive interviews in India’s electronics industry.

Finally, this framework will also help identify a more general finding: There are diverse pathways
to industrial upgrading in the electronics industry, and India needs to develop its own approach (or
a portfolio of approaches). Replicating the Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese models of electronics
industry development and upgrading is clearly not an option for India today, given the constraints
imposed by the above three fundamental policy parameters.

2. Domestic Institutions and the Legacy of the License Raj
2.1. From State-led mission-oriented planning to Liberalization
After independence, India’s industrial policy had been shaped by the Industries (Development and
Regulation) Act (1951) which introduced a system of industrial licensing that regulated and
restricted the entry of new firms and the expansion of existing ones and became known as the
“License Raj”.

It was expected that state control over industrial development via licensing would help to
accelerate industrialization and economic growth, and that it would reduce regional disparities in
income and wealth. Regulations were all-encompassing, from establishing a factory to starting a
new product line.56 Applications for industrial licenses were made to the Ministry of Industrial
Development and then reviewed by an inter-ministerial Licensing Committee.

This rigid system of regulation prevented the development of a vibrant private manufacturing
industry. Only a handful of the large business houses (like the Tatas and Birlas) could afford to
cope with the uncertainty that resulted from unpredictable selection decisions and frequent delays
of indeterminate length. Those rigid regulations created perverse forms of business models. For
instance, the leading business houses routinely engaged in preemptive license applications as a
means for stabilizing capacity and investment planning.

During the 1980s, it became clear that the “License Raj” development model was producing
disastrous results. Rising external debt, exacerbated by the increase in oil prices due to the Gulf
War, resulted in macroeconomic crisis and India was obliged to request a stand-by arrangement
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In May 1991, a Structural Adjustment agreement
imposed by the IMF as a condition for financial aid became a powerful catalyst for the government
to implement a far-reaching liberalization of the Indian economy. Industrial licensing was
increasingly abolished, in waves of industries.

2.2. Liberalization came late to the electronics industry
The electronics industry however was one of the last to be de-licensed. Until the 1980s, the main
focus of the electronics industry was the so-called “strategic industries”, especially defense
electronics. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) like Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and the
Electronic Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) dominated, and the Department of Electronics was in
charge of approving not only a firm’s entry into electronics, but any changes in product line or
increased output for a product already approved.57 A tight coalition of interest between the
Department of Electronics (DOE) and the SOEs “impeded the emergence of local private firms
and delayed India’s exploitation of new microprocessor-based technologies.”58

It was only in 1996, when licensing was abolished for consumer electronics, that the electronics
industry was de-licensed, with the important exception of the aerospace and defense electronics
sectors. As part of the dramatic shift to liberalization, tariff and non-tariff barriers were also slashed
as India opened its economy to the outside world.

It was expected that the liberalization of industrial and trade policy would “encourage and assist
Indian entrepreneurs to exploit and meet the emerging domestic and global opportunities and
challenges. The bedrock of any package of measures must be to let the entrepreneurs make
investment decisions on the basis of their own commercial judgment.”59

However, despite the roll-back of industrial licenses per se, many dysfunctional regulations have
remained in place and continue to stifle private investment and innovation in India’s electronics
industry. As will be analyzed in Chapter Three, many firms feel as if the quantity of licenses has
declined, but the cost of complying with those that remain has climbed. Moreover, the fact that
electronics was only de-licensed in 1996 meant that when it was opened to the full force of free
trade in 1997 it was still struggling to find its feet.

3. International Trade Agreements
India’s experience with trade liberalization through international trade agreements has two sides.
Some sectors like IT services, car components and generic pharmaceuticals have clearly benefitted
from India’s WTO membership. As far as electronics manufacturing is concerned however, this
section will demonstrate that the gains from trade liberalization were overshadowed by substantial
costs, especially stalled or declining domestic production.

This finding should not divert attention away from this study’s message that restrictive regulations
and weak implementation of support policies are the principal constraints on investment in and
growth of India’s domestic electronics manufacturing. As emphasized in the 12th Five Year Plan,
as well as by Raghuram Rajan, the government needs to better align domestic policies in order to
unblock the barriers to investment and growth in the electronics industry.60

In fact, as examined in detail in this study, the Indian government already seeks to fast track the
development of India’s electronics manufacturing industry through regulatory reform and
industrial support policies. The government’s National Policy on Electronics is a first step on this
path. This policy initiative seeks to improve India’s international competitiveness through
incentives for capability development, cluster formation, R&D, and technology transfer through
FDI. Equally important however are efforts to enhance the technological capabilities of Indian
electronics firms, and to strengthen India’s innovation system, with a focus on technology
absorption and an improved capacity to use and develop critical technical standards.

At the same time however, India’s experience with ITA indicates that early membership and large
tariff concessions may well create additional challenges once a country seeks to reduce investment

barriers in its domestic electronics industry. Hence, international trade agreements can act as an
additional constraint to India’s domestic electronics manufacturing.

The following analysis focuses on constraints to national industrial support policies that result
from India’s WTO membership, and the impact of a proliferation of plurilateral trade agreements.
In particular, the analysis will examine in detail an inverted tariff structure that tilts towards
imports over domestic production, and the asymmetric distribution of gains from trade
liberalization that results.

3.1. WTO-related parameters and “plurilateral” trade agreements
India’s National Policy on Electronics, and any other support policies and reform efforts direct at
the electronics industry, needs to take into account important external WTO-related parameters.
WTO membership obliges India to ensure “compliance” of its industrial and innovation policies
with increasingly complex trade rules which reflect the evolution of the multilateral trading
system. This constrains India’s options for national support policies that were available earlier to
Japan, Korea and Taiwan.61

For instance, the Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) prohibits domestic
regulations a country applies to foreign investors that can have trade-restrictive and distorting
effects. Policies are now banned, such as local content requirements and trade balancing rules,
which were traditionally used to promote the interests of domestic industries.62 Already, and as
described in Chapter Four, the Government had to delay its Preferential Market Access (PMA)
scheme, a component of the National Policy on Electronics, in response to critique from the US,
the EU and Japan that this scheme would not be in compliance with India’s WTO obligations.

In addition, the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) protection to
be provided by each Member to nationals of other WTO Members.63 TRIPS lays down in detail
the procedures and remedies that must be available in each country so that right holders can
effectively enforce their rights.64 Disputes between WTO Members about the respect of the TRIPS
obligations are subject to the WTO’s dispute settlement procedures. According to its proponents,
the TRIPS provisions seek to reduce distortions and impediments to international trade, promote

63
   The coverage of the TRIPS agreement is quite pervasive, and includes: copyright and related rights (i.e. the rights
of performers, producers of sound recordings and broadcasting organizations); trademarks including service marks;
geographical indications including appellations of origin; industrial designs; patents including the protection of new
varieties of plants; the layout-designs of integrated circuits; and undisclosed information including trade secrets and
test data.
64
   In addition the TRIPS Agreement provides for certain basic principles, such as national and most-favoured-nation
treatment, and some general rules to ensure that procedural difficulties in acquiring or maintaining IPRs do not
nullify the substantive benefits that should flow from the Agreement.


                                                                                                                    31
effective and adequate protection of intellectual property rights, and ensure that measures and
procedures to enforce intellectual property rights do not themselves become barriers to legitimate
trade.65 Critics argue that the current TRIPS provisions may impede both innovation and
knowledge diffusion,66 and that they “… commit countries to enforce the patents issued by other
countries without any safeguards that…[those other]… countries are taking appropriate steps to
guard against the issue of patents covering prior art, or trivial patents covering no art at all.”67

Recent efforts by developed countries to push developing countries beyond their TRIPS
commitments through so-called TRIPS-Plus measures included in a growing number of bilateral
and regional free trade agreements have raised concerns in developing countries, articulated
especially forcefully by India and China. These concerns culminated when a group of mostly
developed countries, led by the US and the EU, signed the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade
Agreement (ACTA) in October 2011.68

Overall, by introducing intellectual property law into the international trading system, the TRIPS
agreement and TRIP-plus measures have fundamentally redefined the scope for national industrial
and innovation policies.

Of similar impact is a “plurilateral” WTO agreement, the Government Procurement Agreement
(GPA). As a “plurilateral” agreement the GPA is limited to the WTO Members that specifically
signed it or that have subsequently acceded to it. Its present version was negotiated in parallel with
the Uruguay Round in 1994, and entered into force on 1 January 1996. On 15 December 2011,
negotiators agreed to re-negotiate the Agreement, a political decision confirmed formally on 30
March 2012.69 The agreement applies to all procurements for commodities, goods and services if
the maximum potential value of the contract will be in excess of US$552,000.70

The US government is an important driving force behind the GPA. According to the US Trade
Representative, “the United States strongly encourages all WTO Members to participate in this
important agreement.”71 According to a document released by the Government of Massachusetts,
the WTO-GPA “…has been the United States’ most effective negotiating tool for opening up

   According to Wikipedia, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) “…is a multinational treaty for the
purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to
establish an international legal framework for targeting counterfeit goods, generic medicines and copyright
infringement on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the World
Trade Organization, the World Intellectual Property Organization, or the United Nations.” The agreement was
signed in October 2011 by Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the
United States. In 2012, Mexico, the EU, and 22 countries which are member states of the EU signed as well.

threshold changes every two years. The next expected change will be in January 2014.

opportunities for U.S. suppliers to compete for foreign government contracts on a non-
discriminatory basis. To date, the GPA has given U.S. firms and their workers access to overseas
procurement markets estimated to be worth more than US$200 billion annually.”72

India is an observer to the GPA since February 2010. It is noteworthy that India does not have a
central law on the subject of government procurement, despite the fact that government
procurement accounts for 25 to 30 percent of India’s GDP. As highlighted in the September 2011
Report of the Committee on Public Procurement, appointed by the Government of India,
        …[a]t present, public procurement in India is governed by administrative rules and
        procedures which only attract departmental action in case of violation. These rules do
        not create any rights in favour of the public in general, and the potential suppliers, in
        particular. Nor do they provide for a fair and effective mechanism for dispute
        resolution, thus virtually denying any recourse against unfair and arbitrary decisions
        of the procuring entities. Another limitation of this arrangement is the absence of penal
        consequences for misrepresentation, cheating or fraud in public procurement, except
        under the normal penal codes which are inadequate for dealing with complex
        procurement matters […] Malpractices in procurement do not often carry any deterrent
        consequences and the associated lack of accountability enhances the potential for
        corruption. Departmental action against erring officials is rare, if not absent. Suppliers
        affected by malpractices have no recourse except through civil courts that are unable
        to offer any timely relief. As a result, public procurement does not inspire much public
        confidence.73

The Government seems to be intent to use membership in the WTO-GPA as a catalyst for pushing
through against vested interests the reforms outlined in the Public Procurement Bill.74 However, a
concern is that the revision of the text of the GPA in March 2012 is “…watering down a number
of flexibilities available to developing countries under the GPA 1994 by making Special &
Differential Treatment (S&DT) to developing countries, which was already a subject matter of
negotiations in the GPA 1994, subject to more conditionalities and available only as transitional
measures.”75
3.2. The Information Technology Agreement (ITA)76

signed the ITA in 1997, one of the first among developing countries. The rationale was to attract
inward FDI and facilitate the growth of its then nascent IT services industry. ITA participation was
also viewed as an important catalyst for extending further India’s liberalization drive.

ITA participation and the resultant price reduction for information technology imports did indeed
facilitate the expansion of India’s IT services industry. At the same time, however, India’s
participation in ITA has acted as an important barrier to the development of India’s domestic
electronics manufacturing industry. This is a trade-off, which may or may not have been
worthwhile, but a trade-off nonetheless.

The ITA went into effect in April 1997 with 29 WTO member countries. Unlike other plurilateral
agreements, ITA provides “most favored nation” (MFN) treatment to all WTO members, even if
those countries have not joined the ITA. Today, ITA has 78 WTO members - 36 members are non-
OECD member countries, and 35 of those are developing countries.77 The latter include countries
that are already significant players in the electronics industry (i.e. China, Taiwan, Malaysia,
Thailand and Vietnam), while other countries, such as India, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines, and
Turkey have the potential to become players.78

In its current form, ITA provides for zero tariffs for 217 electronics products.79 The main product
groups covered are computers, semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing and test equipment,
telecommunications equipment, software, and scientific instruments.80 ITA-1 has enabled a
substantial increase in the trade of electronics products it covers. “Aggressive tariff liberalization
facilitated growth in ITA trade from US$1.2 trillion to US$4.0 trillion … [in 2010].”81 Unlike
some other plurilateral trade agreements, such as the WTO-GPA, which allows exceptions by way
of offsets (e.g. defence offsets), the ITA does not allow any exception to the covered products.
The only relaxation is to identify certain specified products as sensitive so that they qualify for a
phased-in implementation period. India has requested and received such an extension.82

Current negotiations to expand the product coverage, in an “ITA-2” are focused on product groups
that are of particular interest to developed world companies, such as multi-component integrated

   WTO members that have not joined the ITA include Mexico, Brazil, Tunisia, South Africa, Argentina and Chile.
Of those countries, only Mexico is one of the leading exporters and importers of electronics products. Its
government however has decided that non-membership better fits its economic interest.

with all duties slated for elimination by 2000.

Opinions differ on the distribution of trade liberalization gains from ITA. A widely held perception
in the US is that “developing countries” benefited most from trade liberalization through ITA. For
example, Ezell argues that trade liberalization through ITA is likely to:
        …benefit developing countries in three principal ways: 1) reducing tariffs on a broader
        range of ICT products encourages greater adoption of ICT products that play a key
        role in spurring economic growth; 2) lower prices realized by reducing tariffs on ICTs
        increases the productivity of all other industries in a developing economy; and 3) by
        lowering the price of a key input, the ITA has undergirded development of the
        burgeoning ICT software and services industries in many developing countries such as
        India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines.85

However, the evidence provided to support this proposition is unconvincing to many. The
argument neglects fundamental differences among ITA participants in the stage of development,
in economic institutions, and in their resources and capabilities for manufacturing and innovation.
Due to these structural differences, ITA participants differ in their capacity to reap these theoretical
gains from trade liberalization. Furthermore, as stated by the US International Trade Commission
(USITC) itself, “…[t]he paucity of conclusive research on the impact of the ITA on global trade
attests to the difficulties in empirically measuring the effects of the ITA and signals that …
considerable discussion and analysis are still needed to determine the magnitude of the ITA’s
impact on IT trade and technology diffusion.”86 Closer to reality are industry insiders and US
officials who have openly argued that leading US MNCs “benefit disproportionally” from ITA-
enabled trade liberalization.87 There is also some evidence that for leading US vendors of ICT
products, ITA provided significant benefits in terms of growing exports and expanding global
production networks.

Take semiconductors, an important product covered by ITA-1. While prior to 1997, the US share
in the worldwide market for semiconductors hovered around 40 percent, since the signature of the
ITA agreement, the US share has moved up to around 50 percent.88 From 2005 to 2009,
semiconductors constituted the number one product export from the US on an aggregate basis,
with exports totaling US$48 billion (US$10 billion more than automobile exports, in second
place).89 In 2011, US semiconductor producers had global sales of US$152 billion, representing
over one-half of the global semiconductor market.90

As for the impact on global production networks, the same research by the USITC finds that ITA-
1 boosted FDI by MNCs in China which “had a major role in China’s accelerating ITA exports,
as multinational corporations sought to reduce costs by directly adding capacity in China. Once
China joined the WTO, products exported from China were guaranteed MFN access to other
countries, providing strong incentives for multinational corporations to establish production and
assembly operations in China.”91

It is important to emphasize that India joined ITA from a position of weakness. The country was
heavily reliant on electronics imports, but had a weak domestic electronics industry, which had
only recently been liberalized.

Moreover, India volunteered some of the largest tariff concessions of any signatory. The largest
tariff concessions to ITA, based on pre-ITA bound rates, were by India (66.4 percent), far ahead
of Thailand (30.9 percent), and Turkey (24.9 percent). India also stood out in average applied-
tariff reductions, where India’s tariffs were reduced from a pre-ITA level of 36.3 percent,
compared to China where average applied-tariff reductions started from a level of 12.7 percent.92
Overall, an industry weaker and more recently liberalized than any of its competitors was subject
to a larger shock than any of its competitors.

This contrasts with China’s approach. It joined the ITA only in 2003, six years after India. In
contrast to India, China entered the ITA from a position of strength. “China was … [already]…a
leading manufacturer and trader of IT products prior to joining the ITA and deeply engaged in the
global IT production chain even before tariff liberalization.”93 When China joined the ITA in 2003,
its per capita GDP (US$1,270) was three times higher than that of India’s 1997 per capita GDP
(US$427).94 By 2003, when China entered the ITA, it was already the third largest exporter and
the fourth largest importer of ITA products. In 2004, China expanded its market share, becoming
the world’s largest exporter of ITA products. In 2005, China surpassed both the EU and the US to

become the largest country in terms of overall ITA trade.95 Moreover, as China is far ahead in its
electronics manufacturing industry, India is now an easy target for low-cost electronics imports
from there. Some observers fear that, with the influx of such imports into the domestic markets,
due to the zero tariff under the ITA, “…the existing domestic producers may become domestic
assemblers and traders in the IT products.”96

The result in the last decade has been an acceleration of ITA imports in India. In 2000, 96 product
lines were reduced to zero tariff, and in 2005, 121 product lines were reduced to zero tariff. While
between 1997 and 2000, the growth rate of India’s ITA imports was 18 percent annually, their
growth rate increased to nearly 38 percent between 2001 and 2005.97 Data from the Directorate
General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) show that India’s electronics imports under chapter 85 have
grown faster than India’s electronics consumption.98 The import content of the raw material
consumption of India’s electronics industry has increased over the last 7 years from 50 percent to
56 percent.99 More recently, between FY2010-11 and FY2012-13, India’s imports have grown
especially fast for integrated circuits (82%), the second largest electronics import category. India’s
imports also grew very fast for some electronic components like capacitors (36%), rectifiers and
inductors (38%), and for consumer-related products like video recoders and monitors (81%).100

Needless to say, trade deficits are not in principle negative for economic growth. In fact empirical
research points to the importance of imports in boosting productivity.101 Yet in India’s case, local
value added of electronics manufacturing is only around 7 percent, while electronics imports
account for almost two thirds of consumption. Until there is a more substantial base of domestic
production to benefit from such spillovers, the positive productivity effects of rising imports
appear unlikely.

Finally, the growing use of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) have
further mitigated any positive effects of ITA-induced tariff reductions in target markets. The US,
the EU and Japan appear to be the main drivers behind the surge in NTBs and TBTs. Of the total
of 456 TBT notifications from 1995 to 2000 by all WTO members, developed countries have
submitted 356 notifications, i.e. 78 percent of the total.102

There are few effective governance mechanisms in place to ensure that the surge of NTBs and
TBTs does not constrain access of Indian companies to the markets in the US, the EU and Japan.
Moreover, these barriers require sophisticated institutions and governance capabilities, in

particular in the area of setting standards (discussed further below), creating an uneven playing
field for countries that are still building such capabilities.

If this analysis is correct, this would imply that for developing countries like India, the gains from
trade liberalization through ITA may well be nullified through the surge of NTBs and TBTs in
developed countries. In fact, India faces a double bind: While tariff reductions have led to a sharp
decline in investments in domestic electronics manufacturing, exports from India face substantial
TBTs and NTBs in the US, the EU and Japan.103

In short, participation in the ITA and the resultant inverted tariff structure appears to have had a
negative impact on India’s electronics manufacturing industry, one that must be taken into account
in any policy process.

During 2013, ITA members were negotiating in Geneva a possible substantial expansion of the
list of products covered by ITA. Before the first round in July, the Indian government decided not
to join these negotiations.104 The Indian Government argues that a small group of developed
country signatories of the ITA, led by the US, the EU and Japan have designed an expanded list
with a focus on products where these countries, and especially the US, continue to lead by a wide
margin.

An alternative strategy for India has been proposed by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and
Industry of India (ASSOCHAM).105 The Chamber argues that merely resisting the ITA expansion
is unlikely to have positive effects for India’s electronics industry. Instead, the Indian government
should engage in a smart strategy of co-shaping the consolidated product list of ITA-2: “India
needs to address the ITA expansion, weighing carefully its long-term as well as short-term
objectives in a strategic manner rather than becoming overly influenced by ad hoc approaches and
concerns.”106 In this view, non-participation in ITA-2 negotiations comes at a heavy cost. Not only
would India lose the option of co-shaping the contents of the new expanded ITA product list. Non-
participation might also discourage international investors to expand their presence in India, and
it might act as a disincentive for existing FDI manufacturing projects to expand and upgrade their
facilities.

A close look at China’s approach to the 2013 ITA-2 negotiations however raises doubts whether
India would have had realistic chances to co-shape the expanded ITA-2 product list. China

    According to the Commerce and Industry Ministry, “India’s experience with the ITA-1 has not been encouraging
as it has almost wiped out the IT industry from India. After examining the matter in consultation with the nodal
Ministry i.e. Department of Electronics and Information Technology and other stakeholders, it has been decided, for
the present, not to join the negotiations as it will not be in our national interest.” Quoted in “India to skip talks on
expanding ITA scope”, The Hindu, March 13, 2013.

apparently was trying to implement such a co-shaping negotiation strategy, yet the result was not
encouraging. Before the July meeting, China presented a list of sensitive products that called for
the removal of 106 products rather than asking for an extended implementation period. Under
pressure to shorten this list, China on July 17 reduced the list of sensitive products that it wanted
not to be part of the ITA-2 to around 90. However, China’s revised list of sensitive products
continued to include two product groups that are among the US priorities for ITA-2: MCOs107 and
medical devices.108 The following quote from a detailed report in the newsletter Inside U.S. Trade
nicely summarizes the ITA core group’s response to the China’s revised sensitivities list:
        …[T]he Canadian mission -- which was organizing the meetings in Geneva -- sent out
        a notice stating that talks previously scheduled for July 18 would not take place, on the
        basis of the earlier agreement at the ambassador level that talks could not advance
        without China producing a more “credible” list. … Exactly what constitutes a credible
        list is something that no member has clearly defined, sources said. But one source said
        that the chief drivers of the ITA expansion initiative -- the U.S., Japan and the EU --
        are clearly targeting a total expansion including about 200 items. That would require
        China to at least halve its current list of sensitivities. China was not supportive of
        suspending the negotiations, and it is unclear whether it will really be able to back off
        its initial position to that extent. But while some sources charged that China's long list
        indicated a lack of coordinated domestic consultation … -- others said Beijing… has
        industrial policy goals in mind….109

At present, India’s absence hardly matters, given its insignificant role in the global electronics
industry.110 Longer-term, however, staying at the sidelines is not an option for India. As argued in
Chapter Four of this study, India needs to find a way to co-shape the future architecture of the ITA.
If ITA-2 would indeed broaden the product list to include MCOs and medical equipment, this will
most likely close any realistic chances for India to develop significant domestic manufacturing
capabilities in these subsectors. An additional aspect of China’s ITA-2 negotiation approach that

107
    MCOs are used in a wide variety of products, including smart phones, tablets, medical devices, household
appliances, and car parts such as braking, steering and air bag systems. MCOs thus can be classified under a wide
range of HS subheadings. As a result, no one really knows for sure how important MCOs are for US exports. US-
ITC estimates that in 2011, sales of MCOs accounted for between 1.5 and 3.0% of global semiconductor sales, or an
estimated $1.2 to $2.4 billion.
108
    A report of the US International Trade Commission for the US Trade Representative (USTR) identified five
priority subsectors of the consolidated draft product list for ITA-2: medical devices; relay and industrial control
equipment; optical media, including LED; loudspeakers and handsets; and, most importantly multicomponent
integrated circuits (MCOs). US-ITC selected these subsectors to illustrate “the potential for increased market access
opportunities for USA firms as a result of ITA expansion.” ( United States International Trade Commission, The
Information Technology Agreement. Advice and Information on the Proposed Expansion: Part 2: page VI)

    A particularly telling sign is that India does not even show up in McKinsey’s list of top -ten countries in the
global value-added electronics industry, http://www.slideshare.net/morellimarc/mckinsey-manufacturing-future-
2013-22958651 By contrast, ITA-2 without China would be an oxymoron. Not only is China the world biggest
smartphone market, but it is also by far the most important market for US semiconductor firms. As John Neuffer,
senior vice-president of global policy at the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) points out: ““China
has got to be part of this. They are too big a player. You can’t have an outcome without the Chinese.” Donnan, S.,
2013, “Negotiators nervously eye China’s resistance in IT trade talks”, Financial Times, November 19,

is of interest to India’s National Policy on Electronics is that “China also listed some products
already covered by the ITA such as printers and monitors, which has confused other
negotiators.”111 These are in fact product groups, where India has some, albeit limited production
capacity.

3.3. Regional and Mega-Regional Trade Agreements
The inverted tariff impact of ITA is further amplified by various Free Trade Agreements (FTAs)
and Preferential Trade Arrangements (PTAs)112 signed by India.113 One of the most significant is
the ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement, expected to eliminate tariffs for about 4,000 products
(which include electronics, chemicals, machinery and textiles), with 80 percent to be reduced by
December 2013, with the remaining 20 percent by December 2016.114 The impact of this
agreement is already being felt for “electrical and electronic equipment” (a proxy for the
electronics industry).115 As research on the sectoral impact of the FTA states,
        [T]here are hardly any immediate benefits for Indian producers as average percentage
        tariff drops in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand’s Normal Track products are much
        lower than India’s. Further, the ASEAN-5 economies are leading exporters of light
        manufacturing products…[including electronics]…. India will also be competing with
        China and South Korea in the ASEAN market, which already have FTAs with ASEAN.
        Thus Indian SMEs will find it difficult to hold their own against these countries in such
        sectors.116

As long as India lacks a vibrant domestic electronics industry, India’s gains from the ASEAN-
India FTA will thus be limited to its IT services industry (which by some reports is in any case
being out-competed by the same industry in the Philippines).

Longer term, an important challenge may result from agreements India does not sign, but which
affect its potential market. These are the emergence of so-called “mega-regionals”, i.e. “by-
invitation-only” arrangements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Agreement (TTIA). Some observers are concerned that
“developing countries will be excluded from market share in the signatory regions. Also, since
these mega-regionals are being negotiated outside the scope of the multilateral trading system,

quoted in “U.S., Others Suspend ITA Talks to Pressure China to Soften its Stance”, Inside US Trade, July 29, 2013:

112
    The WTO defines FTA as "agreements among two or more parties in which reciprocal preferences (whether or
not reaching complete free trade) are exchanged to cover a large spectrum of the parties trade". Customs unions on
the other hand, are PTAs "with a common external tariff in addition to the exchange of trade preferences". Both
forms of PTAs can be either bilateral (two parties) or plurilateral, that is, involving three or more countries.

The Government of India as well as those of China and Brazil have expressed concern that, unlike
in multilateral negotiations, the US has more political and economic leverage over other parties in
the TPP negotiations. This is a particular cause for concern with regard to intellectual property (IP)
provisions.

Recent research indicates that IP provisions proposed for the TPP are likely to be even more
restrictive than those in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement.118 Perhaps the primary criticism
of the TPP is that it sets US intellectual property laws as the “norm” for all members. The TPP
patent provision has been criticized primarily for its impacts on pharmaceuticals and medical
devices, but will likely also impact software and other information and communication
technologies. “In particular, the TPP removes the requirement that an inventor disclose the “best
mode” of the invention, thus creating the possibility of inventors “retaining the best for
[themselves].”119

Other observers highlight possible negative implications for developing countries, as these
countries by definition do not have developed countries’ institutional capabilities or standards.
As noted above, this reduces the theoretical level playing field that motivates the advocates of such
agreements to, in practice, a highly uneven one in which superior standards-setting and other
governance capabilities can provide substantial advantages. Another structural feature of the
electronics industry, which makes it depart in important ways from theoretical models of gains
from trade, is that it is not freely competitive, but oligopolistic in almost all its segments.

4. Global Oligopolies and Entry Barriers
Global oligopolies have proliferated recently in high-tech industries. A well-known example is the
aerospace industry: Two companies dominate the manufacture of large commercial aircrafts,120
three suppliers dominate the market for jet engines, while brakes have two dominant suppliers,
and tires have three. The same holds for the global electronics industry. A limited number of
MNCs dominate in important market segments, with the result that latecomers like Indian firms
are confronted with substantial entry barriers. Support policies for the development of India’s

    For instance, TPP-2 Art. 8.6 of a leaked US TPP Proposal for an IP Chapter would require TPP members to grant
extensions of patent terms beyond the TRIPS 20-year minimum patent term to compensate both for delays in
patenting and in granting marketing approval. Patent term extensions delay the introduction of generic products into
a market, maintaining monopoly protections and higher prices during the extension. (Flynn, S. et al, 2011, Public
Interest Analysis of the US TPP Proposal for an IP Chapter, Program on Information Justice and Intellectual
Property, American University Washington College of Law, December 6, chapter V. Patent and Data-Related

    In 2012 the top two industry suppliers (Boeing and Airbus) were estimated to account for over 90% of all
industry revenue. See Hepher, T. and C. Altmeyer, 2013,“Boeing overtakes Airbus in annual sales race”, January
17, http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/17/us-airbus-orders-idUSBRE90G0CF20130117

electronics manufacturing industry therefore need to be informed by a deep understanding of these
oligopolies and the entry barriers they create.

4.1. Technology-centered competition is intensifying
The electronics industry is unrivalled in its degree of globalization. A defining characteristic is
that competition is centered on the increasingly demanding performance features for electronic
systems. Tablets, laptops, smart phones, or mobile base stations all need to become lighter, thinner,
shorter, smaller, faster, and cheaper, as well as adding more functions and using less power. To
cope with these demanding performance requirements, engineers have pushed modular design and
system integration, with the result that major building blocks of a mobile handset are now
integrated on a chip.121

Design teams must cope with this accelerating pace of change. Essential performance features are
expected to double every two years, time to market is critical, and product life cycles are rapidly
shrinking to a few months. Only those companies thrive that succeed in bringing new products to
the relevant markets ahead of their competitors.

The root cause of these increasingly demanding requirements is the emergence of a “winner-takes-
all” competition model, first described by Intel’s Andy Grove.122 In the fast moving electronics
industry, success or failure is defined by speed to market and return on investment, and every
business function, including R&D, is measured by these criteria.

The examples of Samsung Electronics and Apple illustrate to what degree extreme performance
has come to dominate investors’ decisions. Despite an estimated record 47 percent year-on-year
rise of earnings (to almost US$10 billion per quarter), Samsung Electronics at one stage had lost
17 percent of its market capitalization since the beginning of 2013, as this rise fell short of analysts’
expectations.123 Apple’s shares have fallen 40 percent from a peak in September 2012, despite the
iPhone5 breaking its unit sales records.124 Even global leaders like Samsung and Apple are finding
that even record results are insufficient to satisfy investors who expect still faster growth.

The result is intense price rivalry among industry leaders, which is further fuelled by the growing
threat from lower-cost Chinese brands. To prevail, industry leaders must use their technological
superiority to cut costs even further and to erect new barriers to entry. Intensifying price
competition thus combines with intensifying technology-centered competition.

4.2. The spread of global production and innovation networks
This has provoked fundamental changes in business organizations. To mobilize all the diverse
resources, capabilities, and repositories of knowledge on time and at lowest cost, global
corporations have responded with a progressive modularization of all stages of the value chain and
its dispersion across boundaries of firms, countries, and sectors through multi-layered corporate
networks of production and innovation.125 The complexity of these global networks is difficult to
fathom. According to Peter Marsh, the Financial Times’ manufacturing editor, “…[e]very day
30m tones of materials valued at roughly $80 billion are shifted around the world in the process of
creating some 1 billion types of finished products.”126

While the proliferation of global production networks goes back to the late 1970s, a more recent
development is the rapid expansion of global innovation networks (GINs), driven by the relentless
slicing and dicing of engineering, product development, and research.127 Empirical research
documents that this has further increased the complexity of global corporate networks. GINs now
involve multiple actors and firms that differ substantially in size, business model, market power,
and nationality of ownership, giving rise to a variety of networking strategies and network
architectures.128

The flagship companies that control key resources and core technologies, and hence shape these
networks, are still overwhelmingly from the US, the EU, and Japan. However, there are also now
network flagships from emerging economies, especially from Korea, Taiwan, and more recently
from China.

As the most prominent example, Samsung Electronics today has eight Regional Headquarters from
North America to Southwest Asia; and its production network covers nine plants in Korea plus 27
across Asia, Europe and North America. Taiwan’s Foxconn has 13 factories (or rather gigantic
factory cities) in China, and a growing number of factories in Japan, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, as
well as in Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. Huawei’s global innovation network now
includes, in addition to six R&D centers in China, five major overseas R&D centers in the US,
Sweden, Russia, and the UK (as part of British Telecom’s list of eight preferred suppliers for the
overhaul of its fixed-line phone network).129

4.3. Late entry into global oligopolies requires extraordinary efforts
In economic theory, markets are oligopolies when they are “dominated by a few sellers at least
several of which are large enough relative to the total market to be able to influence the market
price.”130 While some oligopolies may lead to price distortions, this is not the only effect of
oligopolistic market structures. As highlighted by Jospeh Farrell and Carl Shapiro, “...[i]mplicit in
the market structure we call ‘oligopoly’ is the presence of some important barriers to entry. Firms
that own certain crucial assets are the incumbents, and others are at best potential competitors.
These assets might take the form of intellectual property: patent rights to production technology,
licenses to use such technology, or industrial know-how.” 131

As the examples of Samsung and Apple show, intense competition may occur among oligopolists.
Nevertheless, their ownership of crucial assets allows them to establish barriers to the entry of
potential competitors. The nature of these barriers may differ, depending on specific
characteristics of the relevant industry sectors and market segments. They may result from pricing,
but oligopolists can also establish and raise entry barriers not related to price, drawing on a superior
capacity to define technology trajectories, control intellectual property rights and brands, and
shape critical technical standards and their enforcement rules.

In short, entry barriers that confront latecomers like Indian firms in the electronics manufacturing
industry result from a combination of superior assets and capabilities that global oligopolists were
able to develop due to their dominant market positions. Price-setting is one such capability, and it
is of critical importance in major segments of the electronics industry. But from India’s
perspective, it is important to highlight the systemic nature of those entry barriers. Oligopolists
can set lower prices, not only because they can source the relevant products from low-cost
production sites through their global production and innovation networks, but also because of their
control over leading-edge technology and their superior innovation capacity. 132

The concentration data for key segments of the global electronics market, presented below in
section 4.4, clearly demonstrate that global oligopolies have been established across the electronics
value chain. While late entry is never to be completely excluded, successful entry into those
markets would require quite extraordinary efforts by latecomers like India to develop superior
business models and new technologies. Both the Indian government and the private sector would
need to join forces and develop a decisively longer-term industrial development strategy that
combines smart regulatory reform and structural support industries.133

This is possible, and has been done by others (indeed, Samsung was once an entrant). Chinese
firms that design integrated circuits for smart phones and tablets provide recent examples. In smart
phones, Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and RDA, have gained significant market share by
undercutting both Taiwan’s MediaTek, a leader in the low and mid-level handset market, and

Qualcomm of the US, the dominant chip designer for high-end phones.134 In tablets, Chinese chip
design companies, led by Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics and Allwinner, have captured 37 percent
of the market for the key processor chips in non-iPad tablets, with their share still rising.135

In the tablet applications processor market, Chinese and Taiwanese tablet chip companies together
captured a 29 percent share of volume in the first quarter of 2013. While Apple and Samsung
together still command a 50 percent global market, thanks to their in-house customers, it is clear
nevertheless that the once tight global oligopoly is under pressure. A clear indicator is that the
entry of lower-cost Chinese firms has accelerated a significant decline in the average selling prices
of tablets from US$522 in the first quarter of 2012 to US$461 in the first quarter of 2013.136

It is important to emphasize however that such successful latecomer entry into a global oligopoly
was only possible as a result of China’s extensive long-term industrial development strategy that
started far back in the 1990s, with substantial and sustained support policies ranging from cost
subsidies to R&D funding. Since then, the semiconductor industry has been one of the priority
targets of China’s indigenous innovation policy, including a plan to create a group of globally
competitive semiconductor firms that will develop into global leaders in market share,
manufacturing excellence and innovation capacity.137

4.4. Evidence – Tight global oligopolies in important electronics market segments
Empirical research on global oligopolies has focused on concentration ratios (CR) as a measure of
the total output produced in an industry by a given number of firms in the industry. The most
common concentration ratios are the CR4 and the CR8, which means the market share of the four
and the eight largest firms. Concentration ratios are usually used to show the extent of market
control of the largest firms in the industry and to illustrate the degree to which an industry is
oligopolistic. According to Blair, oligopoly begins when the four largest firms hold more than 25
percent of overall sales. Between 25 and 50 percent, this oligopoly is loose and unstable, but above
50 percent, it becomes firm and clearly established.138

In the electronics industry, control over platform standards determines who can shape technology
trajectories and markets. The PC industry for instance has been dominated by two companies,
Microsoft and Intel, which together have tightly controlled Windows, the operating system for
most personal computers, and the “Intel Architecture”, the set of rules governing how software
interacts with the processor it runs on. More than 80 percent of PCs still run on the “Wintel”
platform standard.139

In the first quarter of 2013, the four leading PC vendors have a global market share of 48.1
percent,140 while the five leaders have almost 55 percent.141 More recent data by IDC show an even
higher degree of oligopolization142 - the four leading PC firms account for 53.5 percent of the
global market, while the five leaders have a 59.6 percent market share. In short, the global PC
market today comes close to a firm and well established oligopoly, even as many observers
consider the industry decline with the growth of tablets and smartphones.

With the decline of the PC relative to mobile devices,143 some observers were predicting a
transition to a “multipolar” world, where “the market will be fought over by eight or nine more or
less vertically integrated giants.” In this view, Oracle, Cisco and IBM were expected to vie for
corporate customers, while Apple and Google will control the markets for individual consumers.144

Instead, we are witnessing the emergence of a new global oligopoly for mobile devices. In 2012,
the four leading operating systems accounted for 94 percent of worldwide mobile device
shipments, with Google’s Android system alone controlling 68 percent. Projections for 2017
expect an even tighter global oligopoly, with the four leading operating systems accounting for 99
percent of worldwide smart phone shipments.145

In the first quarter of 2013, the four largest smart phone vendors had a global market share of just
shy of 60 percent, indicating a firm and well-established oligopoly.146 In fact, the markets for
mobile devices are now dominated by a duopoly of two dominant firms, Apple and Samsung which
are carving up the majority of profit and a growing portion of sales. Apple has the advantage of
completely controlling its hardware and software, and Samsung has the advantage of
manufacturing many of its key components. Together, only these two oligopolists have the size
and the deep pockets necessary to be able to sell across multiple product lines.

An even higher degree of oligopolization can be found in hard disk drives. Some would argue that
the HDD is a dying industry as the form of storage is used by struggling PC makers, while tablets
and smart phones use solid memory, not disk drives. However, with the dissemination of
distributed computing through the “cloud”, huge centralized data centers will need lots of storage,
supporting disk drive demand in the long term. In the first quarter of 2013 the largest three
companies147 had a market share of almost 100 percent - clearly a tight oligopoly.148 Only ten years
ago, the market structure was very different.149 In fact, the HDD industry represents a case of rapid
global oligopolization (Figure 3 in Appendix One).

    For instance, a widely quoted study used the HDD industry as an example of a highly competitive industry

Of particular interest for India’s efforts to develop its domestic electronics manufacturing industry
is the emerging oligopolistic market structure for key market segments of the set-top box (STB)
industry. After all, STBs are one of the priority products of India’s National Policy on
Electronics.150 This market is dominated by five firms: Pace, Motorola, Technicolor, Scientific
Altanta/Cisco, and Humax.151 However, in light of the segmentation of the STB market, it is
important to highlight the dominant market positions of leading firms in some of those market
segments:
      Pace overtook Motorola by a hair in overall STB revenue in the second quarter of 2011,
        attributed to the fact that it offers solutions across all market segments (telecom, cable, and
        satellite operators)
      Cisco holds a commanding lead in both revenue and units for IP STBs,152 Motorola leads
        in cable STB revenue, and Skyworth Digital dominates in cable STB unit shipments.153
Finally, in the flat panel market, the four leading firms (Samsung, LG, Sony and TCL) have a
combined market share of almost 47 percent, which is still a loose oligopoly.154 However, the two
leaders (Samsung and LG) together account for a third of the global market, and their combined
share in leading edge Gen 7 and Gen 8 flat panels keeps rising.

4.5. India’s electronics market is as oligopolized as the global industry
This global market structure is mirrored in India. According to data collected by the Department
of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITy), five important electronics markets in India
are dominated by a handful of MNCs (Table 5 in Appendix One). For PCs, four MNCs control
57 percent of the Indian market in the first quarter of 2013.155 This constitutes a tight and
established oligopoly. For smartphones, three MNCs account for 65 percent of unit shipments in
the first quarter of 2013 in India, with Samsung far in the lead, with a share of 43 percent.156

A few oligopolists also dominate India’s huge and rapidly growing market for telecommunications
equipment. In 2011, four companies (Nokia Siemens Networks,157 Ericcsson, Huawei and ZTE)

the others, and together hold a 35 percent share in FY2012.159

Only the market for mobile telecom towers has a substantial Indian presence, with Indus Towers
leading with 32 percent, followed by BSNL (15%), Reliance Infratel (15%), Viom Networks
(11%), Bharti Infratel (10%), and GTL Infrastructure (10%).160 These telecom tower companies
however are essentially assemblers (or engineering, procurement and construction companies),
which acquire a piece of land, erect towers (through vendors) and then rent out these towers to
operators. Very few electronics components go into the tower manufacturing,161 and the base
station is typically provided by the operators.

4.6. Market control without domestic manufacturing
The multinational oligopolists described above dominate the Indian market without engaging in
substantial domestic manufacturing in India (whether directly or through EMSs), except for low-
value-added final assembly. They rely on their extended global production networks to source the
relevant products for the Indian market from other production sites, primarily in China.

In making these sourcing decisions, it is important to note that MNCs do not consider just the basic
cost structure, but that they would have to invest in creating a whole range of sophisticated
capabilities for rapid, low-cost scaling up of large production lines for complex products. Those
capabilities are difficult to acquire. In fact, earlier research on Korea, Taiwan and more recently
on China demonstrates that developing these sophisticated scaling-up capabilities carries a much
larger cost than the physical investment in plant and equipment.162

So in addition to China’s substantial cost advantages, MNCs can benefit from these accumulated
capabilities in China for rapid and customized scaling up.163 There are signs that such capabilities
allow Chinese firms to charge higher prices than Indian competitors while still winning orders.
Witness the following statement of Hitech Magnetics, an Indian component supplier: “We have
recently lost out three products that we were supplying to ABB over the last five years. MNCs
now have global sourcing and they are asking us to be 15% lower than Chinese cost, only then
they will source from us.”

India’s electronics manufacturing industry has not yet developed such scaling-up capabilities. In
combination with India’s substantial cost disadvantages relative to China, this explains why the

MNCs that dominate India’s electronics markets have little incentive to invest in an expansion of
local production in India. At the same time, these very same MNCs can use their power as global
oligopolists to erect high entry barriers for Indian firms in case they would seek to enter or re-enter
the industry.

In fact, where local Indian firms seek to compete with MNCs for the India market, they follow the
same pattern of sourcing their products from offshore production sites in China. But suppose the
support policies designed as part of India’s NPE would incentivize domestic firms to invest in
domestic production.

Once they start domestic production, these Indian firms would face difficulties challenging the
dominance of MNCs in their own market. As oligopolists, MNCs can establish high entry barriers,
drawing on their superior economies of scale and scope, long investment in low-cost and scalable
production, mastery of expensive and leading-edge technology, and control over rich patent
portfolios. Trade rules, as described above, mean that these capabilities provide as entrenched a
barrier to entry in India, if not more so, since any such firms would likely also face the inverted
tariff structure.

India thus faces a vicious circle in its efforts to develop a domestic electronics manufacturing
industry. As long as the industry is shaped by oligopolistic competition and an inverted tariff
structure, neither MNCs nor Indian firms have much incentive to invest in substantial domestic
manufacturing in India. At the same time, oligopolistic control gives rise to a “commoditization”
of electronics products across the globe, imposing substantial constraints to local innovation efforts
in a country like India that would seek to address specific needs of India’s domestic market through
“frugal innovation.”

4.7. India’s challenges and opportunities
India’s experience with trade liberalization through international trade agreements has been mixed,
especially for the Information Technology Agreement. IT services have clearly benefitted. Yet,
for electronics manufacturing the gains from trade liberalization were overshadowed by substantial
costs, especially stalled or declining domestic production.

Moreover, these trade agreements intersect with a market that, since the agreements were signed,
has become more and more oligopolized. The result is enormous barriers to entry, which are faced
by domestic firms not just in India but in any developed market. Domestic firms face incumbents
that combine developed world skills and intellectual property with the capabilities for rapid, low-
cost scaling up available in China. Both are the result of decades of investment, and even if firms
in India or elsewhere could in theory be competitive, in practice they will sustain enormous losses
before acquiring capability bases that allow such potential to be actualized.

On the other hand, none of those constraints are impossible to overcome. Indeed, China itself is
showing that it is possible, both in its original acquisition of those capabilities, and in the rise of
Chinese firms to challenge the global oligopolies, particularly in mid- and low-priced segments.
To do so, however, it has had to engage in highly interventionist, long-term support policies,
including substantial subsidies of a range of inputs, as well as creating an exceptional operating
environment for the MNCs to invest, and both them and domestic firms to import and export.

                                                                                                    49
In theory, India could achieve this too. With electronic goods penetration in China nearing
saturation in a range of markets over the next few years, India will be one of if not the largest
growth market for electronics. Given the premium in this industry on time-to-market and
customization, this should create an inbuilt advantage for domestic production in India, certainly
compared to any other developing market.

To achieve this, though, India will have to overcome the substantial latecomer disadvantages
described above, in a context where its influence on key external parameters, in particular market
structure and trade rules, is limited to non-existent. The responsibility for overcoming this
challenge thus lies domestically, in the alignment and implementation of domestic policies and the
improvement of the domestic business environment.

Only such a concerted reform and support effort will have a chance to marginally unblock the
barriers to investment and growth in the electronics industry in India. To appreciate the key
priorities for such an effort, the next chapter presents the view from industry, drawing on extensive
interviews in India.

CHAPTER THREE: THE VIEW FROM INDUSTRY – REGULATIONS
AND OTHER INVESTMENT BARRIERS

1. Research Methodology and Interview Sample
This chapter presents findings of field research in India that was designed to shed light on the
challenges faced by India-based companies (both domestic and foreign) in the electronics
manufacturing industry, especially with regard to restrictive regulations. The field research was
conducted through semi-structured interviews with firms, having the following objectives:
    Explore the nature of work being done by electronics companies in India including product
       mix, levels of value addition, technological complexity of products and processes,
       employment effects, and sourcing of technology;
    Understand how companies assess the challenges they are facing and how they define their
       strategic objectives;
    Examine how companies self-evaluate their management and technological capabilities,
       especially in both electronics design and manufacturing; and,
    Identify the regulatory barriers that are most constraining for investment in electronics
       manufacturing, holding back the growth of India’s electronics industry.

A total of 46 interviews were conducted in six cities between April and August 2013, covering 39
companies, three Government Departments, three industry associations, and one non-
governmental organization (NGO). Interviews were structured by a detailed questionnaire and
lasted between one and two hours.

Interviews were conducted with senior managers across a broad sample of India-based firms that
are involved in various stages of India’s electronics manufacturing value chain (Figure 4 in
Appendix One). The focus was on components and electronics equipment manufacturing
(including EMS). Most of the manufacturing companies interviewed were founded more than ten
years ago.

By nationality of ownership, the sample is fairly evenly distributed between Indian-owned
companies (56%) and foreign-owned companies. The small number of start-ups interviewed
reflects their limited presence, especially in electronics manufacturing. Finally, in geographic
terms, almost two thirds of the interviews were conducted in Bangalore, with an additional 20
percent in the Delhi National Capital Region (Appendix Two includes quotes from interviews).

2. Firms’ Strategies: Challenges, Objectives and Capabilities
2.1. How companies define their strategic objectives
Companies were asked to rank key motivations for investing in domestic electronics
manufacturing as well as enabling factors and challenges for them as they do so. As for
motivations, start-ups and experienced players differ markedly in the factors which drive them to
invest. For start-ups the primary reason seems to be to respond to customer needs and produce
appropriate products that fulfil those needs. For the more experienced players, besides serving
customers, the major reason seems to be the need to gain market share.


                                                                                              51
Throughout the interviews, growing domestic consumption of electronic products was highlighted
as the main enabling factor that would convince the firms to invest in electronics manufacturing.
Underlying this is the need to gain volume, and hence to reap economies of scale.

Some of the more successful companies emphasized the need to develop partnerships with global
industry leaders as an important motivation for expanding investment in electronics
manufacturing. The importance of developing partnerships increases for exporters, as this gives
them an additional source of competitiveness in export markets. According to a domestic EMS:
       For us the key reason for the expansion of manufacturing is the need to develop
       partnerships with global industry leaders. This has always been a major driver for us.
       For example, we are part of a global EMS alliance which gives us significant
       bargaining power in terms of getting preferred pricing in components. Similarly, we
       have global customer partnerships with companies like GE which means that we do
       the production for GE’s global level products … and not just its India specific products.

A young domestic producer of medical equipment also emphasizes the importance of global
partnerships as a source of technology and as a facilitator for gaining access to international
markets:
       For us the major reason for expanding manufacturing is to develop partnerships with
       global industry leaders …. Of course, gaining market share and responding to the
       customer’s needs is also very important. Instead of talking about growing domestic
       consumption, I would rather talk about growing global consumption which is an
       enabling factor for us.

Government policies and tax incentives were frequently mentioned, but almost all interviewed
companies complained about the absence of effective support policies and tax incentives. Even
where firms know about such policies, there is widespread scepticism about whether they will be
implemented effectively and lead to tangible results. Here are three typical examples:
    The tax ‘incentives’ and government ‘support’ policies are all dissuaders rather than
       enablers. – Indian start-up producing medical equipment.
    Things like tax incentives and government support policies have only been recently
       introduced and their effect remains to be seen. However as a businessman I only trust
       what I have seen and I would not rely on these incentives to be an enabling factor as
       long as they do not show tangible results. – Indian EMS.
    The government support policies and tax incentives are non-existent, so I would not
       call them enablers. – Indian component producer.

In terms of their fundamental strategies, most of the interviewed companies seek to compete as
low-cost producers, predominantly for lower-end market segments, though a few companies aspire
to follow close behind global leaders with fast scaling-up. A handful of internationally oriented
companies seek to work closely with a larges OEMs and produce what they ask for. Most
companies, though not all, rate the level of local value added as low.



2.2. How strong are India-based IC design capabilities?

                                                                                              52
As noted in Chapter One, India’s base of integrated circuit (IC) design capabilities is one of its key
potential advantages in the electronics industry. To understand the reality and impact of these
capabilities, companies were asked how digital and analog design capabilities of India-based IC
design companies compare with global best practice, and to assess the level of sophistication of
projects done in India.

This provoked lively responses, with most companies emphasizing a high level of technical design
capabilities, but acknowledging a gap in the level of integration of design projects and the
sophistication of project management. Overall, the interviews confirmed the fundamental
disconnect, highlighted in Chapter One, between domestic electronics manufacturing and India’s
treasure trove of engineers with advanced electronic and IC design capabilities.

According to a leading global electronic design automation (EDA) tool provider with a massive
presence in India, the technical capabilities of senior and experienced designers are on par with
global leaders. MNC affiliates, like Intel and Texas Instruments (TI), conduct integrated design
projects in Bangalore, and such projects are estimated to account for around 70 percent of the
projects, against 30 percent for more basic design services. According to the same source, a serious
concern is a quite significant gap in capabilities between MNCs and public sector units (PSUs).
As compensation packages in MNCs are up to 10 times higher than in PSUs, MNCs can hire the
best talent.164 As a result, performance requirements and competition for jobs are much less
intense in those PSUs than in MNCs.

A more skeptical assessment was offered by a domestic provider of EDA tools. According to this
source, Indian IC design firms are still peripheral players, and require much catching-up to reach
global best practices. This source has interviewed engineers who are working at MNCs, and
concluded that their “quality is not really good. International companies operating out of India are
working on a manpower supply model rather than a capability model.” In this view, MNCs still
seem to emphasize primarily access to large populations of lower-cost young design engineers.
MNCs have little interest to enable Indian engineers to “own the full delivery of the chip. …The
attitude is to look for manpower trading rather than getting into a solution mode for a particular
problem.”

A balanced view was provided by the head of an affiliate of a Japanese company producing
electronic substrates: “… the project sophistication handled is of medium level. Take the example
of a company like Intel. The design work they are doing in India is only the peripheral level design.
All the advanced core design work is done in Israel.”165
A common theme was to emphasize two critical weaknesses: a “service mentality” that focuses on
detailed engineering implementation of designs received from global customers; and a lack of

164
    Note that this contrasts with the situation in China, where the erstwhile huge gap in compensation packages
between MNCs and large domestic firms like Lenovo or Huawei has been substantially reduced, with the result that
domestic firms can now successfully compete for the best talent not just in China but internationally.
165
    This is in line with the author’s research on Intel Bangalore’s IC design projects. Bangalore’s contribution to
complex multicore processors was mainly in detailed engineering to make those processors “market ready”. Tasks
performed at Intel Bangalore’s lab “are mostly tedious and require intense manpower to complete the tasks. The
intellectual content, i.e., inventing new techniques and architectures, is low. No new core design was done to
complete the project.” Ernst, D., 2009, A New Geography of Knowledge in the Electronics Industry? Asia’s
Role in Global Innovation Networks. Policy Studies No. 54, August, East-West Center, Honolulu, HI. : p.21

                                                                                                                 53
exposure of Indian design engineers to strategic marketing and other business functions that are
necessary to develop and market original IC designs. Some companies also emphasized the weak
design and R&D capabilities of small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

3. Regulatory Barriers: Taxes, Trade and Licenses
3.1. Definition and brief overview of regulatory barriers
As noted above, this study builds on the World Bank’s earlier analysis of India’s restrictive
regulations.166 Firms were questioned at some length regarding regulations, to identify which are
most constraining to electronics firms, and their impact on the growth of this strategic industry. In
order to understand such relative priority and impact, the concept of regulations was broadened
from the earlier study to include elements such as trade laws and regulations affecting
infrastructure provision (Figure 5 in Appendix One). Companies were therefore asked which
regulations they consider to be most constraining for investment in electronics manufacturing, as
well as related services and R&D, and how these related to other constraints.

SMEs consider the high cost of capital as the single biggest constraint to investment. The negative
impact of India’s inverted tariff structure167 is also creating serious problems for both smaller and
large companies, and was among the most frequently cited barriers to investment in electronics
manufacturing. The tariff structure is treated in detail above, and the cost of capital is considered
beyond the scope of this study.

Fiscal constraints seem to impact SMEs more than larger companies. Larger companies have
better processes and can afford to use tax consultants to navigate through the complex maze of tax
requirements. Frequently mentioned concerns relate to the instability of taxation, a lack of clarity
of the tax structure, and the disparity of tax structure from state to state. This topic will therefore
be treated in detail below.

Badly designed regulatory breaks and tax incentives are an important concern for SMEs and
especially young companies that are eager to get new ideas produced and introduced to the market.
An example is incentives to promising companies to stay small. According to the general manager
of a leading MNC affiliate,
        There are significant disincentives against scaling- up of SMEs. As soon as companies
        seek to get bigger, they are under pressure not to cross a ceiling, and entrepreneurs
        look for way to navigate these barriers, for instance by establishing shell companies.

Labor issues seem to be more of a problem for large companies, as micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs) are typically working with a smaller workforce and a higher share of
permanent workers.

3.2. Domestic market fragmentation, taxes and the GST
There was a near complete consensus among interviewees about the fundamental need for a nation-
wide GST.168 One interviewee compared waiting for GST with Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for
166
    Bhattasali, D., N. Katoch and L. S. Jordan, 2013, Regulations Restricting the Growth of Non-Farm Enterprises.

    For a detailed analysis, see Chapter Two.

    Further details on GST can be found in the companion study on Supply Chain Delays and Uncertainty in India.

                                                                                                                54
Godot” where two actors wait endlessly and in vain for the long promised arrival of a man whom
they only know by hearsay.

Companies across the board (both large and small) mentioned the disparity between state taxes as
well as 2 percent Central Sales Tax (CST) as a key fiscal constraint. This is by far the largest
regulatory issue facing electronics companies, mentioned first or second in almost all
interviews. It is considered far more important than subsidies.

As documented in Chapter One, electronics manufacturing depends on complex global supply
chains and timely delivery of goods. As long as a unified India-wide GST does not exist, it seems
highly unlikely that a robust electronics manufacturing industry can develop in India, however
many subsidies or other policies are handed to the industry. Most firms acknowledge the priority
the Government is already giving to GST, but they emphasize that the implications of any further
delay in introducing GST will be felt across all segments of electronics manufacturing, and that
this will constrain one of the high priority industries of the future.

This is nicely summarized by the Electronic Industries Association of India (ELCINA) (and the
deadline given in this quote has already been missed):
        There has been considerable delay in implementation of GST regime in the country. As
        per promises made in recent months and expectation of industry, ELCINA strongly
        supports implementation of GST and hopes that the next deadline of 1st April, 2013
        will be met. Implementation of GST, couched in simple language with maximum clarity
        will lead to all-round rationalization … ELCINA strongly supports immediate
        implementation of GST with CST subsumed in it. In case for some reason, the
        implementation of GST is delayed further, CST should be made zero.169

Beyond GST, the general difficulties in obtaining clarity on tax structure and regulations affect all
types of companies equally hard, with design start-ups (especially fabless companies) being
strongly affected due to lack of clarity regarding their status. Manufacturing start-ups are
especially hard hit because of complex and costly tax recording requirements.

3.3. An inverted tariff structure
In almost all interviews, companies of all sizes (both domestic and foreign) confirmed an important
finding of Chapter Two of the study. They emphasized the negative impact of the inverted tariff
structure, where the duty on the finished product is lower than that on raw materials and
intermediate products, which are highly tariffed to protect other industries. According to the
Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT), most materials that are used in
electronics products (such as plastics, copper, aluminum, ceramics) as well as components (both
semiconductors and passive components) attract a customs duty of 10.3 percent and a special

                                                                                                  55
additional duty of 4.4 percent.170 The rationale for these duties is that such inputs are of “dual use”
since they can go into multiple products.

The negative effect is felt by Indian electronic equipment producers, like one Indian manufacturer
explained:
       Currently all the components that are used in our manufacturing have a very high duty
       structure due to which the prices of our final products become uncompetitive. Import
       content on our products is close to 52%, and due to the higher duty structure on
       components, the overall disability is 30-40% on the final price of the product.

Interviewees in general supported the decision of the Government not to join the July 2013
negotiations in Geneva on broadening the scope and product coverage of the ITA (it is being
referred as ITA-2), citing protection of national interest.

Of particular interest is the negative impact of the inverted tariff structure on medical electronics,
a low-volume, high-value industry segment.171 Medical equipment requires complex technology,
and its production requires imports of electronic components and modules; involves high level of
testing to meet statutory and regulatory requirement; and requires highly skilled and experienced
engineers and operators capable of running high precision and very costly machines.

Imports of medical equipment face a duty of 5 percent while materials for their production face a
tariff of 5–7.5 percent—often with substantial delays caused by differing interpretations of whether
an unclear regulation (Central Excise Annexure III, IGCRDMEG Rule 1996) is applicable. This
inverted tariff would only become more difficult for domestic producers if medical equipment
were included under ITA-2 and India joined the agreement. As reported by an Indian start-up
producing medical equipment,
         The inverted tariff structure, which implies that the final products have no duty, is a
         major constraint for companies like us. Imports of Chinese medical equipment at
         ridiculously low prices have seriously impacted the growth of electronics industry in
         this country. … Hence, there is no level playing field for the different countries. For
         example, when Brazilian medical equipment is sold in India, they face a 7.5 percent
         duty while when Indian equipment is sold there it must face a 70 percent duty.

3.4. Customs clearance
Beyond the tariff structure, many interviewees complained about the operational details of the
customs clearance process, which frequently delays production and turn-around cycles. Customs
clearance delays and their unpredictability differ across specific product segments, but are quite
constraining in each. This can have a devastating effect in a fast-moving industry like electronics
manufacturing, especially for smaller and younger firms.

G. Saberwal, 2013, “Case studies of innovative medical device companies from India: barriers and enablers to
development”, BMC Health Services Research, Vol.13:199.

                                                                                                                  56
Firms interviewed reported that inefficient and corrupt customs procedures may often delay
customs clearance by at least two to three weeks. Due to ambiguous regulations, companies often
face situations where customs officials seek to exploit this ambiguity to exact informal payments.
Companies have to struggle with continuous delays and with highly complex customs procedures
for imports of supplies.

Interviews with two industry associations (Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers
Association (CEAMA) and ELCINA) highlighted how these delays can cause serious and systemic
disruptions of the electronics industry’s supply chain.172 According to both, a root cause of these
delays is discretion and authority of ground level officers, interacting with “notification-based
exemptions”, i.e., customs provisions based on notifications that are time consuming to interpret
and change. A primary example is the “Customs Notification 25/99”, also known as the “jumbo
notification.”173 This notification is supposed to list the raw materials which go into electronics
and which qualify for receiving preferential duties. However, interpreting this notification causes
endless delays, and never ending queries, due to conflicting interpretations of ambiguities of
product classification.

The result is that suspicion has become built into the system, as well as opportunities for rent
seeking, and association leaders have to spend much of their time trouble-shooting with
consignments stuck at airports. On one side, customs officers often seem to believe that all
companies are trying to game the system. For instance, ICs have a 0 percent duty, but other parts
are tariffed at 7.5 percent. So, some firms may falsely declare components as ICs, to reduce overall
weighted duty. Other firms may claim to import components as raw materials for electronics, and
then resell them. Clearly, firms which do this are in violation of the regulations and should be
punished. Most firms and associations supported increasing the punishments for violators.

However, the burden of proof is heavily weighted towards firms, which must fully satisfy requests
before allowed access or allowed to operate. In principle, there is a “green channel”, but it is only
available to large firms (a finding confirmed by more extensive data analyzed in the companion
study on freight and logistics).

The associations report that senior officers are responsive, but are caught in a system that is slow
moving and requires far too many approvals. It is therefore necessary to establish a grievance
redress mechanism that is fast, especially for smaller firms. The current administrative
mechanisms take very long, and firms are scared of reprisal. As one interviewee put it: “To gain
one rupee in customs duties the country is losing thousands”. Take the following example: The
duty on LCD panels was cut from 10 percent to 0 percent. However, some companies or countries
have the established practice of labeling “panels” as “modules”. So when a particular shipment
arrived, customs officers queried whether the duty should be 0 percent, and refused to release
material until they received a formal notice. As a result, domestic production stopped. In response,
a representative of CEAMA had to request the Ministry of Finance through DEITy to issue a

clarification notice to customs. The relevant Joint Secretary (JS) agreed, but before issuing the
notice he was reposted. A new JS arrived, but was unfamiliar with the issue. As a result, the
Secretary General of CEAMA had to make repeated visits, only to be told each time “the file has
moved”, and it took six months to clarify this very simple issue.

Similar examples abound in dealing with customs authorities and the interpretation of product
names. For instance there are conflicting interpretations of regulations about “metallic” versus
“plastic” materials, with widely different implications for tariff rates. The point is not that these
queries are not valid, but the enormous complexity required to resolve them.

Reforming this requires trust. A possible solution may be to allow the consignment through, but
require bank guarantees on threat of forfeit. Larger companies can do this, but it is necessary to
spread this system to smaller companies with a track record. More generally, there may be cause
for setting up a new system of tariff query resolution, one that can provide notifications in days
rather than weeks. Such a system would be of particular benefit to electronics, which could be the
pilot of such a mechanism, which might then be spread to other industries.

4. A Weak and Dysfunctional Standards System
Many companies emphasized the critical importance of standards for developing India’s domestic
electronics manufacturing industry. Companies are conscious that effective standards are critical
for market expansion and differentiation, and that they are needed to facilitate technology transfer.
Most companies emphasized that well-defined quality and safety standards could be a powerful
policy tool against low-cost and low-quality imports. However, there is also a broad consensus
that the current laws and institutional set-up of standards development is insufficient to guarantee
the high levels of quality and safety that are essential for the industry’s international
competitiveness.

In line with such a broader concept of standardization as a tool for industrial development, some
companies argued that India should study China’s approach to develop a unified National
Standardization Strategy.174 Other interviewees referred to the approach of the American
Voluntary Standards System as a possible benchmark, and its emphasis on public-private
partnerships in standards development.175
In order to compete as preferred suppliers within global production networks, India-based firms
need well-designed inter-operability standards that enable “two or more networks, systems,
devices, applications, or components to exchange and readily use meaningful, actionable
information - securely, effectively, and with little or no inconvenience to the user.”176

Given the importance of this subject, Chapter Four will examine in detail the broader strategic role
that standards can play in fostering the growth of India’s electronics industry.

5. The Challenges of Young Innovative Firms
A critical finding of the interviews is that smaller companies can face a disproportionate burden
from being exposed to the maze of restrictive regulations. This is especially the case for young
companies that seek to produce new products, but are struggling to cope with existing tax, customs
and myriads of other regulations.

A major challenge for instance for any company which considers investing in electronics
manufacturing is that right from the start the company needs to comply with a multitude of
clearances needed for setting up a manufacturing facility. Especially smaller companies feel
overwhelmed by the multiplicity of regulations and the amount of man hours needed to cope with
those requirements. For instance, the time required for getting the land allotted and for obtaining
the clearances often adds up to between six and eight months, while in China those clearances
would require no more than two to four weeks. As an example, the Consortium of Electronic
Industries of Karnataka (CLIK) is working on a 50 acre cluster, where the land allotment has not
been cleared for more than 18 months. The government in Karnataka has changed during this time
and the entire process has had to restart.

Similarly, a large number of interviewed companies mentioned that excise and commercial
departments continue to remain a major clearance hurdle even though they seem to have improved
in functioning slightly. Companies that provide services for the electronics manufacturing industry
complain about the service tax department and the long time it takes to receive payment for credit
on service tax that was over paid.

Over and above these, the following concerns were frequently mentioned, and are familiar from
many accounts in the media and other studies: lack of coherence; excess paper work; a large
number of laws, which are often unclear; and the interaction of all of these with corruption.

Promising start-up companies that were able to raise early-stage venture capital are hard pressed
to make sense of well-intentioned but complex incentives and support policies provided by the
Ministry of MSME and other government agencies. Many of these firms lack the scale and the
deep pockets of capital that would be needed to cope with the quite substantial costs of compliance
with existing regulations and the multi-faceted and often obscure tax and tariff obligations. Nor
can these firms afford the delays in production due to inefficient customs clearance and
transportation systems.

Most importantly, existing regulations, bank lending and support policies fail to address the needs
of companies that seek to draw on their strengths in product development and system integration
to pursue ”low-volume, high-value” strategies.




                                                                                                 59
These findings are in line with the findings of one of the few empirical studies on India’s
technology-based start-up companies.177 Drawing on interviews with a sample of 443 start-up
companies, that study found that “government policies represent the greatest problem faced by
start-ups in India.”178Among these policies, drawing on a separate slightly larger sample of 532
companies, the same study prioritized the specific constraints: lengthy procedures and formalities,
extensive paper work (20%); high import and excise duties and sales tax (20%); stringent norms
of labor laws (15%); interpretation of laws and policies by enforcement agencies (14%); stringent
environment and pollution control norms (12%); various insurance schemes (10%); frequent raids
and inspections (8%) and taxation (2%).179

In addition to these regulatory restraints, our own interviews highlight the paucity of
institutionalized support for technology-based start-up companies in the electronics manufacturing
industry. Despite progress in de-licensing and de-regulation, India’s framework conditions for
innovative start-up companies remain weak.

6. Impact on Business Organization
Finally, an important finding of this study is that persistent restrictive regulations may give rise to
forms of business organization that prevent organic growth through the accumulation of
specialized resources and capabilities. Deeply entrenched restrictive regulations clearly play a
major role in constraining growth and in stifling innovation. Some companies we interviewed for
instance establish “shell companies” for the sole purpose of by-passing the effects of tax, labor
and other regulations, or for availing subsidies and other schemes.

All the companies that described how this is done did so with the condition of confidentiality. The
common features are easily described though. One legal company will serve as the hub of the web.
This will typically have less than ten people, principally legal and accounting experts. It will buy
and sell from a web of shell companies, maintaining low sales and profits on its books but
accumulating the residual assets. The shell companies will then conduct the actual trading, each
shell processing few enough sales to keep their exemption from excise taxes, and employing few
enough people to remain under the labor law thresholds.

Every few years the shell will be rotated out of circulation, its sales slowing down, to stay under
the radar. If a new scheme, for example, offers subsidized land to small companies, new shell
companies will be established to avail such benefits. If inspectors query why half a dozen
companies are operating out of a single address, undertaking the same activities, then the
companies come to an informal arrangement to ensure the questions do not proceed further. As
one proprietor described it, this web is time-consuming but, under current regulations, it can be
very lucrative. When a business is sold, only the hub company is, the shells becoming in effect
defunct, unless the new owner decides to maintain them instead of setting up a new web.

It is important to emphasize that these shell companies are very different from the complex
network arrangements established by Korean and especially Taiwanese electronics firms whose
main purpose is to generate economies of scale and scope in procurement, marketing,
manufacturing and R&D.180

In India’s electronics industry, avoiding regulations is the sole purpose of those sometimes quite
complex network arrangements. The result is that much of the management efforts in those
companies are concentrated on keeping alive an increasingly complex and “underground” web of
companies that do make money from short-term contracts but lack the human and financial
resources to invest in plant and equipment, let alone in R&D. These companies fall far short of the
minimum economies of scale and scope required for competing in the fast-moving and technology-
intensive electronics industry.

CHAPTER FOUR: UPGRADING STRATEGY AND SUPPORT POLICIES

1. Key Questions
The final chapter of the study examines the Government’s support policies that seek to fast -track
the growth of India’s electronics industry, and to draw recommendations to strengthen their
implementation or fill in any gaps. In light of the previous findings on policy parameters in this
industry and the business environment for electronics manufacturers, the following questions have
guided research for this chapter:
     How familiar are India-based companies with the Government’s policies in support of the
       electronics manufacturing industry?
     What needs to be done to improve the impact and the effectiveness of those support
       policies?
     What policies are required to fully utilize the strategic role that standards can play in
       fostering the growth of electronics manufacturing in India?
     How do companies evaluate the recently launched National Policy on Electronics?
     How do companies rate support policies in terms of their capacity to create an enabling
       environment for electronics industry growth in India?

Key information sources include responses and information received through interviews with the
company sample described in Chapter Three; descriptions of key building blocks of the NPE
described in detail in policy documents published by a variety of government agencies; reports
prepared by industry associations and consulting firms; and academic research papers on specific
aspects of India’s support policies. These are complemented by information from the author’s
research on support policies for the electronics industry in China, Korea, Taiwan, and in the US.

After presenting findings for the above questions, this study concludes by offering
recommendations.

2. Industry Perceptions, Implementation, and Dialogue
During the interviews, companies were asked what indicators they would use to assess whether a
support policy might facilitate an expansion or upgrading of their manufacturing business. As
expected, the selected criteria differed by industry segment, as well as by the size and ownership
pattern of the companies. This by itself conveys an important message to policy makers – the
diversity of interests of different stakeholders in electronics manufacturing requires a diverse set
of policies, and a capacity to listen to the voices of different industry stakeholders.

At the same time, interview responses clearly highlighted a number of widely shared priority
concerns. Almost all respondents emphasized the critical importance of transparent and user-
friendly support policies that take into account the feedback from industry.

The remainder of this section first presents the industry’s responses; then discusses the general
constraint of policy implementation, in line with the 12th Five Year Plan; highlights restructuring
industrial dialogue as a key mechanism for feedback and policy guidance, with a deep and detailed
comparison to the industry dialog in Taiwan, China; and leads finally to a key enabler for such
dialogue, the role of industry associations.

                                                                                                 62
2.1. Firms’ specific expectations from support policies
Most of the interviewees emphasize first and foremost the need to attract and facilitate investment
by both domestic and foreign companies to increase local value-added. Many companies
emphasize that investment promotion should focus primarily on attracting foreign “Big Players”,
as they could act as catalysts for creating a space for domestic smaller companies. A number of
companies argued that a particular focus should be on attracting EMS providers.

The most mentioned items on firms’ “wishlist” (Figure 6 in Appendix One) were the general
constraints of infrastructure and access to capital. The third most mentioned expectation, and the
highest priority one that is specifically relevant to the industry, is that industrial support policies
should help to accelerate the entry of start-ups, and to foster the rapid growth of young India-based
companies that seek to manufacture and commercialize new electronic hardware products. In
addition, successful policies would enable domestic firms, especially SMEs, to develop their own
intellectual property rights.

Concrete suggestions for industrial upgrading policies are provided by the Indian Electronics and
Semiconductor Association (IESA). It suggests that in order to strengthen the technological and
management capabilities of firms, support policies should encourage international technology
cooperation with foreign centers of excellence, such as Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute, Belgium’s
IMEC,181 and should facilitate technology licensing agreements. In addition, IESA suggested that
industrial support policies should
        …induce high value-added FDI to address the rapid domestic market growth (mobile
        phones as an important growth market); foster co-creation, where cooperation
        between firms (both MNCs and domestic firms) and India-based academic institutions
        will lead to co-owned IPR [intellectual property rights] … A fundamental prerequisite
        for implementing this strategy is the development of sophisticated IPR protection, IPR
        licensing and IPR development capabilities.

During the interviews, firms were also asked which States (cities or clusters) already have the
infrastructure, human resources, capabilities, as well as supportive policies that could position
them well for growing investment in electronics hardware manufacturing (Figure 7 in Appendix
One). The leading three States on this list might come as little surprise, but some low-income
states ranked unexpectedly high on the list, most notably West Bengal. Firms also placed and
emphasis on the importance of looking at clusters, as much or more than states, in determining the
potential for growth.

2.2. The general constraint of transparent, user-friendly implementation
Almost all respondents placed much emphasis on the ease of policy implementation, and their
transparency and “user-friendliness”. Many companies expressed a palpable sense of frustration

innovation network includes R&D teams in The Netherlands (Holst Centre in Eindhoven), China, Taiwan, and India
(Imec India Private Limited), and offices in Japan and the USA. http://www2.imec.be/be_en/about-imec/company-

                                                                                                           63
about support policies that are brilliant on paper, but are obstructed by weak implementation
capacity of both central and state governments.

A related argument is that support policies need to be predictable and should have a longer-term
perspective. Most companies agree that one-off initiatives to fix regulatory constraints may be
useful, but they may be subject to dispersal of effort, and risk becoming obsolete quickly, as the
industry changes rapidly. Given the relentless and unpredictable pace of technical change, in three
years’ time this year’s reform may no long have an effect, or may even be harmful. In general, a
fundamental challenge in fact for regulatory reform is a capacity for flexible policy implementation
which, based on a periodic review of what works and what doesn’t, can find ways to recalibrate
and adjust existing regulations.182

This response from firms is directly aligned with a core theme of the 12th Five Year Plan, that the
issue in India is not the intent of policies but their implementation. As the Plan states:
         Two root causes for poor implementation are: inadequate consensus amongst
        stakeholders for policy changes, and very poor coordination amongst agencies in
        execution. … [Often],… a good plan was not made before announcing action. Or, a
        plan was made but it was not understood by, and sometimes not even known to, the
        various agencies involved. And, often, even when the plan was known, there was no
        monitoring and follow-up.183

Specifically, the Planning Commission highlights a range of implementation constraints for a
cohesive national manufacturing strategy, from the complexity of inter-ministerial and State-
Centre relations, to the multiplicity of stakeholder groups that must be involved for a plan to have
traction.

In order to overcome these deeply entrenched implementation constraints, fundamental changes
are required in the management of government programs. According to the Planning Commission,
the government should shift from a role of micro-manager to one with capabilities focused “not
only on scheme design and strategic alignment of schemes to tactical outcomes, but also strong
evaluation and feedback systems and networks from which the states and other local implementers
can learn.”184

In addition, support policies for industrial manufacturing need to focus on learning and capability
development: “A good manufacturing plan focuses on accelerating learning within a country’s
industrial ecosystem that enables enterprises within it to improve their competitiveness faster than
enterprises in other countries. The implementation system for such a plan needs to focus on
building broad-based capabilities across industries.”185

Most fundamentally, the Planning Commission suggests improving inter-agency collaboration, to
establish effective stakeholder consultation processes, and a continuous evaluation of policy
impacts and effectiveness. In fact, the Planning Commission calls for
        wide-spread consensus-building processes … [that]… must become part of the
        Indian manufacturing system. For this, institutions for representation, such as
        employee unions, employer associations, and civil society organizations, must
        become more professional, more democratic, and more competent in arriving at
        agreements that ensure fairness to all stakeholders.186

These extracts highlight the critical importance of changes in the processes of policy
implementation. A tangible implication of them is that making policies relevant to industry needs
requires permanent “Industrial dialogues” on many levels, with more direct access to
entrepreneurs, and a willingness of government agencies to listen to industry needs (companies
complain that they need to “chase the authorities”), and to encourage the development of mission-
oriented public private partnerships. Indeed, according to many respondents, in order to shake-
up India’s electronics manufacturing industry, multiple fora for industrial dialogue are required
between industry and government, with a focus on specific projects and outputs.

On the other hand, a call for such dialogues may be nothing new. Such recommendations can
easily descend into simplistic clichés extolling the virtue of “public-private dialogue”. To make
this more concrete, it will be useful to make a deep comparison to one of the most outstanding
examples of such a dialogue, that in Taiwan, China.

2.3. Industry dialogues and policy innovators: The example of Taiwan, China
Taiwan possesses a multi-layered system of industrial dialogues. Its achievements in the
electronics system design and manufacturing industry would be impressive for any economy; they
are even more impressive for a small island, about one-third the size of New York State. With a
population of roughly 18 million people in 1980, less than half the size of South Korea’s 38 million
in the same year,187 Taiwan lacked a large and sophisticated market, specialized capabilities and
support industries, and the science and technology infrastructure necessary for manufacturing and
developing technologically demanding electronics products. Initially, SMEs dominated the
industry, with limited resources and capabilities and a limited capacity to influence pricing or
shape the development of markets and technological change.

To overcome these dual disadvantages of small size of economy and firm, Taiwan’s industrial
policy developed early on strong linkages between government-supported research institutes,
industry associations, and private industry. The Electronic Research and Service Organization
(ERSO) of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) was the critical anchor institution
for fostering technology co-development, its diffusion and use for commercial-scale
manufacturing, and the creation of multiple domestic and international industrial dialogues.188

                                                                                                               65
Industry associations played a vital role as initiators, enablers and coordinators of industrial
dialogues. Of particular interest to India is the international orientation of Taiwan’s industry
associations in the electronics industry. Consider the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association
(TSIA), which seeks, among other goals, not only “to promote cooperation among different sectors
in the local semiconductor industry”, but also “to participate in global standard setting and
activities related to the development of the semiconductor industry”. Likewise, it sees its key role
as a bridge, as much or more than as a lobbyist, seeking to “engage in international negotiations
on behalf of the local industry”, but also to “create better communications among its member
companies and with other industry associations.”189

As another example, take the Chinese American Semiconductor Professional Association
(CASPA).190 Founded in 1991 as a professional association of Taiwanese semiconductor
engineers, CASPA has developed into the largest Chinese American semiconductor professional
organization worldwide. It consists of more than four thousand individual members, corporate
sponsors, board of directors, board of advisors, board of volunteers, and honorary advisors.
Headquartered in Silicon Valley, it has nine local chapters worldwide, and more than 70 corporate
sponsors, from EDA and design firms, to foundries, venture capital, science and technology park
companies, and legal and financial service companies located in the US, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
China, Singapore and Japan.

CASPA’s international orientation has made an important contribution to the exposure of Taiwan’s
electronics industry to leading-edge technology and management practices. It has also provided an
excellent mechanism for worldwide networking and knowledge sharing.

The promotion of associations of this nature, as well as their integration into the policy process,
has immensely strengthened the ability of policymaking in Taiwan to respond realistically to
global trends. For example, in recent years it has become clear that Taiwan’s prior industrial
development model is reaching its limitations, unless appropriate policies are put in place to
develop domestic capabilities for low-cost innovation both at the firm level and across the
industry.191 In response, Taiwan has devised a new electronics industry policy that combines
market-led innovation and public policy coordination of multiple layers of industry dialogues
between private and public industry stakeholders.

Due to its pragmatism and openness to new forms of public policy and private-public partnerships,
Taiwan’s new policy may in fact serve as a benchmark for India’s attempts to enhance the impact
of India’s support policies for the electronics industry. Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) for instance promotes what they call “policy innovators”. These are government officials
who are incentivized to not only design a particular regulation, but also to take personal

responsibility in enabling across the life cycle of this regulation its effective implementation and
also to ensure flexible adjustments where necessary.

The Ministry’s Industrial Technology Development Program has various mission-oriented
working groups on specific projects such as “smart electronics” or “streamlined manufacturing
technology”. These meet regularly in specialized forums with mid-level participants from
industry, associations, academia and government agencies that develop and implement pre-
competitive cooperative research agendas and implementation schedules.192 They seek in
particular to integrate the R&D resources of research institutes, academia, and industry.

Another feature of Taiwan’s industrial policy process in the electronics industry is the outsourcing
of many policy making functions to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) and the
Chunghua Institution of Economic Research (CIER). These are think tanks created by MOEA,
and are tasked to design and implement policy and regulations in cooperation with industry and
industry associations.

Final features of note are the use of regular, repeated “committees” for consensus building among
ministries and experts from academia, industry associations and private firms; as well as
“seminars” on highly advanced topics, which are actively used for content-based interaction with
the private sector.193

In other words, Taiwan’s policy process is characterized by a proliferation of institutions; their
coming together in repeated, frequent and multi-level forums, oriented towards programs, projects
and substantive content; and a globally-facing, international orientation throughout. This has
created Taiwan’s capacity for a gradual evolution of industrial policy and for flexible adjustments
in response to changes in markets and technology, based on thorough preparation.194

Overall, this model differs from India’s previous, ad hoc and personality driven “advisory
councils”, composed of eminent people, where unpredictable personal dynamics can dictate policy
formulation. For instance, the “technical evaluation committees” for the NPE’s Modified Special
Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) contain mostly government officials, one or two academics
(often from the same institution), and a few representatives of large and established firms. Missing
are India’s diverse electronics industry associations, as well as smaller firms and start-up
companies.

It is important however to emphasize some recent positive examples that indicate a move towards
broader industry representation in NPE policy initiatives. A recent example is the Brainstorming
Session on Indigenous Product Design and Development of Digital Set Top Boxes, co-organized
on May 9, 2012 by the Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India and

IESA.195 Out of 43 members of this Working Group, 29 are from industry, with representation
from three industry associations (CII, IESA and CEAMA). Another recent example is the Meeting
to Ascertain the Manufacturing Capabilities of LED/LED based Lighting Products in India,196
convened by DEITy on May 17, 2013. Out of 17 participants, 12 participants were from industry,
with representation from same three industry associations.

It will be critical that these initial steps are strengthened and furthered, becoming regular and
repeated dialogues focused on tangible actions, as opposed to a series of once-off actions.

3.4. The role of industry associations
As noted in the discussion above, strong associations are a sine qua non of a robust industrial
dialogue. Reflecting this, during the interviews many respondents argued that the role of industry
associations in shaping policy formulation and regulations deserves much greater attention. Within
India’s electronics industry, there is a surprisingly large number of partially over-lapping
associations, both at the central level and for individual states, giving rise to a significant
fragmentation. Too many associations with over-lapping constituencies and mandates may reduce
the voice and influence of individual associations.

Furthermore, associations differ substantially in the type of services they provide, and in their
implementation capacity. For instance, associations like ELCINA and CEAMA have to devote a
large share of their limited resources on fixing problems caused by “ground-level implementation
of regulations and corruption” and on navigating import consignments through custom authorities.
In addition to being forced to fix the endless delays, queries and quarrels, these associations try to
lobby for subsidies to counter what they estimate to be a 10 to 12 percent “disability cost” of
domestic electronics manufacturing.

But ELCINA, for example, has played an active role in shaping and implementing the NPE’s
Electronics Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) policies. Specifically, it is working on three clusters:
outside Delhi, in Bangalore, and in Chennai.197 It also explicitly seeks to overcome the lack of
inter-agency communication within the government. For instance, at present EMC grants cannot
cover housing, since, (a) public housing is a separate mandate of a different ministry (silos again),
and (b) there is fear of subsidized housing speculation. In general, ELCINA also states that it
seeks to provide industrial dialogue services, from disseminating information to training programs
and seminars.198

A similar role is sought by IESA. Since 2009, IESA has been making a conscious effort to co-
shape the NPE. It has broadened its membership to include both leading MNCs and domestic
companies which are active across the semiconductor value chain. ISEA argues that this has had
a positive effect on the sophistication and pragmatism of policy concepts in the NPE, including
the Fab Policy (on which more below).

    The latter two clusters are in fact in AP, rather than TN or KT, due to steep land price differences

                                                                                                           68
Overall, IESA has three main pillars of activities: events, industry research, and government
interface. Its marketing material highlights for instance the following “Industrial Dialogue”
objectives:
     Create global awareness for the Indian semiconductor and electronic systems industry
        outside of the generic ‘IT’ umbrella;
     Create a win-win interaction among semiconductor and electronics product and
        services companies, government, academia, venture capitalists and industry bodies;
     Create an enabling ecosystem that catalyzes industry growth and leadership; and,
     Foster active collaboration between industry and universities to further expand the
        available world class semiconductor talent pool.199

In addition, ISEA seeks to reduce possible trade conflicts with major trading powers, by
disseminating information on key initiatives of India’s NPE (for example, seeking to play a
mediating and transmitting role in the controversial PMA). On the other hand, it remains to be
seen whether this is ISEA claiming greater influence than it has in reality, or whether they can play
a useful role in recalibrating policies to the requirements of WTO and the need to attract technology
transfer through FDI.

These two associations are considered here simply as examples. Others, such as MAIT, CEAMA
and CLIK, have also been referenced above. It is of course a complex and difficult question as to
what types of policies, or other actions, can support the development of capabilities in these
associations so that they can bear the weight of being strong partners in the policy process. One
element must be the response of Government itself: if dialogue results more often in easy subsidy
schemes, rather than difficult reforms, the associations will naturally privilege lobbying for
subsidies. On the other hand, many firms themselves seem to be disaffected with the associations,
with tense relationships to association management.

As the implementation of the NPE proceeds, and as more difficult topics are addressed, it may be
useful to consciously shape responses to the associations, promote responsive internal governance
in them, and involve them in difficult tasks. One of the most important, yet difficult tasks will be
to create and implement a more strategic role for standards.

3. Policies to Implement the Strategic Role of Standards
3.1. Why standards are critical for latecomer industrialization
Standardization is often regarded primarily as a technical issue, and hence receives only limited
high-level policy support. However, technical standards contribute at least as much as patents to
economic growth. As a key mechanism for the diffusion of technological knowledge, technical
standards contribute to productivity growth. The macroeconomic benefits of standardization thus
exceed the benefits to companies alone. For Germany, a widely quoted study conducted for the
German Institute for Standardization (DIN) finds that a 1 percent increase in the stock of standards
is positively associated with a 0.7 to 0.8 percent change in economic growth.200

But these econometric studies only scratch the surface. Equally important are qualitative impacts,
such as those of environmental, health, food and work safety standards. In fact, broad qualitative
impacts of standards are essential for latecomer economic development – a well-functioning
standardization system and strategy can work as a catalyst for translating new ideas, inventions
and discoveries into productivity-enhancing innovation. Standards are the missing link in a growth
strategy which seeks to create quality jobs in higher-value added advanced manufacturing and
services.201 However, there are an almost infinite number of standards that differ in their form and
purpose.

This poses an especially demanding challenge for countries which only recently begun to build up
their standards systems and strategies. Furthermore, rapid and disruptive technical change (such
as the transition to the Internet of Everything202) creates new challenges for standardization. Of
critical importance are interoperability standards that are necessary to transfer and render useful
data and other information across geographically dispersed systems, organizations, applications,
or components.203 This process has increased the economic importance of standardization, but
especially so for emerging economies such as India which are latecomers to industrial
manufacturing and innovation, but at the same time deeply integrated into international trade,
capital markets and foreign direct investment.

To shed light on the evolving tasks of standardization, an operational definition will be useful. A
state-of-the-art definition that serves the purpose can be taken from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US as part of its Smart Grid Interoperability Standards
project: Standards are
        …[s]pecifications that establish the fitness of a product for a particular use or that
        define the function and performance of a device or system. Standards are key
        facilitators of compatibility and interoperability. … Interoperability…[is].. the
        capability of two or more networks, systems, devices, applications, or components to
        exchange and readily use … meaningful, actionable information - securely, effectively,
        and with little or no inconvenience to the user. … [Specifically, standards] define
        specifications for languages, communication protocols, data formats, linkages within
        and across systems, interfaces between software applications and between hardware
        devices, and much more. Standards must be robust so that they can be extended to
        accommodate future applications and technologies.204

At the most fundamental level, standards help to ensure the quality and safety of products, services
and production processes, and to prevent negative impacts on health and the environment. In
addition, standards enable companies to reap the growth and productivity benefits of increasing
specialization.

Today however, specialization extends well beyond trade into manufacturing and services,
including engineering, product development and research. Equally important is the international
dimension. As globalization has been extended beyond markets for goods and finance into markets
for technology and knowledge workers, standards are no longer restricted to national boundaries.
Standards have become a critical enabler of international trade and investment – they facilitate
data exchange as well as knowledge sharing among geographically dispersed participants within
global corporate networks of production and innovation.205

In short, standards are the lifeblood of latecomer industrialization. For countries like India, a robust
system of developing technical standards is necessary not only to reap economies of scale and
scope, but also to reduce transaction costs and to prevent a duplication of efforts.

At the same time, standardization has become a complex and multi-layered activity that involves
multiple stakeholders who differ in their objectives, strategies, resources and capabilities. Most
importantly, standardization is a highly knowledge-intensive activity that requires well educated
and experienced engineers and other professionals. While engineers originally created this
discipline, key concepts are now shaped by legal counselors as well as corporate executives and
government officials.

This implies that an effective system of standardization for latecomer industrialization requires
close cooperation between industry, government, academia and non-governmental organizations
that represent broader interests of society. And within industry, there are different stakeholders
with conflicting interests that reflects differences in size, ownership patterns and business model,
but also whether firms are standards users, implementers or developers.

3.2. Latecomer standardization is costly
As well as sophisticated processes and a variety of skills, considerable financial resources are
required to develop and implement effective standards. A rough estimate of such costs can be
gained from a stylized model that distinguishes important tasks of standardization and that
highlights differences in capability sets and in standardization strategies.206 Table 6 in Appendix
One highlights important tasks of standards development. Typically, tasks 1, 3 and 4 are the most
costly, but in case of litigation, legal costs in the US can easily run into the hundreds of millions
of dollars.

As for the capabilities required to undertake these tasks, consider a simple model that distinguishes
two countries. Country A (the “innovator”) has a long history of standardization; a proven ability
to operate successfully within standardization bodies and to shape international standards; a fairly
diversified production and innovation system; and a broad base of accumulated knowledge and

IPR that helps to generate product and process innovations. Country A thus is able to “control
much of the technological input necessary to meet the standards.”207 As a result, a primary concern
of law and policies in country A is the protection of IPR, and the “openness” of standards is
subordinated to IPR protection.

Country B (the “latecomer to standardization”), on the other hand, is a relative latecomer to
standardization. Country B is a standard taker, manufacturing products that are developed and
standardized by Country A. Country B still has to learn how to operate successfully within
standardization bodies. Most importantly, Country B still has a long way to go to establish a fairly
diversified production and innovation system and a broad base of accumulated knowledge and IPR
that would allow it to shape or at least co-shape international standards. In country B, laws and
policies are focused on economic development and the diffusion of knowledge inherent in IPR.
Standardization is viewed as an enabling platform for innovation and latecomer economic
development.

In principle, these countries and the firms within them can then choose one of the following
standardization strategies described in Table 7, Appendix One (or a combination of them).
Country A and its leading firms are likely to pursue standards leader or co-shaper strategies, while
Country B and its leading firms will initially focus on free rider or fast follower standardization
strategies.

In sum, latecomer economies such as India face opportunities and challenges in their standards
and innovation policies that differ quite considerably from the opportunities and challenges faced
in today’s advanced economies. Latecomers typically are standards takers, and have a long way to
go in their efforts to shape or at least co-shape international standards. Latecomers also typically
are more vulnerable to the impact of “strategic patenting” strategies that large patent holder s use
to generate rents from controlling de facto industry standards.

Latecomers also lag behind advanced economies in their standardization capabilities, and hence
are likely to face higher costs of developing and disseminating effective standards. At the same
time, ubiquitous globalization and rapid and disruptive technical change (such as the rising
complexity of digital networks) create new challenges for standardization. No Indian electronics
company can succeed in international trade without mastering interoperability standards that are
necessary to transfer and render useful data and other information across geographically dispersed
systems, organizations, applications, or components.

The response to this challenge is not a once-off, pseudo-optimal “national strategy for standards”,
or similar, but the development of a strategic approach towards standards that allows continual
tweaking. The reasons for this are threefold.

First, in a world of rising complexity and uncertainty, it is always preferable to have built-in
redundancy and freedom to choose among alternatives rather than seeking to impose from the top
the “one best way” of doing things. Rising complexity drastically reduces the time available for
standards development and implementation, which makes it practically impossible to get solutions

right the first time. There may have to be many policy iterations, based on trial and error, and an
extended dialogue with all stakeholders to find out what works and what doesn’t.

Second, rising complexity also makes it difficult to predict the possible outcomes of any particular
policy measure, especially unexpected negative side effects, of which there is an almost endless
variety. In fact, a small change in one policy variable that describes a particular procedure for
achieving compliance with a particular standard can have far-reaching and often quite unexpected
disruptive effects on many other policy variables and outcomes.

Third, it is next to impossible to predict the full consequence of interactions among an increasingly
diverse population of both domestic and international standardization stakeholders. Given the
diversity of competing stakeholders in standardization, the results of a particular national standards
policy depends much more on negotiations, gaming, and compromises than on the logical clarity
and technical elegance of that policy.

3.3. India’s standardization system
How does India fare compared to these requirements of standardization for latecomer
industrialization? While standards systems in China, Korea, and Taiwan have been extensively
studied,208 there is no systematic study of India’s national standardization system to the author’s
knowledge. A recent background study prepared for the US National Academies was intended to
assess the status and challenges faced by India’s standardization system, but unfortunately that
study provides no more than a superficial description of existing institutions, without analyzing
the challenges and weaknesses of that system.209

The major challenge is to overcome the highly complex and fragmented institutional set-up of
India’s Standards and Conformity Assessment Bodies. The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) is
India’s official national standardization and certification body.210 BIS oversees the development
of Indian Standards (IS), coordinating input from various public and private sector stakeholders
through its technical committees. Today there are over 18,000 standards in the Indian market.211
In addition to these national standards, many other types of standards are used in India, including
those developed by ISO, IEC and other international standards developers, regional standards,
foreign national standards, and others.

However, despite this surface activity, India’s standard system remains fragmented and weak.
There are a number of other standard development organizations (SDOs) that overlap significantly
in terms of objectives, responsibility and coverage. For instance, the Department of Science and
Technology (DST) is supposed to promote new areas of Science and Technology and related
standards, and to play the role of a nodal department for organizing, coordinating and promoting
S&T activities in the country.212

The Quality Council of India (QCI) is designed as an autonomous body by the Government of
India to establish and operate a National Accreditation Structure for standards conformity
assessment bodies213. The National Accreditation Board for Testing & Calibration Laboratories
(NABL)214 provides accreditation services to laboratories that are performing tests / calibrations
in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025,215 while the National Accreditation Board for Certification
Bodies (NABCB)216 undertakes assessment and accreditation of Certification Bodies applying for
accreditation as per the Board’s criteria in line with international standards and guidelines. The
National Quality Control (NQC) organization is then also responsible for spreading awareness on
advantages of compliance to quality standards and continuous improvement.217

As for the electronics industry, a number of standards institutions compete for resources and
responsibilities. These include the Electronics & Information Technology Division Council
(LITD)218 of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the Telecommunications Engineering Center
(TEC),219 the Global ICT Standardization Forum for India (GISFI),220 and the Development
Organization of Standards for Telecommunications in India (DOSTI).221

Of the latter standard development organizations, GISFI and DOSTI seem to be most active,
involving both participation from industry and academia. It is noteworthy however that in the
interviews conducted for this study, most of the respondents were not or only vaguely familiar
with most of these organizations, with the exception of BIS, TEC, and DOSTI.

It is thus hardly surprising that the recently inaugurated Seconded European Standardization
Expert in India project, established by Europe’s leading Standardization Organizations,222 stated
that “India’s standardization system remains very complicated and the Technical Regulations are
still very intertwined with Technical Specifications, so it makes it sometimes quite difficult for
European exporters to understand the requirements that apply to their products.”223

This confusion about the purpose of India’s standards system and its division or labor is shared by
most of the interviewed companies. They report that India’s existing standards system is weak,
with the BIS considered under-resourced and not interacting enough with industry. Overall, they
feel strongly that the existing standards system needs to be strengthened and upgraded, both
financially and organizationally, so that firms can receive effective support from the use of quality
standards and certification requirements.

3.4. Government initiatives
Until recently, the critically important field of standardization has thus remained a “white space”
in policy development.

India’s government now explicitly acknowledges that bold changes are necessary in the
organization of the country’s standardization system. So far however the primary focus of policy-
making has been on developing robust safety standards and certification rules that can be used as
a trade policy instrument. There is still a fundamental neglect of the strategic role that technical
standards can play as a tool for developing and upgrading India’s electronics manufacturing
industry. A report prepared for the 12th Five Year Plan states unequivocally: “Lack of domestic
regulations and standards is a potential cause of import of substandard goods that may not only
put our consumers and environment at risk but also leads to an unfair and cut-throat competition
for the domestic manufacturing industry.”224

As a signatory to the WTO-Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreement, India agreed not to
implement technical requirements that create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
However, as the report states, the “Agreement provides flexibility for member countries to specify
the requirements in interest of national security, prevention of deceptive practices, protection of
human health or safety, animal or plant life or health, or the environment”.

With this flexibility, though with a somewhat narrow concept of India’s standardization strategy,
the above report recommends the following main policy initiatives:
     Mandating Standards. BIS needs to be strengthened to ensure availability of Indian
       standards for every finished electronic good and to mandate compliance to safety, EMC
       and RoHS standards in a phased manner. Furthermore, the Ministry’s DEITy needs to be
       strengthened to regulate standards and ensure compliance with established standards.
       DEITy should “create a specialized enforcement wing to handle fake, spurious, non-
       complying goods.”
     Upgrading Standards Infrastructure. It is necessary to develop a robust infrastructure for
       mandating, testing and certifying standards, by establishing recognized test and
       certification labs through public-private partnerships, and in cooperation with international
       agencies, such as ISO, IEC and international standards consortia.
     Implementation budget. In order to implement the reform of India’s standard system and
       to ensure effective enforcement of standards, the report suggested a Budget of Rs.275 crore

of the Working Group on Information Technology Sector Twelfth Five Year Plan: page 124

                                                                                                         75
        (approximately US$40 million225) over the Twelfth Five Year Plan for ensuring
        compliance of electronic products to standards of Safety and electromagnetic compatibility
        (EMC). Specifically, this budget would finance the establishment and upgrading of test
        and certification labs; support companies in covering the cost of accreditation, mutual
        recognition schemes, and participation in international standardization meetings and
        technical committees. In addition, this budget is supposed to cover the cost of standards
        education and training programs for industry participants, customs and border control
        agencies.

On the basis of these recommendations, DEITy has issued a number of notifications and
administrative guidelines that define requirements for the Compulsory Registration of standards,
the procedures for setting-up and upgrading electronic product testing and certification labs, and a
quite confusing number of additional administrative regulations.226

These standards-related regulations culminate in the Government’s Electronics and Information
Technology Goods (Requirement for Compulsory Registration) Order, 2012, that came into force
on July 3rd, 2013. That policy document describes its main strategic objectives as follows:
     Provide Indian consumers with the right to enjoy world class goods.
     Upgrade the quality of domestic products for bringing Global competitiveness.
     Develop strategy to stop dumping of non-compliant goods.
     For projecting a positive image internationally as a country with quality production of the
       Electronics & IT goods.

4. From Plan to Implementation – Recommendations for Improving India’s NPE
4.1. Objectives and policy tools
The NPE primarily sits within the context of India’s National Manufacturing Plan.227 This has
five objectives, from the creation of 100 million jobs to increasing technological depth.228 In order
to implement the Manufacturing Plan, the Planning Commission calls for a “new policy
paradigm”. In this, the main role of the central government is to provide a space for multi-layered
“Industrial Dialogues” in order to cope with the increasingly complex coordination requirements
of networked industrial manufacturing.
        Thus, the paradigm of policy planning in manufacturing must shift from ‘planning as
        allocations’ to ‘planning as learning’; and from budgets and controls towards
        improving processes for consultation and coordination. In India we have already given
        up the paradigm of allocations and quotas and there is no question of reverting to it.

        However, having not mastered the other paradigm yet, we are not able to grow our
        manufacturing sector as fast as we could.229

A related sector policy, the National Telecom Policy (NTP) 230 was approved in May 2012, and
includes initiatives like free roaming, national number portability, a new unified licensing regime
for operators, and a push for expanded broadband usage.

Of critical importance for India’s electronics manufacturing industry is that the NTP also seeks to
increase local manufacturing of telecom equipment from its current embryonic state. In particular
it seeks to “promote indigenous R&D, innovation and manufacturing to reduce dependency on
imports and enhance exports.” The specific goal is to establish a “complete value chain for
domestic production of telecommunication equipment to meet Indian telecom sector demand to
the extent of 60% and 80% with a minimum value addition of 45% and 65% by the year 2017 and
2020 respectively”. It seeks to use preferential procurement, keeping consistent with key trade
agreements, as well as stronger standards and IPRs to achieve these ends.231 However, while these
are all laudable and long overdue initiatives, the policy document does not provide specific details
regarding when and how the initiatives will be implemented.

The NPE itself was approved by the Government of India in October 2012, and seeks to create “a
globally competitive Electronic System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) industry. ” The
objective at the time was to increase “domestic production” to US$122 billion by 2017, with
US$20 billion in exports.232 Expected direct employment effects were projected to be 3.5 million,
while indirect employment effects were expected to add up to 6.5 million.

It is noteworthy that the official notification of the NPE, published in November 2012, stated the
significantly higher objectives for the overall ESDM industry, without specifying how much of
those target figures would actually be attributable to electronics manufacturing. By 2020, the
ESDM industry is targeted to achieve a turnover of US$400 billion involving investment of about
US$100 billion, ESDM exports of US$80 billion (up from US$ 5.5.billion in 2012) and
employment to around 28 million people.233

In addition to those quantitative targets, the NPE document seeks to accomplish a range of
qualitative goals, including: improving governance mechanisms; creating robust institutional
mechanisms for standards; fostering frugal innovation; and supporting innovative start-ups.

These objectives are unusually ambitious, especially when compared to the speed of developing
electronics manufacturing industries in economies such as Korea, China, and Taiwan. In less than
ten years, India seeks to build an integrated domestic electronics value chain, a process that took
decades in Korea, Taiwan and China.

In terms of the financial requirements, the NPE budget for the period 2012 to 2017 is proposed to
cover the an outlay of Rs.33,375 crore, or almost US$5 billion. Of this, almost a third is allocated
to the semiconductor wafer initiative, almost two thirds to various incentive and infrastructure
schemes, and the remainder to other initiatives.

4.2. Industry perceptions
An important finding is that most firms know very little about the specific policy tools of NPE and
the current status of their implementation. A typical response is that the announcement of NPE
signals a long overdue step in the right direction. But most interviewees reserved judgment due to
lack of information on when and how those policies would be implemented.

Interviewees were most aware of PMA and the Electronics Development Fund (EDF) and rated
such schemes as potentially useful for developing the industry, provided these schemes were
executed properly. Only a few interviewees raised concerns about non-compliance with WTO
obligations, and there were no suggestions that the Government needed to develop new and
sophisticated policy approaches to trade, FDI, international standards and trade rules. This likely
reflects the limited international orientation of India’s electronics manufacturing industry.

The wafer fab scheme attracts much attention, but most interviewees confessed that they know
little about the current status of implementation. Furthermore, the Fab policy invited very different
responses as to how effective wafer fabs would be in developing the industry, and what specific
types of fabs would deserve priority.234

Noteworthy exceptions to the lack of NPE awareness are a few companies that have a material
interest in the development of a domestic electronics manufacturing industry. An illustrative
example is the following quote from an international EDA tool provider:
        Yes, I am familiar. In fact, I was part of the report that was published by DEITy in 2009
        (the task force report which was a joint effort by IESA, ELCINA, MAIT etc.). We had
        given 99 recommendations, which were cut down to 14 by DEITy. Five out of these 14
        recommendations can be seen in the NPE which are: EMC (Electronics Manufacturing

        Cluster), Fab Policy, Modified – Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), PMA,
        and EDF.

It is widely acknowledged by interviewees that, at least on paper, a holistic approach is now in
place. There are however concerns that the Government is primarily driven by macro-economic
factors and the widening trade gap, and that it neglects the fundamental structural flaws of India’s
electronics manufacturing industry, primarily its weak and incomplete eco-system. According to
a domestic EMS provider,
        [t]he Indian electronics hardware industry has a lot of missing links which are
        retarding its growth and only setting up of the whole ecosystem can stop that. Ideally
        this should have been done 25 years ago but better late than never. Look at the textile
        industry; we have the whole ecosystem and thus the industry is generating employment
        and is successful. The same is the case with automotive industry; it is doing most of the
        value addition in India itself. But the work done by the electronics industry is restricted
        to low value adding activities like assembly.

There is a widespread consensus that components manufacturing is the most critical bottleneck
that should deserve priority attention of the NPE. Most interviewees however emphasize a gradual
approach to building a more integrated electronics ecosystem.

4.3. Priority products
The NPE provides two somewhat conflicting objectives for the Government’s choice of Priority
Products. On the one hand, there is the legacy of India’s public sector defense electronics complex.
An important objective of NPE is “… [t]o progressively increase the domestic productio n of the
requirements of strategic sectors, namely, defense, atomic energy and space through domestic
production, through appropriate combination of public sector and private sector.”235 On the other
hand, NPE places considerable emphasis on “large-volume” production, identifying explicitly the
following five priority products:236 cheap “budget smart phones”; set-top boxes (STB); flat-panel
displays (FPD) and tablets; optoelectronics (and especially LED); and smart meters (for
deployment in smart electrical grids).

The underlying assumption is that India’s huge demand for these devices and the projected rapid
growth of these domestic markets will induce massive investments in large-scale production lines
that will generate economies of scale and scope, and hence enable domestic production to compete
with China-based mass production lines.

As discussed in Chapter One of this study, there may still be some space in a few select industry
segments for late entrants like India to focus on “high-volume, low-value” production lines.
However, global transformations in information technology and markets are defining a new
manufacturing imperative for India. Unlike China and other earlier industrial latecomers from
Asia, India can no longer rely exclusively on “high volume, low cost” manufacturing as the main
strategic option for expanding its electronics manufacturing industry. Instead, India’s NPE should

seek to create new space for an alternative industrial manufacturing paradigm - “low-volume, high-
value” production.

It is noteworthy that in the interviews, only a minority of respondents were clearly favoring this
alternative “low-volume, high-value” manufacturing paradigm. They argued that a focus on low
volume, high complexity products would face less immediate competition from China and would
leverage India’s strengths in IC design and related capabilities. Examples of implementing such a
low-volume, high-value manufacturing approach included frugal innovations in medical
equipment and domestic production of strategic and defense products.

The overwhelming majority of interviewees, however, insisted on emphasizing large-volume
production, as “high volumes will incentivize development of component ecosystem”, as
“components account for a huge chunk of India’s import bill”.

Some respondents offered a more differentiated view, including some concrete suggestions. For
example, some suggested adding smart cards to the NPE’s list of priority products. This suggestion
came from both domestic smart card producers, and foreign (Japanese) producers of substrates.
However, the same respondents noted that at present almost half of the domestic capacity for smart
cards is lying idle, and that policies should focus on developing security standards that would
provide disciplined protection for such production, rather than attempting a “race to the bottom”
with huge subsidies to make production cost competitive.

Another strong suggestion was to add medical devices to the list. Supporting this is the rapid
growth of the Indian medical devices market valued at Rs.17,742 crore (US$3.3 billion) in 2011,237
but imports currently cover nearly three quarters of this demand. India faces a huge and rapidly
growing need for affordable medical devices in the country. In addition, India’s stren gths in IC
design could facilitate entry into the design and development of India-specific medical devices
that meet the specific requirements of local conditions, i.e., “frugal innovation”.

4.4. The Semiconductor Wafer Fab Policy
India’s attempts to establish domestic wafer fab lines have a long but checkered history. In 1983,
the Government decided to establish a full-scale wafer fab, called The Semiconductor Complex
Limited (SCL) in Chandigarh.238 Despite high expectations, the project failed to become a serious
player in the wafer fab industry. In the early 1980s SCL entered into a technical collaboration with
the American Microsystems Inc., but the fab remained far behind the leading-edge in wafer size
and process technology.

In 2007, the Government made yet another attempt and announced an ambitious plan to foster
wafer fabrication along with the production of other products such as PV solar cells and liquid
crystal display panels (LCDs). The initial response was limited. While the Government received
proposals worth US$6.2 billion, none were for setting up chip manufacturing. In fact, SemIndia, a
Consortium created to bid for a US$3 billion chip-making facility in Hyderabad, has never

submitted its proposal.239 Negotiations with Intel, which had indicated its interest to invest in a
wafer fab line in India, ended in failure, with Intel claiming that the “government dragged its heels
on introducing an investment policy on semiconductors.”240

In response, and seeking to learn from these prior attempts, NPE’s Semiconductor Wafer Fab
Policy was designed by a Committee, established in April 2011, to identify technology and
investors for setting up two semiconductor wafer fabrication (Fab) manufacturing facilities.241

Fab-1 was intended to use “established technology to support fabrication of varieties of chips to
meet the requirement of high volume products as well as the requirement of the fab-less design
companies on pay per use basis. This activity may involve either setting up a plant in India with
established technology or acquiring an existing fab abroad and its relocation to India. The
Government support needed for either of the options would have to be negotiated.”242 In contrast,
Fab-2 was to be set up “as a green field cutting edge state-of-the-art facility. This would require
provisions for giving equity / grant to an established Integrated Device Manufacturer to establish
its fabrication facility in India. The amount of equity / grant would have to be negotiated.”243

As for the budget, the Committee estimated that the two fabs would require an investment of
roughly Rs.25,000 Crore (around US$5 billion), and adds: “The exact level of Government support
could be finalized by way of negotiations. The Government support could be by way of equity/
grant/ subsidy in physical/ financial terms.”244

As the Wafer Fab policy is a signature plank of the NPE, it has received substantial attention during
the interviews. Companies were specifically asked the following questions:
     Would it facilitate your business if local fabs existed, i.e. would it reduce your cost, time-
        to-market, and would it facilitate investment in new product development?
     What type of fab would be most conducive for your efforts to expand and upgrade their
        operations?
            o mature process technology based on second-hand fab equipment
            o analog fab
            o leading-edge digital wafer fab with minimum investment cost of $ 4 billion
     Is it realistic to focus on leading-edge fabs? Should India try to mobilize the huge
        investments required for such bleeding-edge technology, given the extreme volatility
        especially of markets for memory devices?

239
    DIT had received three proposals under the 2007 fab policy, including the first-ever LCD panel unit in India to be
set up by Videocon at an investment of $1.8 billion. The other two were proposals for photo-voltaic cell
manufacturing units by Moser Baer ($3.2 billion) and Titan Energy Systems ($1.2 billion). The department has also
received 14 enquiries, of which 3-4 are for chip manufacturing. http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2007-

         Would it be more realistic to focus on analog fabs that need less advanced process
          technology than leading-edge digital wafer fabs?

Most interviewees accepted the strategic rationale for investing in a diverse portfolio of domestic
fabs in order to reduce the unsustainably high import dependence on semiconductors. Setting up
wafer fab lines in India would help to reduce the cost and the time involved in procuring
semiconductor chips from abroad, which will be especially useful for manufacturing start-ups. As
semiconductors are strategic components, having virtually no manufacturing presence might lead
to future over-reliance on imports. The huge import bills for semiconductors which are expected
to keep growing can be reduced if domestic wafer fab capabilities are established. The
establishment of a fab would also be a critical step in creating an integrated value chain for
electronics in India, and the experience gained by the Indian design companies when working in
close coordination with domestic fabs will add significantly to their design capabilities

But many interviewees also expressed concern whether an effective execution strategy is in place
to cope with substantial implementation barriers. Not only would it be necessary to import the
extremely costly fab production equipment, but India also would need to import the intangible
knowledge that is necessary to run fabs cost-effectively. As a result, the overall life-cycle cost of
running a leading-edge fab would likely be enormous. And this is an industry that is extremely
cyclical and often quite unpredictable. In addition, India’s poor logistics network may often mean
that less time may be required to procure chips from Taiwan or even China than for domestic
procurement. There is excess capacity available at most fabs in China and Japan, so running a
profitable fab may not be easy. Overall, there is a widespread concern that the very high capital
expenditure involved and the excess capacity available globally would make it very difficult to
generate a fast payback on the investment.

In short, investing in domestic wafer fab lines, especially those for leading-edge 450mm wafer
with 22nm technology and below, poses huge risks. One such risk is power disruption - even slight
disruptions in power supply can have devastating effects on yields, and may require costly and
time-consuming recalibration of equipment.

Another fundamental risk is the extremely high water consumption of wafer fabs. For instance, a
leading-edge wafer fab today “uses anywhere between 2 to 4 million gallons of very, very pure
water — we call it ultrapure water — per day, and that, on the average, is roughly equivalent to
the water usage of a city of maybe 40,000 to 50,000 people.”245 In light of India’s severe water
shortage,246 this is hardly an attractive proposition.

The water shortage is especially severe in Bangalore,247 which initially was one of the primary
candidates for locating India’s wafer fab. As a result, on August 26, 2013, the State government

of Karnataka stated: “Much as we would have wanted the prestigious project to be based in
Bangalore, which has perhaps the best ecosystem for electronics manufacturing in the country, we
would be unable to host it because of the heavy demand it would place on water resources.”248

Another fundamental risk is that India, as a latecomer to wafer fabrication, will need quite some
time and significant investments to develop a capacity for handling the toxic waste that
accompanies wafer fabrication.249

Some interviewees emphasize that establishing diverse domestic fabs will take time. All the more
important would it be to develop a portfolio of diverse policies with different time perspectives,
with the careful selection of pilot projects that will produce results soon.

No final decisions have been made at the time of writing this study, and decisions and policy
statements seem to be in continued flux. On September 13, the Indian Government, chaired by the
Prime Minister has given “in-principle approval” of the two competing consortia offers of setting-
up two chip fabrication units.250 Yet, few details have been announced since then. According to
India’s Telecom Minister, “Cabinet has in-principle also approved that incentives that will be
given to these players, will be offered to other players (as well) who are interested in setting up
semiconductor plant here… Incentives...are already covered under existing policies, which
account for about 62 per cent and the balance 38 per cent is in form of loan provision, which is
refundable. The burden on government will be only interest charges.”

In short, the formal announcement is yet to come – the waiting is not yet over. As for the level of
Government support for these units, this will be decided through future negotiation with chip
makers. This is where negotiations with Intel in 2007 were before they went astray.

If a decision would be taken that one of the fabs would be producing analog devices, this would
have quite substantial advantages:
     Cost effectiveness: Analog fabs are much more cost effective than digital fabs. While the
        digital fab may cost billions of dollars in just the setup costs, not to mention the millions
        to be spent in operational expenses each year, an analog fab can be set up in the cost range
        of hundreds of millions of dollars.
     Close co-ordination and design skills: Analog chip design involves close coordination with
        the chip manufacturer and in this regard, having a local fab can help tremendously in
        growing the capabilities of the Indian design industry.

The strategy for a pragmatic approach is in line with research on the economics of wafer
fabrication. For instance, a leading-edge 300mm Fab typically requires a US$9 - US$12 billion

your own risk! We really don’t have water for those areas.” http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/07/26/water-

revenue threshold.251 That threshold is substantially higher still for the emerging 450mm Fabs.
India is at least 5 to 10 years away from being such a market. In addition, if one takes into account
the widely discussed technical challenges that even the global industry leader Intel faces in its
transition to 22nm and 14 nm process technology, then it becomes clear why leapfrogging into
22nm fabs with 450mm wafer size is unlikely to be a realistic proposition for India, versus a
strategy of diversified fabs, while capabilities are built up.

4.5. Industry views and recommendations on other NPE support policies
On paper, the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS) scheme is an ambitious
incentive package to “offset disability and attract investments in large-scale manufacturing in the
Electronics System Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) Industries.”252 The scheme “provides
subsidy for investments in capital expenditure – 20% for investments in SEZs and 25% in non-
SEZs. It also provides for reimbursement of CVD/excise for capital equipment for the non-SEZ
units. For high technology and high capital investment units, like fabs, reimbursement of central
taxes and duties is also provided. The incentives are available for investments made in a project
within a period of ten years from the date of approval.”

Until 2020, the NPE seeks to attract investments of around US$100 billion, leaving open however
how much of this should go specifically into electronics manufacturing. For the FY2013/2014, a
target has been set to attract investments of Rs.25,000 crore (approximately US$4 billion).
However, by August 2013, the government has received investment proposals worth roughly
Rs.4,600 crore (or US$700 million) awaiting clearance, less than 20 percent of the budget
allocation.

In contrast to the optimism projected by the Ministry, most interviewees confessed to know little
about the NPE’s M-SIPS, and thus were reluctant to share their assessments. As this is a central
building block of implementing NPE, this low awareness is a worrying finding.

To implement NPE and to increase its effectiveness, the Government would need to simplify the
current somewhat ambiguous M-SIPS scheme. Equally important, the Government, together with
industry associations, needs to make a concerted effort to disseminate information on this
potentially important incentive scheme.

An important objective of NPE is to “provide world-class infrastructure for attracting investments
in the Electronics Systems Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector..., [to] … encourage
development of entrepreneurial ecosystem, drive innovation and catalyze the growth of electronics
manufacturing.”253 The proposed Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) scheme “would

support setting up both Greenfield (new) and Brownfield (existing clusters) EMCs.”254 For
Greenfield EMCs, “the assistance will be restricted to 50% of the project cost subject to a ceiling
of Rs.50 crore (US$10 million) for every 100 acres of land. For Brownfield EMCs the assistance
will be restricted to 75% of the project cost subject to a ceiling of Rs.50 crore.”255

In the interviews, companies were asked whether the proposed EMC scheme could replicate the
earlier success of similar schemes for software, and how it should differ from them. Most
respondents cited major problems with the scheme such as its potential for creating land scams,
the unrealistic selection of cluster locations, and the unattractive conditions for EMCs, especially
start-ups. A minority of respondents agreed that clusters are necessary as islands of good
infrastructure in a developing economy, and pointed to the success of India’s car components
industry, and the huge benefits that Taiwanese and Chinese firms historically were able to reap
from such manufacturing zones.

Overall, the scheme replicates many of the features of the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks
(SITP), originated by the Ministry of Textiles. This scheme has been notably more successful than
prior programs to develop industrial parks and zones in India, and has in fact avoided some of the
problems that respondents identified.256 On the one hand, this could indicate that – in line with a
common theme – firms are not fully aware of the details of the program. On the other, the EMCs
have differed from the SITP on a few crucial dimensions, including allowing a more active role in
location selection by organizations that are not entrepreneurs themselves (e.g., state industrial
development corporations and associations). These may be the causes for the reported unattractive
locations of the currently projected EMCs.

To improve the effectiveness of the EMC scheme, the state governments need to adjust and tweak
the EMC program, preferably through the type of industrial dialogue process described above.

The Electronics Development Fund (EDF) could potentially help to strengthen the weak
innovation capacity of India’s electronics manufacturing industry. It would create a dedicated
fund to support seed, angel and venture funding, with an initial corpus of Rs.5,000 crore
(approximately US$800 million). This proposed fund is now with Ministry of Finance, and, at
present, its status is still under discussion.

In principle, the EDF could become a powerful policy tool to foster the upgrading of India’s
electronics industry through innovation. However, to strengthen the impact of EDF, experience
from elsewhere suggests the importance of emphasizing commercial success criteria as well as
institutional innovations that facilitate this focus.

Lessons could be learned from other innovation funds worldwide – both those specific to the
electronics manufacturing industry and broader ones. In the US, for instance, the Small Business
Innovation Research Program (SBIR) is one of the most effective tools in the US government’s
kit for stimulating innovation. SBIR is the world’s largest seed capital program for science and
technology businesses. As a source of early stage finance, SBIR is probably at least as important
in value terms as venture capital. However, unlike most venture capital investments, SBIR awards
are available from right at the start of a business’s life.257

Program is shaped by a new policy approach, called “Smart Specialization” which seeks to develop
a more bottom-up approach to industrial policy that focuses on “entrepreneurial discovery” – an
interactive process in which market forces and the private sector are discovering and producing
information about new activities and the government assesses the outcomes and empowers those
actors most capable of realising the potential.259

Yet another possible benchmark is China, where the Government (through MIIT and NDRC) has
created a US$20 billion national investment fund for developing the indigenous semiconductor
industry in Beijing, Shenzhen and Chengdu.260 This fund is supposed to cover the whole industry
value chain (design, manufacturing, R&D, and industry consolidation/overseas mergers and
acquisitions). Of interest to India is that the above fund will be managed through a private
investment company.261
A draft proposal, published by DEITy in November 2012, highlights the following ambitious
objectives of EDF:
        There is an urgent need for intervention to promote and develop innovation, R&D,
        Indian IPR and manufacturing within the country for electronic products, which
        include telecom products, especially those having security implications. … The fund
        may be leveraged to acquire foreign companies so as to shift the production of products
        currently imported in large volumes, into the country. Some of the PSUs which are well

of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020) – in addition to the private investment that this money is expected
to attract. http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020

    The fund will exit five years after the investment is made, with a possible three-year extension. Sub-funds are to
be established by the main fund and partners, with a period of no less than 8 years. The Government (MIIT) will
select two fund management companies to raise, invest, and manage the Fund. One fund management company
would be responsible for the main fund (including the sub-fund for IC manufacturing), and another management
company would be responsible for the IC design sub-fund. (Author’s interviews, January 2014).

        managed professionally and accessible to both Government and private sector.262

Specifically, the EDF proposal recommends funding a quite extensive list of priority activities
related to electronics R&D. A few examples are263: the design and fabrication of an Indian
Microprocessor; the creation of a Manufacturing Value Addition Fund, to provide interest-linked
subsidies linked to domestic value addition; a seed fund to support start-ups; a fund to provide
multiplier grants for industry-academia linkages; a focused venture fund; and an equity / venture
fund to nurture solar PV start-ups and research projects.

However, there are only a few suggestions on how administrative processes and communication
with industry would need to change, in order to facilitate an efficient and speedy implementation
of the EDF proposals.

In the interviews, companies were asked what they know about the current status of EDF, and how
the EDF would need to be organized so that it could facilitate the entry of innovative start-up
companies into India’s electronics manufacturing industry.

Most interviewees acknowledged that they knew little about the details and current status of the
EDF scheme. Voices from industry display strong expectations mixed with quite substantial doubts
about whether such an ambitious scheme can be successfully and fairly implemented.

However, such doubts should not be taken as a fundamental barrier. Indeed, foreign venture capital
funds are themselves expressing interest in the EDF, and it may become one of the highest impact
initiatives within the NPE. What is clear is that if a fundamentally strengthened implementation
process is needed anywhere, it is with the EDF. As such, the committees and working groups that
will be necessary for its implementation will deserve sustained consideration, tilting strongly
towards the newer models of industry dialogue recently seen, rather than the older “business as
usual” models (see sections above).

5. Additional Policy Recommendations
5.1. Framework for policy recommendations
To enhance the effectiveness of NPE, both the Central government and the State governments
would need to implement the following additional policy recommendations. It is useful to
distinguish between “priority actions” and “fundamental process changes.”

“Priority actions” are actionable specific changes in regulation or support policies, e.g.,
implementing a national GST, engaging with and co-shaping ITA-2, increasing awareness of NPE,
and cutting tariffs on components.

                                                                                                          87
“Fundamental process changes” involve ongoing longer-term changes, e.g., revamping India’s
standardization system and the structure of standards-development organizations, generating more
sophisticated trade diplomacy, implementing a different inspection and dispute-resolution regime
for customs, and improving the existing architecture for electronics-industry working groups. A
distinction can also be made between outward facing and domestic recommendations, with the
former relating primarily to trade and FDI policy, as well as interactions with global public
organizations, such as the WTO, and international industry associations, such as private standards
consortia and the World Semiconductor Council. In turn, domestic recommendations relate
primarily to regulatory changes, support policies, and the interaction between government and
diverse segments of India’s electronics industry.

Needless to say, these distinctions are not binary opposites, as some actions will fall somewhere
in between the poles. The most notable example is standards: it is both outward facing, as being
globally set and a tool for trade policy, and inward facing, as a means to induce higher quality and
improved safety locally. Standards is also both a discrete action, with specific standards needed
urgently in such areas as medical electronics, and an ongoing process, as the standards setting
architecture needs to be revamped and the attitude to standards shift to be more strategic.

Finally, these categories depend on each other: most of the priority actions will not have long-term
impact without process changes, but likewise the process changes will be difficult to implement
without some priority target to create momentum for change and root them in action. An example
is tariffs and trade policy, which will have little long-term impact if firms continue to spend much
of their management time at customs arguing if an LCD module is duty free or not or managing a
web of shell companies to circumvent regulations.

5.2. What is success? Measuring industrial upgrading264
In general terms, industrial upgrading is about linking improvements in specialization, local value-
added, and forward and backward linkages265 with improvements in learning, absorptive capacity
and innovative capabilities.
For India’s electronics manufacturing industry, two aspects of industrial upgrading are of greatest
policy relevance: “firm-level upgrading” from low-end to higher-end products and value chain
stages, and “industry-level linkages” with support industries, universities and research institutes.

For India, the challenge is to enable firm-level and industry-level upgrading to interact in a
mutually reinforcing way, so that both types of upgrading will give rise to a “virtuous circle”.
“Firm-level upgrading” is the key dimension - without it, there is little hope that India can fast-
track the growth of its electronics industry. In other words, Indian firms must develop the
capabilities, business models and organization that will allow them to strengthen their absorptive
capacity and innovative capabilities. This requires important adjustments in corporate strategy.

                                                                                                               88
But for firm-level upgrading to succeed, upgrading must take place simultaneously at the level of
“industry linkages”. As Powell and Grodal observe, “collaboration across multiple boundaries and
institutional forms” is the norm today, and innovation networks “… are now core components of
corporate strategy.”266 This reflects the growing geographic mobility of knowledge and the
emergence of IT-enabled governance mechanisms to orchestrate distributed knowledge. To
broaden the pool of firms that are fit for sustained firm-level upgrading, India’s government needs
to foster strong support industries and dense linkages with universities and research institutes.

Finding the right balance between firm-level and industry-level upgrading poses a continuous
challenge for policy makers and corporate planners - the “right balance” is a moving target, it is
context-specific and requires permanent adjustments to changes in markets and technology. A
strategy that neglects one element at the detriment of the others is unlikely to create sustainable
gains. The stronger the links between those two elements, and the better they fit, the greater are
the chances that Indian firms can shape markets, prices and technology road maps.

In addition, three other forms of “industrial upgrading” may help to guide India’s revised NPE
strategy: (i) inter-industry upgrading proceeding from low value-added industries (e.g. light
industries) to higher value-added industries (e.g. heavy and higher-tech industries); (ii) inter-factor
upgrading proceeding from endowed assets (i.e., natural resources and unskilled labor) to created
assets (physical capital, skilled labor, social capital); and (iii) upgrading of demand within a
hierarchy of consumption, proceeding from necessities to conveniences to luxury goods.267
5.3. Establishing a robust national standard development infrastructure
The study’s review of India’s current government initiatives in standard development clearly
indicates that, although standards are now receiving greater attention, more can and should be
done, given the importance of standards and the distance left to travel. The government may want
to concentrate on the following immediate priority actions.

First, both the government and the private sector need to mobilize substantial resources (both
financial and human) to strengthen and upgrade standard-setting organizations especially for NPE
priority products, such as medical devices. This will improve the competitiveness of Indian firms
against low-cost low-quality imports, especially from China. Such standards should be set at high
quality levels, both to ensure safety and to create a source of discipline for local firms, which will
have to meet such stringent quality levels to benefit from the protection from low-quality imports.

    See Ozawa (2000) for a discussion of upgrading taxonomies. Most research has focused on a combination of the
first two forms of IU, based on a distinction between low-wage, low-skill “sun-set” industries and high-wage, high-
skill “sunrise” industries. Such simple dichotomies however have failed to produce convincing results, for two
reasons: First, there are low-wage, low-skill value stages in even the most high-tech industry, and high-wage, high-
skill activities exist even in so-called traditional industries like textiles. And second, both the capability requirements
and the boundaries of a particular “industry” keep changing over time. An example is the transformation of the
personal computer industry from an R&D-intensive high tech industry to a commodity producer that depends on the
optimization of supply chain management. (Ozawa, T. 2000. “The ‘Flying -Geese Paradigm: Toward a Co-
evolutionary Theory of MNC-Assisted Growth”, in: K. Fatemi (ed.), The New World Order: Internationalism,
Regionalism and the Multinational Corporations, Amsterdam and New York: Pergamon).

                                                                                                                       89
Second, specialized public-private working groups need to identify areas where substantial savings
can be achieved on the costs of standards development, testing and certification. At the moment,
without trusted standards, firms have to run tests for every high quality customer and for all
regulatory purposes. Not only are those over-lapping and repetitive testing requirements too costly,
especially for SMEs, but they also substantially reduce the firms’ ability for quick response and
flexibility.

Third, support policies need to target those firms which are active in developing, implementing
and using national and international quality standards, and provide them with privileged treatment,
in terms of access to incentives and eligibility of support policies. Benchmarking firms according
to their standardization capabilities should be used to enhance the impact of such policies. ITU,
ETRI and other organizations have developed operational measures of firm-level standardization
capabilities.268

This would make it possible to move beyond spreading such incentives like a watering can evenly
over the entire target group without considering the urgency of potentially different individual
cases. In other words, high standardization capabilies can be used as a filter for selecting firms that
should be primarily targetted by incentives and industrial support policies.

Fourth, and outward facing, India’s standard development organizations as well as private firms
should should take a much more active approach to learning from best practice policies, procedures
and organizational approaches developed elsewhere through strategic use of international
cooperation. In fact, standard development organizations in the US, the EU, Japan, Taiwan and
Korea are all eager to deepen their links with India’s standard development organizations,
especially in the information technology and electronics industries.

As a first concrete step, it is suggested that a series of specialized workshops are organized with
DEITy and relevant industry associations that would start with a roundtable workshop featuring
independent standardization experts from countries like Germany, Japan, the US, Korea, Malaysia,
Singapore, and China. These high-level expert workshops could be followed by a series of hands-
on traning courses for Indian standards experts in the private sector and as well as state
governments and Central government agencies that are involved in the formulation and
implementation of India’s NPE.

Another concrete suggestion is to create an India - European Institute of Standards and Innovation
with two campuses: one in India (possibly linked to a leading IIIM or the IIST in Banaglore) and
one in Europe (possibly linked to ETSI). The charter of such an institute would be to train
engineers, executives, technicians, government officials, and academics from both countries. The
institute would also provide technical consulting services to enable both Indian and European
companies to solve problems that arise from dealing with the differing standards systems in the
two countries. Similar forms of international cooperation should be considered with the IEEE-
SA, and some private standards consortia that are eager to strengthen their position in the Indian
electronics industry.

Overall, as senior officials in the Government of India have acknowledged, India faces a capability
gap in standards that it does not in other areas of policy formation for electronics. Whereas in
setting semiconductor policy, for example, there is a large diaspora of talented engineers who can
provide substantial input, Indian talent – whether local or diaspora – has traditionally played a
limited role in international standards bodies. It is thus urgent to start building a base of capabilities
for a strategic approach to standards, and to start putting in place the processes and dialogues that
can harness and support those capabilities.

5.4. Government procurement
Government procurement needs to strengthen as an important instrument of India’s NPE. As
reported in Chapter Two, India still lacks a central law on the subject of government procurement,
despite the fact that government procurement accounts for up to 30 percent of India’s GDP. This
would need to change. In addition, India needs to play a more active role in the WTO-GPA – the
current status of observer is no longer sufficient to enhance India’s interests in the electronics
manufacturing industry.

In fact, the WTO-GPA allows many exceptions, such as small and medium sized enterprises and
national security.269 Research on GPA documents indicates that if a country like the US, United
Kingdom, or Germany is sophisticated in how it uses the many exceptions, GPA membership
provides an extraordinary amount of flexibility and fairly rich benefits. In the US, the SBIR
program makes effective use of GPA exceptions. The US also makes ample use of exceptions due
to national security and homeland security concerns through DARPA and the Department of
Homeland Security. Debates about India’s government procurement policy make no reference to
the opportunities that these exceptions offer. In fact, proponents of “open procurement” in India
fail to acknowledge that the US has made ample use of this highly sophisticated approach to
government procurement.270

5.5. Strengthening the absorptive capacity of Indian firms
Policies need to focus on strengthening India’s “absorptive capacity”. R&D is critical. Especially
for process technology development, to strengthen the ability of Indian firms “to recognize the
value of new external information, assimilate it, and apply it … to do something quite different.”271

To strengthen India’s absorptive capacity in electronics manufacturing, it is necessary to
coordinate policies between the Center and the States that affect investment, innovation, FDI and
trade. These policies need to be broad-based, and should encompass regulations; investment
promotion; R&D tax credits; industrial support policies to foster firm-level managerial and
technological capabilities; patient innovation finance; standard development and certification;

5.6. Flexible policy implementation
Finally, flexible policy implementation is critical to make NPE work. A broad portfolio of diverse
policy approaches is required to enable India’s electronics firms to increase the gains from NPE.
The mix of policies will differ across sectors, product groups and regions. And the appropriate
policy mix will have to evolve over time.

6. Last Thoughts - The Growing Importance of International Trade Diplomacy
Chapter Two has documented the negative impact of India’s inverted tariff structure on the growth
of India’s electronics manufacturing industry. In line with these findings, Chapter Three
documents that almost all interviewees singled out the inverted tariff structure as a major barrier
to investment in this industry.

This indicates that policies to fast-track India’s electronics industry need to place considerable
effort on developing smart approaches to international trade diplomacy. To start with, it should be
emphasized that trade diplomacy has an important domestic component. The findings of this study
indicate that it is time now for the government to reconsider whether the IT services sector still
needs to receive absolute priority attention in negotiations about trade agreements. One could
argue in fact that the focus now needs to shift to the thus far neglected domestic electronics
manufacturing industry and its needs.

Furthermore, a new approach to trade diplomacy would focus on negotiating revisions in the
Information Technology Agreement (ITA) that acknowledge and correct the asymmetric effects
that ITA has had on cost structures and capabilities of India’s electronics manufacturing
industry.272 Plurilateral agreements like ITA should allow for special and differential treatment of
latecomers.273

Bold action is required to avoid zero-sum or even negative-sum game outcomes and the resultant
trade conflicts. Thus far, policy debates on the distribution of trade gains and costs have focused
on negotiating “Special and Differential” (SD) arrangements (delays, phase-outs for product
coverage, etc.). However, there seems to be limited scope for expanding special and differential
arrangements. For instance, in the case of ITA-2, long phase-outs for product coverage for large
emerging economies like China may “make the expanded agreement irrelevant due to the quick
pace of technological change.”274

Innovation? India’s Experience, Think piece for the E -15 Expert Group Meeting, Geneva, October 3-4.
273
    According to Mari Pangestu, a prominent trade economist from Indonesia, plurilateral agreements “… should
promote economic and technical cooperation recognising the different stages of development of participants. Special
and differential treatment can be justified in circumstances where participants face challenges in benefitting from an
increase in trade.”, http://ictsd.org/publications/latest-pubs/dg2013/mari-pangestu/
274
    Ian Steff, VP for global policy and technology partnerships at SIA, quoted in “In ITA Talks, Semiconductors
emerge as Sticking Point with China.”, World Trade Online, November 4, 2013,
http://insidetrade.com/201311042451780/WTO-Daily-News/Daily-News/in-ita-talks-semiconductors-emerge-as-
sticking-point-with-china/menu-id-948.html

                                                                                                                   92
For future policy debates, this raises questions like: What changes are necessary in domestic
regulations as well as in industrial and innovation policies to reap the potential benefits of ITA
trade liberalization? And, equally important: How does a country’s innovation capacity in a
particular industry affect its approach to, and its position in, multilateral and plurilateral trade
agreements?

In the end, a broad portfolio of diverse policy approaches is required to enable India’s electronics
industry to increase the gains from ITA participation.
The trade–related policy tools developed as part of India’s NPE fall far short of such an agenda.
In India’s Foreign Trade Policy Plan, released in May 2012 by the Director General of Foreign
Trade and Additional Secretary to the Government of India, the electronics industry ranks low (as
Number 10 out of 14 industries).275 The following priority trade policy initiatives for the
electronics industry largely build on existing policy schemes:

       Export of electronic goods to be incentivized under Focus Product Scheme.
       Expeditious clearance of approvals required from DGFT shall be ensured.
       Exporters /Associations would be entitled to utilize MAI & MDA Schemes for promoting
        Electronics and IT Hardware Manufacturing Industries exports.
     Electronics Sector included for benefits under SHIS scheme.276
Finally, on ITA and India’s FTAs, the NPE does not seem to have introduced new initiatives that
would address India’s new trade diplomacy requirements. Echoing the comments again, this
fundamentally important area would seem to be a natural place to deploy new and strengthened
mechanisms for industrial dialogue. Such a concerted effort could also reap substantial
symmetries with an outward-looking, strategic approach to standardization, which could both
provide disciplined and smart protection as well as push Indian firms and institutions to a more
active role in international standards bodies.

India’s engagement with the institutions that shape the global industry is a critically important
complement to the more high-profile efforts to build fabs and provide incentives. Such a two-
pronged strategy would likely provide an enduring and sustainable boost to the electronics
manufacturing industry in India.

Table 6: A Taxonomy of Standardization Tasks282


      1. Develop technology to support the standard
      2. Analyze the cost-benefit ratio of adopting an existing international standard
          versus creating a new domestic standard
      3. Identify licensing fees for essential patents (for both existing standards and
          for newly created standards)
      4. Pass testing, conformity assessments, and certifications
      5. Identify membership fees for formal and informal standards-development
          organizations
      6. Quantify logistics (travel, etc.) costs
      7. Assess the cost/risk of including one’s own patents within a general
          standard
      8. Manage the patent pool
      9. Establish back-end support for standards implementation and quantify
          costs
      10. Establish legal (litigation) support and quantify costs
      11. Establish lobbying support and quantify costs



Table 7: International Standardization Strategies


      Free rider: Let MNCs decide which standards to use, and save cost by not
      investing in the development of domestic standardization infrastructure and
      capabilities
      Fast follower: Develop domestic capabilities that are necessary to rapidly
      adopt existing standards so that the standard’s technology can be manufactured
      and marketed quickly
      Co-shaper: Revise existing standards and/or adapt proposed new standards to
      suit domestic needs so that current and new products may be quickly developed
      and marketed
      Standards leader: Create new standards to suit domestic needs and embed
      essential domestic patents within these standards so that current and new
      products may be quickly developed and marketed




282
   Table 6 highlights important tasks of standards development. Typically tasks 1, 3, and 4 are the most costly.
However, in cases involving litigation, legal costs can easily run into the hundreds of millions of dollars in the
United States. In principle, these countries and their companies may select one or a combination of the
standardization strategies described in terms of rising sophistication in Table 4.

APPENDIX TWO: QUOTES FROM INTERVIEWS
Chapter 3.2

“The highest standards products do not come out of India yet. The problem lies in the fact that the
Indian engineers are not exposed to the marketing side which leads to them not finding out what
the customer actually wants. The capability is there and people are eager to move onto bigger
things but the lack of exposure to various aspects of business is a deficiency in the skill set.” –
Indian IC design company.

“Many people seem to think that Indians have strong design capabilities but in actuality it is
service capabilities. Indian companies seem to have strong services capability and not necessarily
strong design capabilities. India seems to have some functional design and system design
capabilities but not much capabilities in design for manufacturing. Also there is a weakness in the
capability to understand the market and to translate this knowledge into specifications.” – MNC.

“Indian design companies do have a service mentality. …India should focus on what we are good
at. The lower rung manufacturing should be left to China. India has high intellectual brainpower.
With so many engineers coming out of colleges, India should develop IP [= intellectual property].
This is the reason we decided that we will not be a services company. We are an IP company.” –
Indian IC design company.

“Typically Indian design firms don’t get good projects. Foreign companies are worried that they
might loose their IP when they outsource work here. There are not too many design companies in
India serving the domestic market.” – Indian systems integrator.

“The design capability is not really there for the SMEs. We cannot spend money on having an in-
house high potential R&D team. The industry-academic linkage is next to nil. Students from good
colleges never want to work with the SMEs. Maybe we can work together with Indian educational
institutions on one-year projects, where we can have new products coming out of such projects.
But this kind of an arrangement is difficult to implement.” – Indian component manufacturer.

GST (3.3)

“The multiplicity of taxes and the delay in bringing GST has become a major thorn for us. The
movement of goods across states is very restricted and difficult with all these taxes and laws…
"The biggest fiscal constraint is the disparity in tax from state to state. That is why GST is so
essential….The next problem is the lack of clarity of tax structure. We have so many taxes like
central excise, sales tax, income tax, professional tax etc. So many taxes make things very
complicated. Besides this there are 50 other things which are required for doing business. Why
can’t we have a single sheet of paper which lists down very clearly what all is required for
business, instead of the maze which is currently present?” – Indian component manufacturer.

“The major challenges we face in the component industry is the variation of the sales tax from one
state to the other. For example (if I am selling in West Bengal) – I have to give 2% (Central Sales
Tax) + 14.5% (State VAT) + 1% (Octroi for West Bengal) + 12.5% Excise + Education Cess etc.

                                                                                               102
This is in addition to the corporate income tax that we have to pay. Compare that with China
where they follow a unified national tax policy.” – Indian EMS.

“A major fiscal constraint is the disparity in tax structure from state to state which leads to a lot
of hassles. A nationwide GST would really help in this regard.” – Indian EMS.

“A major fiscal constraint is the disparity in tax structure from state to state. Varying VAT levels
and dealing with sales tax also creates a lot of hassles for us. Something like a standard GST
(Goods and services tax) would do wonders for this problem.” – Indian smart card producer.

“Disparity of tax structure from state to state is a major challenge. Every state has a separate VAT
structure. May be the GST regime would answer that.” – Indian Systems Integrator.

“A major fiscal constraint … is the lack of a uniform taxation system nationwide and the slow
process of implementing GST.” – Japanese MNC, IC substrates.

“I am fairly optimistic that GST will be implemented within the next 3-4 years then the disparity
in the tax structure can be tackled from state to state. In the lighting industry – Maharashtra for
example has a 4.5% VAT while Delhi has 12.5%. In fact the definition of LED is blurred when you
go from state to state. Sometimes it is considered as electronics while sometimes it is considered
as electrical. Some states even now have entry tax (known as Octroi).” – Indian EMS for lighting
devices.

“I would say that the biggest challenge for our business is the tax structure. The multiplicity of
taxes and duties makes carrying out business a very challenging task .We would prefer something
like GST which would be a single tax and subsume all other taxes within it.” – Indian EMS.

(GST x 2)

“Things are too complex with regards to taxation. There is no clarity as to the rules and no one
authority to deal with which will handle all the issues. For example if you have to get material
from the US via Mumbai to Bangalore, you have to deal with a number of tax laws and then again
such complexity is present for interstate travel also. Our tax auditors are constantly struggling to
deal with the maze of the confusing tax laws for procurements and deal in general” – a domestic
EMS company and exporter.

“Section 32 A/B of the Indian Income Tax act allows us to request exemption on R&D. However,
when we went to DSIR to complain that we cannot get this exemption they said that unless you are
manufacturing in India, we cannot give this exemption.” – a domestic chip design company.

“Unpredictable tax regulations are a major issue. We do our billing in the US and not in India as
being taxed in India leads to many complications. The retrospective taxation principle is a major
headache.” – Indian IC Design company.




                                                                                                 103
“State VAT and Excise tax is the second biggest constraint. To give you an idea how serious this
problem is: ELCINA has three to four people who have been working for 10-12 years to inform
the members of any changes in the laws and tax regulations.” – Indian Components company.

“A lot of CENVAT credit has been built up for our company over time. But the government is not
clear as to on what qualifies for availing this CENVAT credit and keeps changing the criteria
frequently. This has led us to having great difficulty in long term strategic planning.” – Indian
EMS provider.

“The service tax is a major challenge. For all the service tax exemptions we have to apply for
credit. Why are we required to pay in the first place? Every quarter there is a notice and it is a
bureaucratic process to make the officials understand the same thing again and again.” – Indian
EDA Tool Provider.

 “There is so much tax-related paperwork in operating manufacturing business in India. For
example importing a software – I have to pay both VAT and Service Tax. For refunds, the VAT
refund comes in 2/3 years while service tax refund never comes. Tax credit process is extremely
cumbersome. • Clarity and simplicity of regulations is most important. So many notifications are
there and so much paperwork is required to comply with all these impractical tax structure.” –
Indian IC design company.

“Being a fabless company, we can be considered a hybrid of a product and service company. This
has led to many tax-related issues. For example when we import IP, we must pay a service charge
of 10% on it which does not make any sense. Also, for such transactions, 20% TDS is cut and if
the foreign company does not have a PAN card in India, the refund cannot be claimed. Obtaining
the PAN is a major headache as the process takes 6 weeks, leading to additional delays and
impeding business. Often the IP selling companies are reluctant to pay these taxes and thus to
secure business we must often pay the tax amount. Thus overall, we end up paying 130% of the
asking amount which leads to a lot of financial uncertainty for a company like ours…”

“The retrospective taxation issue is also a major one as you are never sure when a case is really
closed, creating a very uncertain environment. …

Lack of Indian government knowledge with regard to the nature of fabless companies and R&D
companies in general has led to taxation and other clauses which hinder the progress of such
companies. We have always tried to follow the path of least resistance in these matters but stills
these things make life difficult for any start-up.” – Indian IC design company.

“Managing sales tax issues is itself difficult and results in large amount of record keeping, filing
returns and compliance to various vague rules and regulations – this seriously effects the flow of
materials for even movement of spares to ensure timely service to the hospitals/ users. Each state
has a different set of tax laws which too results in compliance difficulties and consequent
litigation.” – Indian producer of medical equipment.

Inverted Tariff Structure



                                                                                                104
For instance, an Indian EMS provider, argues: “The biggest challenge for us is the inverted tariff
structure which is seriously retarding the electronics industry’s growth. There are a lot of EMS
companies in China so why should anyone get it from us? We are very uncompetitive as compared
to these countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan. There is no duty for imports
from these countries and there is no protection for the domestic industry. It is not a level playing
field at all.”

For an Indian smart card producer,” The major challenge for our business strategy is dealing with
the inverted tariff structure. The customs and duty on the final product is very low compared to
that on the raw material that we use (plastics). Thus imports are much more competitive than the
locally manufactured products.” A similar assessment is offered by an Indian producer of Smart
Energy Meters: “India’s inverted tariff structure is a major problem for our industry and countries
like China are taking advantage of it by dumping very cheap products on our market.“

For an Indian EMS provider, “the inverted tariff structure is killing the industry with trading
proving to be much more lucrative option that manufacturing.” And another domestic EMS
provider provides a detailed explanation:
” A major challenge for our business strategy is the inverted tariff structure. The very low tariff
applicable on finished products from China and others makes things very difficult for us. This is
especially true in the case of high volume and high potential items like mobile phones. There is no
level playing field. I know from my own experience that in China, these companies are heavily
subsidized in terms of cheaper land, power etc. which gives an unfair advantage to them. The
Indian government should go ahead and impose anti dumping duties on these countries and
products.”

3.3

The need for Single Window Clearance
“We have so many taxes like central excise, sales tax, income tax, professional tax etc. So many
taxes make things very complicated. Besides this there are 50 other things which are required for
doing business. Why can’t we have a single sheet of paper which lists down very clearly what all
is required for business, instead of the maze which is currently present?”

Lack of coherence
“There are too many regulations and they are all over the place. This we analyzed as th e biggest
issue in fostering manufacturing. To cater to this problem, we proposed an online repository of
regulations where somebody who is starting up a new business knows what kind of clearances
need to be obtained and who is the contact person for the same. Currently every department
(ministry), every state has different regulations and it becomes very difficult for new entrepreneurs
to comply with these regulations.”- Analyst.
Too much paper work
“There is so much paperwork in operating a manufacturing business in India. For example, for
imported software, I have to pay both VAT and Service Tax. For refunds, the VAT refund comes
back in two to three years, while service tax refunds almost never arrive. The tax credit process
is extremely cumbersome.” – Indian Fabless Company.



                                                                                                 105
Large number of laws
“The large number of laws to be complied with in manufacturing runs into pages covering labor
laws, factories act, safety & fire, pollution control, sales tax, excise duty, central government and
state government compliance, other statutory obligations such as ESI, PF. Etc. This only adds to
inefficiencies and therefore makes the units uncompetitive.” – Indian start-up Medical Electronics
Manufacturer.

Corruption
“There are too many procedures, ministries intervening. Getting money back for overpaid fees is
such an issue. We have to pay such a high customs duty (33% on passive components – all added
up). And corruption at the lowest level of customs is very high. If we disagree disagrees to pay
Rs.2000 as a bribe, our imported material will be delayed by two weeks.” – IP Company.

3.4 CUSTOMS

Companies have highlighted in particular the following concerns:

“Obtaining custom clearances is a challenge. Custom delays are very frequent, even though
opening the package is not that much of a concern. Private companies may be facing larger
challenges than we face.” – PSU.

“The customs bureaucracy is very difficult to handle when we import the various test equipment
and that creates a big disincentive for anyone venturing into this market.” – Indian IC design
company.

“We import about 20% of the value of procurement. We have seen numerous problems with
customs clearance and handling. It takes a lot of time and the clearing agents sometimes open up
the consignment just to check. We have no control over the shipment as we have already paid to
the overseas supplier but the material is never received in the same packing as was originally done
at the supplier side. These clearing agents typically are more interested in serving large MNC
companies as we have very small volume and very small possibility of getting them bigger
revenues. We have tried air-freight also for resistors, but one time we lost one/two boxes during
transit. The categorization of electronic components is not clear to these customs officials. We
have to spend a lot of time in explaining them the exact categorization and hence the right duty
amount that needs to be paid.” – Indian SME component manufacturer.

STANDARDS

Here are a few examples of industry views on the weakness of India’s standards system and
suggestions on what needs to be done to improve it.
“India’s standards system is weak, and reflects the limited exposure of electronics manufacturing
to the international market. Strengthening the India’s SDOs is critical for unblocking the barriers
to growth of electronics manufacturing.” – International EDA tool provider.

“Our products are made according to JSS (Joint service specification) grade, which is an Indian
defense specified grade and which is similar to MIL (US Military) grade. But the problem is that

                                                                                                 106
these JSS standards have not been very active for past 5-6 years which is a big cause of worry as
our products may not be accepted abroad without their certification.” – Indian component
manufacturer.

“I think we are lacking in the overall standards for electronics and electronic components. BIS is
doing some work but that is extremely limited. LCSO is only for mill grade components.” – PSU.

“The current level of standardization is extremely poor in India. And now the government is sitting
up and taking notice that standards can be used as non-tariff barriers to stop grey market products
from proliferating. For example – they have specific BIS guidelines for the safety standards of set-
top-boxes in India. This means that any company (Chinese or Indian) selling STBs in India has to
obtain a certificate from a lab in India specifying that they comply with India specific safety
standards.” – Indian electronics manufacturer.

“Standards are extremely important for the benefit of the customer as well as for the benefit of the
industry. But too few people understand, how best to deal with them. For example – when we sell
to a builder in bulk, he doesn’t care about the star rating. All he is concerned about is the upfront
price…..Quality, Energy and Safety standards are extremely important for our business. We feel
that effective standards provide benefits to facilitate technology transfer and protecting the
interests of customers thereby benefiting the industry.” – MNC.

“Standards in India are in bad shape. Very few people in India like to work on standards for
electronics. Take battery standards, safety standards or interoperability standards. People in the
government are afraid to take up standards as it is something that they don’t understand too well.
Moreover, standards could be used as good trigger to compete with China on quality and safety.
– Indian manufacturer.

“We are not satisfied with the standards ecosystem in India. There is no clear mapping of the
international ISO standards. Government tenders differ in the standard specifications that they
require.” – Indian manufacturer.

“Standardization is extremely important, but there are not enough testing facilities in the market
to promote not only standardization but also good quality products. There is the TUV lab in
Whitefield which has 50-60 days of backlog work because of which companies are not able to
bring tested and certified products to the market quickly enough.” – Indian Venture Capital firm.

“There are no standards for LEDs. Every category of product should have a BIS standard. It is
more of an industry function than government function to make sure that BIS standards are strong.
But it is unlikely to happen as government wants to retain control of such functions.” – Indian
EMS.

“There are no quality standards requirements for the manufacturing and use of medical devices
in India. This further increases the woes faced by “quality” manufacturers like us….We
understand there are a number of false claims of CE marked products coming from China. There
is no agency to even verify the genuineness of the CE certified imports. There should be a
registration process for organizations / trader importers who want to sell medical devices in India.

                                                                                                 107
Lack of resources with the GOI should not paralyze implementation of a registration process.
Every country to which we export has such a process in place, including third world countries and
emerging economies.” – Indian producer of medical equipment.

“Unfortunately very few Indian MSMEs follow standards and thus their quality becomes suspect
in eyes of foreign customers.” – Indian EMS.

"I feel now the Government of India has realized the need for standardization and we are seeing
a huge effort in that area. However, the slow speed of implementation is a major issue and in the
electronics industry, hence speed is crucial. We need to ensure that new products developed are
certified in time. …The second important thing regarding the standards is the presence of testing
labs and facilities. If there are not enough labs (or they are too costly), then the whole
standardization effort would be wasted.” – International EDA tool provider.

POLICY DIALOGUE

According to an Indian IC design company, “While policy debates within the government about
how to reform regulations and to design smart policies are important, ideas on their own will not
change the barriers to growth of the electronics manufacturing industry. In order to effectively
implement these reformed regulations and policies, it is necessary to discuss details and
implementation strategies with important stakeholders through an intensive and continuous
“industrial Dialogue” on many levels. A few isolated high-level conferences won’t do the trick.
Without such “Industrial Dialogue” it is very difficult for policy-makers to develop a sound
understanding of the real world competitive dynamics of a particular industrial segment that are
targeted by the above policies.”

An Indian EMS provider, adds:” There are very few forums that communicate what government
is thinking and or doing. The bridges are lesser and are weak. The bureaucracy is top heavy and
it is a big challenge when the industry wants to approach the government. They don’t know whom
to approach.”

And for CUTS International, India’s Consumer Unity & Trust Society, an industry association that
promotes the reduction of restrictive regulations, “…[t]here should be a lot closer association
between industry and government. Other stakeholders such as industry associations and consumer
organizations should come to one forum and help in implementing these recommendations. Mr
Pradeep Mehta has come up with a concept of “Growth Compact” where they are creating a body
(totally apolitical) with representation from different ministries and industry. Mr. Arun Maira is
also working on India Backbone Implementation Network (IbIn), which is the implementation
framework on policy and planning issues.”

INDUSTRY’S DESIRES FOR SUPPORT POLICIES

“The Government should do whatever it can to get MNCs and big players into the country. It can
create SEZs which have all facilities for these MNCs and which have very few restrictions.
However, industrial land should be kept for industrial purposes only and should never be sold for
any other. In fact, no one should own the industrial land. The Government can give it for a lease

                                                                                              108
and then take it back. This will prevent misuse of land for non-industrial purposes, which is
something very common here (he pointed to the plot of industrial land nearby which had a
residential colony).” – Indian component supplier.

A number of companies agree that a particular focus should be on attracting EMS providers. Quite
specific suggestions were offered by a foreign IDM: “It is essential that we clearly develop a
manufacturing policy that would aim to create an ecosystem of electronics manufacturing and get
bigger players to invest in India. Once bigger players commit, the ecosystem will self-develop.
Moreover, our focus should be on getting some of the bigger global EMS providers like Foxxconn
or Flextronics to expand in India as electronics manufacturing is all about scale. We need to select
the right companies to pitch to. IESA might be pitching to everyone (including OEMs such as
Cisco, Dell etc. who have very low interest in getting into high value add manufacturing).”

An Indian component supplier, adds: “Having more EMS providers in India would obviate the
need to get the work done abroad and would also create a lot of local demand for our products.”
And an Indian electronic equipment producer adds: “To attract foreign companies, the government
should provide subsidies or cheap land, but they will also have to provide the necessary
infrastructure.”

A second widely shared expectation is that industrial support policies should focus on upgrading
the domestic electronics industry value chain by strengthening critical technological and
management capabilities for priority products and components. According to a domestic EMS
provider, “…[a] major problem of our industry is that it is not globally competitive. The Indian
hardware manufacturers see the requests and standards of European and US customers as too
demanding and thus focus only on India, making them highly uncompetitive. China and others did
exactly the opposite of this and were export oriented from the start and thus they are very
competitive now. Recently I was trying to get and order from European customers and for our raw
materials we contacted both Indian and Chinese companies. The Chinese companies responded
with their offer well within the day but the Indian’s didn’t respond for a week and asked too many
questions. This led to the US client losing confidence and they asked us to buy the raw materials
from China.”

In order to upgrade India’s electronics manufacturing value chain, support policies would “need
to provide funding for R&D and for translating this knowledge into innovation; facilitate
investment in infrastructure for setting up manufacturing business; procure locally to boost
domestic manufacturing; and invest in skill development. We have only 15 good engineering
colleges in India. There is a huge dearth of quality engineers coming through.” – International
EDA tool provider.

A domestic IC design company highlights three priorities for such policies: “1. R&D incentives
like grants are desperately required. 2. Taxation and PMAS policies need to be defined to
incentivize R&D. IP procurement should get tax benefits.3. Better recognition and awareness
about R&D and fabless electronics companies which would help define more suitable policies for
them.”




                                                                                                109
According to an Indian IC design company, “…[f]or start-ups to enter the electronics hardware
industry, the initial setup costs are too high. So one way to judge the success of the policies is to
see substantially more startups entering the industry. Growth in level of IP development and
product development is also a very good indicator of the success of government’s policies.”
According to an Indian producer of smart meters, success of industrial support policies depends
on”…[w]hether small companies are getting sufficient opportunities to compete on a level footing
with the big companies for the government tenders i.e. whether the system is fair or not.”

And a small Indian component supplier provides two examples of successful support policies: ”
For SMEs, there is a Delayed Payment Act that the government has passed. Any MNCs/ large
companies procuring from a registered SMEs have to pay the money in 30-45 days. Earlier they
used to pay in 180 days (sometimes even 365 days).But what if the companies do not comply, there
is no redressal system. I cannot raise my voice against my customers. The Government’s
International Cooperation Scheme for SMEs is also very interesting. This policy reimburses a
large part of the airfare in participating in global exhibitions and some part of the exhibition stall
costs.”

NPE (1)
Industry voices

“I am aware of the NPE. I think it is has come more than two decades late but bet ter late than
never.” – Japanese Chip substrate producer.

“I am aware of NPE but do not know much about its various details. But I know that the
government is making a lot of effort to ensure the growth of the electronics hardware industry.
Recently I had gone to a conference of ESDM players in Delhi and a lot of things had been
discussed there. I am hopeful that NPEs targets can be achieved.” – Indian smart card producer.

“I have heard about the national policy on electronics. It doesn’t seem to be practical. You talk
about the Fab while in India you just can’t manufacture anything.” – Indian IC design company.

“We have heard about the National Policy on Electronics but frankly speaking we are not much
aware of the finer print. MAIT has been talking about the electronics manufacturing clusters
(EMC), but we think all this is still on the drawing board. We don’t know what is going to happen
after union elections in 2014.

PMA might be extremely useful for us but in order to succeed in the long-term, the cost structure
of manufacturing domestically should improve. The root-cause for limited domestic component
manufacturing should be solved first.” – Indian manufacturer.

NPE (2)
“If we can boost domestic component manufacturing and make it cost competitive, then the end
products capability would also improve.” – Domestic components manufacturer.

“Building entire value chain should not be done at one time. Focus should be on developing
priority products and components at one time. We should probably focus on getting PCB / PCB

                                                                                                  110
Assembly / plastics / connectors / passives and ATP [=assembly, test & packaging] facilities first.
These things don’t require huge investments and there is a potential of getting into positive return
on investment from these facilities. We should at first focus on a $200m investment with 1000
people.” – Foreign semiconductor company.

“I don’t believe that an ecosystem can be created by design or desire. A well functioning ecosystem
is created by business viability and presence of opportunities. The right environment is important
but there is no point in pushing without business finding it viable.” – Domestic EDA Tool provider.

“We should not insist to get 100% manufacturing done domestically. Depending on supply chain
constraints / demand supply equations, even if an OEM sets up in India 70% domestic components
sourcing and 30% foreign we should be ok. It is not practical to aim for 100%. But for specific
components and products we should think about becoming a global hub that does not just cater to
the domestic market but also to exports.” – Domestic R&D service provider.

NPE (MORE)
Some companies raised similar caveats with regard to the “high-volume, low-value” paradigm.
Finally, however, two respondents provided arguments for a focus on “low volume, high-value”
products. An Indian PSU with a heavy exposure to the so-called strategic industries, argues “India
should also be able to manufacture high-value low volume products. Some niche companies should
come up and play in these product segments.”

And an Indian producer of medical equipment, states: “I don’t really agree with the choice of
products. I feel India has a very good chance of competing at the global level in low volume and
high complexity products. We definitely do have the capability to do well in that category.”

In contrast, here are some pro- “mass manufacturing” arguments:

An Indian IC design company, argues: “The priority products seem to have been correctly
identified because these are volume products. The costs of setting up indigenous facilities for such
products will be high initially but in the long term it will surely decrease. The government’s
priority product policy should try to identify products which can generate volumes in the long term
volumes because by then the indigenous facilities can be competitive. We can definitely compete
with these countries because our design houses are capable of and are actually involved in a lot
of innovation.”
“I agree with the government’s choice of the products as these are all strategic high volume
products. For example – consider STBs, we have about 75 million STBs required in the next 2-3
years and almost all of it will be imported. So the government has thought about the trade deficit
and how these priority products can help us improve that situation.” – Indian final product
manufacturer.

“The priority products seem to have been correctly identified as these are volume products and
they can drive the future of the Indian electronics hardware industry. But some of the current
incentives are lop-sided as people like Micromax make more money in trading than they would do
in a capital intensive business (from manufacturing in India.” – International semiconductor IDM.



                                                                                                111
“It is a good decision to start off with consumer based products rather than B2B products.” –
Indian IC design company.

“The choice of the products is correct as these products are mass market products. A lot of these
products like smart energy meters have a high level of Indian value add which can help it to be
competitive. Talking about competitiveness without having domestic value add is a very hollow
claim.” – Domestic EMS provider.

“Yes I agree overall with the choice of products, but we don’t have the capacity domestically to
manufacture set-top boxes. SMEs cannot get into these products but may be they can come together
and join hands and use infrastructure available with companies such as BEL etc. to mass
manufacture. Even then, we might not be cost competitive. May be we should accept a set-top-box
at Rs.1200 even if it is available from China at Rs.1000.” – Indian component manufacturer.

“Indian players have already entered low-cost smart phones, and are doing well. For all other
products: If local manufacturing ecosystem is built /cost differential addressed we can compete
anywhere. For many of these high volume / low value products margin is only 6-8%. And if this
goes away in the cost differential how can companies aim to survive.” – Indian R&D service
provider.

An Indian smart meter producer, adds the following concrete suggestions: “With regard to smart
meters, we can definitely compete against other countries, provided the following problems are
addressed: 1. The government approval process must be shortened. Taking approvals is a very
slow process and often we have been stuck for 5 months for what should have been a simple and
quick approval process. For example – getting an ISI mark for a new product takes a lot of time.
2. The certification process for our products is also so slow with labs like National Laboratories
taking an inordinate time to get approvals. And 3. If incentives can be given to start-ups, we can
definitely innovate and compete.”

NPE (PRODUCTS)
According to an Indian producer of smart cards, “The government should add smart cards, as this
is a very fast growing industry. Today an average Indian has at least one smart card in his pocket
and if you talk about the below poverty line (BPL) population, every individual has around 2-3
smart cards. So the opportunity is huge.

The problem is that with China’s cheap products and attractive financing schemes, the Indian
smart card industry is running below capacity. Almost 50% of our capacity remains idle as of now.
Thus the domestic industry needs incentives (maybe taxation related) and some kind of protection
from the Chinese imports to grow effectively.”

A concrete suggestion on how to implement a successful push for domestic smart card production
without facing WTO compliance problems comes from a Japanese provider of IC substrates. “I
think smart cards must be added to the priority list immediately. The government should make
smart cards the focal point and use the logic of enhancing the country’s security to use smart cards
to grow the electronics industry. If an act is passed in the parliament making this a national
security initiative, there is nothing the WTO or other treaties can do.”

                                                                                                112
The same company also raises doubts about India’s capacity to compete with China on “high -
volume, low value” production: “There should be no talk of competing with China. Let’s accept
the fact: We cannot compete with China right now. Take the example of solar cells, everyone was
planning to enter the market but after China’s huge capacity expansion investing in it doesn’t
make sense. But such logic cannot be followed for such a strategic product as smart cards. Even
if the locally produced smart card is 30-40 % more expensive, the government should encourage
the use of the domestic product. Effective standards are an important tool of completion. For
instance, the government could prevent Chinese import by specifying some difficult to meet
standards which will give us a breathing space of 4-5 years in which we can develop our domestic
ESDM industry and then compete with China. For example we can specify a particular level of
UV radiation based production which will make it difficult for the Chinese to meet the standard.”

“I am not too sure about the choice of priority products. Especially in consumer electronics, by
the time the domestic players come up and manufacture their own design, the technology will be
obsolete. The incentives should be provided to global industry leaders such as LG, Samsung,
Toshiba to do more of the work from here. We should learn from China which encouraged
partnerships between domestic and foreign players and attracted FDI.”

Doubts whether India’s lack of a domestic component base will obstruct efforts to promote high-
volume production or priority products have been raised for instance by an Indian EMS provider:
“In principle, " the choice of the government’s priority products is fine and they are all high
volume and high potential products. However, what these products have in common is the fact that
almost 75% of their value is made up in the bill of materials. Hence if you don’t have local
components and semiconductor manufacturing, you will never be price competitive in these
product segments.
These will definitely take a lot of time to be set up in India. In the meantime, the government can
help he local industry by imposing anti-dumping duties on China and protect the industry the same
way import protection is done in the automobile industry. Truth be told, I feel that we have lost
out on this race and the only hope for us is the growing demand which will make the
authorities/companies wake up and take necessary steps.”
 A similar argument is made by a domestic EDA tool provider: “The consumer electronics industry
is fickle even though it is high volume but we are so far behind that we cannot make it work. The
case of Akash Tablets is also there (where such major issues happened between the Canadian and
Indian companies). India however may have a chance for products such as smart meters where
these products can provide a competitive industrial advantage.”

EMC
Critical voices from industry include:

“EMC is a good policy but it has been implemented in a crazy way. For examples the clusters
which have been set up in Karnataka are all located in the remote areas of Bangalore almost 80
km away from the city, where there is absolutely nothing. Tell me, why would anyone go there?
How will technically skilled people (even from abroad) come to work in such places when you
don’t have things like hospitals/schools etc for their family nearby?” – Indian EMS provider.




                                                                                               113
“I would say that the government makes a mistake by focusing on clusters. You just cannot force
a cluster to be set up, it has to evolve automatically. Look at what happened with automobile or
the textile industry. Government should keep out of these matters. From what I have seen, forcing
clusters to come up often leads to real estate scams more often than not.” – Indian component
manufacturer.

“Who owns the EMC? Who is the government pitching to? Pitching to private players to develop
and invest in parks is not going to work. A manufacturing cluster is very different from a software
cluster and each plant has different needs unlike software parks hence cluster/park development
by private players is unsuccessful. This is a major issue and the absence of a local ecosystem is a
major barrier for companies setting up Indian facilities. Including an EMS in the cluster
development plans is a must as even big companies like GE India also outsource their entire
electronics manufacturing to EMS companies. Automotive sector (especially the growth of
automotive ancillary) should act as a case study for developing the clusters in the electronics
industry.” – International IDM.

“I am not in favor of developing clusters at all. Why can’t you incentivize individuals to setup
wherever they want? Why can’t the government give us a choice in this regard? I tell you, if a
place like Andamans has proper infrastructure and incentives, we can move there also. There
should not be any restriction on the places where one is incentivized to set up facilities…..Why do
you want to create islands of growth? The goal should be t spread benefits evenly.” – Foreign
Chip substrate manufacturer.

“I am not really sure what to comment on this but I feel that the electronics industry is a very
fragmented industry in India. It is very difficult to ensure that the various players come and settle
down in specified clusters. The need is to offer incentives even if you don’t settle in clusters.” –
Indian smart card producer.

“EMC might just benefit major established companies who wish to open a new facility. For an
SME moving to an SEZ or to a cluster will not be economically viable. Whatever may be the
incentives.” – Indian systems integrator.
“The government’s cluster and SEZ schemes, have a major probl em in that there is no incentive
offered if you don’t move to the SEZ. Tell me, if I have been working in Bangalore for 5 years and
all my employees are here, how can I move to Chennai just to get the SEZ advantage? Why can’t
I be incentivized for doing manufacturing here in Bangalore? Even if somebody pays me twice the
money, I will be reluctant to move to Chennai.” – Indian smart meter producer.

“Basically the clusters are all real estate projects and have not worked for electronics. Though
the idea of the government is right, I feel clusters should come up naturally and should not be
forced. Also, to get the various subsidies promised in these clusters, you have to really chase the
authorities. It is very difficult to actually get the money thus there is no real incentive for us to shift
to these clusters even if the level of subsidy is very high because we will not actually see the
money.” – Indian medical equipment producer.

Supporting voices from industry emphasize possible agglomeration and learning economies:



                                                                                                      114
“Going by the examples of other countries, clusters definitely do help. Having a well developed
cluster will help create multiple opportunities for chip design companies” – Indian IC design
company.

“What I have seen in the other countries, clusters have proven to be very successful in developing
the industry. The major advantage that clusters have is that they help solve the problem of deficient
infrastructure in developing countries. The major area where this helps is logistics as all the
players in the value chain are located very close to each other.” – Indian EMS provider.

A few respondents offered suggestions on how to improve the impact of the EMC scheme:
“Effective cluster of companies who can learn from each other. These clusters woul d be better
suited where there is a higher consumption (Maharashtra / Gujarat). These two states can act as
pioneers in the LED industry to show the way. North people do not want to invest heavily. Watches
industry cluster was developed in Hosur as one company (HMT) invested and it got transferred to
other companies.” – Indian EMS provider.

“Clusters are extremely important. We should have cluster based on the priority products selected.
Infrastructure has to be provided by the state government. The ownership should lie with DEITy
for pushing through the implementation on EMC.” – International EDA tool provider.

“The rentals for SEZs are too high to be affordable for any startup. They are only affordable for
big MNCs. Also a lock in of 5 years is required for such SEZs. Tell me, how can a startup afford
that kind of payment? The SEZ grants say that you must move into a particular area (say Chennai)
to receive 25% subsidy but the scheme offers nothing if you set up facilities in other non-SEZ areas.
At least they should offer 20%. Basically the SEZ scheme is a money making racquet and it is
allowing vested interests to make money out of real estate instead of contributing to the growth of
electronics in the country. The SEZ scheme is like a wolf in sheep’s clothing; it looks attractive
but there is nothing there for most companies.

…. To avoid such abuses, I feel that the developer of the cluster needs to have a long term vision.
The goal cannot be to merely extract financial benefits from setting up such clusters. The target
should be to ensure development of the ecosystem and promotion of innovation. Basically the
effectiveness of such clusters all boils down to the creator of the cluster. Many vested interests are
also involved in setting up clusters/SEZs and measures need to be taken to prevent that from
happening.” – Indian IC design company.

“The major advantage of clusters is that it mitigates the impact of the various drawbacks in India.
That is, it provides good infrastructure, proximity to suppliers and customers which eliminates
logistics issues, opportunities to learn and innovate, access to laboratories etc.

ELCINA has been mandated by DEITy to develop clusters in India and we are our level best. We
have developed one in Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and in 2-3 years another one in Chennai’s Sree City
may come up. We are facilitating the access to land of the size of 50-150 acres and it is the
responsibility of the members to develop the land. The members (interested industries) may float
a special purpose vehicle or form real estate consortia to develop the land.

I would say that yes, this approach is not very attractive for small companies but I am sure that
they can buy a small chunk of land (say half acre) and then develop it. We are planning to develop
200 clusters all over India so it should not be a major problem for the start-up to shift to the
nearest cluster. They need not go too far away.

Another point regarding the clusters is that many states treat these clusters as mega projects and
this helps the companies in the clusters to avail additional incentives and subsidies. Overall I am
highly optimistic about the effectiveness of the cluster policy.” – Indian EMS provider.

“It is very difficult for small companies to access such funds unless they have contacts or the clout.
You have to go through a very complicated maze to get the funds. For example, there was a CGMT
financing scheme for MSME companies which mandated government banks to give loans up to 1
crore for MSMEs without collateral. It was a good scheme but there were so many ground level
implementation issues like lack of funds, banks unwillingness to lend without collateral etc. that it
became practically useless for us.” – Indian smart card producer.

“This is a very good idea for us. But I don’t know how would they release the fund. For Rs 100
that we earn as pre-tax profit we have to Rs.35 as taxes, Rs.15 as bonuses to employees and Rs.20
as dividend to shareholders. We are only left with Rs.30 to reinvest in R&D and new product
development. If there is a fund that says that Rs.10 crores is allocated for a new product idea in
the instrumentation space then we can propose something and use that money (Rs.5 crores in
product development, Rs.2 crores in setting up manufacturing and Rs.3 crores in marketing). This
would be hugely beneficial to us. But how would it be released has to be communicated to the
relevant players.” – Indian systems integrator.

“I have only heard of this scheme but I don’t know of its practical details. Things like eligibility
criteria and disbursal mechanisms have not been delineated. A bureaucrat just seems to have made
this up in his office without considering the implementation part of it. No schedule for its
implementation has been made thus it is pretty much useless. The fund should have come sooner,
it is already too late. Also, it seems that this fund would go the way of other Indian funds which
look attractive but are not accessible at all, with bureaucrats saying “We have no money ourselves
to give you.” – Indian chip design company.

“"The biggest problem with schemes like this is screening out the cheats and those who don’t
really intend to start up companies. To avoid that the following can be done: Instead of giving the
funds directly to the companies to use it for whatever they want, the committee can use the money
to give subsidized equipment/land to the company. This way the frauds and charlatans won’t come
ahead and only those interested in really setting up companies will take advantage of the fund.” –
Indian producer of medical equipment.

Two foreign EDA tool providers expressed strong support for the EDF scheme and offered some
practical suggestions:
“The EDF seems to be developed as a mother fund of $2bn, and then several daughter funds (based
on the priority products). This daughter fund would provide upto 50% of seed funding for a startup.
Once this fund is utilized, government will wash its hands from managing the company etc. I am

not aware about the current status on EDF, you should talk to IESA about it. Our incubators,
would not come under the EDF directly, but they will be pushed by DEITY. I think the method that
the government is thinking about is the correct one.” – foreign EDA tool provider.

 “To counter the dearth of sophisticated VC firms, the government announced an Electronic
Development Fund, where it would invest up to Rs.10,000 crore (Rs.100 billion ) in a 1:4 ratio,
but the plan is yet to be ratified by the Cabinet. ….EDF is under discussion since nine months, yet
still there is no decision. This indicates the extremely slow pace of decision-making in the
Government. For an industry that has to think in 3months product cycles, decision-making cycles
of 12 months and more are not very helpful….It is rumored that a major VC firm (Walden
International )has offered Rs.500 crore (Rs.5 billion ) towards EDF” – foreign EDA tool provider.
