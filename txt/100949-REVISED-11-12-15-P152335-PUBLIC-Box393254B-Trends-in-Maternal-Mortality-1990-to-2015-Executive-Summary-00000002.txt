Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2015




       Executive summary
       In 2000, the United Nations (UN) Member States pledged to work towards a series
       of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including the target of a three-quarters
       reduction in the 1990 maternal mortality ratio (MMR; maternal deaths per 100 000 live
       births), to be achieved by 2015. This target (MDG 5A) and that of achieving universal
       access to reproductive health (MDG 5B) together formed the two targets for MDG 5:
       Improve maternal health. In the five years counting down to the conclusion of the MDGs,
       a number of initiatives were established to galvanize efforts towards reducing maternal
       mortality. These included the UN Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s
       and Children’s Health, which mobilized efforts towards achieving MDG 4 (Improve
       child health) as well as MDG 5, and the high-level Commission on Information and
       Accountability (COIA), which promoted “global reporting, oversight, and accountability
       on women’s and children’s health”. Now, building on the momentum generated by
       MDG 5, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) establish a transformative new
       agenda for maternal health towards ending preventable maternal mortality; target 3.1 of
       SDG 3 is to reduce the global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 live births by 2030.
       Planning and accountability for improving maternal health, and assessment of MDG 5
       and SDG targets, require accurate and internationally comparable measures of maternal
       mortality. Countries have made notable progress in collecting data through civil
       registration systems, surveys, censuses and specialized studies over the past decade. Yet,
       many still lack comprehensive systems for capturing vital events data, and underreporting
       continues to pose a major challenge to data accuracy.
       Given the challenges of obtaining accurate and standardized direct measures of maternal
       mortality, the Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group (MMEIG) – comprising
       the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the
       United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank Group and the United Nations
       Population Division (UNPD) – partnered with a team at the University of Massachusetts
       Amherst, United States of America (USA), the National University of Singapore, Singapore,
       and the University of California at Berkeley, USA, to generate internationally comparable
       MMR estimates with independent advice from a technical advisory group that includes
       scientists and academics with experience in measuring maternal mortality.
       The estimates for 1990 to 2015 presented in this summary are the eighth in a series of
       analyses by the MMEIG to examine global, regional and country progress in reducing
       maternal mortality. To provide increasingly accurate maternal mortality estimates, the
       previous estimation methods have been refined to optimize use of country-level data and
       estimation of uncertainty around the estimates. The methodology used in this round by
       the MMEIG builds directly upon previous methods, but now provides estimates that are
       more informed by national data. It also supports more realistic assessments of uncertainty
       about those estimates, based on the quality of data used to produce them. The statistical
       code and full database used to produce the current estimates are publicly available
       online.1

    Globally, the MMR fell by nearly 44% over the past 25 years, to an estimated 216 (80%
    uncertainty interval [UI]2 206 to 249) maternal deaths per 100 000 live births in 2015, from
    an MMR of 385 (UI 359 to 427) in 1990. The annual number of maternal deaths decreased by
    43% from approximately 532 000 (UI 496 000 to 590 000) in 1990 to an estimated 303 000
    (UI 291 000 to 349 000) in 2015. The approximate global lifetime risk of a maternal death fell
    considerably from 1 in 73 to 1 in 180.
    Developing regions account for approximately 99% (302 000) of the global maternal deaths
    in 2015, with sub-Saharan Africa alone accounting for roughly 66% (201 000), followed by
    Southern Asia (66 000). Estimated MMR declined across all MDG regions3 between 1990 and
    2015, although the magnitude of the reduction differed substantially between regions. The
    greatest decline over that period was observed in Eastern Asia (72%). As of 2015, the two regions
    with highest MMR are sub-Saharan Africa (546; UI 511 to 652) and Oceania (187; UI 95 to 381).
    At the country level, Nigeria and India are estimated to account for over one third of all
    maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, with an approximate 58 000 maternal deaths (19%)
    and 45 000 maternal deaths (15%), respectively. Sierra Leone is estimated to have the
    highest MMR at 1360 (UI 999 to 1980). Eighteen other countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa,
    are estimated to have very high MMR in 2015, with estimates ranging from 999 down to
    500 deaths per 100 000 live births: Central African Republic (881; UI 508 to 1500), Chad
    (856; UI 560 to 1350), Nigeria (814; UI 596 to 1180), South Sudan (789; UI 523 to 1150),
    Somalia (732; UI 361 to 1390), Liberia (725; UI 527 to 1030), Burundi (712; UI 471 to 1050),
    Gambia (706; UI 484 to 1030), Democratic Republic of the Congo (693; UI 509 to 1010),
    Guinea (679; UI 504 to 927), Côte d’Ivoire (645; UI 458 to 909), Malawi (634; UI 422 to 1080),
    Mauritania (602; UI 399 to 984), Cameroon (596; UI 440 to 881), Mali (587; UI 448 to 823),
    Niger (553; UI 411 to 752), Guinea-Bissau (549; UI 273 to 1090) and Kenya (510; UI 344 to
    754). The two countries with the highest estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality are
    Sierra Leone with an approximate risk of 1 in 17, and Chad with an approximate risk of 1 in
    18. The estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality in high-income countries is 1 in 3300 in
    comparison with 1 in 41 in low-income countries.
    Emergent humanitarian settings and situations of conflict, post-conflict and disaster
    significantly hinder the progress of maternal mortality reduction. In such situations, the
    breakdown of health systems can cause a dramatic rise in deaths due to complications that
    would be easily treatable under stable conditions. In countries designated as fragile states,
    the estimated lifetime risk of maternal mortality is 1 in 54.
    Globally, approximately 1.6% (4700) of all maternal deaths are estimated to be AIDS-related
    indirect maternal deaths. In sub-Saharan Africa, 2.0% of all maternal deaths are estimated
    to be AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths, yielding an AIDS-related indirect MMR of 11
    maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. In 2015 there are five countries where 10% or more
    of maternal deaths are estimated to be AIDS-related indirect maternal deaths: South Africa
    (32%), Swaziland (19%), Botswana (18%), Lesotho (13%) and Mozambique (11%).

    2	 The uncertainty intervals (UI) computed for all the estimates refer to the 80% uncertainty intervals (10th and 90th percentiles
       of the posterior distributions). This was chosen as opposed to the more standard 95% intervals because of the substantial
       uncertainty inherent in maternal mortality outcomes.

Trends in maternal mortality 1990 to 2015




       Nine countries that had MMR of more than 100 in 1990 are now categorized as having
       “achieved MDG 5A” based on MMR reduction point-estimates indicating a reduction of at
       least 75% between 1990 and 2015: Bhutan, Cambodia, Cabo Verde, the Islamic Republic of
       Iran, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Rwanda and Timor-Leste.
       Based on MMR reduction point-estimates and uncertainty intervals for the same period, an
       additional 39 countries are categorized as “making progress”, 21 are categorized as having
       made “insufficient progress”, and 26 are categorized as having made “no progress”.
       Achieving the SDG target of a global MMR below 70 will require reducing global MMR by
       an average of 7.5% each year between 2016 and 2030. This will require more than three
       times the 2.3% annual rate of reduction observed globally between 1990 and 2015.
       Accurate measurement of maternal mortality levels remains an immense challenge,
       but the overall message is clear: hundreds of thousands of women are still dying due
       to complications of pregnancy and/or childbirth each year. Many of these deaths go
       uncounted. Working towards SDG 3.1 and ultimately towards ending preventable maternal
       mortality requires amplifying the efforts and progress catalysed by MDG 5. Among
       countries where maternal deaths remain high, efforts to save lives must be accelerated
       and must also be paired with country-driven efforts to accurately register births and
       deaths, including cause of death certification. Strengthening civil registration and vital
       statistics will support measurement efforts and help track progress towards reaching
       SDG 3.1. Among those countries with low overall maternal mortality, the next challenge
       is measuring and amending inequities among subpopulations. The new Global Strategy
       for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health will spearhead an enhanced global
       collaborative response aimed at ending all preventable maternal deaths.

     a
       Estimates have been computed to ensure comparability across countries, thus they are not necessarily the same as official statistics of the
     countries, which may use alternative rigorous methods.
     b
       MMR estimates have been rounded according to the following scheme: < 100 rounded to nearest 1; 100–999 rounded to nearest 1; and
     ≥ 1000 rounded to nearest 10.
     c
       Percentage change in MMR is based on rounded numbers.
     d
       Progress towards MDG 5A (i.e. to reduce MMR by 75% between 1990 and 2015) was assessed for the 95 countries with an MMR higher than
     100 in 1990. See section 4.1 and Box 5 for additional details in the full report: World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children’s Fund
     (UNICEF), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), World Bank Group, United Nations Population Division (UNPD). Trends in maternal mortality:
     1990 to 2015. Geneva: WHO; 2015 (available from: http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2015/en/).
     e
       Vital registration data were available for analysis only up to 2011. Recent hospital surveillance data for Canada (excluding Quebec) indicate a
     decline of maternal deaths per 100 000 deliveries from 8.8 in 2007/2008–2008/2009 to 5.1 in 2011/2012; some 98% of deliveries in Canada
     occur in hospitals.
