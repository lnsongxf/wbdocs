I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Niger perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Niger
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Niger
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From March to June 2016, 270 stakeholders of the WBG in Niger were invited to provide their
opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion survey.
Participants were drawn from the Office of the President, Prime Minister; office of a minister;
office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments/implementation agencies; Project
Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/
contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs; local governments; bilateral/
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/
private banks; NGOs/community based organizations; the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 229 stakeholders participated in
the survey (85% response rate).
Some respondents received and returned the questionnaires via post or online survey platform;
others completed the questionnaire with a representative from the fielding agency. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Niger; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the
WBG’s effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the
WBG; the WBG’s future role in Niger; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.
Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey (COS) must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.
The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate was 65%, N=194). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, mean
ratings, percentages of respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are
slightly different from those of the original data reported in the FY’13 COS report and the non-
weighted data presented in appendices A, B, C, D, and F. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to Appendix E (page 89). In addition, the
results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the PLR Survey conducted in
FY’15 (N=214). Data comparisons on selected questions are presented in the body of this report.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the financial sector/private banks were combined
       with those from private sector organizations; respondents from NGOs/community based
       organizations, trade unions, private foundations, faith-based groups, and youth groups
       were combined in the “CSO” category; and the small number of respondents from the
       Office of the President/Prime Minister, the office of minister, the office of
       parliamentarian, independent government institutions, and the judiciary branch were
       included in the “other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
       Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey were significantly less
        familiar with the WBG than respondents in the previous FY’13 Survey (weighted mean
        in FY’16 = 5.2; weighted mean in FY’13 = 6.1)1.
       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Niger, and significantly,
        moderately correlated with the extent to which the WBG plays a relevant role in
        development in Niger, and the extent to which the WBG contributes to the country’s
        development results.

       works too slowly” (36%), “there is not an adequate level of citizen/civil society
       participation” (31%), and “the Government works inefficiently” (27%).

Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholder groups: Respondents across stakeholder groups gave statistically similar
       overall ratings for the twenty six indicator questions. Responses for individual indicator
       questions by stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 58).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had significantly higher
       mean ratings for the aggregated responses to the twenty six COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 7.0) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 6.1). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix F (page 94).

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Niger, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty nine specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Niger. The areas determined
       to be key drivers from these analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at urban development; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at global/regional integration.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Niger, suggesting that ratings of
       effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The area determined to be key driver from these
       analyses was:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at poverty reduction; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at food security.

following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Niger? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number of respondents
indicated will be slightly different from the aggregated responses in Appendix A. Similarly, responses from FY 2013
respondents and the total number of respondents indicated may differ from those reported in the FY 2013 COS report.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 191  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 216

By weighting, the FY 2013 and FY 2016 samples have the same stakeholder composition and thus are comparable. The
weighted percentage of a stakeholder group is determined by the extent to which the World Bank Group interacts with them
in the country and the percentage this group usually makes up in the past aggregated annual global data. The weighted
stakeholder breakdown is presented below:

SECTION A: GENERAL ISSUES
 A4. The World Bank Group’s “Shared Prosperity” goal captures two key elements, economic growth
 and equity. It will seek to foster income growth among the bottom 40 percent of a country’s
 population. Improvement in the Shared Prosperity Indicator requires growth and well-being of the
 less well-off. When thinking about the idea of “shared prosperity” in your country, which of the
 following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Niger? (Choose no more than
 TWO)
  1    Consistent economic growth
  2    More reliable social safety net
  3    Greater access to finance for the poor (i.e., by developing simple mechanism such as micro-finance)
  4    Greater voice and participation for citizens to help ensure greater accountability
  5    Greater access to health and nutrition for citizens
  6    Better entrepreneurial opportunities (i.e., to start small and medium sized businesses)
  7    A growing middle class
  8    Better opportunity for the poor who live in rural areas
  9    Better opportunity for the poor who live in urban areas
       Better employment opportunities for young people (i.e., by developing labor intensive activities and
  10
       building youth skills)
  11   Better employment opportunities for women
  12   Greater equity of fiscal policy
  13   Education and training that better ensure job opportunity
