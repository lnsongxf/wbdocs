1.      Almost all formal SMEs in Jamaica have access to checking or saving accounts, but
the financial sector is scarcely used to finance their investments. Most SMEs in Jamaica have
a bank account, but less than a third have a bank loan or line of credit (well below the 48 percent
average in LAC).2 As a result, investments are mostly financed with own funds, delaying decisions
and eroding productivity, competitiveness and growth. The lack of funding for the SME sector, or
its high cost, has a negative impact on entrepreneurship and business profitability and stability
through the business life-cycle, having a particularly negative effect on employment.

2. There are several factors that have constrained bank lending to MSMEs. These factors
include, inter alia: (i) traditionally banks have not saturated lending in the retail segment due to
investment opportunities in low-risk Government securities and have not felt the need to diversify
into other segments; (ii) lending to the MSME segment has been perceived as high risk due to
significant information asymmetries that exist in the market (lack of credit reporting systems) and
the high level of informality, especially of micro-entrepreneurs3, resulting in higher interest rates
for this segment or refusal of credit; (iii) lack of adequate traditional collateral owned by MSMEs
as required by banks, focused mostly on real estate or motor vehicles; (iv) lack of bank strategies,
processes, lending methodologies, and financial instruments to lend to this segment, although
banks have started to develop such methodologies; and (v) lack of reliable financial statements for
MSMEs that makes it difficult for banks to assess risks.

3.      In addition, the supply of formal nonbank sources of finance is limited, especially for
micro-enterpreneurs, with credit unions providing mostly consumer finance and an
underdeveloped microfinance sector. Credit unions’ assets represent less than 5 percent of GDP
and they provide mostly consumer finance (9 percent of the loan portfolio is provided to micro-
entrepreneurs). 4 The current regulatory framework for credit unions is being revised and
supervision will be undertaken by Bank of Jamaica (BoJ). In addition, the microfinance sector is
small and remains largely unregulated. The absence of a regulatory framework over the activities
of microfinance may hinder the growth of the sector. The authorities aim to develop a Micro-Credit
Act to make it mandatory for MIFs to register, and to create a regulatory authority to oversee MFIs.
The regulatory environment for microfinance should provide a level playing field amongst
financial institutions providing microfinance. The regulatory framework for credit unions should
take into account the specific characteristics of the sector, and BoJ should have overall
responsibility for supervising and regulating all the lenders in the market, including credit unions
and MFIs (non-prudential supervision of MFIs), in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and other
market distortions.

4.      Beyond credit, the supply of alternative sources of finance for MSMEs is limited. The
absence of alternative products beyond credit lines or personal loans represents a hurdle for MSME
activity. Factoring is not developed, and leasing is scarcely used due to lack of tax incentives. As

a result, working capital is funded exclusively with credit lines at high rates, representing a
significant obstacle for the development of the private sector. Also in terms of equity, source of
alternative finance are limited in the market. Venture capital is not developed, and there are only
22 companies listed in the Jamaican Stock Exchange for SMEs (Junior Stock Market) with low
liquidity and turnover ratios. Alternative sources of finance that are particularly valuable for SMEs,
such as factoring, leasing, and venture capital should be developed and promoted. 5 Similarly,
specific instruments to facilitate access to finance for micro-entrepreneurs and farmers should be
designed, such as micro-insurance.

5.      The authorities have taken significant initiatives to enhance the legal and regulatory
environment and financial infrastructure, but further efforts are needed. The Government
has developed an ambitious package of legislative reforms to ease doing business for MSMEs and
has improved regulation for deposit-taking institutions. In addition, several reforms have been
undertaken to expand financial infrastructure, including the establishment of three credit bureaus6
(although data fragmentation is a concern), the modernization of the secured transactions legal
framework and establishment of the movable collateral registry (although improvements for the
set-up of the registry are ongoing), and adoption of the insolvency law, which is expected to
facilitate out-of-court restructurings. However, further efforts are needed in these areas, to:
enhance the credit reporting oversight and consumer protection framework, further enhance the
regulations of the movable collateral registry, and develop regulations for the insolvency law along
with training of judges and insolvency administrators.

6. The authorities have also put in place public programs for MSME finance, however they
lack sufficient coordination, and the partial credit guarantee scheme needs to be revamped.
There are several public programs, such as the Micro Investment Development Agency (MIDA),
the Self-Start Fund (SSF), Jamaica Business Development Corporation (JBDC), and others that
lend and provide capacity building to SMEs. Consideration should be given to review and
consolidate these programs, with a view to improve efficiency and effectiveness. The
Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ) is one of the main players for MSME finance, as it provides
on-lending via financial institutions (about 2 percent of banks’ lending to MSMEs). It also operates
a partial credit guarantee scheme, which is not being utilized by lenders. Thus, its design should
be reviewed and revamped to ensure adequate incentives for lenders to use it and its sustainability.

                                    I.     MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

1. Over the past 30 years, Jamaica has experienced low economic growth and high fiscal
deficits, with a significant impact on the development of the financial sector. In the last 30
years, Jamaica’s real GDP per capita has increased at an average of one per cent per annum.
Natural disasters, financial shocks coupled with unstable and lax fiscal policies, resulted in
persistent public deficits financed through significant public sector borrowings. High borrowings
led to both high financing costs with crowding out of private sector investments, and
macroeconomic uncertainty driven by unsustainable public debt ratios, at about 147 percent by
2013. Nevertheless, Jamaica's macroeconomic outcomes have recovered and are expected to
improve. For fiscal year 2014, growth is estimated at 0.9 percent and for fiscal years 2015 and
2016, it is projected at 0.9 and 2.1 percent, respectively.7

2. The Government of Jamaica (GoJ) has articulated a comprehensive program of reforms
that includes fiscal consolidation and a strategy to promote private sector-led growth. The
Government's economic reforms will benefit from the signed GoJ-IMF Extended Fund Facility
Arrangement (EFF) for SDR in the amount of 615.4 million (about US$932.3 million) for the
period of April 2013 to March 2017, and support from the World Bank and the IDB, each having
agreed to allocate US$510 million over the next four years.

3. The macroeconomic and fiscal context has determined the development of the financial
sector, whose assets represent 129 percent of GDP but with a low credit penetration. The
combination of slow economic growth rates and high level of sovereign debt issuance has limited
the evolution of the corporate and financial sectors. The high ratio of financial assets to GDP is
due to the large proportion of sovereign debt on the financial sector’s balance sheet, which has
crowded out its primary function of lending to the economy. Government instruments accounted
for about 20 percent of bank assets at end-2013.8

                                     II.      FINANCIAL SECTOR LANDSCAPE

4. Financial intermediation in Jamaica remains low. Notwithstanding the recent credit
expansion, the stock of credit remains subdued. Credit has grown by an average of 11 percent in
the last five years. Credit to private sector stands at J$450 billion (US$ 4 billion), representing 29
percent of GDP and 46 percent of the total assets of Deposit-Taking Institutions (DTIs), whereas
bank deposits represent 40 percent of GDP. Both credit and deposit penetrations are well below
their expected value based on the country’s structural characteristics, such as income and
demographic indicators, and below peer countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, and Antigua and
Barbuda.9

5. The financial sector is fragmented. DTIs supervised by Bank of Jamaica (BoJ), including
six commercial banks, two merchant banks, and three building societies, represent only 52 percent
of total financial sector assets 10 . Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) include non-bank
securities dealers (23 percent of assets), insurance companies (11 percent), credit unions (3
percent), and pension funds (12 percent). Despite credit unions’ small share of total lending, their
client base consists of a third of the population. In addition, there is a small microfinance sector
(over 100 companies), which is largely unregulated. 11

6. The financial sector has been resilient with adequate profitability, capitalization, and
provisioning. Despite the two debt restructurings, financial sector soundness indicators remain
adequate, with DTIs exceeding the 10 percent minimum capital adequacy ratio (15.1 percent as of
end-2013). Non-performing loans have declined to 5.4 percent in December 2013, as a result of
write-offs, payments and loan growth, with provisioning increasing to 96 percent of NPLs in
December 2013. Banks are fairly profitable (with a 2 percent average ROA and a 14 percent ROE
at end-2013) as a result of a high net interest margin (higher than 9 percent over total assets).12 The
stress test results from BoJ show that commercial banks would remain adequately capitalized even
under reasonable additional stress, and could absorb losses associated with significant hypothetical
depreciations of the Jamaican Dollar and increases in NPLs.

7. The financial sector has a relatively comfortable liquidity position, despite short term
liquidity pressures as a result of the national debt exchange and the transfer of government
deposits from banks to the Central Treasury Management System at BoJ. Liquid assets
represent about 25 percent of total assets 13 . The liquidity situation of the financial sector was
negatively affected by the implementation of the National Debt Exchange (NDX) in February 2013
and the subsequent illiquidity of GOJ debt instruments14, and the movement of GoJ deposits from
commercial banks to Central Treasury Management System accounts at the BoJ. However, the
ratio of deposits to loans remains at 137 percent, and the ratio of short term assets to short term
liabilities remains at 40 percent, showing a comfortable structural liquidity position.15 In fact, lack

   Commercial banks and merchant banks are required to hold reserves amounting to 26 per cent of their average
prescribed liabilities in the form of liquid assets.
14
   The NDX was characterized by a reduction in the interest rates on GOJ domestic bonds of between 1and 5
percentage points as well as an extension of the maturity profile. In an effort to alleviate the operational impact this
tighter liquidity position could have in the banking sector, BoJ provided funds to DTIs through special repurchase
agreements.

of significant pressure on liquidity can also be inferred by analyzing the cost of funding. Despite
the short term liquidity concerns, the average cost of deposits has not increased, and remains at 2
percent, well below the inflation rate.

8. There is an uneven regulatory and supervisory framework for lending institutions.
Parliament has passed the Banking Services Act, which consolidates existing pieces of legislation
and regulations that govern DTIs. However, other lending institutions have significant presence in
specific sectors (e.g. public agencies in the mortgage market), segments of the population (e.g.
credit unions in low income households), and geographic areas (e.g. NPCB in rural areas), and
have different regulatory and supervisory frameworks. The regulatory and supervisory
heterogeneity in the market could be an impediment to sound and stronger growth.

Financial Intermediation by DTIs

9. Commercial banks are the main players in the credit market, but competition is low and
the portfolio is concentrated in loans to households and large corporates. Commercial banks
represent 70 percent of the total loan portfolio of DTIs and credit unions, and credit unions 10
percent. Competition among banks is low with the two largest banks – National Commercial Bank
and Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica – holding about 75 percent of assets and deposits of the banking
sector. As a result of the activity on the sovereign bond market (government securities accounted
for 20 percent of bank assets at end-2013), banks’ balance sheets still show a low ratio of loans to
total assets, with a focus on household and corporate loans, and in urban areas. Lending to MSMEs
represents about 20 percent of the total portfolio of commercial banks and merchant banks
(building societies focus on mortgage lending).16

10. Deposit-taking institutions (DTIs) activity is funded with short term deposits (80 percent
of total liabilities) as long term funding is nonexistent. Deposits are growing steadily at an
average rate close to inflation and in the absence of other alternative saving instruments, and in a
context in which DTIs will continue reducing their exposure to public debt (it has decreased by
more than 5 percentage points in the last four years), the availability of funds for lending should
remain at comfortable levels. Deposits have grown at an average of 8 percent in during 2009 -
2013, at a similar rate for households (5.9 percent) and corporates (6.6 percent). Individuals hold
more than 40 percent of deposits, enterprises less than a third, and the public sector holds about 16
percent of total deposits, at end-2013. As a share of GDP, household deposits accounted for 14
percent and corporate deposits for 11 percent in 2013. Deposits are mostly short term demand and
savings deposits (more than 70 percent). 17 See Figure 3.

11. Credit has grown by an average of 11 percent in the last five years. Credit growth has
been driven by lending to households, at an average of 13 percent during 2009-2013, compared to
an average of less than 6 percent growth in lending to corporates. Corporate loans account for
about 40 percent of lending to the private sector, and consumer lending consists of mortgage,
installment, and personal loans. A significant share of loans (more than 40 percent) mature beyond
5 years, about 23 percent of loans have maturities of up to 1 year, and 25 percent of 1 -5 years

12. Loans are diversified across sectors of the economy. At end-2013, distribution accounted
for about a quarter of total loans, tourism for 16 percent, and construction for 15 percent.
Manufacturing and the agriculture sector receive a low share of lending, 8 percent and 5 percent
respectively. The agriculture sector’s contribution to the economy is not high, as agriculture
represents 6.5 percent of GDP, and 17 percent of the labor force. More than half of land is
unregistered, making it difficult for banks to lend against this type of collateral. Most agriculture
is done by small scale farmers.

Financial Intermediation by Credit unions and MFIs

13. Credit unions represent a small share of total lending, but have over 1 million members
(a third of the total population), and provide mostly consumer finance. There are 37 credit
unions, with assets of less than 5 percent of GDP (J$ 76 billion or about US$ 685 million),
representing 7 percent of DTIs’ loan portfolio. About 9 percent of their total loan portfolio is
provided to micro-entrepreneurs for productive purposes. Since 2009, their loan portfolio has
grown by an average of 10 percent (yoy), while deposits have grown by 7 percent (yoy) in the
same period. Credit unions only lend to their members, including to sole traders. About a third of
members are in rural areas. They have 76 branches, the majority of which are located outside of
Kingston and St. Andrew parish. 19 There is significant concentration among the largest credit
unions, with the four largest representing about half of the sector’s assets (CWJ, Jamaica Teachers’
Association, COK Sodality, and First Heritage Cooperative). They are currently registered and
regulated by the Department of Cooperatives and Friendly Societies in the Ministry of Industry,
Investment, and Commerce, and will be supervised by BoJ under the upcoming Credit Unions
regulations (see section on the legal framework).

14. In addition, there is a small microfinance sector, which is largely unregulated. It is
estimated that there are about 100 microfinance companies in Jamaica. A bank (Scotia bank) and
a building society (Jamaica National) have set up microfinance companies. However, most of them
are unaffiliated with the formal financial sector. These companies are non-deposit taking
institutions and dependent on their capital base and borrowings to fund lending. The loan portfolio
is estimated at about J$8 billion (US$ 80 million).20 This represents about 25 percent of the total
lending of credit unions. They also serve a small client base of approximately 30,000 – 40,000
borrowers. The largest MFIs are Access (with a loan portfolio of about US$ 12 million and 7,000
borrowers) and Jamaica National Small Business Loans (loan portfolio of US$ 10 million, and
13,000 borrowers).21 They provide both consumer lending and loans to micro-entrepreneurs. There
is a microfinance association with 11 members, but the largest ones do not form part of the
association.

15. Microfinance companies are charging a rate of 1% a week, or above 50 percent yearly.
The Money Lending Act caps the interest rate from microfinance companies at 40% yearly, but
allows exemptions from this requirement), a process that seems rather simple, with microfinance
companies applying to the Ministry of Finance yearly for such an exemption. The reported interest
rates are high, but the cost of managing many small loans is expensive and micro-lenders charge
higher interest rates than other financial institutions to account for that and cover their
costs. Research analyzing the key determinants of microcredit interest rates (such as the cost of
funds, loan-loss expense, operating expenses, profits) to understand what drives the high interest
rates charged by microcredit providers, have shown that operating expenses are the largest
determinant of the interest rate. From the perspective of the demand side, timely availability, easy
accessibility of micro credit, and low collateral requirements are often the most important factors
for micro-borrowers. The adoption of technology is the way forward to reach customers better and
lower operating costs. In addition, given concerns with high microfinance rates, an interest rate

decomposition can be undertaken to determine the primary factors driving the high interest rates
in microfinance in Jamaica.

16. The absence of a regulatory framework and authority to oversee the activities of
microfinance may hinder the growth of microfinance. Instead of an interest rate cap, there are
other ways to protect small borrowers, such as requiring transparent disclosure of loan costs and
terms, prohibiting abusive lending and collection practices, establishing complaint resolution
systems, and improving consumers’ financial literacy. The Microcredit bill is expected to make it
mandatory for MFIs to register, will establish the qualifying criteria for registration, and will make
them subject to a regulatory authority


                                        III.    MSME FINANCE MARKET

Firms’ demand for financial services

17. MSMEs22 are expected to contribute significantly to the country’s employment and the
economy. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 formal SMEs in Jamaica, and between
200,000 – 400,000 micro-entrepreneurs, although there are no recent official estimations on the
size and composition of the MSME sector. According to different sources and surveys, the Own
Account Worker category (i.e. any person who operates a business but did not employ paid help)
is estimated to account for 36 per cent of the employed labor force23 and most MSMEs are involved
in wholesale and retail trade (more than 50 percent) and community, social, and personal services
sectors (23 percent). More than half of the micro and small businesses are located in the Kingston
metropolitan and other urban areas (St. Andrew and St. Catherine).24

18. However, MSMEs face access to finance constraints that limit their ability to invest,
grow, create jobs, and contribute to the economy. According to the 2010 World Bank Enterprise
Surveys, almost all formal SMEs have access to checking or saving accounts, but only about 27
percent have a bank loan or line of credit, well below the average of 48 percent in LAC. More than
40 percent of firms in Jamaica consider access to finance as a major constraint, but especially small
enterprises (47 percent, compared to the average of 32 percent in LAC). The top three business
environment constraints in 2010 in Jamaica were tax rates, electricity, and access to finance.




22
   A national definition for MSMEs in Jamaica was established in 2011 under the Ministry of Industry, Investment
and Commerce’s “MSME & Entrepreneurship Policy”. Microenterprises are defined as enterprises employing 5
persons or less and have an annual turnover not exceeding $10 million. Small enterprises employ between 6 and 20
people and have an annual turnover between $10 and $50 million. Medium-sized enterprises employ between 21 and
50 persons and have an annual turnover between $50 and $150 million.
23
   According to the 2011 Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) Labor Force Survey. In Latin America, formal
SMEs account for over 90 percent of enterprises, with small firms accounting for over 60 percent of enterprises,

19. Access to finance constraints result in investments being financed primarily with SMEs’
own funds. About 72 percent of investments are financed internally (above the average of 63
percent for LAC), while only 22 percent are financed by banks (similar to the average in LAC).25
Due to such constraints, investments tend to be limited or delayed, resulting in lost productive
capacity, eroding competitiveness, sales, and ultimately growth.

Lending to MSMEs

20. Bank have been lending mostly to profitable sectors, such as loans to larger firms,
avoiding riskier and more difficult segments to serve, like MSMEs. According to BoJ’s Credit
Conditions survey of 2013, MSMEs received about 18 percent of DTIs’ lending to the private
sector in 2013, while large enterprises received 23 percent of lending to the private sector. 26 Banks
are the main providers of credit for MSMEs, with credit unions providing 4 percent of total lending

percent of loans.

21. In terms of the enabling environment, banks perceive recent reforms in the credit
information sharing environment and movable collateral registration as positive
developments to encourage them to serve MSMEs. Credit information sharing is nascent in
Jamaica. The data submission process to credit bureaus, which started operation in 2013, is still
ongoing. Although the credit bureaus are still receiving data and the process is ongoing, banks are
requesting credit reports from their customers, already helping in identifying creditworthy
customers. Equally, the establishment of the movable collateral registry is recognized by banks as
a positive development, although registration is not being done in bulk yet, and banks report
skepticism about enforcing movable collateral. Overall enforcement of collateral can be difficult.

22. There are several factors that have constrained lending to MSMEs. These factors include:
(i) traditionally banks have not saturated lending in the retail segment due to investment
opportunities in low-risk instruments and have not felt the need to diversify into other segments;
(ii) lending to the MSME segment has been perceived as high risk due to significant information
asymmetries that exist in the market (earlier absence of credit reporting systems) and the high level
of informality, especially of micro-entrepreneurs 27 , resulting in higher interest rates for this
segment or refusal of credit; (iii) lack of adequate traditional collateral by MSMEs as required by
banks, focused mostly on real estate or motor vehicles; (iv) lack of bank strategies, processes,
lending methodologies, and financial instruments to lend to this segment, although banks have
started to develop such methodologies; and (v) lack of reliable financial statements for MSMEs
that makes it difficult for banks to assess risks.

   43% of the economy is estimated to be informal. Enterprises in the informal sector are concentrated in low-
productivity, labor-intensive activities. Nearly 60% of Jamaicans in the informal sector work in the wholesale/retail
trade or agriculture. In addition, a 2008 survey revealed that about half of MSMEs surveyed claimed to be registered
with the Companies Office of Jamaica (COJ) (IDB, 2006. The Informal Sector in Jamaica).


                                                                  14
      Banks have had high return- low risk investment opportunities. In the last five years,
       the banking sector has had limited incentives to increase lending due to the availability of
       investment opportunities in low risk GoJ securities.

      Lack of a more developed financial infrastructure and insufficient competition in the
       banking sector, have contributed to higher credit risk, and higher interest rates.
       Lending rates28 averaged at about 18 percent in 2013, and are three times as high for micro-
       entrepreneurs as for medium-sized firms, while the cost of raising deposits averages at about
       2 percent (a 16 percent spread). Interest rates are higher for MSMEs due to the higher risks
       and higher transaction costs. MSMEs make more extensive use of short-term credit that
       carry higher interest rates. Credit unions and MFIs charge rates of above 50 percent annually
       for microenterprise loans. The absence of a public credit registry and the incipient situation
       of the credit bureaus 29 have increased credit risk for financial institutions, by making it
       difficult for them to assess the level of indebtedness and borrowers’ repayment capacity,
       and thus having high traditional collateral requirements. When compared to other peer
       countries, Jamaica has the highest interest rate spreads (Figure 8).

      MSMEs lack adequate traditional collateral required by banks, focused mostly on real
       estate or motor vehicles. Banks offer mostly secured credit to SMEs. The main sources of
       collateral are real estate, as well as vehicles and equipment. In addition to other
       requirements, banks also require letters of references from MSMEs. On average, the value
       of collateral needed for an SME loan is more than 200 percent of the loan amount (compared
       to 140 percent of the loan amount for large enterprises), according to the Enterprise Surveys
       of 2010, higher than its peers (such as, Trinidad & Tobago, Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados,
       Belize).

      Banks have limited strategies, processes, lending methodologies, and financial
       instruments to lend to this segment, although banks have started to develop such
       methodologies. Banks serve SME clients primarily through their branch network, and the
       largest banks have started to develop processes and methodologies for lending to this
       segment. Most of the large banks have SME departments.

28
   As a result of high lending rates (18 percent, which compares to 8.25 percent for 180-day T-bill and a 9.5 percent
inflation rate in December 2013) and low cost of funds (2 percent weighted average deposit in local currency rate),
the Net Interest Margin for DTIs was 8.9 percent of average assets in 2013.

        Banks are cautious to lend to MSMEs because many are considered unbankable due
         to the lack of reliable financial statements. Banks report that the financial statements of
         MSMEs are not reliable, and they consider this factor as one of the most significant
         obstacles for them to lend to MSMEs.

        A large share of firms remains in the informal sector, especially microfirms, and thus
         do not enter the formal financial sector. A significant part of the economy is informal
         (estimated at about 43 percent of GDP),30 and does not have sufficient access to the formal
         financial sector (except from the credit unions and MFIs). Enterprises in the informal sector
         are concentrated in low-productivity, labor-intensive activities. Nearly 60% of Jamaicans in
         the informal sector work in the wholesale/retail trade or agriculture. In addition, a 2008
         survey revealed that about half of MSMEs surveyed claimed to be registered with the
         Companies Office of Jamaica (COJ). 31 Informality affects negatively MSMEs’ growth
         prospects and their ability to raise finance. Banks report that informality is a significant
         obstacle as they do not approach the financial sector.

23. In addition, the supply of nonbank sources of finance especially for micro-entrepreneurs
is limited, with credit unions providing mostly consumer finance and a an underdeveloped
microfinance sector. Credit unions provide mostly consumer finance to lower income households,
with about 9 percent of their loan portfolio to micro-entrepreneurs for productive purposes. In
addition, MFIs are small, largely unregulated, and for micro-enterprise lending they report annual
interest rates of about 50 percent.32 The high cost of funds and high administrative expenses for
small loans contribute to the high interest rate. Given the high interest rate charged, the short term
maturity, and the low value of such loans, they fill a gap for immediate liquidity for micro-
entrepreneurs, but not for financing investments.

Alternative Sources of Finance for SMEs

24. Financial instruments that can be especially valuable for SMEs are lacking in the
market, such as factoring and leasing. The recent modernization of the secured transactions
reform should encourage the development of such movable asset based financing instruments.

25.     Factoring33 does not exist in Jamaica and there is a general lack of awareness about
this instrument. Factoring and reverse factoring would help small businesses finance their
production cycle, since they lack access to bank credit and most buyers usually take between 30
and 90 days to pay. Factoring schemes are widely used to provide SMEs with immediate working
capital on the basis of their receivables from large firms, and become important instruments,
especially in an environment with weak contract enforcement regimes Factoring provides many
benefits to SMEs, both credit and a way to manage cash flow. In traditional factoring, the factor
purchases many accounts receivables from SMEs, and needs to collect credit information and

33
   Factoring is a form of financing in which SMEs sell accounts receivables to a financial firm (the factor) at a
discount (equal to interest plus service fees) and receive immediate cash. The title of the accounts receivables is
transferred to the factor.

                                                          16
assess the credit risk for a large number of buyers. However, in an alternative way, reverse
factoring, the factor purchases receivables only from high quality buyers. In this manner, reverse
factoring mitigates the problem of information opacity as factors need assess the credit risk of a
few large transparent firms, as well as the risk of fraudulent invoices.

26. In Jamaica, factoring is not recognized as a financial service in the Banking Services
Act, and there is no factoring law. The development of factoring is affected by specific legal,
regulatory, and tax issues, which need to be assessed, including the recognition of the sale and
purchase of accounts receivables, the treatment of this instrument in the financial regulatory
framework (or how factoring companies are regulated compared to other financial services firms),
and tax considerations, as stamp duties on factored invoices and VAT might make factoring
transactions too costly. Jamaica has an Electronic Transactions Law that should favor the
development of factoring.

27. In addition, there is very limited leasing conducted by commercial banks. Financial
leasing is defined in the Banking Services Act as a permissible activity for DTIs, but there is no
leasing law. There appear to be ambiguities amongst market players as to whether they can
undertake leasing as a financial service, whether a special license is needed, and what the benefits
would be for offering such an instrument.34 Leasing would enable SMEs to finance an investment
without owning assets, and they would be able to lower taxes by recording the full lease payment
as an expense. It would also enable lessors to reduce credit risk as it resolves the issue of lack of
collateral and financial information/credit history from the SME, it provides a stronger legal
position for seizing equipment since they own it, and would benefit from tax deduction for the
depreciation. Preferential tax treatment for leasing transactions would encourage its development.
A relevant issue is also the existence of second-hand market for certain equipment, in which to
sell the equipment if an SME defaults and the equipment is seized. There is an indication that there
would be difficulty in selling certain repossessed equipment in the second hand market in Jamaica.

28. Beyond debt financing, there is limited equity financing for SMEs. Venture capital
investments in Jamaica have generally operated informally, through the entrepreneur’s own funds
or from friends and family. The development of venture capital presents an opportunity to finance
high-growth firms, given an enabling legal and regulatory environment and policy commitment.
In addition, the Junior Stock Market for SMEs is small and not liquid.35 Only 22 SMEs are listed
and since its establishment in 2009, SMEs have raised about J$3.5 billion (US$ 27 million) in the
Junior Market (compared to J$ 10 billion or US$ 90 million raised in the overall market). As of
end-2013, market capitalization was J$ 27 billion (US$ 270 million, about 10 percent of the overall
market capitalization), with traded volumes of about 477 million for a value of J$1.4 billion (US$
12 million). This constitutes on average 29 trades a day, with a daily value of less than J$5.5
million (US$ 45,000). 36 The limited number of firms that would qualify to be listed, lack of
liquidity, lack of relevant institutional investors, and the risks presented by such investments for
retail investors, do not encourage the development of this market.



34
   In developing countries on average about 15 percent of investments are financed via leasing.
35
   The Junior Market is designed for SMEs to raise between J$50 million and J$500 million. It has provided tax
advantages for SMEs to list, and allows for reduced fees, and requires companies to appoint a mentor to assist them
with corporate governance principles, financial reporting, etc.

29. In addition, micro-insurance is an important financial service that would mitigate risks
for micro-entrepreneurs and farmers, but is currently limited. Micro-insurance would enable
micro-entrepreneurs and farmers to mitigate risks in their daily lives and businesses. Currently, the
offer of micro-insurance products is focused on funeral coverage, some specific loans, employer-
based insurance products with low premiums paid by employees, and for simple accident coverage.
A micro-insurance product (index based: wind speed or rain fall) has been developed and offered
to farmers to protect their agriculture products. The authorities are working towards drafting a
specific regulation for micro-insurance, which is currently treated in the same manner as regular
insurance.

                                 IV.     LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK

30. BoJ does not have in place a modified regulatory framework in terms of documentation
requirements that could incentivize lending to MSMEs. Documentation requirements and
certain regulatory norms can limit banks’ lending activity to SMEs. In Jamaica, as a result of AML
regulations, banks require audited financial statements, proof of tax compliance, recommendation
letters and other requirements from MSMEs.37 Jamaica has adopted IFRS for all SMEs, but in
many countries IFRS for SMEs has been considered excessively costly and complex for smaller
firms.38 A large share of the firms in Jamaica consists of small businesses and it is costly for such
small borrowers to be required to submit audited financial statements.39

31. BoJ will undertake official supervision of credit unions with the enactment of the Credit
Unions’ Regulation to be issued under the Bank of Jamaica Act. Credit unions are currently
registered and regulated by the Department of Cooperatives and Friendly Societies in the Ministry
of Industry, Investment, and Commerce as per the Cooperative Societies Act. Credit unions have
also been identified as “specified financial institutions” under the Bank of Jamaica Act by the
MoF, which enabled BoJ to request financial and other information from credit unions as
necessary. The Credit Union League is also involved in the voluntary regulation of credit unions
and it maintains a stabilization fund for credit unions.

32. The development of a clear regulatory framework40 for credit unions and the transfer
of supervisory oversight to BoJ is a positive development. Lack of a clear regulatory framework
for credit unions has created uncertainties amongst the industry in recent years. Following
extensive consultations with the industry, BoJ is in the process of modifying the regulations.
Initially, proposed provisions included requiring a cap on secured lending of 10 percent of total
loans, when the microfinance business is mostly unsecured, or requiring full provisioning for all
loans over 90 days (modified in the current revisions to require full provisioning for unsecured
loans at 180 days, 50% provisioning for secured NPLs of over 360 days, and full provisioning for

37
   KYC requirements are currently under review in the context of supervision and AML oversight approach from a
risk based perspective. There is a pending review/update of supervisory guidance on the requirement of audited
financial statements, or alternative submissions that would be acceptable.
38
   The EU exempts firms with fewer than 50 employees from obligatory audits, to strike a balance between improving
transparency and reducing the regulatory burden for small firms.
39
    The Enterprise Surveys of 2010 indicated that over 44 percent of formal firms in Jamaica were sole proprietors
(compared to 31 percent in LAC). 14 percent of firms were LLCs (compared to above 40 percent in LAC), 12 percent
partnerships, and 29 percent limited partnerships.

                  minimum capital requirement of J$ 5 million (compared to 60 million for commercial banks). The
                  regulation should also take into account the implications of the SIPP law that broadened the range
                  of personal property that can be taken as collateral.

 • Minimum capital should, in principle at least, be set high enough to ensure that the institution can cover the
 infrastructure, MIS, and start-up losses to reach a viable scale. Minimum capital should also provide incentives for
 adequate performance and continued operation.
 • Where possible, it is usually preferable to set minimum capital through regulation rather than legislation, but the
 regulator needs to be clear in its communications with the market to avoid a perception that the regulator is
 unpredictable. Primary among other advantages, setting the requirement through regulation makes it easier for
 supervisors who are new to microfinance to start with a manageable number of new licensees, reserving the option
 of reducing minimum capital and licensing more institutions as experience is gained.
 • Regulation—including any proposed new regulation that provides for depository microfinance —should clearly
 define the types of permissible activities that a prudentially regulated institution may engage in.
 • There are strong arguments (and recent experiences) that support the imposition of higher capital adequacy
 standards for specialized depository MFIs than for banks.
 • A microloan portfolio should not be limited to a specified percentage of the lender’s equity nor burdened w ith a
 high general provision requirement simply because the loans are not conventionally collateralized.
 • Absent special circumstances, performing microloans should have the same provision requirement as other loan
 categories that are not particularly risky. However, the provisioning schedule for delinquent microloans that are
 uncollateralized should be more aggressive than the provisioning schedule for secured bank loans.
 • Boards of deposit-taking MFIs should be independent of management and should include members with
 experience in finance and banking, as well as members who understand the clients well.
 • Specialized MFIs may need higher, rather than lower, liquidity requirements.
 • MFIs should not borrow or transact in foreign currency without having the capacity to assess and manage currency
 risk.
 • Given the size of microloans and the nature of the borrowers, loan documentation requirements need to be lighter
 for microcredit than for conventional bank lending.
 • Prohibitions against co-signers as borrowers may need to be relaxed.
 • Branching requirements should be re-examined, but not necessarily eliminated, for microfinance.
 • The content and frequency of reports should enable supervisors to conduct the analyses needed for effective
 supervision of a depository MFI. However, regulation must also consider the circumstances of its supervised
 institutions, which may not be able to comply with some requirements applicable to banks.
 • With respect to MFIs that are not member-owned and that receive favorable regulatory treatment because of their
 focus on poor clients, it is hard to see a reason for any insider lending except perhaps small welfare loans to
 employees
 • When creating new regimes for depository microfinance, regulators should take c are that full-service banks and
 other financial institutions (not just MFIs) are enabled to provide microfinance services.

 Basel Core Principles and Deposit-Taking Microfinance

 The 2010 guidance paper on Basel Core Principles for Microfinance, applying the 25 principles to microfinance
 activities in depository institutions, highlight the importance of a proportionate (risk-based) approach as well as the
 key differences between a microloan portfolio and a commercial loan portfolio. The key differences include (a) the
 particularities of the labor-intensive microlending methodology, (b) the licensing requirements, which should
 reflect different risks than those of commercial banks, (c) the particular provisioning and reserve requirements that
 should be applied to microloans, and (d) the need for different liquidity requirements (BCBS 2010).

33. Microfinance companies remain largely unregulated, and the authorities are working to
develop a Micro-Credit Act. The absence of a regulatory framework over the activities of
microfinance may hinder the growth of the sector. MFIs are governed under the Money Lending
Act (MLA) of 2004, established to regulate money lending in Jamaica and to protect borrowers

                                                           20
from unscrupulous lending practices. While the Act precludes lending institutions from charging
interest rates above a ceiling of 40 percent, some institutions are exempt, including banks, building
societies and friendly societies, as well as MFIs that receive an exemption from the Ministry of
Finance (to be renewed annually). The authorities are working on a current proposal for developing
the Micro-credit Act that would make it mandatory for MFIs to register, would establish the
qualifying criteria for registration, would create a regulatory authority to oversee the MFIs, and
would remove the interest rate cap.

                        V.      SECURED TRANSACTIONS AND INSOLVENCY FRAMEWORK

34. The authorities have undertaken significant reforms to strengthen the enabling financial
infrastructure, with improvements in the enabling environment for credit reporting
systems43, secured transactions, and insolvency and creditor rights framework. According to
Doing Business 2014, Jamaica ranked 109th on the ease of getting credit,44 below the LAC average
of 92nd. Doing Business ranks Jamaica fairly positively (8 out of 10) in the strength of legal rights
index45, but poorly in the depth of information index (0 out of 6).

                  Indicator                                    Jamaica                LAC

                  Depth of credit information index (0-6)         0                    3
                  Public registry coverage (% of adults)         0.0                  12.8
                  Private bureau coverage (% of adults)          0.0                  37.5

35. The establishment of the credit bureaus will reduce information asymmetries in the
credit market over time. Credit reporting is valuable to creditors for enhanced credit risk
assessments, and thus can facilitate access to finance for individuals and MSMEs over time.
However, the data submission process to the credit bureaus is taking place at a slower pace than
anticipated. The credit reporting oversight framework and consumer protection framework are in
the process of implementation.

36. Recent secured transactions reforms, including legal reforms and the establishment of
the movable collateral registry, would facilitate lending to MSMEs as they have mostly
movable assets. The modernization of the secured transactions reform is a positive development.
Research indicates that the establishment of movable collateral registries increases firms’ access
to bank finance.46

37. The Secured Interest in Personal Property (SIPP) Act was enacted at end-2013, and an
electronic moveable collateral registry was launched in January 2014. The Act enables

   The strength of legal rights index measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of
borrowers and lenders and thus facilitate lending.

bank finance?”

creditors to register a wide range of moveable assets, such as vehicles, equipment, agricultural
products, livestock, inventory, accounts receivables, intellectual property, and security over
present and future assets. Banks report that the electronic registry is easy to access and at a low-
cost. It is expected that the registry will become fully operational by end-2014, and improvements
are ongoing. It established a transition period of one year to register all the secured interests
previously recorded in paper-based databases. Most banks have not yet uploaded their data on
moveable collateral at the registry, are manually registering each security and cannot upload in
batch. There have been more than 44,000 secured interests filed as of end-April 2014, most of
which from retail firms selling home appliances.

38. The law includes many positive features. The positive features of the law 47 include: (i)
creation of a uniform secured transactions system that covers all existing liens and other
encumbrances; (ii) creation of a wide-ranging security interest in all types of tangible and
intangible, present and future movables; (iii) registration is generally the preferred method of
perfection, although the law provides alternate methods of publicity for specialized types of
collateral or for specialized transactions; (iv) inclusion of comprehensive rights over proceeds and
after-acquired property; and (v) creation of a modern electronic registry system and provision for
effective enforcement remedies.

39. However, potential difficulties in the regulation for the registry can be encountered.
These include: (i) the drafting style and terminology of the regulation is general and high-level,
with several important rules including the methodology, logistics and process for registration not
being specific enough); (ii) the registry process appears to give responsibilities to the registrar
beyond those necessary for the normal operation of a modern commercial registry, including the
qualification of registry information; (iii) the registry rules establish that it does not provide
constructive notice of the existence of a security interest, which is the main role of any collateral
registry; (iv) the registry rules are complex and incomplete in some sections, and generally require
registry involvement in functions that can either cause delay, error or liability for the registry.

40. Box 2 below.


41. Beyond the regulation, further efforts are needed to maximize the benefits of the new
system. The use of movable assets would require a shift in the lending culture. These include
challenges related to the lack of financial institutions’ capacity to adopt innovating lending
technologies and lack of awareness of the SME sector of the possibility of using nontraditional
types of collateral (such as accounts receivables). In addition, enforcement mechanisms have not
been tested yet, and there are concerns that the court system may not be prepared to enforce
security interests. Data collection is also incomplete, which will hinder any efforts to monitor and
evaluate the registry’s usage and efficacy. For example, there is no data on the value o f each
secured interest filed, the type/size of company, or identification of the kind of movable assets
being registered.

              Box 2. Specific issues with regards to the regulations of the registry

        Registry rules frequently mention a unique identifier number, but do not provide details of the use and
         functionality of that number in many subsequent operations regarding the initial registration. If the registry
         rules attempt to follow a folio system, it may be necessary to change the rules whereby subsequent
         amendments follow the same number system.
        Registry rules establish an electronic system. However, the rules also preserve written authorizations and
         other paper-based operations. In some cases, the registrations require the creation of printable written
         statements to be effective. These rules should be amended to make this a purely electronic registry.
        Application of the Purchase Money Security Interest (PMSI) does not appear to be reserved exclusively
         for purchases and the manner in which it extends to proceeds, accounts and other types of property, does
         not seem to require the extension of new value. Both are necessary features of a PMSI.
        There are inconsistencies in the rules for the registration of motor vehicles, whereby in some cases
         registration by serial number is mandatory but in other cases it could be interpreted as optional.
        The registry rules appear to use description of land as a potential index search criterion for fixtures.
         However, there are no specific rules on how this search would operate or the manner in which it would be
         coordinated with real estate registrations.
        The rules require the involvement of the registrar in qualifying and verifying information. They also
         require that the registrar deny some registrations based on interpretations or rules and other legal criteria.
        The rules require authorization of registrations, which opens the door to registry errors and questions as
         to the reliability of information in the system.
        In case of registry error or omission, rules allow for the validity of a registration with errors against
         subsequent creditors, even though (due to the error) it is possible that they would be unable to locate the
         security interest to which they are subject.
        The verification process (to ensure that the creditor has authorization to file) requires a written contract.
         However, the contract can take place after the registration. Although this helps with some issues (i.e. pre-
         filing), there are uncertainties regarding the validity of the period in which the registration existed but was
         not authorized, which can be confusing and cause potential problems.
        Rules that require that a registration be terminated by the creditor within 21 days after the payment of the
         secured obligation add unnecessary complications to the system, given that a registrar would be unable to
         enforce the termination, unless the registry also had access to all loan documents and payment information.
         This requirement may also reduce the possibility of using secured lines of credit in which no obligation
         may exist at numerous points in the credit relationship.




Insolvency and Creditor Rights Framework

42. The authorities are also reforming the insolvency and creditor rights framework, with
the new Bankruptcy and Insolvency bill, which is expected to foster access to credit at lower
costs. Effective frameworks for creditor rights and insolvency systems reduce the risks for lenders
and make the collateral execution process less time-consuming and less costly. Research has
shown that countries with stronger creditor rights tend to have higher rates of private credit to
GDP, and lower costs of debt.

43. The Bankruptcy and Insolvency law aims to facilitate corporate rehabilitations in
Jamaica and it introduces out-of-court work outs. It also includes personal insolvency
provisions, i.e. covering also non-corporate SMEs. While the new insolvency law has been
adopted, implementing regulations would need to be developed. There need to be clear guidelines
for the regulation and supervision of insolvency representatives, covering amongst other things,

                                                          24
professional qualification, independence requirement, etc. Significant training is also required for
judges and insolvency administrators, as well as other legal professionals.


                     VI.      GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS RELATED TO ACCESS TO FINANCE

44. The authorities have put in place several government programs and institutions for
MSME finance to address a market gap. The Development Bank of Jamaica (DBJ), publicly
owned, plays an important role for MSME finance. DBJ provides financing to MSMEs mostly
through onlending via financial institutions (commercial and merchant banks, credit unions, the
National People’s Co-operative Bank, and microfinance companies) that undertake the credit
evaluation and loan supervision.48 Eligible companies must have assets of less than US$250,000,
annual sales below US$ 4 million, and fewer than 250 employees.

45. For MSMEs in 2012 DBJ facilitated the approval of over 8,000 loans, in the amount of
J$ 1.4 billion. Of this total, the vast majority was facilitated through MFIs (about 40 percent) and
NCPB (about 38 percent), and the rest through other AFIs (17 percent). DBJ’s lending to MSMEs
constitutes almost half of credit unions portfolio to microenterprises and 2% of banks’ lending to
MSMEs. The funds are provided at attractive interest rates in the range of 10-13% to clients
involved in the productive sectors, such as agriculture, agro-processing, manufacturing, tourism,
mining and the service sectors. DBJ has also been designated as the lead agency for co-ordination
of MFI industry interventions, playing a significant role to provide funds to these institutions.49

46. In addition to DBJ, there are other banks and agencies that lend and provide capacity
building to SMEs. EXIM bank provides mostly direct lending to SMEs (a loan portfolio of around
J$8 billion), the Micro Investment Development Agency (MIDA) provides wholesale lending to
SMEs, and the Self-Start Fund provides direct lending to SMEs (expected at J$100 million in
2014/2015, in the past five years the SSF has disbursed over 600 loans valued at over J$200
million). In addition, JBDC also had a financing arm for SMEs, but it now focuses only on
providing capacity building services to SMEs.

47.     Partial credit guarantee schemes have the potential to improve access to finance for
SMEs, mitigating the credit risk that could generate the existence of asymmetric
information. Guarantees can enable lenders to learn about the creditworthiness of borrowers
without incurring the initial risk involved. They not only enable SMEs to access formal credit, but
also improve terms and conditions of the loans (longer terms, lower rates, higher loan amounts).
However, credit guarantee schemes need to be well designed to work successfully, so that they do
not increase moral hazard for borrowers and lenders. Governments’ involvement in credit
guarantee schemes can be to both provide funds to private guarantee schemes, or to set up public
credit guarantee schemes. The majority of credit guarantee schemes in developing countries are
public schemes. One of the main questions with regards to the impact of the scheme relates to
additionally, whether they generate additional loans, or loans that would have been issued even in
the absence of the PCG. Box 3 below outlines the features of FOGAPE, a good practice PCG
scheme in Chile.

48
   Its asset base stood at about J$ 23 billion, with a loan portfolio of above J$9 billion. In 2012, it approved more
than 8,000 loans in the amount of J$ 6 billion. Direct lending constituted above 40% (for large strategic sectors), and
about 60% for onlending.
49
   DBJ data, DBJ has lent over $2 billion to MFIs since the Micro Finance Window was established in 2009.

                                                          25
                     Box 3. Public credit guarantee scheme in Chile - FOGAPE
 FOGAPE is a credit guarantee fund managed by a large public bank, BancoEstado, which provides partial credit
 guarantees to financial institutions for investment or working capital loans to MSMEs, as well as partial reinsurance
 to SGRs. Loans guaranteed can be up to US$ 250,000, for a maximum maturity of up to 10 years. The fund does
 not have its own staff, it is managed by five staff of BancoEstado. The fund’s current capital is about US$ 250 Mln.
 Leverage can be up to 11 times the size of the fund, and its current leverage is 8 times. The guaranteed products
 are loans, lines of credit, factoring, leasing, and credit cards. FOGAPE does not target its guarantees to any
 particular sector. It’s supervised by the financial system regulator, and is externally audited.

 Low operating costs - FOGAPE does not evaluate guaranteed loans, but rather sets broad eligibility criteria and
 lets participating financial intermediaries decide which loans to guarantee. This has allowed FOGAPE to maintain
 relatively low administrative costs.

 Influencing incentives for lenders, partial guarantees - FOGAPE has put in place an incentive structure for
 lenders that has reduced some of the problems created by credit guarantee schemes, allowing it to keep a high
 portfolio performance. FOGAPE only provides partial credit guarantees, so that financial institutions bear part of
 the credit risk, discouraging them from selecting only the highest risk borrowers, and maintaining incentives for
 screening and monitoring loans that are covered. In a survey by Beck, Klapper, and Mendoza (2008), 29 out of 39
 public guarantee schemes in the sample guaranteed on average up to 75 percent of the loan amount.

 Auctioning of guarantees based on the coverage rate - FOGAPE allocates guarantees to financial institutions,
 or reinsurance to SGRs, through an auction in which these institutions bid on the total amount to be guaranteed and
 the coverage ratio, fostering competition amongst institutions and driving down the average coverage ratio (by law
 the maximum coverage ratio is 80 percent). Guarantees are allocated to those financial institutions offering the
 lowest coverage ratio until the total amount of guarantees auctioned equals the total amount bid. This bidding
 process encourages banks to take on more risk. SGRs also participate in the auctions for obtaining partial
 reinsurance for the guarantees (currently about 10 SGRs participate in the auctions).

 Adequate fees – In Chile, the fee that financial institutions pay for the guarantees is tied to loan defaults. Fees can
 vary between 1-2% of the guaranteed amount annually. Most schemes in the world charge annual fees of about two
 percent of the guaranteed amount (Green 2003).

 Simple claims procedures – FOGAPE has in place clear rules for paying out guarantees, which are paid out in full
 within 15 days of the claim being made, making the scheme more attractive for financial institutions.

 Increased outreach - FOGAPE has also been successful in scaling up outreach, increasing the number of new
 loans guaranteed per year from 10,147 in 2000 to over 64,000 in 2012 (for micro and small enterprises only). In
 2000-2012, it guaranteed more than 500,000 loans for more than 200,000 firms. In 2010, there was a peak in
 guarantees, since due to the financial crisis it was authorized to accept guarantees for larger size companies.

48. The DBJ has been operating a partial Credit Enhancement Facility (CEF) since 2009,
but it has not been sufficiently utilized by financial institutions. DBJ set aside J$250 million
capital with a 2x maximum leverage to provide partial credit guarantees to AFIs. Since DBJ
provides all the capital, the scheme is consolidated on DBJ balance sheet. The maximum guarantee
is established at J$ 10 million (US$ 100,000) or 50% of the loan. The scheme charges a fee of 2%,
for covering 50% of the loss par i passu after financial institutions have exhausted their recovery
efforts. Currently the scheme only offers one product and applies the same premium to all the
sectors and originators. Since the coverage is par i passu, the conditionality and underwriting
requirements are not very demanding. In 2012, the CEF approved 105 guarantees in the amount
of J$155 million (US$ 1.4 million), supporting J$233 million (US$ 2 million) in loans through 8
AFIs. Since inception, the CEF has facilitated the issuance of J$309 million (US$ 2.8 million) in

                                                           26
loans to 115 SMEs with guarantees totaling J$ 178 million (US$ 1.6 million). To date, there have
been no claims against the CEF. 50


                                  VII.    POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

Legal and regulatory framework

49. The authorities can consider simplifying documentation requirements and modifying
the existing prudential framework for banks to incentivize lending to small businesses. The
requirement to provide audited financial statements for small businesses is costly and time-
consuming. BoJ could enable banks to treat business loans below a certain amount as consumer
loans, for the purposes of information and provisioning requirements, thus, easing documentation
requirements that banks ask from their clients for loans below the determined amount, and the
required risk assessment. In addition, current prudential regulations for banks need to be adapted
to take into account the range of movable assets introduced by the SIPP law.

50. The regulatory environment for microfinance should provide a level playing field
amongst financial institutions providing microfinance, in order to promote competition and
reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage. The proposed Credit Unions regulations to be issued
under the Bank of Jamaica Act, and the Micro-Credit Act are a welcome development. The
authorities should ensure that the regulatory framework for credit unions takes into account their
unique characteristics, in terms of liquidity and reserve requirements, provisioning, etc. Given
BoJ’s role as the supervisor of DTIs, and its new upcoming authority of supervising credit unions,
consideration should be given for BoJ to also undertake non-prudential supervision of credit-only
MFIs. Since these MFIs are non-deposit taking, non-prudential supervision would be appropriate,
in terms of ensuring transparent lending practices, establishing complaint resolution systems, basic
reporting, fit and proper criteria, etc. In addition, given concerns with high microfinance rates, an
interest rate decomposition exercise can be undertaken to determine the primary factors driving
the high interest rates in microfinance in Jamaica.

Expanding alternative and nonbank sources of finance for SMEs

51. In order to encourage the development of non-traditional financial instruments such as
leasing, factoring, and venture capital, the authorities should create an enabling legal and
regulatory environment. Consideration should be given to: (i) develop a factoring law and review
and revise relevant provisions in other legislation; (ii) review of the legislative framework that
may have contradictions that inhibit the development of leasing, and development of a leasing law
to remove ambiguities amongst private sector players; (iii) awareness raising on the benefits of
both factoring and leasing, since there is lack of know-how in the market on movable asset based
lending; and (iv) develop the eco-system for venture capital.

52. The authorities should also consider the development an electronic factoring platform.
Such a platform would link large creditworthy firms with their SME suppliers, allowing them to
use their receivables from these large buyers to obtain working capital finance through factoring
operations. Such a platform would facilitate efficient and low-cost processing of reverse factoring

                                                 27
transactions. As an example, Mexico’s development bank NAFIN created an internet based
infrastructure to facilitate factoring. The program created chains between big buyers and their
suppliers. The buyers that participate in the program, large creditworthy firms, must invite
suppliers (small opaque firms) to join their chain. The program allows small suppliers to use their
receivables from these big buyers to obtain working capital finance through factoring operations
with participating financial institutions. Transactions take place online, significantly reducing
costs. NAFIN was responsible for the development, production, and marketing costs of the
electronic system, and in charge of its operations.

53. In order to encourage the development of micro-insurance, the authorities should draft
a specific regulation for micro-insurance. This regulation should simplify the approval process
for micro-insurance products and enable the environment for market players to develop such
products.

Strengthening the secured transactions, and insolvency framework

54. The regulation for the operation of the movable collateral registry should be revised,
and beyond the regulation, further efforts are needed to maximize the benefits of the new
system. The use of movable assets would require a shift in the lending culture. These include
challenges related to the lack of financial institutions’ capacity to adopt innovating lending
technologies and lack of awareness of the SME sector of the possibility of using nontraditional
types of collateral (such as accounts receivables). Thus, a comprehensive and extensive
communications and outreach campaign would be useful to increase awareness and usage of the
registry, and stakeholder training that includes the dissemination of the new system to government
officials, judges, enforcement officers, lawyers, business community, and financial institutions.
The trainings would cover the following areas: (i) structure and content of the Secured
Transactions law, including, creation of security interests, publicity of security interests and
priority scheme vis-à-vis third party, enforcement of security interests, and other areas; (ii)
organization and use of the electronic registry; (iii) overview of asset based lending practices,
including accounts receivable financing, inventory financing, equipment financing, collateral
management and valuation of collateral, and agribusiness financing taking movable property as
collateral.

55. The authorities should monitor closely ongoing developments in the set-up of the
collateral registry, and evaluate and address any challenges. The registry should enable the
identification of the kind of movable assets being registered, specifying the share of accounts
receivables, equipment, etc. in order to show impact of the reform over time, identification of the
value of the security interest, or the type/size of company. A monitoring and evaluation framework
would be useful to monitor and evaluate the registry’s usage and efficacy.

56. While the new insolvency law has been adopted, implementing regulations would need
to be developed, and trainings for judges and insolvency administrators. There need to be
clear guidelines for the regulation and supervision of insolvency representatives, covering amongst
other things, professional qualification, independence requirement, etc. Significant training is also

Strengthening the credit guarantee scheme, and other programs

57. The design and operational model of the PCG scheme should be reviewed and revamped
to provide adequate incentives for lenders to participate. Experience has shown that with an
adequate financial and operational design and attractive products, PCGs can provide improve
lending to MSMEs, especially in a context characterized by the lack of credit information. The
PCG scheme should be established separate from DBJ to avoid financial consolidation that could
reduce the incentives of its use. The capital structure could be either based on public funds, or with
both public and private funds. A financial model based on expected loss needs to be established
that allows the PCG to be profitable by charging a premium that is adequate for to the risk coverage
provided. The instruments and services it provides to lenders should include different alternatives
based on the sector, percentage to be covered and type of coverage (par i passu, first loss, or second
loss). Premiums could vary according to the characteristics of the instrument and the coverage
provided). Conditionality and underwriting criteria would also depend on the type of coverage,
and this could be used in some cases to homogenize portfolios that could be securitized. In
addition, there needs to be a simple and efficient claims procedure, with clear rules on when and
how to pay out the guarantees, as well as paying claims without a long and costly verification
process.

58. Given the existence of many government-funded programs for MSME finance (through
DBJ, Exim bank, Self-Start Fund, MIDA, and others), consideration should be given to
review and consolidate such programs. Such consolidation would result in improved efficiency
and effectiveness of public finance programs for MSMEs.

Easing other constraining factors for MSME lending

59. In addition, technical assistance to MSMEs is critical to improve their bankability.
Capacity building of SMEs in terms of preparing financial statements and business plans, as well
as improving their financial literacy and management training, would have a positive impact on
SMEs’ bankability. The capacity of institutions that provide business training to SMEs such as
JMDC should be enhanced with greater coordination and simplification among different
institutions. There needs to be collaboration amongst various training agencies and other key
stakeholders (Small Business Association of Jamaica, Jamaica Chamber of Commerce, and others)
to set up a comprehensive platform for providing training and development services for SMEs,
including through community organizations.

60. The authorities should also evaluate measures of formalizing SME activity to improve
their capacity to access credit. MSMEs would likely gain more access to finance if levels of
informality were reduced. While there are many differences amongst countries, there are common
business environment reforms that can have an impact on the formalization of informal firms,
including tax policy and administration, business practices regulations, and labor regulation. In
addition, countries adopt policies that improve enforcement and undertake information campaigns
that help firms understand their obligations and the increased benefits and reduced costs of
becoming formal. An assessment of the causes of informality is first needed prior to designing
reform programs. 51

   See the report by the World Bank “Economic Informality: Causes, Costs, and Policies: A Literature Survey of
International Experience”, 2009. It presents country experiences that deserve further analysis, such as simplified
taxation schemes (Brazil, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Sweden), reducing barriers to entry (Mexico), allowing for more
flexible hiring and firing of workers (Spain), informing firms about the benefits of formalization (Colombia), and
others.

61. In order to inform policy-making, there is also need for continuous and comprehensive
data on SMEs. Data collection on the size of the MSME sector, its composition, contribution to
the economy and employment, would be valuable to adequately inform policy-making. In addition,
a demand survey on business finance would be useful to better understand demand-side
constraints.
