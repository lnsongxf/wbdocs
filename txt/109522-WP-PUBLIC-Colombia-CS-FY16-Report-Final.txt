I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better
understanding of how stakeholders in Colombia perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
    General Issues Facing Colombia
    Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
    World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
    The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
    Working with the World Bank Group
    The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Colombia
    Communication and Information Sharing
    Background Information

II. Methodology
From April 2016 to June 2016, 745 stakeholders of the WBG in Colombia were invited to
provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the Office of the President/Prime Minister; office of a
minister; office of a parliamentarian; ministries/ministerial departments; Project Management
Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of WBG projects; consultants/contractors working on
WBG-supported projects/ programs; local governments; bilateral/multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; non-profit
organizations/community based organizations; the media; independent government institutions;
trade unions; faith-based groups; youth groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; the
judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 186 stakeholders participated in the survey
(25% response rate).

Most respondents received and completed the questionnaire online. A few others received and
filled out the questionnaire via email. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing
Colombia; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s effectiveness and results; the
WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG; the WBG’s future role in
Colombia; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results in this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY’13 (response rate is 41%, N=271). Data were weighted to reach the same
stakeholder composition in two years, which allows for year comparisons. Stakeholder groups
which were not present in both fiscal years were not included in the comparison. Respondents
who belonged to the “other” stakeholder category were not included either. As a result, means of
the FY’16 data and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in appendices A, B, C, and D. For the weighted stakeholder
breakdown and year comparison results, please see appendix E (page 88).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, respondents from the Office of the President/Prime Minister and the
       Office of Minister were combined. Respondents from the financial sector/private banks
       were combined with those from private sector organizations. Respondents from private
       foundations and NGOs/CBOs were combined into the “CSO” category. Few respondents
       from bilateral/multilateral agencies, media, and the judiciary branch were included in the
       “Other” category. There were no respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, trade
       unions, faith-based groups or youth groups.

Familiarity with the World Bank Group

       Respondents’ levels of familiarity with the WBG were significantly, strongly correlated
        with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Colombia, the extent to which
        the WBG plays a relevant role in development in Colombia, and the extent to which the
        WBG helps to achieve development results in the country.

     Year comparison: Stakeholders in both FY’13 and FY’16 have statistically similar

report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.

The Effectiveness of the World Bank Group and Other Development Banks3
(Indicator Question)
          Year comparison: Respondents in the FY’13 and FY’16 Country Surveys gave
           statistically similar ratings for the effectiveness of the WBG and the IDB. This year’s
           respondents gave significantly lower ratings for the effectiveness of the Latin American
           Development Bank than respondents in the FY’13 Country Survey.
          In FY16, stakeholders gave significantly higher ratings for the WBG’s effectiveness than
           the effectiveness of the Latin American Development Bank, and statistically similar
           ratings for the effectiveness of the Inter-American Development Bank.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Colombia, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty three specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Colombia. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at rural development;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at transport; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at information and communications technology.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Colombia, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at social protection;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti corruption; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at agricultural development.

the following TWO best illustrate how this would be achieved in Colombia? (Choose no more than TWO)

Appendix E: Responses to Selected Questions by Year19
*All data presented in this appendix are weighted. As a result, means of the FY 2016 data and the total number
of respondents each year will be slightly different from those in FY 2013 appendices.

FY 2013 Number of comparable respondents = 247  FY 2016 Number of comparable respondents = 184

By weighting, the FY 2013 data has the same stakeholder composition as it is in FY 2016. Therefore, the
two years are comparable. Respondents from the office of a parliamentarian, trade unions, faith-based
groups, and youth groups were not included in the year comparison analysis, because there were no
respondents from the office of a parliamentarian in FY 2016 and no respondents from the youth groups
in FY 2013. There were no respondents from trade unions or faith-based groups in neither years. The
weighted stakeholder breakdown is presented below:
