EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself
    and of his family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care and necessary social
    services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability,
    widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
                                                       —Article 25, Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The aging challenge in Moldova is pressing. The average age is rising at a much more rapid rate
in Moldova than in neighboring countries, and the size of the population is shrinking (figure O.1).
The demographic trends are driven by three factors: low fertility, high net emigration, and low life
expectancy. Moreover, the risks to well-being are many and diverse among the elderly. For instance,
Moldova is one of the few countries in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region where the elderly
are poorer than the average population. In addition, the elderly in rural areas are at particularly high
risk of poverty, and have lower access to basic services.

human rights even more crucial.

The report outlines the international and national legal and regulatory context supporting the rights
and entitlements of the elderly and, while other areas must also be kept in mind for the overall agenda
on human rights in Moldova, it focuses the diagnostic on three that are critical for the economic
security of the elderly: the right to health, the right to work, and the right to social security. Although
the report places the discussion on the overall demographic context of the country, it does not delve
into issues critical to the aging agenda but outside of its scope, such as the growth and productivity
impact of aging.

Healthy aging

Old-age mortality, especially among men, has not improved in the last 25 years. Life expectancy at age
60 in 2015 was 16.4 years, compared with the average of 21.0 in the region. One consequence of the
large gender gap in health is a feminization of aging. In addition, the population is undergoing an
epidemiological transition, whereby chronic disease replaces infectious diseases as a major contributor
to mortality and morbidity, with these chronic diseases on an upward trend. Low awareness of elderly
of their health rights, access and utilization of healthcare in the environment of inefficient service
delivery contribute to deterioration of health outcomes among elderly. Importantly, the current
benefits package and service delivery model do not facilitate timely access to services or financial
protection for health expenditures. Instead, aggregate health financing indicators paint a picture of
inefficient spending, with very high out-of-pocket expenditure linked to formal and informal payments
with most formal spending on medicines and also diagnostic examinations conducted in outpatient
care. Inequities also exists, with the poor themselves, including the elderly poor, spending less on
medications, suggesting inequalities in access.

Productive aging

High and increasing economic inactivity across all age groups is a serious challenge in Moldova,
particularly in a context of aging population and high reliance on pension income. Since 2000, the
retired population has grown, and the share of workers choosing to remain employed after the age of
54 has steadily declined. Recent economic growth has been concentrated in particularly productive
sectors, supporting some workers and leaving others behind; older workers are predominantly
employed in low-productivity agriculture. Promoting employment among older people of today and
those of tomorrow requires addressing the main challenge of the labor market in Moldova: boosting
job creation. However, action is also needed to remove barriers that the elderly face, and encourage
greater participation, formality, and employment quality in coming years.

Secure aging

Most of the elderly population, including almost all the elderly in the bottom welfare quintile, are
covered by the social protection system, and older people highly depend on pensions as an income
source. However, the coverage of social insurance contributions has declined over the years (in line
with declining employment rates) and remains low, and the pension system dependency ratio is rising.
This means that, in the future, the risk of poverty will grow among the elderly as the pension system,
without reform, becomes unsustainable.

Policy implications

Policies are needed to ensure economic security of the elderly in Moldova, and for institutions to adapt
to an aging population.

Promoting healthy aging calls for ensuring affordable and accessible health care to all older people, as
well as the provision of affordable, good-quality medicines to treat non-communicable diseases, and

                                                                                                      7
for prevention from early ages. Moldova’s current reform agenda attempts to address many of these
challenges, and these efforts should be sustained. These include, for instance, revising the benefits
package by increasing the reimbursement rate for antihypertension medications, as well as the existing
pay-for-performance scheme in primary care to provide stronger incentives among primary care
physicians to improve the management of chronic disease.

Policies to promote productive aging, beyond those related to sustaining economic growth and
promoting job creation by firms, include investing in education throughout the life cycle with a
particular focus on lifelong learning to retool the skills of older workers; supporting greater access to
formal child and elder care facilities, with potential positive effects on female labor for participation,
as well as early childhood development; reducing the disincentives in the social protection system to
formal work, including increasing retirement age; and raising awareness about potential age-related
discrimination in the labor market.

Policies to promote secure aging call for reforming social protection systems, particularly the pension
system. Creating a fiscally and socially sustainable pay-as-you-go pillar is critical, as well as carefully
choosing the right set of policies for those not in the contributory pension system. On the latter, the
various options need to be carefully considered for their trade-offs and fiscal implications. In addition,
it is important to address the bottlenecks in the efficient delivery of social care services; foster greater
legal and financial autonomy among service providers; and create an adequate financing mechanism
to ensure that local governments have resources to deliver social care services.

Finally, there is a need to improve the monitoring of trends around the right to economic security of
the elderly, as well as the implementation of the relevant legal and regulatory framework This includes
enhancing data collection on the population by gender, age and other categories of vulnerable groups,
and on social services to provide a more accurate picture of needs and challenges; monitoring and
reporting on the implementation of laws that affect older people; and, raising awareness by conducting
information campaigns among the public on the entitlements and rights of the elderly.

1. INTRODUCTION
Moldova is aging rapidly. Driven by low and decreasing fertility and high net emigration, the
population of Moldova is expected to shrink, while the share of older people (population aged 65+)
expands. By 2060, the population is projected to drop by 29 percent, or 1.2 million people, and the
share of older people will triple to 30 percent. Although the old-age mortality rate is high,
improvements in longevity will accelerate the population aging process. The concern is that the
demographic dividend will be over before Moldova has reaped the benefits. The small increase in the
birthrate during the 1980s together with the decline in fertility during the last decades, led to a decline
in the child dependency ratio and a growing share of the working-age population during the 2000s.
Nonetheless, this demographic dividend has not been fully exploited because of the large emigration
of young people who work abroad in unskilled jobs that underutilize their education. Furthermore,
the inactivity rate in Moldova is the highest in the region, especially among older people. The share of
the working-age population peaked in 2014, and the opportunities represented by the first
demographic dividend are disappearing in Moldova. This raises serious questions about the ability of
the society and the economy to support a growing elderly population.

The demographic dynamics may have important implications for the well-being of the old.
An aging society with a declining working-age population may have lower productive capacity and
slower economic growth, which have negative impacts on the resources available for the old. A rising
share of older people may put higher pressure on the government and society to provide pensions,
health care, and social services required by the older people. There will also be fundamental shifts
within households because there are fewer adult children to take care of aging parents. Thus, the
changing demographics result in many shifts in the economy and society that affect the growing elderly
population.
Older people face numerous risks that reinforce each other and may drive these people into a
situation of insecurity (Table 2.1). Because health deteriorates with age, older people often have
health problems, which may be an obstacle to their full participation in social and economic activities.
Consequently, they may lack sufficient resources to meet their growing health needs or to maintain an
adequate standard of living. In addition, their withdrawal from social activities may lead to feelings of
isolation, uselessness, and depression, which may worsen their health conditions. Their dependence
on the financial or social support of others could also disempower them, preventing them from
influencing decisions that affect their welfare. The perception that the elderly are dependent and a
drain on family and social resources may also lead to others to ignore the needs of the elderly, who
may therefore be left behind in the process of modernization. These risks can be exacerbated by the
institutional environment. For example, the effectiveness of health service delivery (or lack thereof)
directly influences old-age mortality and the ability to age in good health. Similarly, adult education
and incentives against early retirement allow the old to work longer and thereby secure greater
economic well-being.

The aging challenge is pressing in Moldova even relative to other aging countries in Europe
and Central Asia (map 1.1). Together with Bulgaria, Moldova has the highest rate of population
shrinkage in Europe and Central Asia. The Europe and Central Asia regional aging report identifies
Moldova as the country with the most severe aging-related policy challenges, linked specifically to
migration, fertility, life expectancy, dependency ratios, and old-age poverty.1 This highlights the need
to guarantee the social and economic security of the elderly, a segment of the population that will
grow in coming decades.
In Moldova, much policy attention is already focused on older people. The government,
supported by local and international stakeholders, is undertaking efforts to respond to the aging
challenges, including by committing to the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging in 2002.2 In
line with this commitment, it has been working to implement the regional implementation strategy
2012–17 on this plan of action through a road map on aging and an action plan adopted in June 2014
for 2014–16.
However, concerns are growing that, for example, while the current cohort of the elderly is well
covered by the social protection system, there is a large risk that future cohorts will experience rising
levels of old-age poverty given the current mixture of social protection programs. In addition, the
share of the working-age population that is employed is small in Moldova compared with other
countries in the region, raising the issue of the protection of current and future generations in old age.
The objective of this report is to explore the situation of Moldova’s older population in relation
to the rights of this population to social and economic security and to create knowledge that
can inform policy options to guarantee an adequate standard of living for the current and
future cohorts of older people. No overall systematic diagnostic has looked at issues of economic
security in Moldova in the context of an aging population. Specifically, the report focuses on aging
people, particularly on three aspects of older people’s social and economic security—health, labor
market engagement, and access to social protection—and calls for healthy, productive, and secure

2For example, the Regional Office of the United Nations Population Fund established an International Advisory Panel on Population

on, but does not zoom in on the economy-wide impact of an aging society on economic growth,
productivity, or fiscal issues. It applies a human rights–based approach by focusing on a population
group that is facing critical and growing challenges to the maintenance of an adequate living standard
and by providing strong evidence-based analysis to raise the ability and accountability of individuals
and institutions responsible for respecting, protecting, and fulfilling the rights of the older population.

The report extends regional analyses to drill down into the underlying factors and constraints that
jeopardize the economic security of the elderly today and in coming decades and to inform the
tailoring of policy options to help the government fulfill its obligations toward older people as equal
rights-holders.3 The release of the 2014 census data will provide crucial and more up-to-date
information on demographics, labor markets, migration, and more, allowing adjustments to this and
other, similar analyses as needed.

The report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 explores demographic patterns in Moldova,
highlighting concerns about the ability of society and the economy to support a growing elderly
population. Chapter 3 outlines priority issues for the economic security of older people from the
perspective of human rights. It presents the international framework for selected older people’s human
rights related to economic security—the right to health, the right to social security, and the right to
work—and Moldova’s positioning within this framework. Chapter 4 presents basic trends in health
outcomes in Moldova over the last two decades, focusing on life expectancy, the burden of disease,
and risk factors. It also describes challenges in the current health system and empirically examines
access to services, the quality of care, and drug adherence across the life cycle. Chapter 5 explores
recent trends among the working-age population with a focus on older cohorts, highlighting both
worrying and encouraging developments in the labor market. Chapter 6 examines the type, size, and
performance of social protection, cash benefits, and in-kind services in relation to older people who
may seek to claim their social and economic rights. Chapter 7 concludes and provides policy
recommendations aimed at promoting healthy, productive, and secure aging from a human rights
approach. The report uses the terms older people and the elderly interchangeably, with slightly
different age thresholds across the report depending on what is relevant to the topic, given the
generally accepted cutoffs in each area. The messages, however, remain consistent regardless of the
age threshold.

2. DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERNS AND WELL-BEING OF THE
ELDERLY
Moldova is aging rapidly, driven by low and decreasing fertility and high net emigration. The population is expected to
shrink, and the share of old people is expected to increase. This chapter explores these demographic patterns, highlighting
concerns on the ability of society and the economy to support a growing elderly population. It provides the first insights,
explored in the remaining chapters, into the current state of economic security among the elderly by describing the country’s
age-related poverty profile.

Demographic patterns
Rapid aging
Moldova has been aging rapidly, although the phenomenon started among the youngest in
the region in the early 1990s. In 1990, the average age was 32 years old, compared with the average
in Eastern Europe and Central Asia of 34 years. Since then, the average in Moldova has risen by 6
years, higher than the growth rate in neighboring countries such as Belarus and Ukraine. The average
age in Moldova will catch up with the rest of the region within the next decade, making the country
as old as Belarus and the Russian Federation (Figure 2.1). The demographic trends in Moldova have
been the result of three factors: (1) low and declining fertility, (2) high net emigration, and (3) low life
expectancy.

Note: The population forecast beyond 2015 is based on the medium fertility, normal mortality, and normal migration scenario. This
scenario assumes that fertility rates follow a trend from high to low then fluctuate around the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman).
The scenario also assumes that life expectancy at birth and migration follow the historical trends of each country and similar countries
in the region. In the case of Moldova, the population estimates are taken from the 2012 Revision of the population prospects, which
does not include the region of Transnistria. Regional averages are simple averages. The median age rises more quickly in Moldova, from

27.5 to 47.5 years in 1990–2060 (by 20 years in total), compared with the regional average median age of 31.4 years in 1990 to 45.8 years
in 2060, an increase of 14.3 years.


Moldova has one of the lowest total fertility rates in the region. In 1990, its fertility rate was at
the replacement level, but, by 2015, the rate had dropped to 1.46 children per woman of childbearing
age (Figure 2.2). However, the rates are likely underestimated because the estimates include migrants
who were absent from the country for more than a year. The adjusted indicator shows that the total
fertility rate in 2015 was 1.6 children per woman of childbearing age.4 The decline in fertility in
Moldova follows the trend in Central and Eastern European countries that have undergone structural
political and economic changes in recent decades and reflects the second demographic transition in
the country.5

Notes: The total fertility rate is the average number of births per woman of childbearing age (15–49). For Moldova, the fertility estimates
are derived from the 2012 Revision, which does not include the region of Transnistria.


In line with this, the number of births has declined in Moldova. A notable decrease in the number
of births occurred in 1942–45. Two echoes of this reduction followed during the 1960s and later in
the late 1980s. The number of births increased briefly in the mid-1980s as a result of family policies
promoted during this period, but immediately declined after 1990.6 Moderate growth was registered
during the early 2000s, but this recovery was dampened by the 2008–09 economic crisis, especially
among the younger population.7 Furthermore, according to data of the 2005 Demographic and Health

Survey, modern contraceptive uptake is relatively high in Moldova (64 percent). The recovery of wages
and the increase in educational attainment among women may have also raised the opportunity costs
of children, leading women with higher educational attainment to have fewer children.8

Moldova is a country of emigrants. Without migration, the net population growth would have been
1 percent between 1990 and 2015. The net cumulative emigration rate of 22 percent led to a population
decrease of 21 percent during the period (Figure 2.3). Most of the emigration occurred during the
1990s. In the early 1990s, emigration was influenced by the dissolution of the Soviet Union: many
residents moved back to their countries of birth, such as Russia and Ukraine. In the second half of
the 1990s, emigration was a result of a large outflow for permanent resettlement to Israel, Germany,
and the United States. Emigration to Russia for permanent residence intensified in the 2000s as a
result of several laws and programs that facilitated Russian citizenship among former Soviet citizens.
There was also a constant flow of emigrants to Russia and Europe for work, mostly among people of
working age.9 The flow of migrants between 2007 and 2014 varied between 45,000 and 55,000 a year.10

Note: Net migrants represent the number of immigrants, minus the number of emigrants. In Moldova, the estimates are based on the
2012 Revision, which does not include the region of Transnistria.

High net emigration, especially among young people, accelerated the population aging
process. The recent trend in migration for work means that a large share of the economically active
are leaving the country. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the share of the adult
population (15+) working or looking for work abroad increased from 4.3 percent in 2000 to 10.0
percent in 2014. Among these, 99.9 percent were below 65 years of age. This means that, even though
the size of the adult population (15+) has stabilized in recent years, the economically active population
decreased as a growing share of the working-age population moved abroad. Indeed, the share of the

economically active adult population (ages 15+) working or looking for work abroad rose from 8.4
percent in 2000 to 27.7 percent in 2014 (Figure 2.4). Even if this trend were to slow under a scenario
of zero migration, the working-age population would continue to decline by 7.6 percent in the next
decade.

In addition to external migration, internal migration resulted in a ruralization of aging.
Moldovans working abroad mostly come from rural areas (71.7 percent in 2014). Combined with the
trend toward rural-to-urban migration within Moldova, this has meant that the urban population has
become younger than the rural population. Although the share of the elderly is not greater than the
share of the nonelderly in rural areas, the NBS data show that a higher share of the elderly reside in
small towns (24.1 percent) than in big cities (19.5 percent), while the reverse is true among the
nonelderly. The aging in rural areas may have already been offset by the higher fertility rate and the
number of children in rural areas. Similar to other Eastern European and Central Asian countries, the
total fertility rate in rural Moldova is higher (1.8 compared with 1.5 in urban areas) (Figure 2.5

Figure 2.5). This, however, also means that rural areas face a higher dependency ratio.

An aging population without aging people
Although the population has been aging, people are not living longer. The aging of a population
is related to the increase in the share of older persons in the population and the increase in longevity.
In Moldova as in other countries in the region, the first driver dominates, that is, aging is driven more
by fertility decline than by longevity improvement. Indeed, Moldova is the worst performer in the
region in longevity (Figure 2.6). (This worrying health outcome is described in detail in chapter 4.)

As a result of low longevity, especially among men, Moldova does not have a high share of
elderly people despite the country’s high average age. The elderly (ages 65+) accounted for only
11.7 percent of the population in 2015, and only 2.3 percent of the population were living past age 80.
This is a small increase from the 8.3 percent in 1990, a much slower increase than the regional average,
from 10.5 percent to 15.0 percent during the period (Figure 2.7). This means the old-age dependency
ratio is low, at 16.4 percent compared with 22.7 percent in the region, but it is expected to rise rapidly.

The future: a smaller and older population
The population has been shrinking since the independence of the country in 1991. From 1990
to 2015, the population shrank by 21 percent (Figure 2.8). This is similar to the rate in Bulgaria,
Romania, and other Central and Western European countries, higher than other neighboring
countries, and much higher than the rest of the region, where populations actually grew. Three
concurrent trends have contributed to this population shrinkage: sharply declining fertility rates, slow
progress in life expectancy, and the emigration of the younger population. If these trends continue,
the population should shrink much more quickly, to 52 percent of the 1990 population by 2060.

Note: The population forecast beyond 2015 is based on the medium fertility, normal mortality, and normal migration scenario. This
scenario assumes fertility rates follow a trend from high to low then fluctuate around the replacement rate (2.1 children per woman),
while life expectancy at birth and migration follow the historical trends of each country and similar countries in the region. In Moldova,
the estimates are taken from the 2012 Revision, which does not include the region of Transnistria. Regional averages are simple averages.


Even if fertility were to rebound, it would take a long time for Moldova to reverse the shrinking
population trend. The fertility rate is projected to rebound if Moldova follows the historical trends
of other countries that are more advanced along the demographic transition. However, even if the
fertility rate were to rebound to the projected rate of 1.74 in 2060, it would still be below the
replacement rate, leading to a reduction in the population by 34.1 percent, or 1.2 million people. Based
on the projections of the United Nations (UN), the fertility rate would take longer than 50 years to
return to the replacement level.

Longevity is stagnating, but is expected to improve eventually, which may slow the reduction
in population, but will also increase the share of the elderly. Because of improvements in
technology and health behavior, life expectancy is projected to rise slightly, although at a higher rate
among women than men (3.6 years and 2.2 years, respectively, by 2060). Nonetheless, given the low
fertility rate, the UN projects that the share of the elderly will more than double by 2060, to 26.9
percent. The elderly cohorts may expand further if a large share of migrants return at old age.

Moldovan society would, as a result, become smaller and older. If the trend continues, the
average age of the population will reach 47.4 years by 2060, surpassing the regional average and even
the average in the closest European neighbors, such as Bulgaria and Romania. The share of children
would shrink from 21.7 percent to 17.6 percent, and, because of their longer longevity, women in their
60s and 70s would account for a relatively large part of the population (Figure 2.9). This demographic
trend, however, is not inevitable. The experience in more well developed countries in Europe shows
that economic growth, improvements in labor market policies, especially in favor of women, and
progress in health behavior and preventive care can help reverse this trend and accelerate the
improvement in longevity, thus shifting the demographic change toward a more sustainable path.

Because of the low fertility rate and the population share of the elderly, Moldova should be
enjoying a demographic dividend.11 The small share of the elderly, combined with the decline in
fertility in recent decades, led to an expanding share of the working-age population in the 2000s.12 The
Global Monitoring Report 2015/2016 classifies Moldova as a late-dividend country, meaning that the
share of the working-age population is still large because of the replacement-level fertility rate during
the 1980s.13 If there are fewer people to support (that is, a lower dependency ratio), a country has an
opportunity for rapid economic growth because more resources are freed up for investment. The
opportunity to reap the benefits of the demographic dividend will eventually end as low fertility
reduces the growth rate of the labor force, while continuing improvements in health result in longer
life expectancy and corresponding growth among the elderly population.14


11 The demographic dividend is “the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population’s age structure, mainl y when
the share of the working-age population (15 to 64) is larger than the non–working-age share of the population” (UNFPA 2014, 12).

The potential benefits from the demographic dividend in Moldova, however, have not been
fully reaped because of the substantial emigration of working-age people. This missed
opportunity of enjoying a significant demographic dividend was due to the fact that Moldova entered
the millennium not with a booming labor force and employment, but with booming migration and
remittances. In sum, Moldova traded a demographic dividend for migrant remittances as the
workforce emigrated.15 The window of opportunity to exploit the demographic dividend is not yet
closed, but soon will be. First, the share of the working-age population already peaked at 74.3 percent
in 2015 and will continue to fall, partly because of reduced fertility and partly because of large
emigration. Although emigration can lead to higher remittances, which boost the growth in
consumption and gross domestic product (GDP), while providing informal support to the dependent
population in the home country, it does not necessarily contribute to improving productivity and
supporting the pension system. This can lead to an imbalance in the pension system in the long run
(see chapter 6).

Second, in the near future, another stage will start: depopulation without a demographic dividend. The
working-age population will decline at the projected rate of 0.8 percent annually in the next two
decades. The child and old-age dependency ratios are currently below the regional average. By 2060,
it is projected that, while the child dependency ratio will be at a similar level, the old-age dependency
ratio will have tripled to 45.7 percent, higher than the Eastern European average (Figure 2.10).

The dependency ratio is even worse if the high economic inactivity rate is taken into account.
The calculation of the dependency ratio relies on the assumption that the population ages 65 and older
are dependent. It also relies on the assumption that the majority of the population ages 15–64 are
economically active. In the context of the current labor force, such assumptions may underestimate
the dependency ratio, given the high inactivity rate in the labor force, the low retirement age, and the
prevalence of early retirement (Chapter 5 discusses the labor situation in Moldova in further detail.)

Indeed, with the lowest labor force participation rate among adults (15+), at 40 percent in 2012,
Moldova has the highest dependency ratio in the region as measured by the ratio of inactive to active
adults (Figure 2.11). Furthermore, a significant share of the labor force works abroad in unskilled jobs
that underutilize their education. The low health status and the high disability rate among the elderly
(see chapter 4) are additional factors that undermine the ability to utilize the growing share of the
elderly in the population.

The well-being of older people
The level of well-being of the elderly is relatively low in Moldova compared with other
countries in Europe and Central Asia. According to the Global AgeWatch index 2015, which
captures the economic security, health status, education, employment, and socioeconomic conditions
of people ages 60 and over around the world, Moldova has one of the lowest scores, ranking it at 77th
out of 96 countries by level of quality of life of the elderly (Figure 2.12). The index value is based on
the country’s assessment in four thematic domains and 13 indicators.
In 2015, the average score across welfare indicators in Moldova was only 35 out of 100; slightly above
Greece and behind the rest of the region, including neighboring Belarus, Romania, Russia, and
Ukraine. Even though there was a small improvement in the overall score since 2013, the progress
was slower than in other countries, leading to a drop by three positions in the global ranking. Moldova
is ranked particularly low in health (90). Approximately 71 percent of the elderly suffer from chronic
diseases, particularly cardiovascular or osteoarticular infections and digestive problems (see chapter
4). The country is second lowest in income security (63).

The elderly in Moldova are less active in economic and social life than their peers in Europe.
Moldova ranks low according to the active aging index, which assesses people ages 55 years and older
according to their participation in the labor market (employment rate), in social life (voluntary and
political activities and caring responsibilities) and their ability to lead an independent life (sufficiency
in terms of materials, lifelong learning, and health services) and an active life (well-being, educational
attainment, information and communication technology, and social connections).16 According to the
index, Moldova has one of the lowest employment rates among the population of preretirement age
(49.0 and 27.6 percent among the 55–59 and 60–64 age-groups, respectively), relative to the European
Union (EU) average of 62.2 and 31.5 percent, respectively. Less than 5 percent participate in voluntary
activities, and less than 2 percent show any political participation. Every second elderly person is
deprived of an independent, healthy, and secure livelihood, compared with one in three in the EU.
The enabling environment for active aging is limited in Moldova because of low life expectancy and
social connections (32.2 percent), as well as a lack of skill in using information and communication
technology (2.9 percent). Moldova, however, is comparable with EU countries in terms of care
responsibilities among the elderly for grandchildren, educational attainment, and mental well-being.17
Beyond these indicators, the well-being of a share of the elderly is undermined by
psychological abuse and physical violence. A survey of more than 1,000 people ages 60 or above
revealed that 29 percent had experienced acts of violence and abuse, and two-thirds of these people
were women.18 The most common form of abuse was emotional, involving humiliation, intimidation,
insult, and isolation. In addition, about 11 percent of those surveyed became victims of economic
abuse. The most vulnerable are elderly women and elderly with low education attainment or who are
living in rural areas, which is probably linked to issues of economic security.

Old-age poverty
Poverty has been declining more rapidly among the elderly than among the rest of the
population. The poverty rate among the elderly declined rapidly, from 35.0 percent in 2007 to 13.8
percent in 2014, a much more rapid rate than the rate among the rest of the population, bringing the
elderly poverty rate closer to the rate among the rest of the population (Figure 2.13). As discussed in
Chapter 6, this is largely driven by pension increases that favored especially pensioners in urban areas
and nonagricultural sectors. Similarly, households with elderly members or elderly-only households
tend to be poorer than households without elderly, but poverty reduction among this group has also
been more rapid. This may arise because of the financial crisis in 2008–09, the drought in 2012, and
the economic slowdown in 2014, which affected the working-age population more negatively. Indeed,
the most vulnerable group is multigenerational households with both children and elderly: the poverty
rate among these households is highly sensitive to crisis.

However, Moldova is one of the few countries in the region where the elderly are poorer than
the average population. The national poverty rate among the elderly (ages 65 and above) is 13.8
percent, slightly higher than the national average of 11.4 percent. Until 2013, the poverty rate among
the elderly (at the regional World Bank poverty line of $5.00 a day at 2005 purchasing power parity)
was higher than the national average (Figure 2.14), although the rapid improvement among the elderly
had made the poverty rate more comparable with the rest of the population by 2014 (around 40
percent). Nonetheless, the average disposable income of the elderly was 92.7 percent of the average
income of the population. There are several reasons for the relatively higher poverty rate among the
elderly, including their co-residence with others, the poor coverage and inadequacy of pensions, the
lack of opportunities to work into old age, and the costs for utilities and healthcare services.

The elderly in rural areas are at particularly high risk of poverty. According to the Household
Budget Survey, around 56 percent of the elderly were living in rural areas in 2014, a relatively high
share compared with other countries in the region (Figure 2.15). This share has been declining since
2007, when 65 percent of the elderly were living in rural areas. Poverty among the rural elderly has
also been decreasing, although still trailing the rate among the urban elderly. The poverty rate among
the rural elderly was 18.7 percent in 2014, 2.5 times higher than the corresponding urban rate. This
urban-rural disparity is not unique to the elderly, but the elderly are consistently poorer than the
nonelderly in all areas. The disposable income of the elderly in rural areas is 78 percent of that of the
elderly in urban areas and has narrowed less because the elderly in rural areas are more dependent on
agricultural income, which fell, and benefit less from pensions. Furthermore, the labor engagement is
lower among the rural elderly than among their urban peers. According to the NBS, only around 25
percent of the pensioners in the north and south are employed, compared with 47.3 percent in
Chisinau, which explains the much lower labor income of the rural elderly (Figure 2.16).

The feminization of aging in Moldova—given the greater longevity of women—means that
elderly women are often more vulnerable. The poverty rate among elderly women was 14.7 percent
in 2014, compared with 12.3 percent among elderly men. Elderly women are more likely to be widows,
outliving their partners: 62.4 percent of elderly women are widows, while only 25 percent of elderly
men are widowers. The limited participation of elderly women in the labor force means they receive
lower pensions, though some may still benefit from survivor pensions. According to the NBS, 72
percent of pensions go to men. The average pension received by women in 2014 was 76 percent of
the average among men, which may reflect the gender wage gap of 26 percent in Moldova that arises
because of the segregation between men and women in sectors of employment and positions.19 Elderly
women are also more likely to be subjected to domestic abuse and feel less safe in the neighborhood
where they live (only 33.3 percent, compared with 58.6 percent among men).20
The elderly are increasingly lacking resources to spend on their needs. Already at low earning
capacity, the elderly also face pressure on the expenditure side. The consumption expenditures of
households with elderly members is greater than the disposable incomes of these households, which
suggests dissaving and confirms the chronic lack of financial resources of the elderly (Figure 2.17,
panel b). The increase in the cost of housing maintenance, utilities, and basic food products are
contributing to the rise in the poverty incidence among the elderly. More than 50 percent of the
expenditures of the elderly goes for food, slightly more than the corresponding share of expenditures
among the nonelderly. The next highest spending items among the elderly are utilities and medical
and health services, most of which are essential items that may be difficult to adjust (Figure 2.17, panel
a). Indeed, the share allocated to utilities has increased since 2007. The elderly are forced to spend
considerable financial resources for healthcare services, 9.3 percent of their expenditures, and 1.5 times
more than the corresponding expenditures among the nonelderly. Around 86 percent of these
expenditures go for medications.21 About 38.0 percent of the elderly still said they had difficulty paying

the nonelderly, but do indicate the resource constraints faced by the elderly.

Material deprivation
The elderly suffer from material deprivation. Even though, similar to the general population,
almost all elderly own their dwellings, many lack household utilities and access to basic services that
are critical for well-being, including good health. Only 31 percent of the elderly have autonomous or
central heating or hot water, compared with 37 percent and 48 percent among the nonelderly,
respectively. Only 32 percent of the homes of the elderly are equipped with toilets and sewerage.
Although the majority (64 percent) have piped water, the share is still lower than the national average.
These conditions, however, have improved since 2007 (Figure 2.18, panel a). Similarly, the elderly have
less access to home appliances and cultural and transport items (Figure 2.18, panel b), and their
household appliances are older and have been in use for more than 16 years, while the share of new
appliances with high-quality features and energy efficiency is significantly lower than the national
average.

Nonetheless, because of the country’s legacy, the share of the elderly who own their homes
and land is high. Home ownership is high in Moldova, particularly in rural areas. Thus, 99 percent
of households with elderly members have single-family homes, according to the Household Budget
Survey. Their per capita living area is 60 percent greater than the average living area among the
nonelderly. In addition, a high share of the elderly own land. Yet, most of them seem to use the land
for subsistence farming.22 Short on labor, elderly households face difficulties generating higher outputs
from their land to obtain additional income.
As with consumption-based poverty measures, material deprivation is worse among the rural
elderly. The urban-rural gap is also reflected in access to utilities and ownership of assets (Figure
2.19). About 96 percent of the rural elderly heat their homes with wood stoves; 92 percent do not
have a toilet inside the home; 86 percent do not have a bath or shower; 73.3 percent do not have a
sewerage system; 55 percent do not have access to a water supply system; 17.3 percent do not have
access to phone services; and 11 percent do not have satellite dishes.

Subjective well-being
Beyond these objective measures, the elderly have low levels of subjective well-being.
According to the Global AgeWatch index 2015, the share of people ages 50 or above who feel their
life has meaning is 26 percent smaller than the corresponding share of people ages 35–49.23
Approximately 22.0 percent of older people perceive their standard of living as “bad or very bad” (1.3
times more than the national average), and only 5 percent view it as “well and good” (2.1 times less
than the national average). Every fourth respondent believes that his life has worsened in terms of
living standards from year to year.24 The Household Budget Survey shows that a higher share of the
elderly feel bad about the quality of their lives and believe that their living conditions grow worse from
year to year (Figure 2.20).

Migration and the well-being of older people
Emigration, which has driven the aging of the population, has changed social structures and
the dynamics of families. The emigration of younger household members means the older
generation has been left behind, especially in rural areas. The share of the elderly in households rose
from 13.9 percent to 15.9 percent between 2007 and 2014. Because of their longer life expectancy,
women tend to head old-aged households. The share of woman-headed households rose gradually
over the period, from 37 percent to 39 percent (see annex A). This is in line with the gradual increase
in the average age of household heads, from 55 years in 2007 to 57 years in 2013. These shifts in
household composition affected the living conditions of the elderly in many ways. While the elderly
may benefit from remittances, remittances may serve as a disincentive to work, and the emigration of
young adults can generate burdens among the elderly through an increase in household duties and
caregiving responsibilities.
A few elderly receive remittances, and this intergenerational support is an important source
of welfare improvement. Only 13.4 percent of the elderly live in households that received
remittances in 2014, compared with 27.6 percent among the nonelderly, but this is a small increase
from the 12.0 percent in 2007. These latter elderly tend to be more well off, and experience lower
poverty rates and higher income and consumption levels (Figure 2.21, panel a). It also appears that
international migration has a positive effect on the health of the elderly health because it allows them
to eat a more diverse diet and spend more time on leisure activities and sleep instead of working in
subsistence farming.25 Furthermore, the elderly living in migrant households do not seem to suffer
from many of the problems that are associated with caregiver absence and are not necessarily less well
off in terms of physical health, or material, social, and emotional well-being.26 Thus, remittances are
significant enough (46 percent of income) to compensate for the lower level of other income sources:
the average pensions of the elderly who received remittances are around 85 percent of the
corresponding pensions of the elderly who were not receiving remittances.

The elderly living in multigenerational households where the adult children have migrated
are subject to different socioeconomic conditions. Although not particular to the elderly, many
of people receiving remittances are not willing to accept low-paying jobs in Moldova as long as they
receive remittances from abroad regularly.27 Migrant households tend to have a division of labor
whereby the members who remain engage in childcare, subsistence farming, or other household
duties.28 The elderly in remittance households often therefore live with more children and have a
greater average care burden in caring for their grandchildren. A research study by the United Nations
Children’s Fund has highlighted the extremely important role of older people in childcare and
education when other household members migrate for work abroad. If both parents migrate abroad,
older people become the main caregivers in 91 percent of cases, and, if one parent is abroad, 36 percent
of the children are cared for by older people, even if one parent remains in the home country. Older
people also replace the parents as legal representatives of children; they assume responsibility for
guardianship or tutorship in 34.7 percent of the multigenerational households affected by migration.29
Even though they are not necessarily less well off, the caregiving responsibility may limit the potential
of older workers in the labor market. Of greater concern are the elderly living in migrant households
that do not receive remittances. Lacking both the material and informal support of their adult children,
they have limited access to social and cultural activities.30 Conversely, a lack of formal elderly care
opportunities may prevent some adults from migrating because they have to stay with the elderly
parent to provide care.31
Emigration may have also led to the growing prevalence of the elderly living on their own,
although they do not necessarily benefit from remittances. In 2014, 69.1 percent of the elderly
were living alone or with other elderly, an increase from 63.7 percent in 2007. This share is fairly high
compared with other countries in the region, even higher than the shares in Belarus and Ukraine
(Figure 2.22). These elderly received fewer remittances relative to the elderly living in multigenerational
households; they were thus more dependent on pension income. These elderly are not necessarily the
most vulnerable to poverty, but they are slightly less well off than average: the average monthly
equivalized income of the elderly living alone is $195.5 (2005 purchasing power parity), compared with
$213.90 among the elderly living with nonelderly, a statistically significant difference (Figure 2.21,
panel b). In addition to economic insecurity, the elderly living alone are also deprived of family and
social interactions that might otherwise provide them with emotional and psychological support.
There is qualitative evidence that the elderly who are living alone feel isolated, abandoned, and
insecure. Many are institutionalized as a result of children’s migration.32

In sum, Moldova faces the most severe aging challenges in the region. The average age of the
population is increasing at a much more rapid rate in Moldova than in neighboring countries, and the
population is shrinking because of low fertility, substantial emigration, and low life expectancy. As a
result, the old-age dependency ratio is projected to triple in the next 45 years. In addition, the current
cohort of older people in Moldova experience a lower quality of life than the rest of the population,
with higher average poverty rates, less access to services, and worse perceptions about their own well-
being. The elderly are highly dependent on pensions, particularly the elderly living alone. This
highlights the need to ensure a sustainable and adequate pension system.

3. A HUMANS RIGHTS PERSPECTIVE
Human rights are a “common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations.”33 They are universal, so they
apply to everyone; they are inalienable, so they cannot be taken away; they are interrelated and interdependent, so the
realization of one right depends on the realization of others; and they are indivisible. For example, the realization of the
right to health can lead to improved health, which can enhance labor force participation and economic productivity. This
can support the realization of the right to an adequate standard of living, more well protected from poor health and
poverty. This chapter outlines some of the priority issues for the economic security of older people from the perspective of
human rights. Given the scope of this report, it presents the international framework for selected older people’s human
rights related to economic security—the right to health, the right to social security, and the right to work—and Moldova’s
positioning within that framework.

Human rights apply to everyone equally, and, given the poorer living conditions of older
people and as the proportion of this age-group increases both relative to the rest of the
population and in absolute numbers, demography makes the task of recognizing older
people’s human rights more crucial. The prohibition of discrimination is a cornerstone of equal
human rights. Increasingly large swathes of a population can experience the discrimination,
marginalization, and disempowerment of ageism and old-age discrimination if it is left unchecked.
Older people may be discriminated against for reasons associated with old age, regardless of whether
they have attained a certain chronological age, such as the age of retirement.34

Historically, the human rights of older people have been obscured by a well-intentioned
emphasis on the social aspects of the protection and care of older people. Many position papers,
reports, and policy statements have poured effort into noting that population aging is occurring and
that policies reflecting this are not in place. These reports are often alarming and fatalistic, describing
an aging tsunami or foretelling the collapse of a system of social security. They accept an untested
premise that increasing numbers of people living into older age are a menace to society, rather than a
sign of a successful society. Instead, a 2010 report states that “governments must challenge the myth
that social pensions are a burden to the economy and the stereotyping of older persons as a burden
to development.”35

This chapter is centered on what needs to change for governments to fulfill their obligations
to treat older people as equal rights-holders. Specifically, it outlines two main elements of the
human rights landscape for older people in Moldova: the international framework for older people’s
human rights related to economic security and Moldova’s positioning within that framework. It
explores these elements through the lens of three rights that older people have said are their priorities:
the right to health, the right to social security, and the right to work. 36 These rights are particularly

on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural


                                                                                                                                  34
critical to the economic security of Moldova’s current and future elderly population, particularly given
the demographic patterns of the country (see chapter 2), and are interrelated and interdependent.
Other rights, though not discussed in this chapter, but are critical, such as the rights to education,
culture, and reproductive health. In its analysis, the chapter also touches on the cross-cutting issues of
the right to be free from discrimination, the rights of other relevant and intersecting groups, and older
women’s rights, given the gendered aspects of growing old.

Overview of the international framework on age-related rights
The international framework on human rights prohibits discrimination, but it rarely refers
specifically to older people. Discrimination is prohibited in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Article 7; Article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR); the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, articles 5 and 12; the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 26; and Article 2 of the Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women specifically prohibits discrimination
against women. The prohibitions these instruments articulate are not meant to be exhaustive;
“therefore, even if age is not mentioned specifically as a prohibitive ground for discrimination, it
should still be accepted under ‘other status’.”37 International human rights law lacks clarity on how
this prohibition applies to the specific position of older men and women.38

Beyond this framework, which applies to older people as well as everyone in society, the next
subsections refer to additional resources that refer to the right to health, employment, and social
security among older people. It also briefly links these rights to other development efforts, such as the
Sustainable Development Goals.

The right to health
Health and an adequate standard of living are connected. Article 11 of the ICESCR recognizes
“the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate
food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions.” Article 12
enshrines “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and
mental health.” This relationship works both ways: many older people “may fall into a vicious cycle
where poor health engenders poverty and poverty engenders poor health.”39 To realize the right to
health, governments need to take steps to prevent, treat, and control disease and assure medical service
and medical attention for all in the event of sickness.40

As part of the right to health, discrimination against older people within a health care system
must be prohibited. Older people’s equal rights to provide informed consent and to be treated with

Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities.

                                                                                                                        35
dignity, particularly in situations of custody, such as long-term care, imprisonment, or hospitalization,
should be protected. Discrimination based on residence is also connected with discrimination against
older people living with disabilities. Such people’s rights “deserve specific attention as they are subject
to hospitalization and institutionalization on the account of their age, their disability, or both factors.”41

Access to palliative care is part of the right to health. In some cases, lack of access to palliative
care may constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; particularly if the suffering is severe,
meeting the minimum threshold for ill-treatment; the government knew or should have known about
the pain; and all reasonable steps were not taken “to protect individuals’ physical and mental
integrity.”42 International human rights law is clear that no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel,
inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.43 The European Convention also maintains this
prohibition.44

Ensuring the right to health among older people must account for differences in health needs
between older men and women. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women states that “States parties should take appropriate measures to ensure the access of older
women to health services,” noting that women typically outlive men, are therefore more likely to suffer
from chronic diseases, and are often primary caregivers for aging spouses.45 Governments should
ensure affordable and accessible health care to all older women through activities that include the
elimination of user fees, the training of health workers in geriatric illnesses, access to appropriate
medicines, and long-term health and social care, care that allows for independent living, and palliative
care.46

The focus on health as a key endowment of people is also evident outside the human rights
framework. For instance, Sustainable Development Goal 3, to “ensure healthy lives and promote
well-being for all at all ages” declares that “we must achieve universal health coverage and access to
quality health care. No one must be left behind.”47 Governments should actively pursue the
Sustainable Development Goal targets on noncommunicable disease (NCD), which
disproportionately affect older people.48 The World Bank gender strategy highlights the importance
of NCDs, especially among middle-income countries, and has articulated the important links of
preventing discrimination based on gender, disability, and poverty.49

The right to employment
Discrimination in employment is prohibited in international human rights law. The
International Labour Organization (ILO) has a number of fundamental conventions, including the
Convention concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation.50 This
convention requires that distinctions, exclusions, or preferences must be based on respect of a
particular job’s inherent requirements.51 Its reach is broad, extending beyond job applications and
employer decisions in hiring and firing. It expressly includes vocational guidance, vocational training,
and placement services.52 It notes that age, family responsibilities, disability, and social status may all
require special protection or assistance.53 The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women notes that systemic discrimination against women throughout their lives results in lower
incomes in old age, leaving women at a disadvantage compared with older men.54 The Older Workers
Recommendation “aims to protect the rights of older workers with equality of treatment.”55 Older
people, in addition to their age, also often have family caregiving responsibilities, disabilities and a
social status that require specific protection in order to ensure equal rights in employment.

The barriers that older workers face have been recognized within the international human
rights framework. The Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights notes the damaging
effects of old-age discrimination on the labor force. Article 6 of the ICESCR requires states to
safeguard the right of all to work that is freely chosen and accepted. It notes the difficulties often
encountered by job-seekers nearing retirement age in finding and keeping work. The protection of the
right to gain a living through work is not limited to prohibiting discrimination; indeed, the committee
calls on states to prevent discrimination on the basis of age.56 This is also found in ILO
Recommendation 162 (1980) concerning Older Workers.

The ILO’s Employment Policy Convention, 1964 (No. 122) “promotes full, productive, and freely
chosen employment for all who are available for and seeking work.”57 The UN Special Rapporteur on
Human Rights in Extreme Poverty notes that, “as people grow older, they tend to be progressively
excluded from the formal and informal work markets by employers who prioritize a younger

Abolition of Forced Labor; the Convention concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize; the
Convention concerning the Application of the Principles of the Right to Organize and to Bargain Collectively; the Convention
concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women Workers for Work of Equal Value; the Convention concerning Discrimination
in Respect of Employment and Occupation; the Convention concerning Minimum Age for Admission to Employment; and the
Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor.

workforce occupy less attractive jobs, with lower pay than people of prime age.”58

Nondiscrimination is critical to the labor rights of women, including older women, who are
often at a disadvantage in looking for a job. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination
against Women has supported the creation of labor legislation and the use of temporary special
measures to address the unemployment situation of women above 40 years of age. Other European
countries have created temporary special measures to support employment among such women.59 The
World Bank’s gender strategy also calls for creating more and better jobs for women and for men and
cites the importance of building systems that include older women in access to economic
opportunities.60 For women who are not a part of the formal labor force, closing the gender gap in
the ownership and control of key assets such as land, housing, technology, and finance is even more
important to entrepreneurial success. “Enhancing women’s ability to make themselves heard and
direct the course of their own lives” is a critical part of participation in all aspects of life.61

Employment and decent work for all are also an important component of sustainable
development. Sustainable Development Goal 8 promotes “sustained, inclusive, and sustainable
economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all” in keeping with the ILO’s
labor standards.62 International development programs should ensure that older people benefit from
these efforts.

The right to social security
The right to social security is well-elaborated in the international framework on human rights.
ICESCR Article 9, together with articles 10 and 11, outlines the right to social security. The human
right to social security was further elaborated by the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural
Rights in General Comment 19 (2008) on the right to social security. Articles 22 and 25.1 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights also involve the right to social security. “Although it is a self-
standing right, the right to social security is also critical to the realization of the right to an adequate
standard of living, guaranteed in article 11 of the Covenant.”63

There are multiple facets to a social security system that meet international human rights
standards. General Comment 19 notes that insurance and savings, contributory and noncontributory,
and cash and in-kind benefits are important parts of social protection systems.64 Insurance, it notes, is
not enough, and it “is unlikely that every person can be adequately covered through an insurance-
based system.”65 For adequate coverage, systems must provide for several contingencies relevant for

older people beyond old-age benefits, such as survivor, disability, and health benefits. The Committee
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights offers the example of the importance of noncontributory
pensions for older women: “Given their greater life expectancy and the fact that it is more often they
who have no contributory pensions, women would be the principal beneficiaries.”66 Adequate
coverage among women outside the formal labor market and who never married could not be
achieved through contributory systems alone, without this option. Noncontributory pensions for
those people without resources upon attaining the age of retirement are necessary obligations under
Article 9 of the ICESCR. “Benefits payable under a social security system should be adequate in both
amount and duration and accessible to all without discrimination.”67 The informality of the workforce
limits the effectiveness of contributory pension systems. The Committee on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights notes that “States parties must take steps to the maximum of their available resources
to ensure that the social security systems cover those persons working in the informal economy.” 68
Box 3.1 outlines 10 human rights elements for a social protection system.

Box 3.1. Ten human rights elements for a social protection system
 Good systems:
 1. Are grounded through a legal instrument, such as a constitution, and an adequate institutional framework
     to ensure permanence
 2. Exhibit equal enforceability for contributory and noncontributory plans, ensuring the universality of
     protection;
 3. Ensure transparency and access to information, allowing “rights-holders to know what their entitlements
     are, and the criteria for inclusion in and exclusion from the programme(s)”
 4. Have clear roles for all stakeholders, including vulnerable groups
 5. Ensure accessibility, adaptability, and acceptability, including respect of privacy
 6. Ensure meaningful and effective participation of the intended beneficiaries, for ownership and
     sustainability, but also as a reflection of their right to take part in public life
 7. Provide adequate benefits to enjoy an adequate standard of living and afford required goods and services,
     ensuring dignity and autonomy
 8. Ensure comprehensive, coherent, and coordinated policies, including access to health care
 9. Ensure equality and nondiscrimination, including gender equity, incorporating a gender perspective
 10. Are enforceable, enabling recipients to claim their rights through the courts, if necessary, with accessible
     complaint mechanisms and effective remedies

There is guidance on supporting older people’s human right to social security. The Special
Rapporteur on Human Rights in Extreme Poverty notes that “the focus on older persons should
consist of setting basic, noncontributory pensions as one of the pillars of a comprehensive approach
that includes measures to ensure access to basic services (especially health services) and eliminate
discrimination based on sex.”69 Curtailment of noncontributory or social pensions would result in a

disproportionate impact on older women. A report on older people’s human rights authored by the
Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights notes that “the Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women includes a reference to old age in relation to
discrimination in the enjoyment of the right to social security (article 11.1 (e)).”70

Regional European human rights law regarding social security is extensive. Within the
framework of the international human rights norms set out above, the region has articulated the
application of these rights with great specificity. The European Code of Social Security requires social
security for all those over the age of 65, with some formulas for exceptions, and a minimum
replacement ratio of 40 percent.71 While it outlines a basic old-age benefit of a minimum of 50 percent
of replacement ratio for all those over the age of 65, it is also significantly weakened by a broad
allowance for the age threshold given appropriate demographic, economic, and social criteria.72 A
Revised European Code of Social Security entered into force in 1996.73 Nowhere in these standards is
state budgeting proscribed; pension systems may seek to self-fund through employee and employer
contributions, but securing minimum social pensions through the general budget is also possible.

European standard setting has adopted several approaches. Politically, the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe has urged member states to protect adequate social security.74 In
policy, the council’s recommendation to member states on the promotion of the human rights of
older persons notes that full social protection incorporates a number of human rights.75 In the revised
European Social Charter, states parties bound themselves to take measures to “enable elderly persons
to remain full members of society for as long as possible,” to “enable elderly persons to choose their
lifestyle freely and to lead independent lives in their familiar surroundings for as long as they wish and
are able,” and to “guarantee elderly persons living in institutions appropriate support, while respecting
their privacy, and participation in decisions concerning living conditions in the institutions.”76 Through
Article 23, states parties bound themselves to provide older persons with social protection in the form
of “adequate resources enabling them to lead a decent life and play an active part in public, social, and
cultural life.”77 Article 23 is complemented by the protection afforded by Articles 12 and 13, which
protect the rights to social security and social and medical assistance, respectively.78 Signatories to the
revised Social Charter are also party to the 1988 Additional Protocol to the European Social Charter,
which articulates, in Article 4, the right to social protection for older people, including adequate
resources, information, independence, housing, health care, and support and privacy in institutions.79

All these rights represent necessities for dignity. States bound themselves to the basic duty to
“maintain the social security system at a satisfactory level at least equal to that necessary for the
ratification of the European Code of Social Security.”80 This is patterned on the ILO’s Convention
102 (Social Security Minimum Standards) of 1952.81

Migrant workers have specific rights to social security. The International Convention on the
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families applies to all migrant
workers and members of their families without distinction of any kind, including, specifically, age
(Article 7). The rights of workers to social security after returning from working abroad are preserved
in Article 12 on the right to social security of the Revised European Social Charter. States parties
commit to take steps, by “appropriate bilateral and multilateral agreements or by other means . . . in
order to ensure: equal treatment with their own nationals of the nationals of other Parties in respect
of social security rights, including the retention of benefits arising out of social security legislation,
whatever movements the persons protected may undertake between the territories of the Parties.”82

Curtailment of existing rights to social security must be carried out carefully to prevent
discrimination. Many older people depend on their social security benefits for survival. So, individual
judicial review within a reasonable time is considered by some courts in Europe as an immediate
necessity for the survival of older persons.83 Fast-track appeals systems allow older people to challenge
mistakes quickly and efficiently. For systemic changes, the Committee on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights has noted that “there is a strong presumption that retrogressive measures taken in
relation to the right to social security are prohibited.”84 Should such measures be taken, states parties
have the burden of proving that all alternatives have been considered, that these actions are the best
for the realization of all social, economic and cultural rights outlined in the ICESCR, and taking into
account the state’s maximum available resources.85 “International financial institutions, notably the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, should take into account the right to social security
in their lending policies, credit agreements, structural adjustment programs, and similar projects, so
that the enjoyment of the right to social security, particularly by disadvantaged and marginalized
individuals and groups, is promoted and not compromised.”86

An adequate standard of living includes housing. The right to an adequate standard of living
includes the right to housing, according to Article 11 of the ICESCR. The Committee on Economic,
Social, and Cultural Rights in General Comment 6 on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of
Older Persons notes that “national policies should help elderly persons to continue to live in their

own homes as long as possible, through the restoration, development and improvement of homes
and their adaptation to the ability of those persons to gain access to and use them.”87 The Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women notes that states should “take necessary
measures to ensure access of older women to adequate housing that meet their specific needs. . . .
States parties should provide social services that enable older women to remain at home and live
independently for as long as possible. States parties should ensure that laws and practices affecting
older women's right to housing, land, and property are abolished. States parties also should protect
older women against forced evictions and homelessness.” 88 Such actions could be catastrophic for
older women with limited incomes or limited mobility.

The aims of the human right to social security are aligned with the Sustainable Development
Goals. These set out to ensure “all people must enjoy a basic standard of living, including through
social protection systems.”89 This “comprises both social insurance and social assistance with due
consideration to the true cost of living.”90 Social Security is a key element of social protection. The
benefits are not solely individual; they have positive externalities that are as relevant for societies as a
whole as they are for individuals. “Social security, through its redistributive character, plays an
important role in poverty reduction and alleviation, preventing social exclusion, and promoting social
inclusion.”91 The World Bank Golden Aging report supports this, noting that the “elderly poor” must
be protected as a core function of a system: “excessive moves toward linking pensions with wages and
years in the labor force may undermine the old-age protection and distribution functions of a pension
system.”92 Any gap in social protection systems “severely affects those living in extreme poverty, a
group in which older persons are represented to an unduly high degree.”93

Fulfilling the rights of specific population groups
Older women face the cumulative effects of multiple discriminations across their lifetimes.
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, General
Recommendation 27, recognizes that old age is “one of the grounds on which women suffer multiple
forms of discrimination.”94 The pattern may start with discrimination in education and carry over to
access to formal work, wages, and expectations of unpaid work, including caregiving. Gender roles
remain static across the life course, leaving older women with unpaid care workloads that go
unrecognized and unreported. In the European human rights system, Recommendation 1796 (2007)
of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe highlights the particular discrimination that
older women face, including lower incomes and poverty over their lifetimes, and the compounded
vulnerabilities from loss of income and pension contributions for leaving the workforce to assume

caregiving.95 The caregiving has other implications as well; for example, “women with heavy unpaid
care workloads may not be able to access health care due to lack of time or money.”96 More recently,
both the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have drawn
attention to the impact of financial crises on older women.97

The prohibition on discrimination based on gender is a legally immediate requirement, not
one that can be progressively addressed. The realization of the equal opportunity of men and
women to enjoy all economic, social, and cultural rights is addressed in Article 3 of the ICESCR.
Signatories of the ICESCR are required to ensure their laws do not discriminate in recognizing the
rights of men and women.98 The Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which oversees
the way countries implement the ICESCR, notes that the “implementation of Article 3 [prohibiting
discrimination] in relation to Article 9 [social security] requires, inter alia, equalization of the
compulsory retirement age for both men and women; ensuring that women receive equal benefits in
both public and private pension schemes.”99 This is a not uncommon example of a discriminatory law
in violation of the assurance of equality. Unequal laws on these issues exacerbate older women’s
marginalization and poverty, further entrenching gender inequality and discrimination.

Reliance on contributory social security systems exacerbates older women’s inequality. 100
Women are excluded from contributory social security systems for many reasons. Caregiving
responsibilities, lower educational attainment, and lower social status result in “lower-quality, informal,
and insecure jobs, due to the time women spend out of the workplace and their need for flexible work
arrangements.”101 These jobs are not providing the secure employment and retirement benefits that
men may accrue during men’s prime working years.102 As a result, “older women are more likely to
receive lower pensions and other contributory benefits [if at all] in the absence of adequate legal
frameworks to underpin their entitlement, threatening their enjoyment of their rights.”103

Older rural women face high barriers to accessing rights. The Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women has stated “its concern about the absence of detailed information on
the situation of older women in rural areas.”104 Poverty rates are often higher in rural areas, and access
to services is often curtailed unless there is a concerted effort by local and national governments. The
committee has repeatedly highlighted rural women’s lack of access to health care.105 Governments

should ensure that older women living in rural areas “benefit from policies and programs in all areas,
in particular access to health, education, social services, and decision-making.”106

Unpaid care work is a stumbling block to reaching goals of poverty reduction, women’s
empowerment, and gender equality.107 Older women are often caregivers. This has been
recognized by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Extreme Poverty: “Older women are
not only more likely to be poorer than men, but they are also likely to be burdened with caregiving
responsibilities for other family members, especially their grandchildren.”108 Noncontributory
pensions for those without resources upon attaining the age of retirement are necessary obligations
under Article 9 of the ICESCR. “Benefits payable under a social security system should be adequate
in both amount and duration and accessible to all without discrimination.”109 Nondiscrimination
against women in unpaid care work requires adequate noncontributory pensions.

Many older men and women, especially older women, experience violence in their homes, in
care settings, or in conflict or postconflict situations.110 Older people have the right to be free
from all forms of violence and abuse, and, through the general human rights prohibitions in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, governments have the duty to prevent violence and abuse,
protect older people, and punish violators.111 General Recommendation 27 of the Committee on the
Elimination of Discrimination against Women notes that “States parties have an obligation to
recognize and prohibit violence against older women, including those with disabilities, in legislation
on domestic violence, sexual violence, and violence in institutional settings. States parties should
investigate, prosecute, and punish all acts of violence against older women.”112

Countries also have strong economic motivations for eliminating family and domestic
violence against older people. The risk of violence is associated with a higher risk of health
complications and costs, as well as a higher risk of loss of ability to work or seek employment. Violence
has implications for health costs, productivity loss, and income loss. Physical violence is “more likely
to require longer periods of recuperation even from minor injuries. Apart from causing severe and
lasting emotional distress, physical violence is also a cause of premature mortality.”113

For certain older people, older women in particular, who may be experiencing the cumulative
effects of a lifetime of violence, the responsibility to respect and protect the right to live free
from violence is more compelling. “The state obligation to investigate alleged torture or other
forms of ill-treatment is also embodied in Article 3 of the European Convention, in relation to Article

1 of that instrument.”114 A suite of cases in 2013 and 2014 brought by women in Moldova reflect the
value the European Court of Human Rights places on nondiscrimination (Article 14). “The ECtHR
[European Court of Human Rights] has consistently found that state’s failure to investigate acts of
domestic violence that can be characterized as ill-treatment constitutes a violation of the duty to
prevent torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under European standards.”115

Ethnic minorities, such as Roma, face multiple types of discrimination in old age, based on their
age, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status, and disability. Stigma, a lack of access to information,
social isolation, and other factors may converge to limit the exercise of the human rights that have
been discussed in this chapter.

People with disabilities may face compounding types of discrimination as they age, and older people
may acquire disabilities as they age. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does
not specifically reference old age, but, as younger people with disabilities become older people, and as
people acquire disabilities in old age, the convention should be applied to them.

The Moldova-specific legal framework for a human rights–based approach to
population aging
Moldova has taken on numerous responsibilities in international and regional human rights
that relate to specific rights of nondiscrimination, health, social security, and employment.
Moldova has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICESCR, the
International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.116

While discrimination is prohibited, and equal recognition before the law is guaranteed for all
citizens by the constitution of Moldova, older age is not a constitutionally prohibited grounds for
discrimination.117 The constitution also does not contain specific protections for older people, as it
provides for people with disabilities, women, and children. The constitution does guarantee a
minimum free health insurance, a right to an adequate standard of living within the right to social
protection, and old age insurance as a right of all citizens.118

Antidiscrimination Law 121, adopted in 2012, is meant to “prevent and fight against discrimination
and ensure equal rights in political, economic, social, cultural, and other aspects of life for persons

residing in Moldova, regardless of their race, skin color, nationality, ethnicity, language, religion, sex,
age, limited abilities, political views, or any other factors.”119 The inclusion of age is important.

The enforcement of laws is critical to older people’s protection. As a social group, older people
in Moldova are among the most marginalized by discrimination.120 Social exclusion among older
people ranked among the worst in a six-country study in the region.121 The situation of older persons
was not reported in the government’s 2011 report to the Human Rights Council.122 The second
Universal Periodic Review of Moldova with the Human Rights Council will occur during the 26th
session beginning in October 2016. As with other international human rights reviews in Moldova, the
application of laws secures older people’s human rights.

Specific laws reflect the government’s regional and international commitments to the elderly

1. Discrimination. The government is seeking to improve its prohibitions against discrimination.
   In its report to the UN Human Rights Council during the Universal Periodic Review process in
   2011, the government reported that it would start the ratification process of the Council of
   Europe’s Protocol 12 to the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms after the
   adoption of a legal framework on antidiscrimination.123 The Law on Equality, for example, requires
   specialized structures for implementation, particularly to address the discrimination faced by older
   women.124 Discrimination among employees based on their age is prohibited.125 Discrimination in
   hiring is, however, less expressly prohibited by the Labor Code, Article 47. Discrimination against
   people with childcare responsibilities is prohibited through Article 247 of the Labor Code.126

2. Health. Moldovans have a national right to health care.127 National legislation refers to this as a
   constitutional right and guarantees the right to equal opportunity to obtain timely, good-quality
   health care through the compulsory health insurance system.128 Older Moldovans also have the
   right to health care free from discrimination in the health system. In advance of Moldova’s
   Universal Periodic Review in 2011, two nongovernmental organizations reported age
   discrimination in ambulance services that had routinely not responded to calls from older people,
   and the Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights expressed concern about these
   reports.129 The reports also noted that the high costs of medicine, the informal fees, and inadequate
   income were major barriers to older people’s enjoyment of the right to health care.130 Moreover,

percent greater than other groups, and the highest levels are found in Moldova and Tajikistan.

      since introduction of mandatory health insurance and family medicine in 2004, the awareness on
      the rights for access and utilization of healthcare services has been low, especially amongst older
      adults. In particular, every third person in Moldova is unaware about the rights and benefits
      offered under health insurance package and every third old adult refuses hospitalization due to
      additional expenses that might arise during treatment process. Such lack of information on the
      rights to healthcare contributes to disparities in accessing health services and pharmaceuticals and,
      as a result increases the risk of elderly being exposed to catastrophic expenditures related to their
      healthcare.

3. Employment. Unpaid care work, discrimination, and informality all impact older people’s equal
   rights in employment. Moldova is party to the fundamental conventions of the ILO, including
   Convention 111 concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation and
   Convention 122 on Employment Policy. Employment and decent work for all are also an
   important component of sustainable development. The government took note of the importance
   of the Millennium Development Goals in the Universal Periodic Review process.131

      Undeclared work is prohibited by the Labor Code.132 Informal work is, however, common in
      Moldova. Because of this, unintended disincentives for contributory pension systems may be
      created in the decisions of employers and employees. A stakeholder submission in advance of the
      Universal Periodic Review in 2011 requested that Moldova “ensure that the individuals working
      in the informal sector, including migrant workers, have access to social security when they reach
      the retirement age.”133

      Older people are still productive, and this should be reflected in Moldova’s laws and policies. A
      recent report on unpaid care found that “the amount, intensity, and drudgery of this work
      increases with poverty and social exclusion.”134 It is useful that Moldovan law allows for partially
      paid leave for grandmothers and grandfathers still working.135 The regulation on the determination
      and payment of allowances to families with children also applies to older persons.136

4. Social security. Moldova is a party to the ICESCR. The Committee on the Elimination of
   Discrimination against Women notes that “States parties should provide adequate non-
   contributory pensions on an equal basis with men to all women who have no other pension or
   insufficient income security and State-provided allowances should be available and accessible to
   older women, particularly those living in remote or rural areas.” 137 Noncontributory pensions
   promote gender equality and empowerment. The intention to equalize eligibility requirements
   between men and women is long overdue, but its continuing emphasis on wage-based plans

      or the realities of women’s lives.

      Regional European human rights law regarding social security is extensive. A Revised European
      Code of Social Security entered into force in 1996, but Moldova is not a signatory. Additionally,
      Moldova became bound by the Revised European Social Charter on January 1, 2002. There are
      some articles that the government has chosen not to be bound by.138 The Revised Charter outlines
      that older people are specifically entitled to “adequate resources enabling them to lead a decent
      life and play an active part in public, social, and cultural life,” which states parties are to pursue
      “by appropriate measures.”139 The government has chosen not to be bound by this article.140

      Moldova is not bound by EU law, but its extensive treatment of social security is indicative of the
      legal norms of the region. Article 34 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
      and Article 25 recognize the rights of older persons “to lead a life of dignity and independence
      and to participate in social and cultural life.”141 The government reached bilateral agreements with
      Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Romania in 2010–11 to ensure social security of pre–
      pension-age persons emigrating.142

      The European Code of Social Security requires social security for all people over age 65 and a
      minimum replacement ratio of 40 percent.143 Pension systems must function to protect rights.
      “Policymakers are responsible for implementing technical standards and rules, but also for
      ensuring that the products and services are accessible for people at risk of discrimination, such as
      those living in remote rural areas.”144 Chapter 6 explores the aspects of the system that must be
      addressed to realize the right of all older people to social security.

Older women face specific challenges. Moldova is a party to CEDAW and the Optional
Protocol.145 In Moldova, 92.1 percent of urban grandparent caregivers are women.146 Family- and
community-based care among orphans and vulnerable children is critical, but few policies are sensitive
to the human face of these families and communities, which is usually the face of an older woman.
The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Extreme Poverty has highlighted that one-fourth of
Moldova’s middle-age workforce resides abroad. Left behind, older people, often older women, carry

the burden of caring for children and maintaining family homes in rural areas. The right to social
security can create a favorable environments for more extensive care, in addition to financial support.
A 2010 study conducted by the United Nations Children’s Fund and HelpAge International of 1,205
multigenerational households in Moldova found that remittance-receiving households in rural areas
received less employment income and took advantage of fewer services.147 Perhaps, this reflects the
choice to use the freedom the remittances allow to spend more time caregiving rather than working.

Violence against older people is a problem in Moldova. Family and domestic violence were
mentioned repeatedly in the summary stakeholder report submitted to the Human Rights Council for
Moldova’s 2011 Universal Periodic Review.148 In a nationally representative survey, over two-thirds of
older people experiencing violence and abuse lived in rural areas.149 The Special Rapporteur on
Violence against Women called the legal developments in Moldova “commendable,” but noted “the
discrepancy between the normative framework and the reality on the ground is a major concern.” 150
She calls on Moldova to “elaborate a Plan of Action for the implementation and monitoring of the
Law on preventing and combating violence in the family, including through appropriate mechanisms
and the allocation of adequate budgetary and human resources for its implementation to relevant State
bodies.”151 This should take into account the rural and urban divide and a human rights–based
approach that incorporates participation and accountability.

                                                             ***

Older people’s rights to nondiscrimination, health, employment, and social security are
rooted in international human rights law. In Moldova and around the world, “there is no binding
international instrument or even supervisory body dealing specifically with the rights of older
persons.”152 In international forums, attempts have been made to cast older people’s human rights as
secured without the existence of a universal standard.

Moldova has signed and ratified many of the international and regional treaties involving
human rights, but implementation gaps remain. Many older people in Moldova do not enjoy the
benefit of these rights because the treaties are not reflected in law and practice.

Data count: what gets measured gets done. If a state ratifies a human rights treaty, it agrees to be
bound to report on progress on the rights covered in the treaty. No such treaty exists unifying the
rights of older people. Some policy documents exist. These include the UN Principles on the Rights
of Older Persons and the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging. The latter can be used to
guide states in protecting the rights of older people.153 These are positive markers, but they are not
human rights instruments with attendant rights to enforcement, whereby older people can hold their

review of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging calls for “states to develop their national
capacity for monitoring and enforcing the rights of older persons through, inter alia, national
institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights where applicable.”154 As the UN
Economic Commission for Europe regional synthesis report on the plan of action notes, “Overall,
countries have found very individual ways of reporting, choosing to provide more details on selected
issues and leaving out others.”155 Without regular reporting and accountability, no human rights
relationship can exist between a state and its people.

Data and monitoring are critical to the realization of older people’s rights. The government has
not submitted formal statements at any meetings of the UN Open Ended Working Group on Aging.156
The Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights has recommended that the government
“take urgent measures to establish a system for the collection and monitoring of annual data on
Covenant rights, disaggregated by disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups.”157

4. HEALTHY AGING
The goal of universal health coverage espoused by the World Health Organization involves ensuring that individuals
have access to the health services they need without suffering financial hardship through the costs. As countries develop
economically, the burden of disease shifts from infectious disease to chronic and NCDs. Because the prevalence of the
latter increases with age and the management the associated care requires frequent use of health services and ongoing
treatment with medication that can be expensive, the elderly may be particularly disadvantaged if universal health coverage
were incomplete. This chapter presents basic trends in health outcomes in Moldova over the last two decades, focusing on
life expectancy, the burden of disease, and risk factors. It also describes challenges in the current health care system and
empirically examines access to services, the quality of care, and adherence to drug regimens across the life cycle. The fiscal
implications of addressing these challenges cannot be overlooked in considering policy options.

Healthy aging in Moldova? A picture of key health outcomes
Low life expectancy
The population has made gains in life expectancy, although life expectancy at birth is low.
Starting out in the worst position in Eastern Europe in 1990 (Figure 4.1, vertical black lines), the
population gained 4 years of life expectancy in 1990–2013 and caught up with or surpassed Belarus,
Russia, and Ukraine, as shown by the vertical dotted black lines in Figure 4.1. The improvements in
other countries, particularly the Baltic States and Central Europe, were greater, and the gap in life
expectancy between Moldova and the rest of Europe remains sizable. Life expectancy in Moldova is
low, at 71.3 years (compared with the regional average of 76.0). Life expectancy is approximately the
same in Moldova now as it was in Central Europe in 1990. Residents of Western Europe are expected
to live an average 9 years longer than residents of Moldova. Figure 4.1 also shows that gains in life
expectancy were spread across contributing causes of mortality, with the exception of HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and substance abuse; the life expectancy associated with these causes of mortality is
below the overall average life expectancy prevailing in 1990.158

Old-age mortality, especially among men, has not improved. Although under-5 mortality rates
have fallen by more than half since 1990 (from 35 to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births), life expectancy
at age 60 in 2015 was 16.4 years, compared with the average of 21.0 in the region, and had not
improved since 1990. Healthy life expectancy at birth is even lower, at 62 years in 2013.159 Starting at
age 50, people spend at least 30 percent of the rest of their lives in bad or very bad health.160

The life expectancy statistics reflect a large sex gap in health outcomes. Like most other
countries, life expectancy in Moldova is much lower among elderly men than among elderly women.
Life expectancy at age 60 was only 14.3 years among men and 18.2 among women in 2015.161 The
difference in healthy life expectancy at birth is even larger, at 7 years: healthy life expectancy at birth
was 59 years among men and 66 years among women in 2013. This sex gap is only 4 years in Romania
and 5 years in Bulgaria.162 Life expectancy at age 60 increased by 0.5 years among women during the
last 25 years, but has worsened among men. However, the longer life expectancy among women is
associated with more years in bad or very bad health. Women ages 60–64 spend 5.6 percent of their
time in good health, compared with 68.9 percent among men.163

One consequence of the large sex gap in health is the feminization of aging. Women account
for 62.5 percent of people ages 65 or older and 68 percent of people ages 80 or older. The share of
married men among elderly men is 80.9 percent, while the share of widowers is 12.1 percent. Married
women account for 51.1 percent of the elderly women, and widows represent 39.7 percent. By the age
of 75, widowers account for 40.0 percent of elderly men, compared with 78.1 percent, which is the
corresponding share of widows among elderly women.164 A large share of elderly women, especially
widows, live alone and are thus more vulnerable to economic insecurity.

Substantial morbidity
The population is undergoing an epidemiological transition, whereby chronic disease
replaces infectious diseases as a major contributor to mortality and morbidity. In 1990–2013,
infectious diseases and neonatal conditions declined in importance relative to NCDs. Respiratory and
circulatory diseases accounted for the largest share of morbidity. The incidence of cardiovascular
disease rose appreciably: the relevant share of registered patients doubled in 2000–14 (Figure 4.2).
This was likely associated with population aging. It exerts pressure on the health system. The incidence
of cancer is also expected to rise dramatically among the elderly, by around 30 percent by 2035, and
this increase is similar to Russia, but much higher than the expected increase in Belarus and Ukraine.165

The pattern of these disease burdens across the life cycle in Moldova resembles trends in
other low-income settings in which NCDs are not confined to the elderly population, but also
affect the prime working-age population.166 Table 4.1 presents results from the nationally
representative 2013 STEPS survey, in which the blood pressure and cholesterol levels of respondents
were measured. While half the aging (50+) or elderly (65+) populations exhibits high blood pressure
and high cholesterol, these indicators are not trivial among the population ages 35–49. Nearly half of
this group also exhibits high cholesterol, and nearly 30 percent have high measured blood pressure.

Note: Hypertension and high cholesterol were measured through the survey. The prevalence of cardiovascular events were
derived from the following question posed to respondents: “Have you ever had a heart attack or chest pain from heart
disease (angina) or a stroke (cerebrovascular accident or incident)? ” Young adults were ages 18–34. The prime working
age was 35–49 years. The aging category refers to ages 50 or older. The elderly category refers to ages 65 or older.

These disease risk factors are likely driven by behavioral risk factors that are also strikingly
high in Moldova, as in the rest of Eastern Europe (Table 4.2). Among young adults and people
of prime working age, nearly half of all men smoke, and nearly half have drunk to excess in the last 30
days (six or more standard drinks on a single occasion at least once in the previous 30 days). Few men
or women exercise; 92 percent of women of prime working age report they do not engage in moderate-
intensity exercise. By ages 60–64, over 80 percent of women are overweight or obese (Figure 4.4).

The prevalence of high cholesterol and the likelihood of a cardiovascular event were statistically
indistinguishable across quintiles of monthly earnings. There appears to be a steep income gradient in
blood pressure control: the bottom three quintiles were, respectively, 18 percentage points (83
percent), 19 percentage points (87 percent), and 7 percentage points (34 percent) significantly more
likely to exhibit uncontrolled blood pressure.167

The overall pattern of health-related risk taking can have overwhelming consequences among
individuals through increases in the incidence of disease and the need for expensive long-
term treatment, as well as society through declines in labor productivity and pressures on the
fiscal system from high, increasing health-related costs.168 If the associated costs of health care,
law enforcement, and productivity losses are included, the total cost of alcohol abuse, for example,

167These differences were estimated from a regression analysis of an indicator of high blood pressure on indicators of quintiles of
reported monthly earnings.

States.169

The prevalence of disease and behavioral risk factors among the younger population in
Moldova suggests that healthy aging requires continuous access to health care services across
age-groups to treat and manage chronic disease. Affected people currently of prime working age,
if treated appropriately according to internationally accepted standards, would spend more than half
their lives on medication.

This epidemiological profile calls for a strong primary care sector that can ensure diagnosis,
treatment, and management of chronic diseases in a timely manner among older people and
preventive care among future generations. It also calls for considerable health insurance coverage,
because chronic disease often requires continuous treatment through medication, which can be
expensive. The prevalence of chronic disease also increases the likelihood of health catastrophes, such
as cancer, stroke, or heart attack that can require expensive treatment and rehabilitation.

Challenges in the health system
The current benefits package and service delivery model in Moldova do not facilitate timely
access to services or financial protection for health expenditures. Systemwide challenges have
led to inefficient spending in the country relative to its neighbors. Despite high de jure insurance
coverage, especially among the elderly, Moldovans must spend a considerable share of their resources
to access basic services and medicines, and thus a substantial share of the population must forgo care.
Income gradients are evident across the life cycle because the lowest expenditure quintiles are much
less likely to receive care and spend much less on medicines, although they are not less likely to require
medical attention. As the consumption of medicine normally progresses with age, the evidence
suggests that the poor among the aging and elderly population segments are not adequately treating
their conditions, because their spending on medicines is well below the corresponding spending
among the more well off quintiles of much younger age-groups.

Inefficient spending
Aggregate health financing indicators paint a picture of inefficient spending. Moldova stands
out in Eastern Europe in that more than 10 percent of GDP was devoted to health expenditures in
2006–14 (Figure 4.5). However, this greater spending has not translated into better health outcomes.

While the spending is relatively high, the share of the spending that is public is low, accounting
for half or less of all health expenditures in 2006–14 (Figure 4.6). A large majority of private spending,
83 percent, comes from out-of-pocket payments, and thus individual citizens account for nearly half
of all health expenditures (Figure 4.7). Despite the fact that a mechanism to pool these separate
payments from individuals to make large investments exists, there is poor allocation of these
investments. The capital budget is scattered thinly across an excessive number of small investments,
without sense of priority and efficiency in spending. Thus, lack of targeted investment in
infrastructure, equipment and service provision pushes patients to private healthcare seeking better
care and avoiding long waiting lists. Consequently, substantial underinvestment in areas such as
hospital infrastructure and equipment, explains why many hospital facilities are considered
underutilized and unsafe.170

The current system of provider payments provides few incentives for hospitals to strive for
efficiency. The diagnostic-related group method of payments has not been fully implemented.
Through the method, inpatient stays are classified into groups (for example, heart failure,
appendectomy, knee replacement), among which hospital reimbursements are the same, regardless of
the diagnostics, procedures, or treatments provided by a hospital. Currently, hospitals in Moldova only
use the method to classify cases because the National Medical Insurance Company bases payments
on the costs reported by individual hospitals. Because some hospitals may be inefficient and thus
report high costs for low volumes or for low-quality care, the current system of provider payments
does not offer incentives for efficiency improvements.

Similarly there are small incentives for effective and quality perfomance at the primary
healthcare level. Preventive healthcare services are not efficient, specifically to monitor and cover
the elderly population. Efforts should be made in orienting the organization of service delivery (like
many European Union countries) to address aging populations with more ambulatory services and
less acute care beds, in favor of long-term and social care for elderly.

High out-of-pocket expenditures are a direct result of the benefits package, which currently
supplies unclear and not always cost-efficient health services with little insurance coverage
for pharmaceuticals. One-third of total health expenditures are devoted to pharmaceuticals, which
is the share of pharmaceuticals in total health expenditure documented in Eastern Europe. Yet, 95
percent of these expenditures are borne by individuals rather than the government, the share of which
is the lowest in public pharmaceutical expenditure in Eastern Europe (Table 4.3). The averages among
EU member countries put these figures into perspective, among these countries, the share of
pharmaceuticals in total health expenditures is only 16 percent, 65 percent of which is publicly
financed.

Limited financial protection
Out-of-pocket payments account for half of total health expenditures. This is a sign that many
users of health services face financial hardship when paying for services and that some individuals,
particularly those in less well off socioeconomic groups, may have to forgo essential care altogether.
The World Health Organization considers a system in which out-of-pocket payments represent more
than 20 percent of total health expenditure incapable of protecting people from falling into poverty
because of unexpected health costs. Thus, universal health coverage has not yet been achieved in
Moldova.

This is also apparent from nationally representative survey data. For the elderly and children, de jure
coverage is nearly universal (Figure 4.8). For all other age-groups, sizable income gradients characterize
coverage. Among people ages 25–54 in the lowest expenditure quintile, for example, less than half
have insurance.

However, even universal de jure coverage does not guarantee de facto coverage. Among the
aging and elderly populations, 76 percent and 97 percent, respectively, reported insurance coverage,
but less than half reported they had used insurance coverage to pay health care expenditures in the
previous 12 months, most likely because the bulk of an individual’s health care expendit ures derives
from medicines, the use of which steadily increases across the life cycle (Table 4.4; Figure 4.9).

Low access to medicines and quality health services
Expenditures on medication are lower among the poor, suggesting the poor have low access
to medicines. The income gradients of an individual’s expenditure on medication are striking across
the life cycle (Figure 4.10). Among the 55–64 age-group and people above age 65, the bottom quintile
spends less than a quarter of the spending of the top quintile on medication. The differences in patient
propensities to use generic versus branded drugs cannot account for these gradients, because
pharmaceutical regulations prohibit substituting branded with generic medicines, and many medicines
in the benefits package are branded. While the various income groups may be purchasing different
brands, these gradients also likely reflect limited to no adherence to drug regimes among the poor.

Adherence to drug regimes is low across the life cycle, particularly among the young (Table
4.5). Among individuals ages 50 or older, only 64 percent and 33 percent, respectively, of those who
had received a diagnosis related to high blood pressure or high cholesterol were on medication.
Adherence appears better among the elderly, but much worse among younger age-groups, who will
pay the consequences as they age either through premature mortality or through longer durations of
compromised health. After experiencing a major cardiovascular event, only 14 percent of individuals
older than 50 were taking a statin. While adherence to medication is an issue even in the absence of
budget constraints, especially for chronic disease, the role of costs may be inferred by comparing
adherence to statin with adherence to an over-the-counter drug such as aspirin, which was being taken
by 44 percent of people ages 50 or older who had experienced a cardiovascular event.171

older. The elderly category refers to ages 65 or older.

It is also possible that the low measured adherence to drug regimes reflects poor quality
service delivery. Before taking any medication, patients would need a prescription from a medical
provider, and it may be they do not receive these. Thus, among people with high blood pressure
measurements during the survey, only 57 percent of the elderly had received a hypertension diagnosis,
and only 44 percent were taking relevant medicine (see Table 4.5). Similarly, only 10 percent of people
with high cholesterol measurements had received a diagnosis, and only 5 percent were on cholesterol
medication. These diagnosis and drug adherence rates are worse earlier in the life cycle.

While it is possible that patients are not receiving a diagnosis or prescription for medication
because they are not going to health care facilities and seeking medical advice, other evidence
suggests high rates of service use, especially among older age-groups (Figure 4.11). While
income appeared to determine whether an individual had used health services in the previous four
weeks, even the lowest quintile seeks medical attention, and, among people ages 55–64 in the lowest
quintile, 25 percent had sought care. Thus, the inadequate quality of services rather than low
participation among patients seems to be a major factor behind the observed low rates of diagnosis
and drug adherence. Nonetheless, not all the elderly who need medical assistance have access to
services: 28.6 percent of people ages 65–74, and 41 percent of people ages 75+ felt they had needed
medical assistance in the last 12 months, but had not requested it. Among those who had exhibited
this behavior, 29 percent cited the lack of financial means as the main reason.172

Trends in health outcomes, risk factors, and health expenditures suggest that the elderly may
lack adequate services and face considerable financial hardship in accessing care and that the
long-term health of future generations of the elderly is also at risk. Behavioral and health system
challenges are creating financial burdens on the aging population saddled with chronic disease if they
seek medical attention and adhere to any prescribed medications. Evidence shows that risky behaviors,
such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and disease risk factors, such as hypertension
and high cholesterol, start early in the life cycle. This suggests that future generations of the aging and
the elderly may exhibit even higher rates of morbidity and mortality.

That rates of diagnosis are so low despite frequent visits to health facilities and that the consumption
of medicines is low overall and strongly linked to a household’s budget suggest that interventions that
improve the quality of services—particularly health promotion and prevention activities and primary
care services—and reduced pharmaceutical costs for patients will not only benefit the current aging
and elderly populations, but also improve the health and financial security of future generations as
they age.

5. PRODUCTIVE AGING
Economic security among the elderly is strongly linked to the past, present, and future health of the labor market. Work
history largely determines the size of a pension, and, as the largest source of income among the elderly, pensions play a
significant role in the well-being and security of older people. In addition, past labor market outcomes affect the amount
of savings and investments that elderly people are able to accumulate before retiring. At the macro level, employment
affects the sustainability of the social protection system as well. The demographic transition in Moldova will require that
a shrinking workforce support a growing elderly population. This chapter explores recent trends among the working-age
population. It focuses on older cohorts and highlights both worrying and encouraging developments in the labor market.

Productive aging in Moldova? A picture of key labor market outcomes
Declining employment
A large and growing share of the population is out of the labor force. While the official
unemployment rate is quite low and has recovered steadily since a rise to nearly 4.5 percent in 2010,
more than 70.0 percent of people over the age of 55 are economically inactive. Even among people
under the age of 55, the inactivity rate is above 50.0 percent. Between 2006 and 2015, the activity rate
has declined in both rural and urban areas, and across most population subgroups (Figures 5.1 and
5.2).173 Though the country’s low official labor force participation rate is partly driven by high
emigration and the inclusion of migrants in statistics on the domestic participation rate, official
statistics place the country well below regional averages (Figure 5.3).174 The rate of employment in
Moldova is much lower than most other countries in the region.

173Because the official definition of inactivity in Moldova includes workers abroad, not all the inactive lack employment income.
174Even after adjusting for migration, the labor force participation rate is low and drives the low employment rate. It is likely, however,
that employment and migration trends captured in the Labor Force Survey underestimate the employment rate and the size of labor
migration. The data will have to be revisited once the 2014 census is released.

In line with trends in labor force participation, employment rates have declined across all age-
groups. About 12.6 percent of people age 65 or older were employed in 2006, falling to only 8.9
percent in 2014. Among individuals ages 55 or older, the employment rate fell from 29.5 percent to
26.5 percent over the same period. This trend has occurred alongside a slow deterioration in domestic
participation in the labor force across all age-groups (Figure 5.4). In 2006, about 47 percent of the
population under age 55 was employed, but, by 2014, only about 44 percent was employed. Both
women and men were less likely to work in 2014 than in 2006. Among women, the employment rate
dropped from 40.5 percent to 37.4 percent in 2006–14. Employment fell even more among men over
the period, from 45.5 percent to 40.9 percent.

The total number of employed people is shrinking. The decline in the size of the working
population has been driven by out-migration, lower labor force participation, and population aging.
In 2000–14, the number of employed people under the age 55 declined by more than 25 percent
(Figure 5.5). Although the share of people over the age of 54 who were employed declined between
2006 and 2004, the total number of people aged 55 or more has grown, leading to an increase in both
the number of active and the number of inactive people in this segment. Thus, the increase in the
number of employed people aged 55 between 2006 and 2014 did little to offset the growing overall
imbalance between the number of employed people and the number of people who were out of the
labor force. Increasing dependence on a shrinking labor force will drive up the per worker burden of
the social protection system (see also chapter 6).

2006, despite a temporary increase in 2009–12. The trend may indicate that many older workers who
previously remained in the labor force in part-time positions are now captured as inactive. In 2006, 12
percent of employed workers over the age of 54 reported part-time employment (excluding of
subsistence agriculture), while only 7.6 percent did so in 2014. Similarly, while more than 19 percent
of workers over the age of 65 were working part time in 2006, fewer than 12 percent fell in that
category in 2014. Among workers ages 55 or older, 15.3 percent would have preferred to change their
employment situation. In sum, among older workers, relatively few work part-time outside of
subsistence agriculture, and most likely do so by preference.

Projections by the International Labor Organization suggest that the number of older people
out of the labor force will continue climbing between 2015 and 2020. While increased labor force
participation could improve the economic outlook and the sustainability of pension and other
retirement programs, if current trends hold there will be a marked increase in the number of older
people out of the labor force in the coming years.

Average incomes have increased among wage earners. Wage growth improved following the
2008–09 financial crisis, and wage workers, who tend to be in more formal contracts, have seen their
earnings rise.175 However, given low employment rates overall and particularly in formal jobs, wage
increases for formal workers only benefit a portion of the population, and can only indirectly benefit
older workers who are already out of the labor force if they belong to a large household including
formal workers. Similarly, a persistent gender wage gap—estimated at 12.4 percent between men and
women of similar qualifications by the NBS—may impact elderly women’s vulnerability given the

175   World Bank (2016b).

Left out of growing economic sectors
Recent economic growth has been concentrated in particularly productive sectors, supporting
some workers and leaving others behind as they prepare for retirement. The transition from a
planned economy was accompanied by job destruction in Moldova and firms, even in the growing
services sector, have had a hard time creating jobs after the 2009 global crisis; instead the most efficient
firms have risen their productivity by shedding jobs, not creating them.176 Since independence, the
economy has shifted rapidly away from agriculture and toward services (Figure 5.7, panel a). The share
of agriculture in economic activity has also declined. Recent improvements in productivity in the
agricultural sector have been concentrated among large agricultural firms, rather than among
smallholder farms and the small plots where older people commonly work.

Productivity has increased (Figure 5.7, panel b), but remains low in Moldova compared with
other countries.177 Projections for 2013–30 indicate that employment in less-productive sectors,
particularly agriculture, will continue a long-term decline relative to economic output and that growth
will be driven largely by productivity improvements (Figure 5.8). If exploited, rising productivity may
counteract some of the negative effects of population aging, but may not directly support the incomes

Agriculture

Though the share of the labor force employed in the agricultural sector is declining, older
workers are still predominantly employed in agriculture. Among employed people over the age
of 54, agricultural work remained the most prevalent occupation in 2014, and was far more common
for older than for younger cohorts. The share of older workers employed in agriculture has declined
from 53 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2009, only partially rebounding to 41 percent by 2015 (Figure
5.9). The decline over this period affected all age groups, but was most pronounced among older
workers.178 However, despite long-term trends towards lower employment in agriculture, structural
transformation has been slow. Total employment remains higher in agriculture than in the service
sector among both older and younger workers.

Older people are increasingly working in part-time agricultural production for subsistence.
The share of individuals working on their own plots of land reached more than 40 percent of the older
population in 2012 (Figure 5.10).179 Informality rates are high in agriculture, limiting access to the
pension system and other benefits for agricultural workers. Agriculture is also particularly seasonal,
causing large swings in income and non-income benefits among workers in the sector. Subsistence
farming households—defined as those that primarily farm and consume 90 percent or more of their
production or more—are often small, female-headed, and have lower educational attainment.
Households engaged in subsistence farming are also more often headed by an older individual with
health problems.180

Recent growth in the agricultural sector is concentrated in segments where the elderly are not
active. According to the 2011 agricultural census, 2.2 million hectares of agricultural land was divided
among around 900,000 farms, the vast majority of which were smallholder subsistence plots. As many
as half of these farms cultivated less than 0.5 hectares each, and about 95 percent of farms covered an
area of less than 3.0 hectares.181 Older workers are more likely than younger workers to farm small
plots and work either on their own, or for smaller enterprises and cooperatives. Of employed people
over the age of 54 in 2014, about 47 percent worked in an activity with only 1–4 other people. For
workers age 65 or above, the share rose to 68 percent in 2014, in contrast to only 38 percent of
employed people under the age of 55. Most of the recent growth in the agricultural sector has been

concentrated in large agricultural firms, which represent a minority of farming enterprises and account
for only a small fraction of the older people employed in agriculture.182

Services

Recent job creation and wage growth has been concentrated in the services sector, and has
not offset job destruction in other sectors. Although agriculture and industry became more
productive between 2000 and 2013, the service sector was already more productive and has become
much more so (Figure 5.11). For those workers that were able to access the service sector, and
especially formal positions, job quality improved over the same period. Rural areas have not benefited
from the growth of the service sector to the same extent as urban areas however, even as the decline
in agricultural employment has affected rural areas more. Since 2000, agriculture and industry have
shed jobs at a rapid pace, and, though service jobs have become more prevalent, they have not fully
offset the decline in other sectors either in aggregate, or among the workers affected by the decline in
agriculture and industry (Figure 5.12). The large majority of the service jobs created since 2000 have
gone to people with secondary educational attainment or above, while the jobs that were lost in
agriculture and, in some cases, in industry were more accessible to people with less educational
attainment.183

182 Investment and the value of agricultural products sold have increased markedly in recent years. The recent partial rebound in
agricultural employment and output has coincided with new investment and productivity growth. Plant production increased by more
than 25 percent in 2007–14, while animal production rose by nearly 40 percent over the same period (NBS data).

Younger cohorts are expected to gain the most from growth in the service sector. In 2014, 19
percent of workers under the age of 55 were employed in the service sector, compared to only 9
percent of workers aged 55 or over. The advantage for younger workers in the service sector is driven
by several factors, but especially by the fact that after the transition to a market economy, older
workers were less able to retrain and reposition themselves in the more competitive labor market. 184
Older people also more often live in rural areas in which there are fewer service sector jobs. Relocation
costs are high for the elderly, and many are unable to work in growing sectors because these jobs are
concentrated in cities.

The public sector

The public sector is increasingly made up of older workers and is slowly shrinking. In 2014
only about 26 percent of people under the age of 55 worked in the public sector.185 In contrast, the
share of people over the age of 55 working in government or a publically owned enterprise grew from
26 percent in 2006 to 31 percent in 2014. Although most people who remain in the labor force after
the age of 65 still work in agriculture, a growing share is in the public sector (Figure 5.13, panel b).
Between 2006 and 2014, women in particular were more both more likely to work in the public sector
than men, and were more likely to remain employed in the public sector after the age of 65 (Figure
5.13, panel a). Though on average public sector workers receive lower salaries, they have substantially
longer tenure than private sector workers. In 2014, the tenure of 38.0 percent of public sector workers
was 11 years or more, while only 13.2 percent of private sector workers could say the same. This gap
is due at least in part to the fact that older workers in the public sector are better educated, on average,
than other workers of the same age group.

The challenges in achieving higher employment among older people
Promoting employment among older people requires addressing the main challenge of the
labor market: boosting job creation. Employment has been declining, and recent evidence shows
that firms are struggling to grow and create jobs.186 Without a rise in labor demand, the current and
future elderly will have few opportunities for productive employment, which also has important
negative implications for the sustainability of the pension system (see chapter 6). Low levels of labor
demand also disproportionally affect particular populations (see annex A). People aged 55 or more,
those with lower educational attainment, and those living in rural areas are more likely to be inactive.
Particularly among people over age 55, inactivity is associated with low levels of educational
attainment, and as in most countries in the region, women in Moldova are less likely to participate in
the labor market, regardless of their age.

The lack of relevance of education and skills
Low educational achievement is correlated with old-age poverty. In 2014, the elderly with
vocational or tertiary educational attainment were 13 percentage points less likely to be poor than
elderly with only primary education. This mirrors the disparity among the nonelderly (Figure 5.14).
Controlling for other demographic characteristics shows that the gap is even wider, ranging from 18
to 20 percentage points (see Table A.1 in annex A). The link between education and old-age poverty
is likely the labor market. Education is a strong determinant of labor force participation among older
workers, while it is even a more robust determinant among young and prime-age workers. In
particular, secondary educational attainment is positively correlated with both labor market
participation (see annex A) and earnings. The wage ratio between skilled and unskilled workers
measured in the HBS survey is 1.2 at the age of 25 and increasing with age to 1.8 by retirement.187 This
high, widening wage gap translates into substantial inequality in lifetime earnings, pensions, and wealth
accumulation.

The likelihood that an individual works past retirement age is strongly associated with
education. Among people over the age of 54, completing secondary school or higher more than
doubles the likelihood a given individual is employed (Table A.2 in annex A; see also Figure 5.15,
panel a), and the relationship is even stronger for older people. The type of education completed is
also important: people who have completed lyceum (grades 1–12) or gymnasium (grades 1–9) are no
more likely to be employed than people with only basic education (grades 1–4) or less. The relationship
between educational attainment and employment has strengthened over time: in 2006, only 5.6 percent
of employed workers over the age of 54 had a secondary professional degree, but, by 2014, the share
had risen to more than 9.0 percent. The corresponding share among those with higher education
increased from 6 percent to nearly 9 percent over the same period.

The older generation in Moldova has relatively high educational attainment, but their skills
may not be appropriate for the current labor market. A legacy of the Soviet system, education
levels in Moldova are relatively high in comparison to some countries in the region (Figure 5.16, panels
b and c). However, given the structural changes in the economy in recent decades, the lack of skills in
high demand from employers—including cognitive, socioemotional, and technical skills—may be a
potential barrier among these groups.188 Almost half of firms (46 percent) either frequently or
systematically encounter difficulties in hiring staff with the desired competencies and skills. The
reported shortage predominantly affects large companies, and the agriculture, industry, transportation,
and construction sectors in particular (57.4 percent). More than 30 percent of firms report that skills
have become a severe constraint to their growth.189

In a rapidly changing world, ensuring that workers can renew and strengthen their skills as
they age is critical. The obsolescence of worker skills throughout the life cycle is a constant challenge
in the context of a changing labor market in Moldova, in addition to the erosion of skills that
accompanies labor market detachment. Beyond the need to provide strong foundational skills in the
educational system, providing opportunities for lifelong learning should be part of the policy agenda
and can support continued labor force participation among older workers through skill upgrades and
retraining.190 Currently, however, few people enroll in formal education programs after reaching
adulthood and enter the labor force. According to NBS statistics, in 2014, only 1,145 people over the
age of 23 were enrolled in general education, vocational schools, or colleges.

Rising average educational attainment among younger generations will mitigate the decline
in the human capital stock as the population shrinks (Figure 5.16), but the quality of education
remains a constraint. 191 About 74 percent of the population age 25+ completed at least upper

190Schuetze (2006); World Bank (2003), (2016b).
191In countries with shrinking populations, the total stock of human capital is often a metric for the economic potential of the country
over the long term. A decline in the total stock of human capital may occur if there are fewer people of working age, even if education
rates remain constant. Moldova has relatively high educational attainment, even among the elderly. Given the increase in educational
attainment among the younger cohorts, even if the adult population decreases significantly, the stock of human capital (measured as the
total number of years of schooling in the adult population) will stay rather stable. However, advancement to tertiary education is low,
and postsecondary completion is lower among the young than among the old, which may signify a deterioration in educational access
(The older generation in Moldova has relatively high educational attainment, but their skills may not be

secondary education.192 Although this represents a higher share than Albania and Romania, it is still
lower than Belarus, Georgia, Ukraine, and other former transition countries that have similar
education systems. The performance of 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics, and science in the
Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) test is among the lowest in the region, and
more than two years behind their peers in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD).193 The skills mismatch seems to be an issue across age-groups as well, and
Enterprise Surveys find that employers report pervasive skill shortages despite rising average
educational attainment among younger generations. Beyond mere educational attainment, the quality
and relevance of education need to be strengthened.194

Labor disincentives in social protection systems
Low participation rates among older people are partly driven by the relatively low retirement
age in Moldova, and the high take-up of early retirement. According to the 2014 LFS data,
employment rates peak at around 60 percent during the prime working years (age mid-30s to age mid-


appropriate for the current labor market. A legacy of the Soviet system, education levels in Moldova are relatively
high in comparison to some countries in the region (Figure 5.16, panels b and c). However, given the structural
changes in the economy in recent decades, the lack of skills in high demand from employers—including cognitive,
socioemotional, and technical skills—may be a potential barrier among these groups. Almost half of firms (46
percent) either frequently or systematically encounter difficulties in hiring staff with the desired competencies and
skills. The reported shortage predominantly affects large companies, and the agriculture, industry, transportation,
and construction sectors in particular (57.4 percent). More than 30 percent of firms report that skills have become
a severe constraint to their growth.

50s), and fall sharply to 49 percent by age 57. At 33 percent, labor force participation among people
ages 50+ in Moldova is among the lowest in the region (relative to 41 percent in Albania, 64 percent
in Georgia, and 38 percent in Romania) (Figure 5.17). The official retirement age is relatively low (age
57 for women and age 62 for men, compared with 60 for women and 65 for men in Albania, Georgia,
and Romania), which means that many people have a shorter employment tenure before retiring.

Early retirement may be partly reflecting the low life expectancy of older people upon leaving
the workforce. Extending the years of employment can contribute to the economic security of older
workers, but in an environment of low life expectancy, raising the retirement age has important welfare
implications. Delaying retirement can increase the resources people accumulate for their pensions (see
chapter 6), leading to higher household expenditures and economic activity, potentially creating a need
for more workers and generating a virtuous cycle. However, life-expectancy has grown slowly since
1990, and workers are not necessarily enjoying abnormally long periods in retirement. At age 60,
women in Moldova are expected to live 18.2 years on average, equating to about 21.2 years in
retirement given a retirement age of 57 years; men are expected to live 14.3 years, about 12.3 years in
retirement given a retirement age at 62. The length of years in retirement is not that different from
other countries. Female workers in Moldova expect retirements of greater length than their
counterparts in Russia (21.2 vs. 19.9 years in retirement for women), and approach the OECD average
expected duration of retirement for women (22.3 years). However, male workers in Moldova on
average are already expected to have shorter retirements than their counterparts in Russia (12.3 vs.
13.0 years) and much shorter than the OECD average expected duration of retirement for men (17.6
years). In sum, increases in retirement age need to happen in parallel to efforts to increase life
expectancy, particularly among men.

Attitudes, social norms, and access to care
Negative attitudes toward employment among older workers may contribute to inactivity.
According to the ‘lump of labor’ fallacy, older workers occupy jobs that would otherwise be taken by

                                                                                                     77
younger workers, thereby reducing the total number of jobs available to younger people. Many
empirical studies have shown this argument to be false.195 Economies that add more workers do not,
as a rule, experience greater unemployment. Indeed, countries that encourage productive aging, high
female labor force participation, or immigration generally experience higher employment and more
overall economic activity among all age-groups. Although no data are available to determine the extent
to which such negative attitudes contribute to pushing older people out of the labor market in
Moldova, surveys in other European countries often point to such disadvantages among older workers
in looking for jobs.196

Social norms and lack of access to child and elder care may also limit employment rates for
women and older workers. LFS data suggest that caring responsibilities pull many younger people
out of the labor force, and many older workers time their exit from the labor force based on the care
needs of family members. Among younger workers, the share who are out of the workforce due to
caring responsibilities is large and has been rising rapidly, from about 5 percent in 2006 to about 22
percent by 2014.197 Although most retired workers do not report caring responsibilities as the primary
motivation for their labor force status, a substantial share of older respondents left their last job for
the sake of caring for family members: in 2006; about 12.7 percent of people who were not working
had left their last job for this reason.198 By 2014, the share had climbed to 17.0 percent.

The burden of providing family care leaves many women out of the labor market early in their
working lives. Women account for almost all of the recent increase in younger workers exiting the
labor force for the sake of family care. In 2014, 22.0 percent of women were out of the workforce to
care for family, compared with 1.2 percent among men (Figure 5.18). Women also spend more time
than men engaged in household and family care activities and are more likely than men to work only
part-time because of care responsibilities (Figure 5.19).199 These trends are likely to increase as the
population ages and in the absence of improvements in healthy aging. Because unequal care
responsibilities can lead to adverse health impacts, lower career advancement, and lower savings, the
increasing share of women exiting the labor force may jeopardize the economic security of both young
and older women.200



195   Gruber and Wise (2010); Knapp (2007).
196 Arias et al. (2014).
197 This trend is also apparent on the intensive margin of labor force participation: older people were less likely than younger people to

have missed work for the sake of caring for family members. In 2014, less than 1 percent of people over the age of 55 had worked less
than 40 hours during the preceding week for this reason, while this was true of more than 4 percent of younger workers. (Calculations
based on Labor Force Survey data.)
198 In 2006–14, less than 1 percent of people ages 55 or over were not working primarily because of family care responsibilities.
199 A time use survey conducted by the NBS in 2013 found that more than 96 percent of women ages 10 years and above were engaged

in household and family care activities and that these responsibilities accounted for an average of about 4 hours 50 minutes a day. About
83 percent of men reported engaging in household and family care responsibilities, which represented an average of about 1 hour 40
minutes a day less than women.
200 For example, part-time jobs are often chosen to balance family care responsibilities, leading to a double burden of work and family

responsibilities, which is much more common among women, even while such jobs usually pay less and are associated with fewer
benefits. Research has also found that this double burden is linked to an increase in health problems (Väänänen et al. 2005). Likewise,
that women are more often absent from work for the sake of family care can lead to a slower pace of advancement, disproportionately
reining in total lifetime income.

The migration of parents has left older people as the main caretakers of the children. Migrants
working abroad have left behind around 146,000 children (21 percent of all children) without one or
both parents.201 Grandparents, especially grandmothers, assume the role of the main caretakers in
most cases (91 percent if both parents are abroad, and 36 percent if one parent is abroad). 202 Overall,
it is common among households with migrant members for women to remain in the home to
undertake care responsibilities (Figure 5.20).

The research has highlighted the key role of older people in childcare and education if the parents of the children migrate for work
abroad. Older people also replace the parents as legal representatives of children, having guardianship or tutorship in 34.7 percent of
the multigenerational households affected by migration (HelpAge International and UNICEF 2010).

Risks to the economic security of the elderly: a longer-term view
Ensuring the economic security of the elderly will largely depend on the availability and
quality of employment among current workers. Continuous gains in productivity and participation
would bring the country closer to ensuring adequate economic security for the elderly. However, three
obstacles need to be addressed if the country is to meet its responsibilities to the future cohorts of
older people: the lack of overall job creation, the extensive informality, and the challenges associated
with migration.

Limited business creation and entrepreneurial activity
A focus on the constraints to raising living standards in an equitable and sustainable manner
highlights the urgency of creating jobs.203 Mitigating the effects of population aging and ensuring
that the elderly are economically secure require boosting job creation to encourage people to seek and
find good job opportunities locally that can improve their living conditions into old age and thus
facilitate the sustainability of the pension system. However, firms face many barriers to launching and
expanding operations and thereby sustainably create jobs. Firms providing employment are typically
larger and older, while younger firms are struggling, and fewer new firms have been launched since
the crisis.204 Six priorities emerge, including strengthening the rule of law and the accountability of

institutions, increasing the quality, equity, and relevance of education and training systems,
and improving the business regulatory framework.205

Entrepreneurial activity and business creation are likely restrained by slower population
growth and skills mismatch. In most of the Europe and Central Asia region, 18- to 34-year-olds
report the highest rate of start-up activity.206 In Moldova, this age-group has also enjoyed greater
opportunities to retrain and become acclimatized to the new business environment following the
economic transition. Nonetheless, firms face multiple constraints to becoming established and
expanding, which hinders job creation and entrepreneurship. In other economies experiencing
population aging, entrepreneurship and productivity have also tended to decline as the population
ages.207 Many older workers are at an even greater disadvantage in Moldova due to a mismatch between
their skills and the nature of most entrepreneurial activities. During the Soviet period, many workers
received specialist training, but few small businesses were established. Thus, many older people have
little personal experience with small entrepreneurial initiatives and lack information on the process of
starting up a business.208

Informality
Informality is a growing issue for young and older workers alike. Aside from public sector jobs,
workers ages 55 or older are substantially less likely to engage in formal employment, and this tendency
increases with age. In 2007, 28 percent of workers ages 55 or older were employed by businesses that
were not registered, in contrast to younger workers, of whom only 17 percent fit into this category.
Since then, work in unregistered companies has become more prevalent, especially among older
workers. By 2014, more than 34 percent of older people were employed in unregistered businesses.
This is particularly problematic for those who have no other sources of income for retirement apart
from noncontributory social protection transfers. Among people who do not pay into the pension
system because of informality or inactivity, such transfers will not protect them against poverty in old
age. In 2014, the share of the population under age 55 working in informal businesses increased to
25.4 percent (Figure 5.21). Informality and inactivity will leave many unprotected under the current
social protection system (chapter 6).

208 See Smallbone and Welter (2001). There is disagreement over whether this is the key reason for lower entrepreneurial activity among

older people in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Bussolo, Koettl, and Sinnott (2015) note survey evidence showing that lower rates of
entrepreneurship among the elderly in the region are not the result of a generational difference in attitudes toward entrepreneurship.
The share of individuals who agree that “starting a business is considered a good career choice” does not diminish after individuals
reach age 55, though the share who start a small business is much more modest among older workers than among younger workers.

Informality contributes to the unsustainability of the pension system. In 2014, nearly 94 percent
of workers in formal businesses reported receiving pension support from their employers, while
virtually no employees of informal businesses received such support. Overall, fewer than 30 percent
of the working-age population currently benefit from pension contributions by employers.209 Because
working for an informal business has become more common and inactivity rates have risen, the overall
prevalence of employer contributions to the pension system has declined since 2006, despite
remaining stable among employees of formal businesses.

                                                                ***

This chapter explores recent trends among the working-age population in Moldova with a
focus on older cohorts and highlighting both worrying and encouraging developments in the
labor market. On the negative side, labor force participation appears to be slowly deteriorating from
already low levels. Since 2000, the retired population has grown, and the share of workers choosing
to remain employed after the age of 54 has steadily declined. Low labor force participation among
younger generations is contributing not only to insufficient pension contributions, but also to the
deterioration of the pension system. Women are disproportionally inactive, and access to basic living
standards in retirement will be particularly challenging for these women who will lack access to
pension benefits. The past few years have also witnessed higher wage growth. Action is needed to
remove barriers and encourage greater participation, formality, and employment quality in coming
years, alongside significant efforts to boost employment creation.

6. SECURE AGING
Older people rely heavily on pension income. This chapter uses administrative and household survey data to examine the
type, size, and performance of social protection cash benefits and in-kind services in securing the social and economic
rights of the elderly in Moldova. It mainly uses a definition of elderly focusing on people ages 60 or above.210 This is
considered more relevant for the analysis.

A picture of the social protection system
Understanding the challenges to the economic security of the elderly calls for a review of the
social protection system. This section focuses on this review.

Social protection system expenditures
The country has an extensive social protection system, including a contributory social
insurance scheme, noncontributory social assistance benefits, and in-kind services for
vulnerable population groups. In 2014, spending on these programs represented 12.7 percent of
GDP, which is close to the regional average. Social insurance includes pensions, disability payments,
maternity benefits, and other benefits. This accounted for 10.4 percent of GDP in 2014, of which
pensions made up the largest share. Social assistance spending was 1.5 percent of GDP, and social
care services represented 0.8 percent of GDP (Figure 6.1).

The government spends generously on the old-age population. Public expenditure on social
protection for the elderly accounted for 8 percent of GDP in 2014. Although not exceptionally high,
this is comparable with the spending of some high-income European countries (Figure 6.2). Benefits

210Although the definition of an elderly person is often associated with the retirement age, which is 57 for women and 62 for men, this
chapter argues for a single standard retirement age. It therefore relies on a concept of the United Nations according to which the elderly
include any person ages 60 or above.

                                                                                                                                      83
and services for the elderly have accounted for almost two-thirds of the total social protection
expenditure in recent years, which demonstrates the high relative importance of this group of
beneficiaries in overall social protection policy (Figure 6.3).

Expenditure on the social insurance for the elderly is the largest spending item. It accounts for
7.3 percent of GDP, while social assistance and services account for much smaller shares (0.4 percent
of GDP each). Of the social insurance budget, 70 percent accrues to old-age beneficiaries; pensions
are the main type of cash support. Meanwhile, the elderly receive only a quarter of all social assistance
and almost half of all social service allocations (Table 6.1).

Pensions for the elderly
Public pensions are the main social protection program for seniors. Of the social protection
budget for the elderly, 90 percent goes to financing social insurance pensions of various types. The
elderly constitute about 90 percent of all social insurance beneficiaries (Table 6.2). Old-age pensions
are the most significant program in terms of expenditures (72 percent of the total old-age social
insurance expenditure) and coverage (77 percent of the population ages 60+).211 This is followed by
other types of pensions such as disability pensions and pensions of the military and other relatively
small groups of retirees who enjoy privileged treatment with relatively higher benefits. Another
significant item is the pension supplement introduced in 2013 for beneficiaries of lower pensions.
However, in comparison with the average wage, pension benefits are quite small: the wage-
replacement rate of 28 percent in Moldova is substantially lower than the corresponding rate in
comparable countries (Figure 6.4).

Social assistance for older people
While consuming a relatively small portion of the social assistance budget, the elderly are
spread across numerous safety net programs, many of which overlap. Social assistance
represents a narrow share of social protection spending on the elderly (4.5 percent in 2014) (Table
6.3). Most social assistance programs are based on entitlements, which crowds out the support for the
neediest households provided through poverty-targeted means-tested programs. Moreover, these are
relatively small cash transfers that overlap in terms of eligibility, thus increasing the fragmentation and
administrative cost of the social safety net. In each type of social assistance program, up to 1 percent
of the total social protection budget is spent on supporting the elderly. The largest individual
categorical benefit programs in terms of spending are monthly government allowances granted to
certain categories of beneficiaries, such as persons with disabilities and war veterans, and government
social allowances for people who do not qualify for pensions. The material aid program, which is also
relatively large in terms of budget expenditures and coverage, provides one-off benefits to people in
difficult circumstances without checking their welfare status. Between the two means-tested social
assistance transfers, that is, the Ajutor social benefit and the heating allowance, the latter
accommodates the largest share of the elderly and involves a sizable budget to compensate for the
increased cost of living over the five months of the cold season. This reflects a positive development
in the government’s social assistance reform that aims to shift resources from entitlement-based to
poverty-oriented cash transfers.

a. The elderly are also beneficiaries of other social insurance and assistance benefits. In the case of household benefits, the Ajutor social
benefit and the heating allowance, the percentage shows the ratio of individual beneficiaries ages 60+ to the population ages 60+.
b. Other allowances include special allowances for pension beneficiaries, allowances for people from certain villages of Moldova
bordering the Transnistria region, compensations to victims or inhabitants in the area of the Chernobyl accident, and others.

The categorical orientation of most social assistance benefits resulted in an entitlement-based
safety net with weak cost-effectiveness and poor equity performance. Because of the prevalence
of categorical transfers, the social assistance system insufficiently prioritizes the poorest of the elderly.
The policy objectives behind some cash transfers have nothing to do with poverty alleviation. Instead
of welfare status, their eligibility requirements consider societal merits (participation in military actions,
the Chernobyl disaster, and so on). At the same time, social assistance benefits are highly fragmented
and overlap in terms of objectives and beneficiaries. Despite being numerous, the social assistance
transfers contribute little to the welfare of seniors. This highlights the insufficient financial support
for the neediest beneficiaries and the weak administrative efficiency given the administrative costs
needed to pay many small social assistance benefits.

The government recently implemented reforms to deliver improved equity with the more
efficient targeting of social assistance. In 2009–12, it took a number of measures to reallocate
resources, increase the share of transfers targeting the poor, and contain categorical spending so the
reforms would be fiscally affordable. In 2009–11, it introduced two proxy means-tested cash benefit
programs, the Ajutor social benefit and the heating allowance. In 2012, it abolished a poorly targeted
program of nominative compensations to reduce overall social assistance spending. The heating
allowance program has emerged as the major safety net to mitigate the adverse poverty impact of
energy tariff increases. In the 2015/16 heating season, when residential energy tariffs rose, the program
scaled up to cover above 150,000 households, including about 100,000 households with elderly
members.


                                                                                                                                         87
However, more remains to be done to enhance the efficiency and equity of the social safety
net. By 2012, the reforms had yielded good equity and allocative efficiency results. However,
thereafter, the expansion of categorical benefits, including pension supplements, renewed the fiscal
pressures and crowded out the resources necessary for expanding means-tested benefits. The coverage
of benefits is still modest overall and in terms of the elderly. In 2014, the Ajutor social benefit
supported only 4 percent of all the households and 3 percent of households with elderly members,
and the heating allowance was received by 6 percent of all households and 10 percent of households
with elderly members. To be able to cover a larger number of the old-age poor with more meaningful
income support, the government should continue to consolidate multiple categorical benefits to
relocate resources to means-tested transfers. This would improve the allocative efficiency of the social
assistance system.

Social services (in-kind services) for the elderly
Apart from cash transfers, the poor and vulnerable are supported through in-kind services.
These social services include measures and activities to meet the social needs of individuals or
households in overcoming difficult circumstances and prevent marginalization and social exclusion
(box 6.1). They include primary, specialized, and highly specialized social services and are provided at
home, in the community, or at residential institutions.212 Expenditures on social services for the elderly
accounted for only 4.4 percent of total social protection expenditure to the elderly in 2014, with tiny
shares of spending on each type of service (table 6.4). Moreover, such services are financed not only
through social protection, but also from the health budget (for example, long-term care).

About half the expenditures go to nonresidential providers and are covered mostly by local
budgets. Many providers serve both the elderly and citizens with disabilities. Asylums and
rehabilitation centers are the largest consumers of the social service budget (see table 6.4). These are

residential institutions, funded by central or local budgets. At the same time, the share of various
nonresidential services reaches almost 50 percent of total expenditures that are covered by local
budgets. These are primary social services provided through homecare and community centers,
recently developed services of protected residence, community houses, mobile teams, and personal
assistance offered to people with disabilities and older people to support independent living (box 6.1).
Such alternative forms of care are not numerous yet but spreading. Donors/development partners
also finance some services. For instance, in 2014, they funded 26 out of 100 social service centers.

  so that recipients may live independently in an environment close to family.
  Other services and institutions. This group includes multifunctional centers and social canteens that provide free

Social services are evolving toward decentralized provision with a focus on beneficiaries and
their individual needs. Recognizing the challenge of bringing the provision of social care closer to
the beneficiaries, the government has developed a strategy for the decentralization of social services
that identifies the main issues of social care service development, as follows:

         Insufficient funding. Social care expenditures are below 1 percent of GDP. Coverage by
          social care services was estimated at 17 percent of the potential demand in 2011.213 Because of
          the aging population, the funding for social care of the elderly had to be doubled in 2015
          relative to the planned allocation.214 The decentralization of funding and provision of social
          care to local governments in 2015 may increase the risk of underfunding because poorer
          districts may face difficulties allocating resources for the services.
         Sporadic and fragmented social care service development. Social care services have
          evolved steadily, but unevenly. Local authorities who are in charge of service delivery tend to

2011. The potential demand for social care was estimated at 428,000.

Research, the Academy of Sciences, and the Ministry of Economy.

                                                                                                                                     89
          determine their social priorities ad hoc and are guided by the political agenda and particular
          interests of local administrative staff, the availability of external donor support, and so on.
          This has led to major differences in the spatial distribution of services across raioane (districts)
          with weak links between supply and demand. For instance, the regional distribution of social
          canteens, which is one of the most highly sought services among the elderly poor, does not
          correlate with the distribution of the elderly below the absolute poverty line.215
         Insufficient local capacity to manage service provision. Local social assistance
          departments lack the tools and skills to identify the specific needs of vulnerable groups and
          use that to plan the delivery of services. Furthermore, they have difficulty assessing the extent
          of social service delivery to meet the needs. Thus, local decision makers lack information to
          decide on service development priorities.

Secure aging in Moldova? Social protection and old-age poverty
Social protection transfers help protect the elderly in Moldova from old-age poverty. Without
social protection transfers, more than 60 percent of the elderly would belong to the first and poorest
quintile (table 6.5). After the receipt of social protection transfers, their share in the bottom quintile
declines to 23 percent. Similarly, before benefits, 73 percent of those in the first quintile are elderly,
while, after the benefits, the share of the elderly among the poorest 20 percent of the consumption
distribution of the population (the bottom 20) falls to 27 percent.

Almost all the elderly in the bottom quintile and 95 percent of the total elderly population are
covered by social protection transfers. Of the elderly in the bottom 20, 99 percent receive some
kind of social protection cash transfer (Table 6.6). This is higher than the overall coverage of the
population in the lowest (first) quintile (80 percent) and much higher than the coverage of the
nonelderly poor (41 percent of the nonelderly in the first quintile). Such extensive coverage results
from the large share of people receiving the old-age pension, which is also confirmed by administrative
data. Fewer than 10 percent of the elderly receive social assistance. Although more elderly than
nonelderly are covered by social assistance, elderly beneficiaries show similar representation across
income groups, including higher representation among the richest quintile (10.9 percent) than among
the poorest quintile (7.9 percent). This is an indication of the wide range of entitlement-based social
assistance benefits received by the elderly.

Overall, benefits reach the elderly in need. There are more recipients of social protection benefits
among the pretransfer elderly poor than among the nonelderly poor: 59 percent of beneficiaries among
the elderly are in the first (poorest) quintile, while only 49 percent of all beneficiaries of social
protection transfers are in the first quintile (Table 6.7). This beneficiary incidence derives from the
nearly universal coverage of old-age pensions. Nonetheless, the distribution of social assistance
benefits seems more progressive in the group of the elderly than in the total population or among the
nonelderly. Similarly, the distribution of social protection funds is more pro-poor among the elderly:
the bottom 20 percent of the elderly receive 60 percent of all social protection transfers, while, among
the total population, the share is 53 percent (Table 6.7). Because of the highly compressed pension
benefit structure, the distribution of social insurance funds among the elderly follows the distribution
of beneficiaries closely. This is not the case in social assistance, where 40 percent of the poorest

beneficiaries receive around two thirds of transfers. This is because the highly progressive means-
tested Ajutor Social benefit and the heating allowance accrue to the bottom 20 among the elderly at a
rate close to 40 percent.

Survey data confirm that the elderly are highly dependent on pensions. Almost 100 percent of
the elderly live in households that received pensions in 2014.216 Figure 6.5 shows that there was an
increase in pension dependence among the elderly, from 47.2 percent of total income in 2007 to 60.5
percent in 2014, thanks to an increase in pension value (by 53.8 percent in real terms). (Note that the
elderly are described differently in Figure 6.1 relative to the standard definition adopted in this chapter,

216   The coverage is similarly high among people of retirement age.

                                                                                                                           92
that is, ages 60+.) Pension dependence is particularly high among the poor elderly (69.3 percent).
Pensions have played an important role in reducing poverty among the elderly, although poverty
persists among elderly groups; pension increases account for a large share of the decline in poverty.217

Although the level of pensions is relatively low, the importance of pensions in the income of
the elderly poor is high. Among the elderly in the first quintile receiving the pension benefit, the
benefit generosity is 50.6, while, among the elderly in the second quintile, it is 24.8 (table 6.8). (Benefit
generosity indicates the share of the average transfer in the total welfare aggregate of the beneficiaries.)
Within the same quintile groups, the generosity of social protection benefits is higher among the
elderly than among the nonelderly, which testifies to the importance of pensions as an income source
among senior citizens. However, in social assistance, the relative importance of benefits appears higher
among the nonelderly than among the elderly across the entire consumption distribution.

Pension increases have favored pensioners in urban areas and nonagricultural sectors.
Agriculture pensioners accounted for 39.2 percent of all old-age pensioners in 2014, while the share
of all old-age pensioners was only 2.5 percent in Chisinau, compared with 52.0 percent in the south.
As a result, the share of pensioners receiving the minimum pension was highest in the center of the
country, while the corresponding share in the south was increasing (Figure 6.6, panel a). Moreover, in
line with the wage gap, the average pension among workers in agriculture is 78 percent of the pension
among nonagricultural workers. While the latter saw improvement, the former stagnated in real terms
(Figure 6.6, panel b). This led to a higher average pension in urban areas, where most pensioners were
nonagricultural workers.

Social protection transfers and especially pensions affect poverty rates among the elderly.
Table 6.9 shows how the poverty indicators would change in the absence of each transfer. Without
social protection benefits, the poverty rate would have been 3 times higher, and it would have
increased by a factor of 6 among the elderly. For the elderly, old-age pension plays an important role
for living standards. Social assistance transfers are more important as a poverty coping mechanism
among the nonelderly. Without the safety net, the poverty headcount in this group would have
increased by 1 percentage point. It is worth noting the role of remittances in reducing poverty.

Challenges facing the social protection system
The government will have to rethink policy objectives to balance affordability and the scope
of social protection for the elderly. While the old-age social protection cost is sizable, pension
benefits, the largest spending item, are relatively small and do not provide high levels of poverty
protection. As population aging progresses, the government will have to respond to the crucial issues
of how to spend limited public resources and what it expects social protection spending to achieve
through the combination of benefits and services.

The pension system faces many challenges that increase the risk of old-age poverty for the
current and future generations. These are outlined in the Moldova 2020 National Development
Strategy and discussed in research papers.218 The pension system is vulnerable to imbalances because
of the aging population: current trends will lead to an increasingly large retired population that will
depend on transfers from a shrinking domestic workforce.

First, social insurance contribution coverage has declined over the years and remains limited.
The ratio of contributors to the population ages 15–64 has declined because of low labor force
participation, relatively high informality, and migration. After plummeting in the last 15 years,
contribution coverage is only slightly above 30 percent (figure 6.7).

The pension system dependency ratio is rising. The shrinking contributor base, in combination
with the high number of pensioners, is driving the system dependency ratio up. The ratio is projected
to rise from the current 0.8 pensioners per contributor to 1.0 pensioner per contributor by 2020
because of the aging demographic pattern (figure 6.8).

Second, the pension benefit coverage of the elderly is expected to decline, thereby amplifying
the poverty risk for those left outside pension insurance. Pension benefit coverage is high now,
but will narrow because of the low participation in social insurance (Figure 6.9) given high inactivity
and informality. This will leave a growing number of elderly outside the social insurance pension
system (Figure 6.11) and increase the risk of income insecurity. The new challenge of providing
pension coverage for farmers emerged in 2009 when their social insurance became voluntary. As a
result, 99 percent of farmers who contributed in 2008 opted out of the social insurance system. Apart
from the poverty risk, voluntary participation of individual farmers may lead to a locked-in effect in
farming, an incomplete service-coverage period for those shifting to another occupation, and more
informal employment in agriculture. Those left outside the pension insurance will need to be
supported through noncontributory social assistance schemes that currently cover only a small share
of the elderly.

Third, the low and deteriorating pension benefit replacement rate exacerbates the risk of
poverty among those covered by the pension system. The level of pension benefits relative to
wages is low and declining (Figure 6.10). In 2014, the average old-age pension was about 27 percent
of gross wages, which was among the lowest gross replacement rates in Eastern Europe and Central

                                                                                                                                97
Asia. According to the NBS, the average monthly pension for pensioners registered with the social
security institution (the majority of pensioners) was MDL 1020.6 in 2014, which was equivalent to 81
percent of the national poverty line or $3.70 a day (2005 purchasing power parity). Almost 20 percent
of pensioners received only the minimum pension of around MDL 700–MDL 800.

The average replacement rate is projected to decrease steadily from 28 percent to almost 13 percent
by 2047. While, in 1995, the pension formula yielded a gross replacement rate of 44.9 percent, the
changes introduced in the pension formula in 1998 pushed the replacement rate down. After 1999,
the salaries used to calculate the salary base in the formula were not revalued (valorized) to account
for cumulative growth in the average wage between the moment when the salary was earned and the
date of retirement. If the current pension system is not reformed, the gap between earnings and
pensions will grow and the system will not be socially sustainable.

Fourth, the cost of the public pension system is growing and requires general government
revenues to bridge the fiscal gap. In 1999, pension outlays accounted for 4.4 percent of GDP, and,
in 2014, they reached 7.5 percent of GDP. Contribution revenues fell short in covering the growing
pension costs, which opened a gap of 10 percent in the social insurance expenditures covered by the
government budget.

Fifth, the preferential treatment of some groups of retirees makes the system inequitable.
Special pension beneficiaries such as civil servants, judges, prosecutors, members of the government
and Parliament and others account for 11 percent of the total number of old-age pensioners. The cost
of these special pensions represents about 13 percent of overall pension outlays. Despite several
changes adopted recently to converge the rules for accruing special and regular pensions, the number
of such pension entitlements should be reduced again to lower their cost and improve equity.

A range of reform measures are required to help address the many challenges, and ensure that
the right to social security is fulfilled. Recently undertaken parametric reforms of the public
pension system, along the lines proposed and discussed in the next section, could help address the
looming risk of old-age poverty among people covered by pension insurance. At the same time, given
the high informality in the economy, the low labor market participation rates, and the large agricultural
sector, ensuring universal pension insurance coverage is likely to be challenging. Therefore, the
government would have to consider ways to consolidate public finances to use general revenues to
protect senior citizens not covered by pension insurance. An efficient and equitable social assistance
system would be one means to this end. Finally, the ten human rights elements for a social protection
system described in chapter 3, could guide reforms to ensure that people realize their right to social
security.

7. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The demographic dynamics of Moldova and other countries in the region do not have to
impose negative socioeconomic burdens. First, the demographic profile is not fixed. While fertility
rates and emigration trends may be difficult and slow of change, improvements in old-age mortality
can slow the reduction in the population. Second, progress on improving the low health status and
the high disability rate among older people can allow them to work longer, hence becoming
contributors rather than dependent on the economy. Third, the quality of the workforce matters (for
example, their educational attainment). Investments in education throughout the life cycle, taking
advantage of the decreasing share of school-age children in the population, are important in raising
the stock of human capital.

In Moldova, the fast pace of aging requires institutions to adapt quickly to the needs of the
aging population. The low fertility rates and brisk emigration rates mean that the aging process is
happening much more rapidly in Moldova than in other countries that are more advanced in the aging
process, such as countries in Western Europe. Major social and policy adjustments are needed to adapt
to a future society made up of more than 20 percent of elderly, a reality in coming decades. Changes
in population age structure involve changes in the overall structure of social needs. The government
needs to create the conditions to support the welfare and rights of an increasing proportion of older
people in the population.

Older people in Moldova, this report finds, face many challenges to maintaining a productive,
healthy, and secure life in older age. There is scope to enhance the health behaviors and the health
care system to advance healthy longevity. The current low educational quality and labor engagement
will have serious short-, medium- and long-term implications. The low access to and quality of
education will not only affect the earning capacity of the population and the savings people accumulate
to sustain their livelihoods in old age, but, in an aging context, also lower the growth of the human
capital stock able to sustain economic growth. As an increasing share of the population is inactive or
working informally, the number of pensioners will outpace the growth in the number of contributors,
undermining the sustainability of the pension system and the main income source on which the
government currently relies to fund old-age security programs.
These challenges to a productive, health and secure life suggest that while Moldova has
signed and ratified many of the international and regional treaties involving human rights
(chapter 3), implementation gaps remain. Addressing these challenges require a multipronged
approach with a human rights-based approach at the center tackling the multiple risks that negatively
impact the socioeconomic conditions of older people. Concerns about the economic and social
welfare of older people should be mainstreamed into the overall policy framework, in addition to
policies that target the older population.

Changing law and policy to reflect a shift in population dynamics is not a simple undertaking.
States must take bold and well-informed steps to protect people equally. Doing so requires a revision
in strategies to enable all people to enjoy their human rights, alongside adequate monitoring and

                                                                                                    99
evaluation by setting indicators and benchmarks to implement the strategies. These indicators,
especially if well disaggregated to capture the lives of older people, can begin to tell the story of the
positive development of the implementation of human rights. The use of human rights–based
approaches to change policies can help ensure outcomes in policy changes that respect, protect, and
fulfill human rights.219 The approaches emphasize participation, inclusion, and equality, especially for
marginalized groups, and create dynamics of accountability.220

There is a need to develop and implement policies that create an enabling environment for
the current and future older populations. The following sections provide broad policy
recommendations to realize equal rights in Moldova in the economic security of older people. The
recommendations focus on policies to promote healthy, productive, and secure aging, as well as
complementary policies to strengthen the human rights–based lens. Many of these proposed policy
actions are not only relevant or targeted toward the elderly, but are systemic in nature given the
challenges of the country.

As recommended policies are further detailed and refined, it is critical that they maintain the
human rights lens so as to fulfill obligations towards older people. Specifically, a human rights
based approach should be guided by the following principles: universality, participation and inclusion,
equality and non-discrimination, transparency and accountability, as well as sustainability. Throughout
the chapters of these reports, it is clear that challenges remain to uphold these principles in practice
in Moldova.

Policies to promote healthy aging
Promoting healthy aging calls for ensuring affordable and accessible health care to all older people, as
well as the provision of affordable, good-quality medicines to treat NCDs.221 As explained in chapter
3, national legislation in Moldova guarantees the right to equal opportunity to obtain timely, good-
quality health care through the compulsory health insurance system, which includes the right to health
care free from discrimination in the health system for older Moldovans. However, serious health
related challenges remain.

Moldova’s current reform agenda attempts to address many of these challenges , and these
efforts should be sustained:

     The National Health Insurance Agency recently revised the benefits package by increasing the
      reimbursement rate for antihypertension medications from 50 percent to 70 percent. While this
      change will certainly lower costs faced by patients, the 30 percent co-pay will likely still deter
      adequate drug adherence because the benefits package is primarily comprised of branded drugs
      (as opposed to generics) and because any positive cost can depress usage and increase
      hospitalizations.222

219 See, for example, Ekwall and Rosales (2009).
220 UNFPA and Harvard School of Public Health (2010).

222 Baicker, Mullainathan, and Schwartzstein (2015).


                                                                                                     100
   The Ministry of Health is currently revising the existing pay-for-performance scheme in primary
    care to provide stronger incentives among primary care physicians to improve the management of
    chronic disease.
   Sweeping tobacco control legislation came into effect in July 2015 that prohibits smoking in
    workplaces and public places; bans tobacco advertising, promotions, and sponsorships; prohibits
    the sale of menthol cigarettes and misleading language such as use of the word “light”; and
    mandates graphic warning labels that cover at least 65 percent of the front and back of cigarette
    packets.
   A number of upcoming reforms aim to improve the efficiency of public spending, which should
    free up resources to expand the benefits package, such as using the diagnostic-related group
    method for payments rather than simply accounting, the introduction of performance-based
    payments in hospitals, bringing all public hospitals in Chisinau under shared management, and
    consolidating hospitals across the country. Hospital reforms have been launched, for instance, to
    make hospitals more efficient and reduce overcapacity of hospital beds and avoid duplication of
    services.

The role of the primary health care system is crucial in supporting the aging population and
in preventing the spread of NCDs early on through preventive measures and public health
services. Given the high prevalence of NCDs across age-groups, disease prevention from early ages
is a cost-effective way to improve health outcomes among the population, including the future older
population. Efforts are being made in carrying out regular checkups for early detection of high blood
pressure and hypertension, blood sugar and diabetes, and so on. Nevertheless, more investments
should be focused on quality of primary care, disease prevention and NCD prevention drugs. The
focus of primary health care also should be on strengthening and advancing skills and knowledge on
the diseases of old age. Among public health measures to be rendered at the primary health care level,
there should be a serious effort to maintain campaigns on the harm of tobacco and alcohol
consumption, the main risk factors in an overwhelming number of the NCDs that ultimately shorten
the healthy life of people.

While these reforms could improve service delivery and decrease financial burdens for all age-
groups, their aims suggest that the current aging and older populations, in addition to those
who will be occupying their place in future generations, should disproportionately benefit. The
prevalence of hypertension and other chronic diseases increases with age, as does spending on
medication. Making services and medication more affordable may also reduce the income gradients
observed throughout the life cycle in service usage and drug adherence.

Importantly, the reform process should strive for achieving and sustaining the
complementarity and synergy among key health sector reforms, such as introduction of
performance financing for primary and hospital care; rationalization and optimization of health
networks; and increased accountability and autonomy for providers.




                                                                                                  101
As these critical foundational reforms in the health system are implemented, additional ones
need to be considered to respond to the needs of the older population. These include (i)
reforming long-term health care services (among the social services provided under the social
protection system) in a way that balances financing, affordability, and fiscal sustainability,223 and (ii)
tackling discrimination in access to health care and informing older people of their rights. On the
latter, as explained in chapter 3, the awareness on the rights for access and utilization of healthcare
services has been low, especially amongst older adults, contributing to disparities in accessing health
services and pharmaceuticals and increasing the economic insecurity of the elderly.



Policies to promote productive aging
Creating more formal jobs and increasing productivity are necessary to sustaining growth and
progress toward the economic security of older people in Moldova. Policies that encourage
greater employment both among working-age people and among people over the current retirement
age are essential.224 Effective policies that successfully increase employment among older workers and
the current generation of working-age people would improve on the status quo through two channels:
(1) increasing wage incomes and (2) increasing the tax and pension contribution payments that are
required to provide the services government is legally obligated to deliver.

        Boosting entrepreneurship, business and job creation, and formality. Creating more and
better jobs is the main pathway for increasing the living standards of the population, including older
people. Economy-wide policies that boost economic opportunities for all and promote firm growth
and job creation should be part of the broad policy agenda to increase living standards and mitigate
the pressures of an aging society.225 Companion reports (World Bank, 2016b and 2017) explore in
more detail the barriers to job creation in Moldova, with priority policy areas being (1) strengthening
the rule of law and the accountability of institutions, particularly to unlock the main constraint
identified to firm growth and job creation, (2) improving the efficiency and equity of service delivery,
for an enabling environment for firms and individuals to access better economic opportunities across
Moldova and particularly in rural areas, and (3) increasing the quality, equity, and relevance of
education and training systems, so that Moldovans may become well prepared to access productive
jobs.
        Investing in education throughout the life cycle, with an additional focus on lifelong
learning to retool the skills of older workers. Lifelong learning can improve productivity and
flexibility among all workers. But especially for workers that are unable to continue in physically
strenuous positions, additional education can improve access to jobs in new sectors. In countries
undergoing demographic transitions as pervasive as the demographic transition Moldova, increasing
access to adult education is an essential part of helping older workers retrain. Changing attitudes to

                                                                                                      102
encourage older people to view education as an alternative later in life is also key to the success of
lifelong learning policies.
        Supporting greater access to formal child and elder care facilities. As a large share of
women exit the labor force to provide family care, supporting greater access to affordable, good-
quality formal child and elder care facilities is one approach to reducing the barriers to paid work that
asymmetrically affect women (mothers and grandmothers), while also supporting older people in need.
Evidence from other countries in the region can be useful in informing these efforts. 226 These policy
can have further positive long-term effects through promoting early childhood development.
        Reducing disincentives in the social protection system to (formal) work. This includes
gradually raising retirement ages for both men and women, which can promote longer working lives
and thus higher economic security through savings and pension contributions. Increasing the
retirement age, currently low particularly for women (the mandatory retirement age for women is 57),
would encourage greater labor force participation among older workers and reduce the projected
imbalances in revenue and payments. In addition, this envisages changes in the pension benefit
formula to reinstall wage valorization and strengthen the link between contributions and benefits.
        Tackling discrimination in the labor market. Given that age is the most important
perceived factor hindering access to job opportunities in many countries in the region, fighting
discrimination in the workplace through, for example, awareness campaigns and providing
information to people on their rights, can help open up opportunities for older people in the labor
market and contribute to upholding fundamental conventions of the ILO related to discrimination.227
Policies to promote secure aging
Ensuring adequate protection of older people calls for reforming social protection systems.
Parametric reforms of the public pension system could help address looming old-age poverty risks for
those covered by pension insurance. The pension benefits would be modest though, and people would
have to work longer.

Recommendations for reforms aim to create a fiscally and socially sustainable PAYG pillar.
This should include the following: (1) introducing valorization of past earnings in the pension formula,
along with adequate indexation and lower accrual rates; (2) gradually equalizing the retirement age to
62 and then increasing it for both sexes to 65. These measures will allow a sharp decline in the
replacement rate to be avoided and a fiscal balance for most of the modeled period to be preserved
(figure 7.1).228

Note: The parametric reforms to a PAYG system imply the following: (i) introducing wage valorization of past earnings and switching
to inflation indexation of the pension benefit, (ii) reducing the accrual rate to 1.12 percent, and (iii) gradually equalizing the retirement
age to 62 and then increasing it to 65 for both sexes. All reforms are launched in 2016 in the simulation exercise.


The Government followed the recommendations in the pension reform law adopted in late
2016. In December 2016, the country adopted the law that re-installs valorization of past earnings,
increases the retirement age and equalizes it for men and women, and introduces a number of other
important changes that would help improve pension benefits replacement rate, strengthen linkages
between contributions and revenues and increase long-term pension system sustainability. Some of
the adopted measures such as valorizing the existing pensions, allowing early retirement without
decreasing benefits, however, may prove costly and require additional transfers from the general
budget.

Choosing the right set of policies for those not in the contributory pension system requires
several considerations. As pension coverage decreases, a growing number of older people will find
themselves outside the contributory pension system and will run the risks of old-age income insecurity.
These will need to be supported through noncontributory schemes that currently cover only 1 percent
of retirees. The retirement age increase would help extend the contribution period required to qualify
for pension that is 31 years for men and 30 years for women and keep the number of those not eligible
for insurance pension low in the coming 15 years. However, their number will grow quickly thereafter
and become significant in 2050–60.

Ensuring universal old-age benefit coverage is a challenging task. International experience does
not offer a best practice solution for covering informal sector workers and individual farmers: they
either avoid paying contributions if the system is mandatory or avoid participating if it is voluntary.

consistent for all workers, improves its transparency and labor flexibility, and may reduce
informality.229 Others have instituted a universal citizen pension as the main old-age-income support
scheme.230

The merits of universal coverage must be weighed against fiscal impact, potential negative
incentive effects, and the administration costs of various income support schemes. Table 7.1
summarizes the outputs of an analysis of several options for noncontributory old-age income support
schemes. The analysis discussed in detail in annex B considers running the current program of social
pensions (social allowances) to cover a growing share of the uninsured population versus a universal
citizen pension scheme paid to all older people at a threshold age, according to different benefit levels,
indexation regimes, and transition paths. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the level of the benefit
and the fiscal cost of the program.

The current social pension program pays low benefits, and running it into the future does not imply
high costs. However, the low benefits increase the risk of income insecurity among large cohorts of
future older people. Yet, higher benefits not only require more money, but also reduce the incentives
to participate in the contributory pension scheme. Citizen pensions bear less disincentives as they
cover both the insured and the uninsured with the same, relatively small benefit. As with social
pensions, administration of this universal benefit is relatively simple. However, the fiscal cost of such
a scheme could be quite high. Moreover, this would not be the most efficient solution, as more well
off older people would also receive a pension. A means-tested benefit would be more cost effective
at achieving a similar poverty impact at lower cost. However, means testing implies higher
administrative costs than the entitlement-based scheme, but it generates an exclusion error that would
significantly increase the old-age poverty risk. Therefore, the analysis summarized in Table 7.1 does
not consider the option of supporting older people solely through a means-tested program.




229 Most Central and Eastern European countries decided to integrate individual farmers in the single pension scheme with mandatory
participation. A form of voluntary participation exists in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania (only for low-income earners). In
Latvia, farmers can obtain only the minimum pension in the pension system. In Slovenia, low-income farmers can opt out of the general
pension scheme. In Belgium, Finland, Poland, and Spain, a separate mandatory pension scheme has been established for farmers. In
most such schemes, the government has to cofinance the contributions, usually on a matching basis.
230 Economies in the Europe and Central Asia region that have chosen universal pensions include Albania, Georgia, and Kosovo.

Albania and Georgia had a compressed benefits structure before introducing social pensions. Georgia set the universal basic pension as
the main old-age income support scheme. Albania and Kosovo’s models are different as they include an earnings -related component,
in addition to the social pensions.

There is no preferred solution as each scheme has its pros and cons. The analysis is meant to
demonstrate key parameters to be considered in designing the program and how these affect the costs
and adequacy of benefits. Which conclusions can be drawn from a comparison of the two programs
concerned? At the same level of benefit, social pensions generate lower cost as they have a smaller
beneficiary group than the universal pension. However, social pensions create disincentives to

                                                                                                                     106
contribute to a PAYG system if their level approximates some of the contributory pension benefits.
Because of universal coverage, citizen pensions are costlier. Paid on top of the PAYG pensions, they
yield better benefit adequacy for the insured older people. In both programs, indexation defines
benefit adequacy in the long run. Although price indexation allows program costs to be contained, it
may make benefits socially unsustainable. At the same time, indexing by wage growth is a generous
policy that increases fiscal pressure. One may consider a flexible indexing approach whereby the
benefits would be adjusted at least with inflation to preserve their purchasing power and would be
revised more generously in the years of high economic growth. In terms of a transition to the new
scheme, introducing benefits only for new retirees does cut much of the cost of universal benefits
because, in the early years of the program, the number of beneficiaries would remain low.

As the population ages, the demand for social care services will grow, which makes it
important to address the bottlenecks in efficient delivery. The strategy for the decentralization
of social services sets the right objectives, but is unclear on the means to achieve the objectives. For
instance, the strategy calls for establishing a system of social service needs assessment at the local level
to underpin service delivery planning. To be able to apply this, local governments and their social
protection units would have to expand and develop their scarce institutional capacities.

To become effective service purchasers, local governments should develop capacities to carry
out the following:
    Assess local social care needs and barriers to implementation of national policy priorities on
       the ground. This would require strengthening the current methodology for social service needs
       assessment to capture the needs not covered by current service providers.
    Develop multiyear local social service commissioning plans based on local needs assessment.
    Commission services against local strategic plans by contracting out services to various
       providers, including nongovernmental organizations, and conclude multiyear agreements with
       providers of long-term care.
    Implement, delegate, or outsource case management so that the service options are chosen in
       the client’s best interest rather than in the interest of the service providers.

Service providers should have stronger legal and financial autonomy. Most providers are funded
directly from local budgets and have no incentive to improve the quality of services or to use the
money efficiently. They would have to enter into contractual relations with local governments rather
than enjoying direct and automatic funding. This would strengthen their responsibility for the efficient
use of funds. Moreover, this would make the facilities more flexible in managing their budgets.

Furthermore, the strategy rightly points to the need for an adequate financing mechanism of
social care services that would ensure that local governments have the resources to deliver the
services. Rural, less well developed, and resource-constrained regions may fall short in seeking to
cover the service needs of the population. To mitigate this risk, the strategy suggests that the financing
of a standard package of social services be mandatory, including through central government transfers.
It is important that the main needs of older people are included in this standard package, for instance,

                                                                                                        107
long-term care for people with severe disabilities. The national government is also limited in what it
can transfer for the provision of social care. Therefore, private co-funding mechanisms should be
developed to differentiate fees based on the support needs and the welfare status of recipient
households.

The Ministry of Labor, Social Protection, and Family will need to strengthen its role as a
policy maker. This should include developing a clear set of broad, national-level mid-term priorities
in social care policy, along with result indicators, as well as setting up structures for service quality
management. National social care priorities and respective resource allocations should be coordinated
with a broader agenda in social inclusion, social cohesion, and social security. These strategic
benchmarks would be used for (1) negotiations on the resource envelope with local governments for
the implementation of social care functions and (2) the development of local social inclusion strategies
and social service commissioning plans.

Cross-cutting policies
Beyond the sectoral policies described, there are other complementary efforts that can help promote
economic security of older people and strengthen the human rights–based lens in Moldova, as follows:

           Census data: finalizing the processing and publication of the results of the 2014 census is
            critical to informing the agenda. Getting more recent estimates of the country’s demographic
            profile will provide a more accurate picture of current challenges. Timely and careful planning
            of the 2021 census should be undertaken once the work on the 2014 round is completed.
           Promoting the use of disaggregated data: Datasets and surveys should disaggregate data
            by groups defined by age, gender, ethnicity, for people with disabilities and others, to allow
            for proper monitoring of outcomes by group. Regarding data by age, it is relevant to compile
            and report that for higher age groups (up to and beyond the age of 100), which will become
            more relevant as challenges related to low life expectancy are tackled. Aggregation of all people
            over a certain age cannot provide policy makers with the information they need to make
            informed decisions. For example, it is reasonable to expect that the gender inequalities in
            unpaid work continue in later life. Time use surveys should include people over age 64.231
           Monitoring and reporting: Many of Moldova’s laws are in line with human rights. What
            remains is for their intentions to be realized through implementation and monitoring. They
            need to be monitored at the national level and reported on, along with the government’s duty
            to respect, protect, and fulfill all of its human rights obligations. The value of the reporting
            process is truly national and it can be assessed by how well it helps improve the lives of the
            persons for which governments are responsible.232
           Bilateral agreements for portable social protection: The government has created bilateral
            agreements for the portability of social protection across some countries. It should initiate

             additional bilateral agreements to make its social protection portable and allow Moldovan
             migrant workers to transport retirement payments back to Moldova, too.
            Awareness of entitlements: Ensure awareness of rights. As discussed above, it is critical to
             ensure that older people have the necessary information about their rights in access to health,
             labor markets, social security and others, particularly as reforms are implemented. In Moldova,
             for instance, in a survey of 500 grandparents caring for grandchildren, fewer than one
             grandparent in 10 had information about state provisions such as childcare services and free
             medical insurance.233

ANNEX B
Elderly income support: options for a noncontributory scheme to reduce risk of poverty and
income insecurity

The estimates in this annex feature the cost (as percentage of GDP) and the adequacy (the replacement
rate) of various noncontributory (that is, financed from general revenues) benefit schemes to support
the retirees not covered by contributory pensions. They assume parametric that changes in the PAYG
system have been introduced.

Option 1: Social pensions paid to people not covered by the social insurance scheme. This option
describes the existing program of social allowances paid to people who do not qualify for contributory
pensions. The law sets the benefit level at 15 percent of the minimum old-age pension. In 2013, the
government introduced a supplement of MDL 100. The benefit and supplement together yield the
replacement rate of about 5 percent of the average wage.

The suboptions below simulate the cost of running the scheme at different benefit levels, assuming
the benefit is paid at the age of 65.

1.1    The current replacement rate of 5 percent is applied to set the benefit at retirement, which is
       then indexed by inflation.
1.2    The benefit is maintained at a 5 percent replacement rate (indexed by wage growth).
1.3    The benefit is set at a 10 percent replacement rate and price indexed.
1.4    The benefit is maintained at a 10 percent replacement rate.

As figure B.1 demonstrates, running the current scheme in the future while applying price indexation
would not require significant resources: it would cost 0.4 percent of GDP in the long run. Yet, because
of the indexation pattern, the replacement rate under suboption 1.1 goes down to 1 percent. Fixing
the replacement rate at 5 percent for the entire retirement period (suboption 1.2) would increase the
cost of the scheme above 1 percent of GDP. Both options, however, offer quite low benefit adequacy,
which seriously jeopardizes the economic security of a growing number of the elderly. Therefore, we
also consider suboptions with higher benefit levels.

Figure B.2 simulates the outputs of setting the benefit at a 10 percent replacement rate under two
indexation suboptions. Even if set twice as high as at the current level, the benefit replacement rate
deteriorates over time in the case of price indexation, which makes the cost of suboption 1.3 similar
to that of suboption 1.1 (0.8 percent of GDP). The small number of beneficiaries in the early years of
the simulation period levels out the initial cost of the program. Maintaining the benefit at a 10 percent
replacement rate through the entire simulation period significantly increases the cost of the program,
which may reach 3 percent of GDP. This puts substantial pressure on public expenditure. Another
drawback of suboption 1.4 is that, because of low density and participation, many future beneficiaries
of contributory pensions would receive the pension benefit at the same level of a 10 percent
replacement rate. This would reduce incentives to contribute and would be perceived as socially unfair
to pay more or less the same benefit as those people who worked and contributed and those who did
not. Therefore, further analysis considers a universal pension benefit (also known as a citizens pension
or demogrant) paid to all senior citizens of a certain age.

                                                                                                                   121
Option 2: Citizens pension is a universal flat benefit paid to people ages 65 years or over, regardless
of their participation in the contributory pension scheme.234 For insured people, such a benefit would
add to the contributory pension and increase the overall old-age income support. This would address
the issue of incentives and social unfairness mentioned with suboption 1.4. The citizens pension would
replace the current minimum pension, thus reducing the liabilities of the insurance pension scheme.
Similarly to option 1, the suboptions below describe various benefit levels and indexation patterns. In
addition, they simulate two transition paths to the new scheme, such as paying the benefit to all old-
age beneficiaries or only to the new ones.

2.1     The benefit is set at a 5 percent replacement rate, indexed to inflation, and paid to all retirees
(existing and new).
2.2     The benefit is maintained at a 5 percent replacement rate and paid to all retirees.
2.3     The benefit is maintained at a 5 percent replacement rate and paid to new beneficiaries.
2.4     The benefit is set at a 10 percent replacement rate, indexed to inflation, and paid to all retirees.
2.5     The benefit is maintained at a 10 percent replacement rate and paid to all retirees.
2.6     The benefit is maintained at a 10 percent replacement rate and paid to new beneficiaries.

In suboptions 2.1, the citizens pension of noninsured beneficiaries shows the same pattern as in
suboption 1.1 (see figure B.1). Introducing this benefit for all the existing elderly would cost about 1
percent of GDP, and the cost would remain at this level during the entire projection period (figure
B.3). Such a low and deteriorating benefit level would not add much to the PAYG pension; so the
combined replacement rate of the insured pensioners would be similar to the contributory pension
rate. Maintaining the replacement rate at 5 percent (suboption 2.2) gradually raises the cost of the
scheme from 1 percent to 3 percent of GDP. To reduce the initial cost of the scheme while there is
still few elderly not covered by contributory pensions, the benefit may be introduced for new retirees
only, as envisaged in suboption 2.3. However, as the scheme matures, the cost of suboptions 2.2 and
2.3 converge (figure B.3). The constant replacement rate in options 2.2 and 2.3 increases the combined
replacement rate for the insured individuals from 30 percent to 35 percent in the long run.

  The retirement age to qualify for the citizens pension is usually about five years higher than in the contributory scheme. Therefore,
234

when the regular retirement age reaches 65, the citizens pension age could be raised.

Policy makers are discussing a similar policy measure, that is, turning the current pension supplement
of MDL 180 into what would be, in effect, a universal pension benefit for all old-age pensioners.
While insured pensioners would maintain a relatively adequate replacement rate (not similar to their
current insurance pension rate though), for the increasing number of elderly not covered by the
contributory scheme, the rate is quite unsustainable in social terms, which exacerbates the risk of old-
age income insecurity.

A replacement rate of 10 percent of the average wage looks more acceptable, but it may decline to 2.5
percent over time as price indexation applies in suboption 2.4 (see figure B.2). In this suboption, even
though the value of the citizens pension is declining, because of the growing number of beneficiaries,
the cost of the program remains at 1.5–2.0 percent of GDP over the entire simulation period (figure
B.4). A reduction in the replacement rate of the citizens pension does not affect much the insured
individuals; as in the reformed PAYG pillar, their replacement rate stays at the range of 29–35 percent.

Maintaining the replacement rate at 10 percent would require substantial public funding that would
grow to 6 percent of GDP as the number of citizens pension beneficiaries increases (see suboption
2.5 at figure B.4). While this suboption promises a replacement rate of 32–41 percent for the recipients
of contributory pensions, its fiscal cost is hardly affordable. Paying the benefits to new retirees
(suboption 2.6) reduces the initial level of spending. Over time, however, the expenses become similar
to those of option 2.5. Containing the cost would require reduced benefit generosity.
