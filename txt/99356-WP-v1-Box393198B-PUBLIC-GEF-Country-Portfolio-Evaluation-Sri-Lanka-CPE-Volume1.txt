            “Joint GEF/Sri Lanka Country Portfolio Evaluation: (1991–2012),
                                     VOLUME 1 -
                                    Main Report”

       THE EXPLANATORY NOTE

       The Operational Focal Point for Global Environment Facility (GEF) in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of
       Environment and Renewable Energy, focuses on two main fundamental documents giving guidelines
       and directions in achieving its mandates. Those are called:

           1. The National Environment Policy (NEP) – Policy Guidelines
           2. The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) – called the “Haritha Lanka Program” – for
              Strategies and Actions in Environment Management and Conservation

       Currently, necessary actions have been taken to align the above two documents with the “ Mahinda
       Chintana” and to it concurrent versions which depicts the National Development Policy Framework of
       the country up to year 2020. Because of this alignment, it has been possible to integrate environmental
       concerns into the National Development Policy Framework thereby guide the development activities of
       the country towards Sustainable Development Pathway.

       Furthermore, the NEP and NEAP are now in the process of being updated through a comprehensive
       participatory approach. In this endeavor, the current environment challenges and issues have been
       identified and appropriate strategies and actions are been identified through a holistic approach in-
       order to overcome those challenges and issues. For this process, members of public and private sector,
       members of NGO community, Concerned Individuals, University Academia etc have been called upon
       and their expertise ideas and comments have been taken into consideration for the updating process.
       Therefore, horizontal as well as Vertical collection and integration of ideas have been captured in
       formulating current NEP and NEAP ensuring ownership to all stakeholders.

       Because of the crosscutting and cross sectoral nature of the field of Environment Management, when
       updating the NEAP, all policies, cooperative plans, strategies and action plans of all stakeholding
       agencies pertaining to Biodiversity Conservation, Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation, Soil
       Conservation and Land Degradation, Air-Soil-Water Pollution, Chemical Accident and Pollution
       Prevention, Coastal and Marine Management and Conservation, Disaster Management and Risk
       Reduction, Awareness, Education and Capacity Building sectors have been considered and fed on to the
       updated Strategies and Actions in the NEAP.

       Therefore the updated new NEAP or the Haritha Lanka Program will be a comprehensive, all inclusive,
       holistically formulated Environment Management document that has addressed current environmental
       issues and challenges optimally with the ownership to all stakeholding agencies.

       All project proponents will be prior informed and notified to formulate / prepare their project proposals
       in accordance to the above three documents which is Mahinda Chintana, the NEP and the NEAP.

    Response to the recommendation 1- To the Government of Sri Lanka
    [Rec. 1. The GEF Operational Focal Point should steer national portfolio formulation for GEF-6 in a way that all the
    crucial environmental challenges Sri Lanka faces are addressed, including land degradation and international
    waters].

    As stated in the explanatory note, the OFP-GEF has made all necessary arrangements to guide and direct
    all the project proponents to refer and adhere to the Mahinda Chintana (and its concurrent versions),
    the NEP, NEAP and the environmental concerns present in their own mandates when they propose
    prospective project concepts to the National Portfolio Formulation dialogue for GEF-6 so that the
    following concerns will be essentially covered in the on-coming project concept papers and project
    proposals.

    The OFP-GEF also recognizes that there were many projects funded through the GEF funding to address
    the Focal Areas on Biodiversity and Climate Change and the allocations for Focal Areas such as Land
    Degradation, Chemicals and International Waters being low partly due non availability of prospective
    project proposals from stakeholding Agencies. This may be partly due to inadequate coordination
    between the OFP and stakeholding Agencies. In order to bridge these gaps and inadequacies, the OFP
    took the opportunity to take the message across the whole array of Stakeholding agencies through the
    Haritha Lanka (NEAP) Updating Committees (ten Committees covering ten missions[Mission 1- Clean air
    – everywhere; Mission 2-Saving the fauna, flora and ecosystems; Mission 3-Meeting the Challenges of
    climate Change; Mission 4-Wise use of the Coastal Belt and the sea around; Mission 5-Responsible use
    of the land resources; Mission 6-Doing away with the dumps; Mission 7-Water for all and always;
    Mission 8-Green Cities for health and prosperity; Mission 9-Greening the industries; Mission 10-
    Knowledge for right choices] of the Haritha Lanka Program) and various National Experts Committees
    and Steering Committees established at the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy (the OFP of
    GEF in Sri Lanka) covering majority of the Environment Management Themes.

    The OFP-GEF has already made arrangements to invite a broad spectrum of stake holders, so that the
    majority of stake holders will get an equal opportunity to make their voice and contribute positively at
    the GEF–6 Portfolio Preparation workshop. In this effort, the OFP believes that all concerns on
    Environment Management including the crucial environmental challenges in Sri Lanka will be addressed.

    Therefore at this time, The OFP-GEF will assure steering the national portfolio formulation for GEF-6 in a
    way that all the crucial environmental challenges Sri Lanka faces are addressed, including land
    degradation and international waters involving an optimal presence of stakeholders.

    Response to the recommendation 2- To the Government of Sri Lanka
    [Rec 2. The Ministry of Environment should play a stronger role in systematically coordinating the GEF portfolio for
    greater impact and sharing of lessons, including across sectors].


    The OFP-GEF cannot agree in full to the explanatory comments in full given by the evaluators.
    But can agree to a certain point since there is always room for improvements.

       This time when the OFP conducts its GEF – 6 Portfolio Formulation program it will use the
       findings of the “Joint GEF/Sri Lanka Country Portfolio Evaluation: (1991–2012), VOLUME 1 -
       Main Report” since it recognizes its guidance and critical comments. Lessons learnt in the past
       projects will be recognized and will be brought forward to the future projects and prospective
       project proponents will be given an opportunity to acquire experiences of past project
       practioners and some of these practioners will be invited to be present at the GEF – 6 Portfolio
       Preparation workshop. Although it has been criticized, sometimes it is inevitable to carry out
       projects somewhat similar to or slightly modified to the past projects in order to replicate for
       wider community although it seems like follow up phases of earlier projects. But we do this
       solely due to disseminate best practices to the community. Sometimes it has been done to
       elevate a particular project to its next stage or phase.

       The OFP-GEF will take necessary steps to disseminate details and best / good practices of GEF
       projects carried out by each other so that synergies and links are established across project
       activities in order to make aware a wider community of the activities being through every
       means predominantly through print and electronic media. A digest of the GEF-SGP has already
       been done (printed) covering 300+ projects carried out during 1997 to 2012. Structured links
       will be build on the results achieved by the SGP program in order influence policy decision
       making and to scale them up to Medium or Full-sized Projects.

       The Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy will continue to act as the coordinator of
       activities in the environmental sector and as the GEF OFP every effort has been taken to
       systematize its coordination role to ensure the GEF portfolio is mainstreamed horizontally
       across sectors (see how the NEAP has been prepared in the explanatory note).

       The Ministry, in its capacity as the OFP-GEF, will further enrich the next national programming
       the portfolio preparation exercise for GEF6 by starting the program early 2014 to avoid delays
       and already had many formal and informal discussions with GEF Agencies to seek support in
       promoting concrete linkages between GEF projects, and other projects that they are carrying
       out.

       By these means, the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy as the OFP-GEF planned to
       play a more stronger and proactive role in systematically coordinating the GEF portfolio for
       greater impact and sharing of lessons and best practices horizontally and vertically within and
       across sectors.

       Response to the recommendation 3- To the Government of Sri Lanka
       [Rec 3. The GEF Operational Focal Point should ensure that project proposals have a clear link to national priorities
       prior to submission through the national as well as the GEF approval process].

       The Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy as the OFP-GEF duly respects and
       acknowledges the GEF support that has contributed considerably to advancements of the
       environmental agenda in Sri Lanka.

    As depicted in the explanatory note at the beginning of this document, all project proponents
    will be timely and adequately informed to incorporate the National priorities and guidance
    given by the Mahinda Chintana, NEP and NEAP for the Environment Management Sector when
    they prepare the projects. By this means the OFP-GEF can ensure that national project
    proposals submitted for endorsement are aligned with national priorities and explain how the
    benefits of the environmental component link to the national sustainable development agenda
    and related national plans such as the Haritha Lanka (NEAP), the Mahinda Chintana, etc. This
    will enhance the effectiveness of GEF funding, leverage funds, build partnerships and mobilize
    stakeholders.

    If the national priorities are being envisioned clearly in the project proposals, it will greatly
    reduce the delays in the project approving processes of both National Planning Department
    (NPD) of the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MoFP) and GEF Secretariat (GEF-Sec). This has
    the practice for all the project proposals forwarded in the past but may have had some
    shortcomings or inadequacies. But the real delays have been seen by the OFP-GEF because of
    the GEF-Sec approval and NPD-MoFP is taking place in different times of the year. In many
    instances the OFP-GEF has experienced that the current budget preparation period is over
    when the GEF-Sec approval is given. Therefore, a project proponent has to wait until next
    budget cycle to put forward that project proposal to secure budgetary provisions and funds. To
    avoid these situations, the OFP-GEF has discussed this matter with the Budget Department and
    the NPD of the MoFP and has come into an amicable solution.

    The OFP-GEF will invite members from the National Planning Department, the National Budget
    Department and the Department of External Resources to the Gef-6 Portfolio preparation
    Workshop as well where project ideas can be discussed from the onset and the links and
    sectoral buy-in can be discussed and negotiated upfront.

    By this means, the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy as the OFP-GEF can ensure
    that project proposals have a clear link to national priorities prior to submission through the
    national as well as the GEF approval process.

               The Experience of Joint GEF - Sri Lanka Country Portfolio Evaluation	  

        	  
        The GEF Country Portfolio Evaluation of Sri Lanka was undertaken as a joint evaluation with
        active involvement of GEF and the officials of the Government of Sri Lanka. This initiative is
        considered as an outcome of the Paris Declaration, which strongly emphasizes ownership,
        country leadership and mutual accountability to achieve aid effectiveness.

        The Joint Steering Committee guided on the Terms of Reference, evaluation questions,
        approach and methodologies and the selection of independent and competent evaluation
        consultants. All strategic decisions were taken through a joint process rather than a donor
        driven evaluation. Collaborations and partnerships do have their own costs in terms of
        communication delays in getting consensus, and compromise on certain evaluation
        questions. However, the involvement of external experts with outside peer reviews helped
        our officers to gain further knowledge and diverse perspectives.

        This joint and collaborative evaluation has proved to be successful as it created the
        ownership and helped to improve the utilization of the evaluation report. Further, it has not
        compromised on the independence as the evaluation was managed by the Joint Steering
        Committee which did not involve in the planning, designing, implementation and operation
        of the projects and programmes.

        The consultation workshop was conducted with the wider group of stakeholders and the
        effective peer review was undertaken by experienced professionals and as such aspects such
        as independence, credibility and objectivity were maintained. Further, the critical inputs
        received from the Peer Review Panel were useful in strategizing the evaluation process and
        in improving the quality assurance process thus helped to improve credibility of the findings
        and the evaluation report. The evaluation report will be uploaded in the Evaluation
        Information System of the Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM) for
        wider dissemination. This will help to facilitate the utility of the evaluation which is very
        important to take follow-up actions.

        The DPMM will closely work with the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy on
        the management responses. The findings and lesson learned will be used in the planning and
        formulation of new projects.

        The joint and collaborative evaluations have fundamentally contributed to improve the aid
        effectiveness, enhance ownership, wider use of evaluation lessons and findings and will help
        to improve the planning and management of development portfolios, projects and
        programmes.

        This joint evaluation will be a replicable model evaluation approach for many countries and
        development partners to follow.
