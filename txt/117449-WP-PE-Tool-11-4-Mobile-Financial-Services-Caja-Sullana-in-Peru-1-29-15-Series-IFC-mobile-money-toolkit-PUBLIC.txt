Monitoring                              Automate “transaction splitting”.
Agent Support                           ••   Develop more resources to provide agents with better tools for liquidity management
                                        ••   Provide agents with a transaction/earnings report
                                        ••   Provide agents with a local contact to assist them in resolving issues
                                        ••   Conduct detailed analysis to better understand agent turnover drivers; then forge plans to
                                             proactively reduce it
Marketing                               •• Strengthen and invest in agent promotion
                                        •• Monitor branding of agents
Training                                •• Provide agents extra training on security issues, particularly how to detect false notes, among
                                           other topics
                                        •• Explore the introduction of a system for on-going and/or refresher training, ideally when new
                                           features are introduced
                                        •• Organize regular agent meetings to provide them an opportunity to learn from other agents
                                           and thereby more easily adopt best practices
Increase number of agent transactions   •• Add more types of transactions via agents
                                        •• Make additional marketing efforts to educate clients about the benefits of the agent network
                                        •• Revise the branch staff incentive scheme to include agent performance (number of
                                           transactions) as one of the key performance indicators. This should encourage branch staff to
                                           extend further support to agents
Monitoring channel performance          •• Monitor key indicators, such as the number of clients and non-clients using the service and
                                           transactions per client and non-client
                                        •• Build an allocation-based costing system that conveys a more realistic picture of channel
                                           performance
