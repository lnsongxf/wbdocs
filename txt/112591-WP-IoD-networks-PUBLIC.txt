Promoting Networks for Institutes of Directors —
Why and How?
Institute of Directors (IoD) Networks promote corporate governance at the regional level through
enhanced training and skill development for directors. Although the number of IoD Networks has
increased over the last several years, many regions have only just begun to collaborate and address
the common challenge of developing a sustainable network. In preparing this report, we began
by looking for similarities among successful networks, including by speaking with several network
members and IFC representatives across the globe. Throughout this process, we analyzed the
benefits and key takeaways from networks in Latin America, Africa, North America, and Europe to
leverage synergies to develop effective and sustainable networks.

Background and Rationale
IoD Networks strengthen the implementation of corporate governance and promote the growth
of individual IoDs and overall peer exchange within their regions. They accomplish these objectives
by promoting the role of directors, filling knowledge gaps, and advocating for better corporate
governance practices and regulations. All in all, networks complement national programs by using                         S chweizerische Eidg enos s enschaf t

Key Takeaways from Past Development and Implementation Methods
There is no universal structural model for IoD Networks; development and implementation techniques are entirely dependent on a
region’s resources and overall environment, including size, culture, and corporate governance knowledge. IoD Networks vary between
formal and informal structures, some of them stemming from corporate governance nonprofit research centers, associations, or
professional institutions.
This section highlights certain good practices drawn from analysis of a number of IoD Networks. While there is no single formula
for success, following the key takeaways below will improve the chances of designing and implementing an appropriate strategy for
creating a successful network.
