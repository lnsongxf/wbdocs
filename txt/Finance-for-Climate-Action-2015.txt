                    that come alongside WBG resources in a climate project. This is
                                                                                            development banks, 72 developing countries have

                    the following approach is used: if a project is assessed as having
                                                                                            and investments. At the program level, financing

                    to prepare this document was not subject to the Bank Group’s            capacity. This financing is expected to attract an

               BOX 1   Highlights of the World Bank Group’s Work with Other Climate Funds

               Climate Investment Funds (CIF): As of June 30, 2015 US$4.6 billion in CIF funding had been approved by MDB boards
               alongside US$9.3 billion from the MDBs’ own resources. This helped to: (i) buy down the cost for strategically important
               but high cost technologies; (ii) Take on risks such as those in the very early stages of geothermal development; (ii) test
               new products/business models; (iii) break the short tenor/high interest rate cycle that prevails in many emerging markets
               that limits access to long-term, low cost capital in the domestic market for climate related investments; and (iv) expand
               the pool of resources available to low income countries and countries in high risk of debt distress. Following devastating
               floods in 2013, the CIF’s Pilot Program for Climate Resilience provided Mozambique with support to climate-proof road
               infrastructure so that roads rebuilt under the Bank Group’s fund for the poorest countries, IDA’s crisis response window
               would be more resilient in the future.
               Carbon Funds: The World Bank Group launched the first global carbon fund, the Prototype Carbon Fund, in April 2000. 
               In the following seven years, another 11 Kyoto funds and facilities were launched to pioneer a full range of flexibility
               mechanisms. The first generation of carbon funds successfully harnessed private sector funding, amounting to 56 percent
               of total peak capitalization of these funds at US$2.76 billion. By the end of 2014, the Bank Group’s Kyoto funds and facilities
               had delivered 196 million tCO2e. Today, the Bank Group is shaping the next generation of carbon initiatives for the post-2012
               period by developing new approaches to performance-based payments and piloting carbon instruments. The Bank Group
               has six different carbon initiatives, capitalized at US$1.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, that aim to scale up emission
               reductions, build readiness for domestic carbon pricing plans, use auctions to put a price on carbon and increase access
               to energy in least developed countries (LDCs), and reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Overall
               74 different public and private sector participants engage in the Bank Group’s funds and facilities. Around 55 developing
               countries are being supported through more than US$2 billion in funds for forests and landscapes including the Forest
               Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Bio Carbon Fund (BioCF).
               The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR): GFDRR has invested up to US$330 million since
               2007 through more than 500 grants.  It’s helped over 80 countries develop innovative solutions to mitigate risk and
               mainstream disaster risk management into their development strategies, and build back after a catastrophe in a more
               resilient manner. In fiscal year 2015 alone, GFDRR-financed grants were delivered together with over US$3.0 billion in
               financing from the World Bank. 
               Global Environment Facility (GEF): Over nearly 25 years US$5.2 billion in World Bank-managed GEF grants have
               been channeled to client countries alongside US$14.6 billion of IBRD/IDA funding and US$22.2 billion from other
               sources. The GEF grants have crowded-in a diverse range of development, private sector and civil society partners for
               transformative low carbon programs, supported regional and global learning, and demonstrated efficiencies from cross
               program collaboration. Grants have helped to draw down risk on partner investments, for example the India Partial Risk-
               sharing Guarantee; build multi-stakeholder alliances, for example the Sahel and West Africa Program that supports the
               pan-African Great Green Wall Initiative to reverse land degradation and desertification in the Sahel and Sahara, boost
               food security and support local communities to adapt to climate change; strengthen institutional capacity, as in work on
               green energy schemes as Shanghai moves to become a low carbon city; demonstrate innovative approaches such as
               Concentrated Solar Power in Morocco; and transform policy, for example the introduction of climate friendly measures
               in transport in Mexico. 
               IFC’s Concessional Climate Finance: This source of finance has supported climate-smart projects with high development
               impact that would not have been implemented otherwise due to unfavorable market conditions. IFC’s sources of Climate
               Finance include the CIFs, GEF and some bi-lateral trust funds, including the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program.* In the
               last five years nearly US$300 million in donor funds have been delivered with US$1 billion of IFC investments and more
               than US$4 billion of other private sector funds to support over 40 investment projects in 23 countries. This has helped
               to bridge gaps and address market barriers that obstruct private sector investment in areas of strategic importance. In
               Turkey, an initial concessional investment of US$20 million in three local leasing companies helped catalyze renewable
               energy and energy efficiency lending, expand the sector and facilitate lending on purely commercial terms.  It’s also
               spurred IFC’s ability to invest in new renewable energy technologies, develop new products, work in challenging markets
               and new sectors through innovative structures and build capacity in firms and governments to identify climate change
               opportunities and help countries develop regulatory environments that enable private sector investments.

               *The IFC-Canada Climate Change Program is financed by a CN$291.55 million contribution from the Canadian government. It is part of
               Canada’s 2010 CN$400 million commitment under the Copenhagen Accord.
