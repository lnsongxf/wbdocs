       BOX 1:  Government support for the creation of financial cooperative networks

       Financial cooperatives have adopted different integrative models around the world with the goal of
       achieving economies of scale that will support viability while offering a wide range of services to cus-
       tomers. Adopted structures range from the atomized-competitive network model to the feder-
       ated network model. In the first model, integration is largely limited to shared publicity, lobbying,
       and representation. Resources are sometimes shared but without centralization. In the federated net-
       work model, resources and decisions are centralized, and the customer sees the network as a single
       entity. The federated network model of organization offers greater advantages to its members than
       the atomized-competitive model, and most federated financial cooperative networks outperform at-
       omized-competitive networks in terms of stability, financial efficiency, and market penetration (DID
       2005). In fact, Rabobank and Desjardins—both federated networks—not only outperform atom-
       ized-competitive networks but also commercial banks.

       In the federated model, the cooperatives share resources and access to support (back office) ser-
       vices provided by a second-tier institution (the federation) which is owned by them. Integration into
       a network also facilitates standardization of operational systems (such as accounting and data pro-
       cessing), policies and norms, products, and the institutional image. Standardization contributes to
       better performance by promoting comparison among base units. In a federated network, contractual
       solidarity binds members on issues such as the regional area of operation, member size, dues, group
       borrowing, and cross guarantees. The most integrated networks such as Rabobank appear to be a uni-
       fied institution.

       Federated networks strengthen governance of their members through internal regulations and
       strategies. Network structure is characterized by democratic representation and centralized authority
       by an apex organization whose roles and responsibilities complement those of the base units. The
       federation has a surveillance function over its members, and there are established mechanisms for af-
       filiation and disaffiliation. The federation trains, supervises, advises, develops products, and ensures
       monitoring of the base units. Finally, a federated network of cooperatives often has shared ownership
                                                                                                     (continued)

  BOX 1:  Government support for the creation of financial cooperative networks (continued)

  in a central agency, a security fund, an insurance firm, or a brokerage that generate products, services,
  or other inputs which are delivered to members at the base level.

  Governments in many countries have actively supported the formation of cooperative networks to
  foster financial stability and/or maintain financial inclusion in remote areas typically served by small
  rural providers. In many cases, governments have raised minimum capital requirements for coopera-
  tives to force mergers in the sector with a view to reach scale. They have also introduced differentiated
  capital requirements for cooperatives in a federated network. For example, in Brazil, the minimum
  capital requirement for cooperatives is 13 percent, compared to 11 percent for cooperatives in a fed-
  erated network. Examples of financial cooperative networks created by governments and multilateral
  donors include the following.

  Albania. In the late 1990s, Albanian authorities, through a World Bank loan, supported the creation,
  training, and monitoring of 92 operationally sustainable financial cooperatives and their organization
  into a network. They also created a second-tier institution owned by the cooperatives—the Albanian
  Union of Savings and Credit Associations—to provide services to the network, and developed net-
  work procedures, governance arrangements, and methodologies. The union’s main functions were to
  train its members, provide funding, and collect and monitor data on behalf of the official supervisor.

  Austria. In the 1890s, the Austrian government took measures to support the creation of a three-tier
  cooperative network, Raiffeisen Zentralbank.

  Moldova. A World Bank loan financed the creation of rural financial cooperatives and a federation of
  such cooperatives in Moldova in the early 2000s.

  The Netherlands. In the 1890s, the Dutch government supported the creation of credit cooperatives
  through subsidies, later changing the policy to provide subsidies to two apex cooperative institutions;
  these later became Rabobank.

  BOX 2:  Privatizing agricultural development banks: the case of Banrural, Guatemala

  Banrural S.A. was created in 1998 with the restructuring of the Guatemalan National Agricultural De-
  velopment Bank (Banco Nacional de Desarrollo Agrícola, Bandesa), a state-owned bank with extensive
  presence in rural areas and 86 percent of its loan portfolio in the agricultural sector. The transforma-
  tion from Bandesa to Banrural was part of the modernization process of the Guatemalan state and fi-
  nancial system approved by the Guatemalan Congress in 1997 (Alfaro-Gramajo 2003).

  Banrural was established as a joint public-private venture, with 30 percent of its capital provided by
  the state and 70 percent by the private sector (Alfaro and Alfaro 2010). Its ownership structure was
  designed to facilitate the active participation of civil society groups involved in the rural sector and
  with a strong social commitment. Its private shareholders include community groups, cooperatives,
  and organizations. The bank focuses on providing a wide range of financial services that facilitate pro-
  ductive social, investment, and consumer activities in rural areas, as well as servicing social sectors not
  traditionally served by the financial system (for example, indigenous groups).

  Banrural seeks to foster economic activity in rural areas of the country in a way that is profitable and
  sustainable for its shareholders, while maintaining a development objective with an entrepreneurial
  vision. Today it is Guatemala’s most profitable bank, and its second largest bank in terms of assets,
  valued at US$5.9 billion at the end of 2014 (Superintendencia de Bancos de Guatemala 2015). The
  bank relies on an extensive network of agents and has over 900 offices serving more than 5.7 million
  customers around the country; it has recently expanded to Honduras (Banrural website).

       BOX 3:  Land transfer and title insurance

       Where uncertainty exists over land title due to fraud or error, a legal system can protect either the cur-
       rent (innocent) owner or a previous owner who claims the title. The U.S. system generally awards title
       to the latter in the event of a legitimate claim. Thus, current owners frequently purchase title insurance
       to provide indemnification in the event of a loss.

       Alternatively, a title system could be structured such that, in the event of a claim, the current owner
       retains title to the land, and the claimant is indemnified. The Torrens system, which has been used in
       some U.S. states including Massachusetts and Minnesota, is an example of such a system. Under the
       Torrens system, current owners register their property with the government, at which time an exam-
       ination of the title is conducted. If no claims are made, title is declared to reside with the owner against
       all future claims, and a public fund is established from registration fees to be used to compensate le-
       gitimate claimants who subsequently appear.

       Miceli and Sirmans (1995) maintain that if land transaction costs are low, both systems are equally ef-
       ficient; but if they are high due to high notary fees and taxes, the Torrens system is more efficient as it
       allocates land to who values it more.

       Several U.S. states have experimented with the Torrens or other title registration systems at one time
       or another, but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers. Llewellyn
       (2008) notes that one Torrens title on a lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable
       for large-scale improvement, as no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York
       title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title.
