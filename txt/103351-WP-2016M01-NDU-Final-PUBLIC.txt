NEPAL DEVELOPMENT UPDATE
Development Amidst Disturbances

January 2016
Preface
          The Nepal Development Update is produced twice-yearly with the following two
          main aims: to report on key economic developments over the preceding months,
          placing them in a longer term and global perspective and to examine (in the Special
          Focus section) topics of particular policy significance. The Update is intended for a
          wide audience including policy-makers, business leaders, the community of analysts
          and professionals engaged in economic debates, and the general public.

          This update, however, only has the first section to shed light on the impact of recent
          trade disruptions. The 2016 Spring Update (April) will have the full version with
          Special Focus section.

          This Update was prepared by a World Bank team including Damir Cosic (Senior
          Economist), Roshan Bajracharya (Senior Economist), Sudyumna Dahal
          (Economist) and Saurav Rana (Research Analyst). Takuya Kamata (Country
          Manager), Martin Rama (Acting Country Director), Shubham Chaudhuri (Practice
          Manager), Rajib Upadhya (Senior External Affairs Officer), Sailesh Tiwari (Senior
          Poverty Economist), Sabin Shrestha (Senior Financial Sector Specialist) provided
          feedback and guidance. Sunita Kumari Yadav (Program Assistant) and Arsianti
          Arsianti (Consultant) formatted the report.

Executive summary: Development Amidst Disturbances
                In the span of six-months, Nepal has been hit by two major shocks. The first one
                was the April/May 2015 earthquakes that have caused a huge loss of life and assets.
                The second shock has come in the form of a near complete disruption of external
                trade following the adoption of the new Constitution on September 20, 2015.

                Devastating earthquakes in April and May of 2015 took a huge human toll;
                destroyed homes, businesses, irreplaceable cultural heritage sites and slowed
                economic growth. The Government of Nepal (GoN), through a Post Disaster
                Needs Assessment (PDNA), estimated the value of losses at USD 7.1 billion
                (physical damage of USD 5.2 billion and economic losses, spanning several years, of
                USD 1.9 billion). In addition, growth is estimated to have slowed to 3.4 percent in
                FY15, two percentage points lower than a year before, reflecting both weak
                agricultural season at the start of the fiscal year as well as earthquake-related
                disruptions.

                Furthermore, the earthquake has put a dent on a stellar record on poverty reduction.
                Simulations suggest that the earthquakes could end up pushing an additional 0.7-1.0
                million of Nepalis into poverty in FY15-FY16, as the result of the earthquake. This
                translates to additional 2.5-3.5 percent of Nepalis pushed into poverty. In addition
                to monetary poverty, the deterioration of water and sanitation services, disruption
                of schools and health services and the possible increase in food insecurity may lead
                to a bigger impact on multidimensional poverty, if normalization of public services
                are not restored within a shortest time possible.

                Nepal’s political parties intensified their efforts to adopt a new constitution, after
                eight years of deliberations, spurred on by the shift in political priorities following
                the April/May earthquakes. As the constitutional process drew to an unexpectedly
                rapid close, protests and clashes, some of which turned violent and deadly, erupted
                in August across the country’s southern belt bordering with India. Following the
                promulgation of the new constitution on September 20, 2015, protests intensified,
                leading to a near-complete disruption in cross-border trade. This has resulted in
                acute shortages of fuel and essential supplies across the country.

                With varying intensity, the trade disruptions—which lasted more than four
                months—have affected economic activity across the board. Industry has been
                severely affected. Service sector has also been hit hard as tourism, trade, transport
                have been disrupted. Agriculture has been affected by lack of fertilizers and other
                inputs which has already affected summer crops and is likely have an impact on
                subsequent harvests. Both government revenues and expenditures have fallen
                sharply, while shortages of goods have pushed up prices adversely affecting welfare.
                Humanitarian effects of the trade disruptions cannot be underestimated with
                children missing school, hospital running low on critical supplies, and delays in
                reconstruction and winterization efforts undermining earthquake recovery in the
                affected areas.

 Development Amidst Disturbances                               Nepal Development Update


           a. Outlook
                 Prior to the trade disruptions, growth was projected at 3.7 percent in FY16 as
                 continued effects of the earthquake destruction, sub-optimal monsoon rainfall,
                 delays in set up of the National Reconstruction Authority were expected to take a
                 toll on economic activity, especially in the first part of FY16. Growth was expected
                 to pick up to 5.5 percent in FY17, on the back of the increased investment (both
                 public and private), as the political process stabilizes and the earthquake recovery
                 speeds up in earnest. Under this scenario, a normalization was envisaged whereby
                 the faster budget implementation and sustained reconstruction activities could lead
                 to a surge in imports, which would have tipped the current account balance into
                 deficit over the forecast period, despite large remittances. Similarly, increased
                 government spending on capital expenditure, as National Reconstruction Authority
                 speeds up reconstruction activities, would lead to a larger budget deficit.

                 Clearly, the assumptions underpinning this forecast have changed. Estimating the
                 impact of the trade disruptions in a data-poor and uncertain environment is
                 inherently difficult and imprecise. Based on the data available, and applying a
                 number of different approaches, our current estimate is that if the trade disruptions
                 continue until the end of January 2016, Nepal is expected to record growth of 1.7
                 percent in FY16. However, uncertainty surrounding this forecast is large and growth
                 could range anywhere from 1 to 2.3 percent.
           b. Challenges
                 Beyond the immediate challenge of overcoming the shock associated with the
                 current trade disruptions, Nepal faces several simultaneous challenges ahead—
                 effective implementation of post-earthquake recovery coupled with a completion of
                 political transition and setting up of a new federal structure. The country also faces
                 the challenge of successful leveraging of its endowments (hydropower potential,
                 human capital) to achieve a faster growth, increasing poverty reduction and creating
                 economic opportunities, especially jobs, for its citizens at home in the medium-
                 term. Additionally, the trade disruptions have highlighted the need to urgently
                 diversify Nepalese economy and society, particularly in terms of trade, transport
                 options and supplies of key resources. Delays or missteps in any one of these
                 challenges may lead to permanently forgone opportunities and income.

                 Low and middle income countries in general tend to experience a permanent loss of
                 potential output following a geological disaster like the one experienced by Nepal
                 given their lower capacity to execute spending efficiently and effectively in
                 rebuilding lost capital stock. In fact, the key growth constraint for Nepal in the past
                 has been the insufficient public investment and resulting infrastructure deficit.
                 While the quantity of public investment may increase as a result of newly created
                 National Reconstruction Authority, ensuring the quality of spending will be even
                 more critical.

                 Furthermore, lower oil prices may reduce economic opportunities in the oil-
                 exporting Gulf Co-operation Countries, which are an important destination for
                 Nepali migrants and a key source of remittances for the country.

 A. Recent Economic Developments
                 2015 will be remembered as the year of twin shocks for Nepal. The first one were
                 the April/May 2015 earthquakes that have caused a huge loss of life and assets. The
                 second shock has come in the form of a near complete disruption of external trade
                 following the adoption of the new Constitution on September 20, 2015.
           1. The earthquake was a major setback for Nepal
                 Devastating earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May 2015 took a huge
                 human toll, destroyed homes, businesses and cultural heritage sites. Post Disaster
                 Needs Assessment (PDNA) carried out under the leadership of the Government of
                 Nepal has estimated that the total value of damages and losses caused by the
                 earthquakes is USD 7 billion: USD 5.2 billion represents the value of destroyed
                 physical assets, and USD1.9 billion reflects the economic losses. Losses span over
                 several years until sectors recovery fully, thus are not limited just to FY15.

                 After it rebounded strongly in FY14, growth slowed sharply in FY15 due to
                 earthquake related disruptions. The overall growth rate for FY15 is estimated to be
                 3.4 percent1 – the lowest in five years and 2 percentage points lower than a year
                 before (Figure 2). All three major sub-sectors—agriculture, services and industry—
                 experienced lower rates of growth in FY15. The slowdown in services accounted for
                 1.2 percentage points of GDP drop, with industry and agriculture sectors
                 contributing equally the remaining 0.8 percentage points (Figure 1).

                 Furthermore, the earthquake has put a dent on a stellar record on poverty reduction.
                 Simulations suggest that the earthquakes could end up pushing an additional 0.7-1.0
                 million of Nepalis into poverty in FY15-FY16, as the result of the earthquake. This
                 translates to additional 2.5-3.5 percent of Nepalis pushed into poverty. In addition
                 to monetary poverty, the deterioration of water and sanitation services, disruption
                 of schools and health services and the possible increase in food insecurity may lead
                 to a bigger impact on multidimensional poverty, if normalization of public services
                 are not restored within a shortest time possible.

                      2. Six months later, Nepal experienced a second shock in a form of cross-
                         border trade disruptions
                               Nepal’s political parties intensified their efforts to adopt a new constitution in the
                               wake of devastating earthquakes in April and May of 2015. As the constitutional
                               process drew to an unexpectedly rapid close, protests and clashes, some of which
                               turned violent and deadly, erupted in August across the country’s southern belt
                               bordering with India. Following the promulgation of the new constitution on
                               September 20, 2015, protests intensified, leading to a near-complete disruption in
                               cross-border trade. This has resulted in acute shortages of fuel and essential supplies

                              across the country. While many in Nepal have accused India of barring shipments
                              from entering Nepal and imposing an “unofficial blockade,” India has officially
                              denied doing so, citing “unrest, protests and demonstrations on the Nepalese side”
                              as a cause of the trade disruptions

                              India is Nepal’s largest trading partner, accounting for 65 percent of Nepal’s total
                              trade, and the principal transit route as more than 85 percent of all imports enter
                              through India irrespective of their country of origin (Figure 5). With alternate land
                              routes through China damaged by earthquakes, Nepal is not only a landlocked
                              country, but is also an India-locked country, with limited ability to expand
                              connectivity and diversify trade in the short-run.

                              Current trade disruptions could have a larger impact than a similar trade dispute in
                              1989 did. Despite the recent easing of trade disruptions, it is not entirely clear how
                              long and in what form the present trade and transit dispute could last. However, its
                              impact, if sustained for an extended period of time, could be larger than the similar
                              episode in 1989 given that Nepal’s economy is much more depended on trade than
                              it was back in 1989. The 15-month trade and transit blockade of Nepal by India in
                              1989 affected growth for three fiscal years. Back in 1989, imports and exports of
                              goods and services accounted for 33 percent of GDP while today they account 52
                              percent of GDP. Today, Nepal imports nearly 20 percent of energy needs from
                              India compared to 5 percent in 1989 (Figure 6).
                     3. Disruptions have sharply depressed imports as well as exports
                              As a result of the disruptions cross-border trade has been curtailed sharply.
                              Cumulatively, for the first five months of FY16, imports are down 32.5 percent,
                              compared to the same period of previous year. This is a first import contraction
                              recorded in decades. Similarly, exports have fallen 32 percent in the same period
                              (Figure 7). The nadir of the trade flows appears to be in month four of FY16 (mid-
                              November) with trade improving somewhat in month five (mid-December) of the
                              FY, although still far from pre-disruptions levels. Based on trade data from

                             One of the most visible, and immediately felt, impacts of the trade disruptions have
                             been shortages of petroleum products. Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC), the state-
                             owned monopoly importer and distributer, is supplied solely by the Indian Oil
                             Corporation (IOC). Prior to the disruptions, IOC loaded and dispatched, on
                             average, 350 tankers per day. This fell to only 15-20 tankers per daily during
                             October/November. As a result, prices of petrol at the black market reportedly
                             went up 300-600 percent. Liquid Petroleum Gas cylinders used for cooking and
                             heating were reportedly no longer available in the market (Figure 9 and Figure 10).

                          4. External balance and foreign reserves have strengthened amid shrinking
                             trade deficit and large remittances
                                        Trade deficit has sharply decreased while remittance have continued to grow but at
                                        a slower pace. Trade deficit reached a historic high of 31.2 percent of GDP in
                                        FY15. However, given the on-going trade disruptions, and the fact that imports are
                                        nine times larger than exports, trade deficit in the first five months of FY16 is down
                                        33 percent compared to the same period of FY15. As in the past, it was offset by
                                        inflows of remittances (Figure 11). The surge in remittances during the last quarter
                                        of FY15 was the response of Nepali migrants in the aftermath of the April
                                        earthquake. In the first five months of the FY16, remittances continued to expand
                                        but at a slower pace growing at 11.5 percent (y/y) in dollar terms compared to 20
                                        percent in the beginning of the fiscal year.

                                        However, outflow of migrant workers registered a sharp slowdown. FY15 saw the
                                        outflow of migrant workers declined (down 0.8 percent y/y) for the first time since
                                        2009 (Figure 12). In the first five months of FY16, outflow of migrant workers has
                                        further declined with negative growth rate of 22.6 percent (y/y) which if continues
                                        will severely impact the growth of remittance inflow going forward.

                                        Foreign reserves continue to improve. Total reserves stood at USD 8.1 billion at the
                                        end of FY15, despite worsening export performance and widening trade deficit.
                                        They were enough to cover 11.2 months of merchandise and services imports, well
                                        above with the 8 months coverage target set out in the Monetary Policy for FY15.
                                        In the first five months of the FY16, total reserves further increased to USD 9
                                        billion with coverage increasing to whopping 18.4 months of merchandise and
                                        service imports amid falling trade deficit and still growing remittances.

                 7. Impact on the economy of Nepal so far
                             The trade disruptions have affected all sectors of the Nepali economy. While higher
                             frequency data that could give an accurate picture of the impacts in the real sector
                             are scarce or lagging, numerous reports are suggesting that the impact on the Nepali
                             economy is significant and broad-based.


                             Industry, representing some 15 percent of the GDP, has come to a near stand-still.
                             Manufacturing, which was mostly unaffected by the earthquake, has been severely
                             hit due to its close proximity to protests that have halted transport entirely. Reports
                             indicate that the sector was operating at only ¼ of capacity at the peak of trade
                             disruptions during October and November. While some industries were forcibly
                             closed by the protestors in Birjung and Rajbiraj area, others like in Hetauda
                             Industrial Estate—which alone contributes 3.66 percent to the National economy—
                             were closed4 due to shortage of raw materials and fuel. Imported raw materials and
                             intermediate products needed for production were in short supply all over Nepal.
                             Fuel for generators is running low at a time when power outage has been lasting in
                             excess of 14 hours of per day. According to Central Bureau of Statistics and Birgunj

               Chamber of Commerce, around 2,000 firms employing some 400,000 people in the
               Terai were closed during October/November given the lack of raw materials and
               fuel. This will have a negative welfare impact on the affected population.


               Construction of projects, particularly those of national importance, including
               hydropower projects have been halted. At the start of the FY, GoN was expecting
               some 300 MW of new capacity to be added to the grid, which is unlikely now.
               Others projects will also face a severe delay in the completion. Load-shedding has
               gotten worse this year as household demand for electricity has increased, given
               shortages of other fuels, while supply constraints persist.

               Services, accounting for 51 percent of GDP, has been hit hard. Tourism, which had
               started to rebound from April/May earthquakes, has taken another blow as peak
               tourist season (September to November) coincided with the peak disruptions.
               Hotels reported 30 percent occupancy rate (down from usual 85-90 percent rate
               during peak season), with many curtailing services or closing altogether.
               International airlines operating in and out of Kathmandu are either
               cancelling/merging flights, shedding weight to carry extra fuel or making stopovers
               in India to refuel. Freight operators reported that nearly 8,000 containers destined
               for Nepal were held up at ports and transit points in India forcing importers to pay
               USD 300,000 a day in demurrage charges in October/November.

               Besides the disruptions in daily travels, the travel plans of around 1.5 million people
               who leave Kathmandu every year during Dashain holidays were severely impacted
               due to shortage of fuel. Long distance travels from/to Terai were further affected as
               the protestors attacked and destroyed vehicles. Transport Association of Nepal
               reported that some 100,000 workers were out of a job and the sector was incurring
               losses of up to USD 2.5 million (NPR 0.25 billion) per day. The Dashain and Tihar
               holiday shopping season—which account for 30 percent of the total annual retail
               sales—has also been severely affected because of the disruptions in supplies,
               changing household priorities and low consumers’ confidence. Furthermore, the
               Banker’s Association reports that the usual NPR 1 billion of new loan volume per
               day that the banking sector processes came to a halt during the peak of disruptions.
               The total volume of new lending in the first five months of the FY16 is sharply
               down to 57 billion compared to 91 billion during the same period in FY15, a drop
               of 43 percent as issuance of loans to all the major sectors have seen a sharp
               slowdown (Figure 18). As a result, the credit growth has slowed down to 14.4
               percent in mid-November compared to 23.1 percent during the same time in FY15
               (y/y).

                              Agriculture, contributing 31 percent of GDP, has been relatively less affected. A
                              majority of agricultural output is for subsistence purposes and likely unaffected in
                              the short-term. However, poor monsoon rainfall this year and earthquake-related
                              destructions were already expected to take a toll on agricultural output. Due to the
                              trade disruptions, the effects on agriculture production have been compounded
                              especially due to unavailability of fertilizer. It was reported more than 100,000 tons
                              of chemical fertilizer were stranded in different parts of Nepal and India including
                              at Sisirya Dry Port in Birgunj since mid-July due to the strikes in the Terai region.
                              Furthermore, as the storage facility in the dry port started being full, imported
                              fertilizers were stored outside which could degrade the quality of fertilizers
                              eventually impacting the agriculture harvests. Ministry of Agriculture Development's
                              preliminary projection show that paddy production dropped by 10 percent to 4.31
                              million tons in FY16 compared to 4.79 million tons in FY15 which was already a
                              drop of 5.1 percent compared to the production of 5.05 million tons in FY14. Thus
                              the paddy production in FY16 is expected to be lowest in the last 7 years. Also, the
                              winter crops are also expected to be affected by the strikes and disruptions in the
                              Terai region. Reports indicate that the dairy and poultry sector outputs dropped off
                              by 40-60 percent, on average, during the peak of disruptions. Dairy industry which
                              collected 500,000 liters of milk valued at NPR 30 million from dairy farmers daily
                              were collecting only 200,000 liters of milk due to the disruptions. Lack of fuel also
                              affected transport of agricultural products to markets.

               There are increasing human costs of the trade disruptions as well. Schools were
               reporting most of their bus fleet grounded and over two million children are missing
               school for more than three months. Schools in Terai region were particularly hard
               hit as the schools were forcibly already closed due to strikes, long before the
               transit/transport disruptions started. Hospitals were reporting dangerously low
               supplies of oxygen and other medical supplies at the peak of the disruptions which
               seems to be easing off since the end of December. Even ambulances were not
               having enough fuel to operate. Social services are curtailed and transfers are not able
               to offset weakening purchasing power of vulnerable groups given price hikes
               induced by shortages. Delays in earthquake recovery means that those in need, who
               have spent not only monsoon and winter seasons in temporary shelters, may end up
               doing so in coming monsoon, resulting in a year-long stay in temporary shelters.

               Investors’ confidence has been affected as well. Statkraft, a Norwegian Hydro
               investment and development company of Tamakoshi (650 MW) project has
               announced that it will be pulling out from this project in Nepal. In a further sign of
               difficult days ahead for hydropower companies, GMR’s—an Indian company that is
               developing Upper Karnali hydro project (900 MW)—office was attacked in
               Kathmandu. This is a significant turn of events from just a year ago when several
               major hydro-power projects were announced.

        B. Outlook
               Prior to the trade disruptions, growth was projected at 3.7 percent in FY16 as
               continued effects of the earthquake destruction, sub-optimal monsoon rainfall,
               delays in set up of the National Reconstruction Authority were expected to take a
               toll on economic activity, especially in the first part of FY16. Growth was expected
               to pick up to 5.5 percent in FY17, on the back of the increased investment (both
               public and private), as the political process stabilizes and the earthquake recovery
               speeds up in earnest. Under this scenario, a normalization was envisaged whereby
               the faster budget implementation and sustained reconstruction activities could lead
               to a surge in imports, which would have tipped the current account balance into
               deficit over the forecast period, despite large remittances. Similarly, increased
               government spending on capital expenditure, as National Reconstruction Authority
               speeds up reconstruction activities, would lead to a larger budget deficit.

               Clearly, the assumptions underpinning this forecast have changed. Estimating the
               impact of the trade disruptions in a data-poor and uncertain environment is
               inherently difficult and imprecise and we attempt to overcome this uncertainty by
               applying several approaches (see Annex for details). Based on limited available data,
               and applying a number of different approaches, our current estimate is that if the
               trade disruptions continue until the end of January 2016, Nepal is expected to
               record growth of 1.7 percent in FY2016.

               However, uncertainty surrounding this forecast is large and growth could range
               anywhere from 1 to 2.3 percent. Our estimate is that if the trade disruptions continue
               until end-January 2016, we could see a drop in FY16 GDP growth between 1.5 and
               2.7 percentage points, depending on the approach, compared to our pre-disruptions
               scenario. Obviously, the longer the trade disruptions last, the greater the impact in
               terms of lower growth, increased poverty and worsening humanitarian problems.

 C. Challenges
               Nepal faces several simultaneous challenges ahead—effective implementation of
               post-earthquake recovery coupled with completion of political transition to a new
               federal constitution—while leveraging its endowments (hydropower potential,
               human capital) to achieve a faster growth, increase poverty reduction and create
               economic opportunities for its citizens at home. Additionally, the trade disruption
               has highlighted the need to urgently diversify Nepalese economy and society,
               particularly in terms of trade, transport options and supplies of key resources.
               Delays or missteps in any one of these challenges may lead to permanently forgone
               opportunities, income and set back Nepal’s aspiration for graduating from least
               developed country (LDC) status.

               Low and middle income countries in general tend to experience a long-lasting loss
               of potential output following a geological disaster like the one experienced by Nepal
               given their lower capacity to execute spending efficiently and effectively in
               rebuilding lost capital stock. In fact, the key growth constraint for Nepal in the past
               has been the insufficient public investment and resulting infrastructure deficit.
               While the quantity of public investment may increase as a result of a newly
               proposed and empowered National Reconstruction Authority, ensuring the quality
               of spending will be even more critical.


               Furthermore, as oil prices are expected to stay low for some time, economic
               opportunities in the oil-exporting Gulf Co-operation Countries (GCC) may be
               reduced. GCC countries are an important destination for Nepali migrants and a key
               source of remittances for the country. GCC countries’ fiscal deficits reached 13
               percent of GDP in 2015. Region’s largest economy and one of the largest
               destinations for Nepalese workers, Saudi Arabia, is facing a large fiscal deficit of
               21.6 percent in 2015 and 19.4 percent in 2016 and has already announced measures
               to curb public spending. As a result, this is likely to impact the flow of remittances
               to Nepal which are already showing signs of a slowing down.

Box 1: Economic literature of the impact of large disasters on growth
 Economic literature finds that natural disasters have a negative effect on growth in general, with strong
 disasters leading to permanent losses while quality of institutions, among others, improves countries’ ability
 to cope with the shocks of disasters.
 From an economic growth theory point of view, it is not directly clear how natural disasters should affect economic
 growth. Traditional neo-classical growth models predict that the destruction of capital drives countries temporarily
 away from their balanced-growth path, while the endogenous growth models provide less clear-cut predictions (Cavallo
 et al., 2013).
 Neo-classical growth theory posits that if a natural disaster (e.g., an earthquake) destroys part of a country's capital
 stock, then the production possibility frontier shifts inwards, leading to lower total output per capita. Subsequently,
 increased investment replenishes the capital stock again and puts it back to its steady state level. In terms of growth
 rates, theory predicts growth to be lower than trend on impact and, under the right institutions, higher than trend
 thereafter (Klomp and Valckx, 2014).
 Endogenous growth theories revolve around the idea that the destruction of physical capital allows the affected
 economy to replace outdated equipment and structures faster than along the trend growth path (Caballero and
 Hammour, 1994). For example, models based on Schumpeter’s creative destruction theory may even predict higher
 growth rates as a result of natural disasters, as these shocks can be an accelerator for re-investment and upgrading the
 capital stock (Loayza et al., 2012; Cavallo et al., 2013). However, a lack of appropriate institutions, inadequate financing
 conditions, or limited access to international markets may hamper the catching-up process. Hence, again, the
 prediction is that a natural disaster lowers GDP per capita on impact. However, what is clear from both theoretical
 approaches is that the recovery from a disaster is directly related to the quality of institutions and their ability to
 implement it effectively.
 Since about early 2000s, a new strain of empirical research has emerged that evaluates a macroeconomic impact of
 disasters. Two recent strudies (Klomp and Valckx, 2014; Lazzaroni and van Bergeijk, 2014) summarize 750 and 1,991
 regressions from these macroeconomic impact analysis using a meta-analysis approach to measure the overall impact.
 They find that, on average, there is a negative relationship between natural disasters and economic growth. The main
 source of data for these studies tends to be the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) that captures outcomes of
 disasters (number of people affected, damage caused).
 Furthermore, looking at physical intensity of disasters (Richter scale, Volcanic Eruptions Index, wind speed,
 precipitation and temperature), Felbermayr and Gröschl (2014), find natural disasters reduce GDP per capita on
 impact with stronger disasters (top 1 percentile in strength), on average, 6.8 percent. In addition, looking at the length
 of impact, they do not find that disasters lead to a temporary boom, on average, in the subsequent five-years.
 Consequently, they find that “natural disasters harm development, period.”
 In addition, they find strong evidence that that higher institutional quality, higher openness to trade and higher
 financial openness improves countries’ ability to cope with the costs from the natural disasters.

APPENDIX: TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF ESTIMATES

                Estimating the impact of the trade disruptions in a data-poor and uncertain
                environment is inherently difficult and imprecise and we attempt to overcome this
                uncertainty by applying several approaches.

                First, we construct a sectoral, bottom-up approach. This approach tries to account
                for three things: i) normal within year seasonality of each of the sectors; ii) impact of
                the trade disruptions on each of the sectors and iii) each sector’s ability to rebound
                following the restoration of trade. For example, some sectors, like manufacturing,
                will be able to partially recoup losses due to the disruptions, while others, like
                agriculture and tourism, will not, given their seasonal nature of farm output.

                Second approach is to use the macro fiscal model for Nepal (MFMOD). MFMOD
                is the World Bank’s large-scale forecasting model. The core of the model is a
                neoclassical production function that combines endogenous and exogenous supplies
                of capital and labor combined with total factor productivity. Important variables,
                such as household consumption, are modelled in line with theoretical models of
                economic agent’s behavior but include important rigidities to account for short-run
                deviations of the economy away from its underlying potential rate of growth. The
                simulation of the trade restrictions is modelled by exogenously reducing the volume
                of imports and exports by 50 percent for a period of four months. In addition, to
                generate the an impact on domestic prices that have been observed so far, domestic
                consumer prices were also substantially raised during the same period. The shocks
                propagate through the model through two main channels. Firstly, the reduction in
                imports reduces the availability of key intermediate inputs for different sectors of
                the economy, curtailing economic activity. Secondly, the reduction in exports and
                the sharp rise in consumer prices reduces the real incomes of consumer and
                investors, reducing consumer demand and investment. The reduction in trade flows
                reduces the government’s collection of customs revenues, reducing the budget
                balance. The current account balance improves slightly in the simulation owing to
                the improvement in the net trade balance (Nepal is a large net importer of goods
                and services so that an equal percentage reduction in volumes improves the net
                balance).

                For third approach, we use a computable general equilibrium model for Nepal
                (NPLCGE). NPLCGE model built for this exercise is a single country model draw
                from the World Bank’s global CGE model (LINKAGE). The model is calibrated on
                a GTAP SAM comprising 57 activities, 57 products sectors, 6 factors, 1 household.
                It is a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model (DCGE), which
                explicitly models the process of convergence of prices and volumes to their new
                values over 10 periods (2010 to 2020). This approach links a sequence of static
                equilibriums with a set of equations, which update, at every period, the main
                macroeconomic variables. The simulation of trade blockade is performed in the
                model by increasing the transaction cost for both import and exports. The
                transaction cost is modelled as traditional “Iceberg effect” where transport is treated
                as an exogenous friction that is fixed and proportional to the value shipped, with the
                value‐added of transportation services treated as pure waste. The simulation
                calibrated the level of iceberg transaction cost that would generate 50 percent
                reduction in total trade during four months.
