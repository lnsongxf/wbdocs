iv	                 Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
Chapter 1
Background and Scope of the
Review
Armenia’s strategy for the agriculture sector1 aims to achieve both
improved national food security and self-sufficiency and export led
growth. Its key objectives are to: increase agricultural output, improve
national food security, modernize and commercialize the sector, and ratio-
nalize farm and non-farm rural employment. While these objectives respond
to the challenges the sector faces, they will not be easy to reconcile and
achieve. For instance, the emphasis on increased self-sufficiency in wheat
production in order to improve food security is at odds with the longer-term
need to build a modern, commercialized agricultural sector producing and
exporting according to comparative advantage. Armenia’s comparative
advantage lies with horticultural commodities, not with wheat. Similarly, the
need to facilitate adjustments in farm and non-farm employment in rural
areas is a challenge that all transition economies share, and which all are
struggling to resolve.
   A recent World Bank Group (WBG) review of this strategy concluded
that while it provides an appropriate framework for sector development,
there is an over-emphasis on realization of the shorter-term objectives to
increase agricultural production and improve food security,2 at the
expense of longer-term measures to modernize the sector and facilitate
adjustments in rural employment. This imbalance could compromise long-
term sector development. The Government is also allocating a high and
increasing proportion of its limited budgetary resources to raising production
and improving food self-sufficiency, at the expense of longer-term require-
ments for sustainable development. While this focus reflects Armenia’s
pre-occupation with national food security, there is a risk that it will result in
increased production from the current subsistence-oriented production base
rather than a more deep-seated restructuring of farm ownership and manage-
ment systems and the modernization and commercialization of agriculture.
   Recognizing the need to increase support for realization of these lon-
ger-term sector objectives, the WBG agreed with the Government to pre-
pare a wide-ranging review of the way forward for agricultural
modernization and commercialization. Despite considerable recent work
on the identification of value chains and the establishment of agricultural
cooperatives—current action lacks a broad, long-term vision of how to pro-
ceed. The Government remains uncertain on how to bridge the gap between
a future based on export-led growth and the current reality of small-scale,
semi-subsistence farms and a small (albeit dynamic) agri-business sector. The
objective of the review is to provide a framework for discussion with govern-
ment on how to modernize and commercialize Armenian agriculture—a key
objective of Armenia’s current agriculture sector strategy. As some of the

Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                    1
proposals represent a significant departure from existing policy, the study is
designed to frame and inform further discussion rather than serve as the
“next steps” for action.
   The study focuses on themes and areas that have been identified as
highly relevant for the modernization and commercialization of the agri-
culture sector. The study originally aimed to review: agricultural marketing,
processing and exports; food safety; agricultural “cooperation,” including
farmers’ groups; agricultural extension and agricultural insurance. This cov-
erage was subsequently modified to: (i) avoid repetition of existing work;
(ii) draw more extensively on WBG experience in other countries; (iii) address
relevant long-term issues more directly; and (iv) to inform discussion of rele-
vant issues on which little information was available. The proposed review of
marketing, processing and exports—an area that has already been well stud-
ied—was thus replaced with a review of global experience in developing suc-
cessful export-led agricultural industries. Similarly, the study of agricultural
“cooperation,” an area also widely studied, was replaced with an analysis of
agricultural land markets. Both “cooperation” and land markets are highly
pertinent to the need to increase farm size to improve competitiveness. Land
markets offer a more structural, long-term response to this problem, however,
a response that so far has received little attention. Finally, an analysis of public
expenditure on agriculture was added to provide insight into public expendi-
ture on long-term versus short-term sector objectives.
   The review outlines the elements of a long-term framework based on
building a cluster-based, institutional framework for horticultural
exports, and suggests the need to prioritize associated development of
agricultural extension, food safety, agricultural land markets and agricul-
tural risk management. Horticulture is viewed as a vector for modernization
and commercialization, due to its demonstrated potential for exports. The
proposed framework would drive growth and change throughout the sector,
however, due to the sector-wide impact of support for extension, food safety,
land markets and risk management.

Chapter 3
The Context for Agricultural
Modernization and
Commercialization
The basis for growth will need to change if Armenia’s agriculture sector is
to continue to enjoy the steady growth achieved since 2000. The real value
of agricultural output grew by 86% from 2000–2015,3 an average of 5.4% per
year, driven by increases in both prices and production. Real prices increased
for many commodities, due to increasing demand on both domestic and
export markets, except for food staples such as wheat, potatoes, milk, poultry
and eggs. The medium-term outlook for continued price increases is weak,
however, due to depressed conditions on traditional export markets and
depressed demand and increased competition on domestic markets.
Moreover, the production increases driving growth were achieved from a
very low base, with crop and livestock productivity levels well below those in
OECD countries with comparable agro-climatic conditions. Further, sus-
tained increases in productivity will require a shift to more modern produc-
tion systems—systems that are ill-suited to the small, semi-subsistence farms
that dominate Armenian agriculture. Slower real sector growth rates since
2012 (annual average growth of 2.2% for 2012–2015) further suggest that the
conditions underlying the price and production increases that drove previous
growth no longer apply.
   Armenia’s strategy for agriculture sector development assigns a high
priority to the modernization and commercialization of agriculture.
Modern production, processing and marketing technologies are needed to
strengthen its ability to compete on domestic and export markets; and a much
higher proportion of output must be sold on these markets if the sector is to
grow and capitalize on its demonstrated potential for export. Realization of
this set of objectives is especially critical in Armenia’s small, open economy;
with its tiny domestic market and limited capacity for government support to
agriculture. A modern, export oriented agricultural sector, built on existing
comparative advantage, is the most realistic basis for future growth.
   Armenia agriculture has been faring well on export markets and there is
potential for further sustained growth. Exports of agricultural products
(wine and beverages, tobacco products, aquaculture products, fruit and vege-
tables), continuing the steady growth of recent years, showed strong growth
during 2003–2015­   rising from US$ 79.1 million to US$398.0 million over the
same period. Agri-export growth was especially strong from 2010–2013,
when it doubled. There has been little growth since 2013, due to low agricul-
tural production in 2014 and deteriorating conditions in the Russian econ-
omy in 2015. Agri-exports remain a major component of total exports,
nevertheless, with 26% of total exports (US$1.48 billion) in 2015. Current

trade and price policies have a limited impact on the competitiveness of
Armenian exports due to Armenia’s liberal economic environment, with its
low levels of trade protection and minimal intervention in domestic markets.
Armenia’s decision to join the Eurasian Economic Union4 (EEU), which
became effective on January 1st 2015, may change this however. Like other
members of the union, Armenia will adopt the EEU’s common external tariffs
after a transition period of 5–7 years. The immediate impact on trade is
unlikely to be significant, as most existing trade is already with EEU members
and bilateral trade agreements already exist with these countries. EEU mem-
bership will thus reinforce both the attractiveness of, and dependence on
Russia for Armenia’s agricultural exporters.
   Future sector growth will be much more reliant on increased productiv-
ity among farmers and agro-processors, and the ability to add value and
compete on export markets. The results of the competitiveness analysis that
was carried out for grapes and apricots shows that they were competitively
priced relative to Turkish exports throughout 2004–2014. The key result of
this analysis is also that, while Armenian products have the ability to com-
pete, their actual competitiveness can vary significantly from year to year.
Hence, to remain competitive, producers and exporters must constantly seek
ways to innovate, improve productivity and lower costs. Realization of future
increases in productivity and exports will thus require a concerted effort to
implement a key long-term theme of Armenia’s agriculture sector strat-
egy—the modernization and commercialization of agriculture. To meet this
challenge Armenia will need to continue to grow its market and develop into
a competitive export industry by turning its comparative advantage into com-
petitive advantage. This will require policies that: improve the enabling envi-
ronment for the private sector, streamline customs procedures, and align
border transit procedures with the regulations of trading partner countries; as
well as investment in transportation and market infrastructure (including
food safety management systems). It is essential to continue to build on com-
parative advantage and, because of the serious constraints the country is fac-
ing, to create a competitive edge through investment in technology, and
physical and human capital. The World Bank’s support for this agenda includes
a review of potential areas for reform and investment and an assessment of
the priorities for action.
   This agenda would also include specific measures to correct gender
inequalities in the agriculture sector. In effect, rural residents employed in
agriculture are often overrepresented among the poor in ECA generally and
in Armenia in particular. Rural women are considered to be especially vul-
nerable because they are often not legal owners of land or agribusiness, and
tend to be employed as lower-skill laborers. These measures could include for
example, encouraging and/or setting quotas for women representation in
decision making bodies, developing financing tools that prioritize wom-
en-headed agribusiness and communicating information about market or
finance opportunities targeted at women (disseminate in places and though
media channels that are more often frequented by women)

Chapter 4
Conclusions and Options for
Sector Reform and Investment
The main conclusions and recommendations of the technical notes are sum-
marized below, as the basis for discussion with government on the main
options for reform and investment.



4.1  Export Horticulture
Armenia’s dynamic, export oriented horticulture industry is a key driver of
future agriculture sector growth—not only because of its inherent potential
to increase production and exports, but also because of expected spill-over
effects to other sub-sectors. The comparative advantage of Armenian horti-
cultural exports is largely based on raw fruit and vegetables, however, as well
as on higher-value commodities produced and exported with modern know-
how and technology. Armenia’s recent accession to the Eurasian Economic
Union (EEU) has also reinforced its high dependence on Russian markets,
the destination of 80% of horticultural exports. Competition is strong in
these markets, particularly for processed commodities; and this competition
will increase further in response to the entry of new competitors such as
Iran, and the Russian government’s recent commitment to boost output of
fresh and processed agricultural products. Hence, in the long-term, the mod-
ernization of agriculture will also need to involve diversification into other
markets.
   An improved enabling environment for production (more efficient pro-
duction and assembly, improved crop risk management) and export (food
safety, customs procedures, border transit) and increased investment in
physical infrastructure (storage, logistics) are clearly necessary for com-
mercialization and modernization. But they are not sufficient. Even with
the improved efficiencies generated by these investments, Armenian
exports will still face significant structural constraints due to the country’s
landlocked location, limited transit routes and distance to major markets.
Hence, the horticulture industry should not seek to compete on cost alone.
The long-term objective should be to build an export industry which
emphasizes quality, high value and product differentiation—obviating the
need to compete on cost alone. This will require investment not only in
technology and logistics, but also public-private partnerships, cluster devel-
opment and the human capital needed to develop a knowledge based
economy.
   Drawing the experience of developing countries that have built a global
presence in horticultural exports markets, the following areas of action are
recommended:


6	                  Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
••   Establish an industry cluster. Work with the private sector and SMEs to
     build up a competitive industry cluster. Start by setting up a platform for
     permanent dialogue in a framework involving government-produc-
     ers-investors/bankers.
••   Attract private investment, especially foreign direct investment (FDI),
     by improving the investment climate and introducing adapted financial
     instruments. Use the experience of “anchor” investors to develop inclu-
     sive supply chain advisory and finance mechanisms, in cooperation with
     commercial banks. There are various models available and tested (aggre-
     gator/processor advisory for outgrowers, tri-partite finance mechanisms
     for inputs, and risk sharing mechanisms) to support competitive supply
     chains with finance and technology.
••   Deepen the knowledge on, and capacity of, the supply base. Increase
     knowledge of the supply base, improve its response capacity and facilitate
     farmer linkages to processors/exporters and markets. Investing in suc-
     cessful food value chains means attracting anchor investors that are able
     and willing to integrate primary production, aggregation/processing and
     marketing/exports.
••   Invest in market research and market intelligence, and promote the ori-
     gin of Armenia. This can be achieved through assistance to find new mar-
     kets, assess market opportunities and implement market development
     strategies. Prioritize high value differentiated products, including branding
     and promotion of the origin through participation in international fair
     shows and international exhibitions. Commission market research to help
     private operators target markets and products more effectively and establish
     the Armenia origin with a strong portfolio of products and technologies.
••   Improve infrastructure and logistics. Intermediate links for aggregating,
     processing and adding value to primary products are underdeveloped.
     These links could be improved by supporting PPPs to invest in marketing
     infrastructure such as consolidation centers for fruit and vegetables and a
     consolidation platform for processed foods. Such centers will allow pro-
     ducers to enter into contracts with buyers for larger batches, optimize
     logistics costs and create a consolidation platform for dried fruit.
••   Enhance competition. Monopsonistic business models are not a substi-
     tute for industry cluster development. Hence, it is important to ensure
     effective competition in parallel to the development of market infrastruc-
     ture. Given the logistical issues related to the transport and transit of
     Armenian exports, it is also critical to ensure highly efficient import and
     export procedures to improve both the cost and quality competitiveness
     of export products. Current inefficiencies in import and export proce-
     dures reduce Armenia’s investment attractiveness and lower the compet-
     itiveness of final products.
••   Ensure progressive compliance with international food safety stan-
     dards, to enhance the capacity for market diversification. This recom-
     mandation is justified and developed in more detail under the specific
     section on food safety issues (see 4.3 below).


Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                    7
••   Improve access to adapted finance and insurance mechanisms.
     Encourage the creation by banks of new, long-term financial products for
     greenhouse and fruits and vegetables (F&V) processing companies.
     Anchor investors experience could also be used to develop inclusive sup-
     ply chain advisory and finance mechanisms in cooperation with com-
     mercial banks.

   Support for these recommendations would mean a significant broaden-
ing of government’s current aim to support private investment in intensive
(green house) horticulture, towards building a competitive cluster of all
horticultural products. This objective is perhaps more ambitious and more
long-term—to build the knowledge and capacity for broad-based moderniza-
tion and commercialization of the horticulture industry. It will require con-
siderable upstream investment to strengthen the supply base, build
public-private partnerships and develop industry-wide platforms for cooper-
ation between the Government and the private sector.



4.2  Agricultural Extension
Armenia’s public agricultural extension system is in good shape, better
than most countries at a similar stage, and requires progressive reform
and development rather than a completely new approach. Its strengths are
that: work plans are based on farmers’ needs, it has good acceptance by farm-
ers, covers most communities in Armenia, and outputs and results are good.
It also generates around 20% of its total costs from the sale of services and
consultancies, with the rest from state funding. This dependence on budget
support means that any decision to cut funding would limit operations, and
likely result in a significant decline in the quality and quantity of services.
Current budget support is very modest, however, in both relative and absolute
terms. The allocation of 346 million AMD (627,000 euros) in 2014 for deliv-
ery of extension services was only 2.5% of the MoA budget. A doubling of
budget support could thus make a big difference to service quality and have a
major impact on sector output, without diverting significant resources from
other budget programs. World Bank studies suggest that investment in farm
advisory services and applied research can yield high economic rates of
return, boosting output more than other public spending on agriculture such
as subsidies. These studies indicated that returns on research and develop-
ment investment average 43% a year, with high returns in all regions of the
world. The level of return depends on the extent to which investments meet
the needs of the small farmers and the rural sector, and on the quality of
spending.
   Based on these considerations, the key recommendations are to
strengthen public extension as the best means to reach Armenia’s small-
scale farms, and to focus on measures to improve the quality of service
delivery. The main role of public extension is to provide public good services
that the market will not supply, including support to small farmers who are

8	                  Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
not in a position to pay for advice, together with a range of activities such as
field trials, demonstrations and mass media messages that are crucial for agri-
cultural development but difficult to charge for. Service quality can be
improved through increased budget support for advisor salaries and trans-
port, continued on-the job training, and wider use of modern information
technologies. There is also scope to moderately improve cost-effectiveness
and cost-recovery, although a target of 30% cost-recovery is considered opti-
mal. Both outreach and service quality are likely to fall significantly if higher
levels of cost-recovery are sought.
   The emphasis on public extension does not preclude a multi-faceted
approach to extension that includes other approaches to service delivery.
The MoA should continue to work with a range of service providers, includ-
ing the MASCs/RASC, local NGOs and private sector suppliers such as CARD
Agro-Service—depending on their comparative strengths and areas of spe-
cialization. The Farm and Veterinary Service Centers model adopted by
CARD holds promise in this regard, although its impact and cost-effective-
ness should be carefully evaluated. FSCs and VSCs also require considerable
public (donor) support and may be better suited to provide inputs for larger
farmers in areas with more intensive production, with advisory services ulti-
mately playing a lesser role. Small farmers and livestock producers in more
remote areas, who may have less access to inputs and advice, may be better
served by the public extension service. Accordingly, it is suggested that the
impact of the FSCs and VSCs are surveyed to assess the number and type of
farmers that use their services, the amount and type of sales generated, the
profitability of the centers, and how the services are rated by farmers. If the
surveys show that they are potentially sustainable, consideration could be
given to relocating the MASC premises to more visible locations and to intro-
ducing a wider array of services.



4.3  Food Safety
After a concerted effort to align its food safety legislation with European
Union standards from 2009–2013, Armenia has recently re-aligned this legis-
lation with that of Russia and other CIS countries—to comply with its mem-
bership of the EEU. This shift has contributed to a lack of clarity in the
interpretation and implementation of current food safety law. A weak capac-
ity for certification, low awareness of the benefits and costs of modern food
safety, limited enforcement of safety standards and poor training pose further
problems, resulting in a low rate of industry certification (40–45 certificates of
compliance issued in the last 7 years). Recommended responses to these
issues are outlined below. All of these measures require active leadership by
the State Food Safety Service (SFSS)—the principal agency for food safety.

••   Strengthen the operationalization of food safety laws and regulations.
     The basis for operationalizing Armenia’s modernized food safety laws and
     regulations lacks clarity. The approach to implementation of Hazard

Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                    9
      Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) procedures is unclear, discour-
      aging investment by industry. Limited levels of inspection and enforce-
      ment by SFSS further reduce the incentive for industry to invest in modern
      food safety practices, especially for smaller enterprises producing for the
      domestic market. A more pro-active role by the SFSS would help to address
      these constraints, including measures to improve the clarity of current
      laws and regulations, an information campaign to publicize these changes,
      and stronger inspection and enforcement capacity. There is also scope to
      introduce greater flexibility in the requirements for compliance, allowing
      for lower levels of investment and less expensive risk management proce-
      dures for smaller enterprises—as in the European Union.
••    Strengthen the quality of national consulting and accreditation. The
      low quality of many national consulting service is slowing the adoption of
      modern food safety systems. The accreditation provided by the National
      Institute for Standards (NIS) also appears to lack adequate international
      recognition. The investments being made by the food industry are thus
      yielding poor returns, reducing the incentives for industry to modernize
      their food safety systems. The SFSS should lead the response to this set of
      issues, beginning with measures to strengthen the capacity of Armenian
      private consulting services. It should also commission an external evalu-
      ation of the accreditation by NIS and address the issues that hamper
      international recognition of their activities.
••    Broaden and accelerate access to international accreditation. Improved
      access to international accreditation services and the international
      accreditation of national laboratories is necessary. Internationally recog-
      nized services facilitate access to a wider range of international markets
      for the more progressive elements of the food industry and set a bench-
      mark for service provision by national agencies and consulting enter-
      prises. Investment in equipment and training is also required to facilitate
      the international accreditation of national laboratories. Broad-based
      measures to motivate and enforce industry compliance with food safety
      laws and regulations will help to increase the current low level of demand
      for international accreditation services.
••    Increase industry awareness of the costs and obligations of modern
      food safety. Industry understanding of the costs and benefits of modern
      food safety systems is poor. On the cost side, food manufacturers often
      view investment in facilities and equipment as the basis for compliance,
      rather than the need to focus on improved risk management. And they
      are often unaware that the costs of compliance include payment for advi-
      sory services and accreditation. More effort is also needed to improve
      industry recognition that the adoption of modern food safety systems is
      an obligation, not a choice. Industry’s focus should be on how and when
      to comply, and how to make these changes cost-effectively, not on how to
      avoid or delay compliance.`An SFSS-led public information campaign
      would help to address this information gap. Industry leaders who have
      achieved compliance should be involved, along with reputable advisory
      and accreditation services.

10	                   Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
••   Establish a vocational or university diploma program for food safety
     training. To date, most of the training for food safety has relied on ad hoc
     donor programs implemented in association with the adoption of EU
     legal and institutional reform—which have now ended. A new generation
     of food industry enterprises is thus emerging, without access to training,
     who need an understanding of the requirements for compliance under a
     very different (EEU) food safety system. Food safety inspectors, labora-
     tory technicians and advisory and accreditation services also need a com-
     prehensive understanding of EEU and international food safety systems.
     In the future, this training should be accessible on a permanent basis,
     rather than through reliance on ad hoc donor support. A vocational or
     university based diploma program is thus needed to provide both the
     public and private elements of the food industry with trained people.
     There may also be an opportunity to develop such a program on a regional
     basis, in order to make it more cost-effective.



4.4  Agricultural Land Markets
Agricultural land markets are weak in Armenia, although recent evidence
shows that they are expanding. Approximately 10,000 ha was sold in 2015,
equivalent to 0.5% of total agricultural land. A further 270,000 ha was leased
out by municipalities. There are no data on private land leasing although it is
likely to be much higher than municipality leasing. A range of measures can
be used to strengthen agricultural land markets, as outlined below.

••   Implement a land consolidation program. A nationwide land consoli-
     dation program is needed to improve the efficiency of land use and facil-
     itate land market development. Government should designate an
     authorized institution to lead this program, and ensure an adequate legal
     framework for program implementation.
••   Improve cadastral data. Inaccuracies in the cadaster result in overlaps
     that inhibit land sales. A systematic registration of state and municipal
     land, forest and land under water should be conducted in order to resolve
     the overlaps with new surveys. As cadastral maps differ from the reality
     on the ground, government should consider initiating mass assessment of
     the existing cadastral maps and implement a systematic re-surveying of
     land parcels/update digital cadastral maps or modify existing maps.
••   Develop a more efficient land monitoring system. Government should
     consider the introduction of an integrated, analytical information system
     to monitor land use such as a Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) or
     Farmers Registry.
••   Improve the efficiency of municipal land lease and alienation. In order
     to facilitate a more efficient and effective alienation of municipal and state
     land, Government should conduct a systematic re-valuation of state land
     and update the cadastral valuation maps. This will help regulate the alien-
     ation process, generate more revenues for the municipalities where land

Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                    11
      is being sold below market price, and increase sales where alienation is
      constrained by high prices. At the same time, there is a need to develop
      guidelines and conduct training for municipalities to increase their
      capacity for land use planning, land alienation and land lease. Local gov-
      ernments should also ensure wider access to information on land alien-
      ation through media and awareness programs.
••    Strengthen policies for abandoned land. All abandoned land should
      first be identified. There will be cases where abandoned land is registered
      and the owner is known, and cases where the land owner is not known
      and not registered. The issue of absentee landowners will also play an
      important role, as some original owners may be deceased or have passed
      their land to others. Policies should be socially acceptable and supported
      by relevant legislation.
••    Improve demarcation of State and Municipal land. Inadequate demar-
      cation has resulted in sale/lease of the same plot by neighboring munici-
      palities. This issue should be addressed by local government, particularly
      where municipalities are to be consolidated or enlarged.
••    Support the development of real estate agencies in rural areas. Real
      estate agencies are well developed in urban areas of Armenia, providing
      area and price information and photos of properties on their websites.
      Equivalent information on agricultural land is extremely limited or
      absent. Instead, it is scattered among municipalities and communities,
      which constrains agricultural land market development and farm enlarge-
      ment. Support for the development of real estate agencies in rural areas
      will help to address this constraint, and strengthen the institutional base
      for rural land.
••    Implement a Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF). A
      Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF)5 is recommended to
      assess the status of land governance. The LGAF is a tool designed by the
      World Bank to help countries assess their policies and practices for land
      governance and to provide benchmarks for comparison and monitoring
      of progress. It has been implemented in over 40 countries including
      Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine and Croatia.



4.5  Agricultural Insurance and Risk Management
Producers of many of the high value fruit and vegetable crops that provide the
base for agricultural exports are highly vulnerable to climate risks, which
destabilize their incomes and reduce the incentives to invest in modern tech-
nology. The Armenian Government is planning to establish an agricultural
insurance program as a means to mitigate production risks. A proposal on
how to proceed with agricultural insurance has been commissioned by the
Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) as the first step towards this objective. To
help inform government consideration of this proposal, the study reviewed
agricultural insurance programs in the following countries in the ECA region:
Albania, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia,

12	                   Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
Macedonia, Montenegro, Russia and Ukraine. The technical note also dis-
cusses program costs and implementation arrangements of insurance pro-
grams in the EU countries, US and Canada as a means of providing further
guidance to the Government of Armenia. It should be noted, however, that
the international experience shows that insurance is not a panacea for pro-
duction shocks. Coverage is unlikely to exceed 10% of the value of agricul-
tural output in the initial years, and unlikely to exceed 50% of the value of
output in later years—even with strong support and high levels of govern-
ment subsidization. Other forms of risk management should thus be actively
supported in addition to insurance, particularly ex ante crop and livestock
management techniques that mitigate risk (e.g. hail nets, frost guns, irriga-
tion, livestock feed reserves, livestock vaccination programs). By reducing
underlying production variability, these risk mitigation strategies also
improve the ability to ensure supply on export markets and reduce the loss of
export earnings. Insurance only compensates producers for loss of income.
   Multiple and named peril insurance (MPCI and NMPI) are the most com-
monly observed forms of agricultural insurance in these countries. Area-yield
index insurance is being piloted in Albania, Serbia and Macedonia. It was also
tested in Ukraine but farmers preferred MPCI products because of their more
comprehensive coverage. There is no positive experience with weather-index
insurance in the region so far. Private insurers provide agricultural insurance
products in most cases, with government subsidizing 50% of the premiums.
A few countries set a cap on the maximum premium subsidy per farm.
Insurance coverage averages 5% to 7% of crop area or total number of farmers
for crops. Livestock insurance programs have even lower penetration ratios.
   This low level of coverage is attributed to: inadequate use of sustained infor-
mation and awareness campaigns for farmers, the co-existence of ad hoc
emergency relief programs and insurance for farmers, corruption, and a weak
capacity to underwrite agricultural risks. Access to re-insurance is also a
problem in some countries, especially where the agricultural insurance port-
folio is very small. The lack of an effective dispute resolution mechanism was
also found to be a constraint to higher use of agricultural insurance.
   Experience in these countries shows that the key prerequisite for successful
program introduction is a pro-active government. A public-private partner-
ship is probably the best platform for the establishment of agricultural insur-
ance in Armenia, but it will need strong leadership from the Government and
pro-active participation by all partners, including farmers. A sustained (2–3
year) program of information and education will be essential to build farmer
understanding and the Government must work actively to build farmer trust.
The current program of ad hoc disaster relief payments to farmers will need to
be terminated or modified, to ensure that farmers don’t have access to both
insurance and disaster relief. In addition to program leadership the
Government should also take responsibility for the enactment of necessary
legislation, the provision of adequate statistics and the establishment of an
effective mechanism for dispute resolution. Both the Government and insur-
ers should also make provision for mistakes and losses during the initial years,
as program development will inevitably be a learning process.

Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                   13
  The agricultural insurance review departs from the CBA study’s recom-
mendations in that it views MCPI and NMPI products as most suited to
Armenia. It also recommends further consideration of group-based area-
yield insurance. Weather index insurance is not viewed as a viable option for
Armenia at this time. The CBA study recommendation to link insurance to
credit programs is also queried. Experience elsewhere shows that financial
institutions do not view insurance as a legitimate form of collateral and so
don’t reduce lending rates for farmers who take out insurance with a loan.6
The use of financial institutions to facilitate insurance distribution and sales
has not been a demonstrable success, and calculation of the insured yield for
credit linked insurance is problematic.
  The other main pre-conditions include:

••    Establish an appropriate legal framework. This is critical but often diffi-
      cult, and may require a strong will from the Government. In the CIS
      countries this critical requirement was often obstructed by old-style
      bureaucracy.
••    Ensure the provision of adequate statistical information. Ideally, statis-
      tical data should be available for 20+ years on each crop type and for each
      administrative unit (rayon, county, taluk, etc.). Historical yield data at
      farm level is also desirable. Further historical data on weather and risk
      events is required to calculate premium rates for MPCI and named-peril
      programs. It is possible to use proxy crop rates and expert judgement
      where statistical data is not available, but this is less reliable and such rates
      should be applied with caution.
••    Build capacity to develop agricultural Insurance. Many of the countries
      reviewed have no insurance companies with strong experience in agricul-
      tural insurance. In others the insurance sector is small and private insur-
      ance companies have limited capacity to underwrite agricultural risks.
      Government should lead support to private insurers in this situation, and
      ensure that they have the time and resources to acquire the capacity to
      deal with agricultural risk. Alternatively, the insurance companies them-
      selves may create a single agricultural insurance company to deal with
      agricultural risks (Hagelversicherung in Austria). Where the insurance
      sector shows no interest in agriculture, government can either establish a
      state-owned specialized insurance company (Crown Corporation in
      Canada), an insurance and catastrophic fund (KANAT in Israel) or sup-
      port the establishment of an insurance pool (Agroseguro in Spain,
      TARSIM in Turkey). Strong regulation of all insurers is also advised to
      avoid subsidy abuse and preserve client trust.
••    Secure adequate underwriting and loss adjustment capacity and access
      to actuarial services. These are more tractable problems, which can be
      overcome in a shorter period of time. Underwriting and loss adjustment
      knowledge can be obtained through re-insurers or via direct contacts
      with insurers in other countries. Experience shows that with moderate
      costs any country can obtain the necessary volume of professional knowl-
      edge and skills within 2–3 years. Basic rate calculation methodologies are

14	                    Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture
     publicly available, and more sophisticated methodologies can be obtained
     at reasonable cost. Some fine-tuning may be required but this can be done
     by outsourcing actuarial services from other countries.
••   Facilitate access to re-insurance. The key obstacle to quality re-insur-
     ance is the small volume of the premium portfolio and the low level of
     technical knowledge within the insurance companies. Major reinsurers
     are not usually interested in reinsurance programs with less than 500
     thousand dollars/euros premium per year. However, these reinsurers may
     lower their qualification requirements if the client/country can prove that
     there is potential for program growth in the future.

   If these conditions are met, insurance coverage could potentially reach 10%
of crop area within 2–3 years of program initiation and 20–30% within 3–4
years. A penetration rate of up to 50% could be achieved within 10 years. A
realistic time-frame of 7–10 years is also essential for the establishment of an
agricultural insurance program, including a pilot program of 3–5 years. This
potential upper limit to insurance coverage also shows that insurance is not a
panacea for agricultural risk management. Even under the most optimistic
scenario, at least half of crop production will not be covered by insurance.
Hence, the Government will also need to support alternative forms of risk
management—including farm level ex ante responses to hail, frost and
drought (e.g. hail nets, frost guns, irrigation). These ex ante risk management
strategies also provide protection against loss of production, the destabiliza-
tion of domestic markets and the loss of export earnings—in contrast to
insurance which only covers loss of income.



4.6  Public Expenditure
Aggregate public expenditure in the agriculture sector7 has increased in
real terms since 2011, although it remains modest at 4.5% of total public
expenditure in 2014. An increase in current expenditure has driven this
growth, due largely to increased direct budget support (mostly subsidies)
for agriculture. In contrast, recurrent expenditure on essential public ser-
vices has increased little—despite a 26% increase in the real value of agricul-
tural GDP. This emphasis on direct budget support at the expense of essential
public services is a concern. A strong public sector capacity for agricultural
extension, food safety, border control and the management of crop and live-
stock diseases are critical for sector modernization and commercialization.
Public investment has also fallen since 2010, although most capital expendi-
ture is still directed to irrigation, water supply and drainage projects. Only 1%
of investment expenditure is currently allocated to measures to strengthen
the provision of public services for agriculture.
  There are strong grounds and adequate scope to re-balance both current
and capital expenditure, in order to provide stronger support for the mod-
ernization and commercialization of agriculture. Continued expenditure
on fuel subsidies, a major current subsidy program, is questionable given its

Modernization and Commercialization of Armenian Agriculture	                  15
disproportionate support for larger farmers and potential for abuse. Other
subsidy programs such as that for livestock breeding stock lack the size and
continuity to be effective. Future budget support for farmers should focus on
a narrower set of measures to support private investment and input supply;
and should be capped to preclude a disproportionate allocation of public
funds to larger farmers. This narrower focus would facilitate a re-allocation of
current expenditure to support for essential public services. Both donors and
government should also increase public investment on measures to strengthen
public and private institutions and to build the knowledge and skills required
for modern production, processing and marketing systems.
   Most of these are all budget neutral recommendations, which are consis-
tent with the national strategy documents. Farm input subsidies improve
access to scale neutral inputs, which benefit large and small farmers alike; and
a cap on these subsidies would limit the transfer of disproportionate benefits
to larger farmers. Increased support for essential public services would also
benefit small-farmers, particularly measures to strengthen the public agricul-
tural extension system, as would stronger donor investment in public and
private institutions and human capital.

                     the logistical issues related to Armenia being
                     landlocked, it will be critical for Armenia to ensure
                     highly competitive import and export procedures
                     to ensure both cost and quality competitiveness
                     of the final produce to be exported. Currently,
                     inefficiencies in import and export procedures
                     negatively affect the country’s investment
                     attractiveness and considerably lower the

                    progressive elements of the food industry and
                    set a benchmark for service provision by national
                    agencies and consulting enterprises. Investment
                    in equipment and training is also required to
                    facilitate the international accreditation of national
                    laboratories. Broad-based measures to enforce
                    industry compliance with food safety laws and
                    regulations will help to increase the current low
                    level of demand for international accreditation
                    services.

                    how to make these changes cost-effectively,
                    not on how to avoid or delay compliance. An
                    SFSS-led public information campaign would
                    help to address this information gap. Industry
                    leaders who have achieved compliance should
                    be involved, along with reputable advisory and

                    trained specialists with an understanding of EU
                    and EEU food safety systems extends beyond
                    Armenia.

                      increase sales where alienation is constrained
                      by high prices. At the same time there is a need
                      to develop guidelines and conduct training for
                      municipalities to increase their capacity for land
                      use planning, land alienation and land lease.
                      Local government should also ensure wider

                      will also play an important role, as some original
                      owners may be deceased or have passed
                      their land to others. Policies should be socially

areas                 land is extremely limited or absent. Instead, it is
                      scattered among municipalities and communities,
                      which constrains agricultural land market
                      development and farm enlargement. Support for
                      the development of real estate agencies in rural
                      areas will help to address this constraint.

                     style bureaucracy.

                     rates and expert judgement where statistical data
                     is not available, but this is less reliable and such
                     rates should be applied with caution.
Build capacity       Many of the countries reviewed have no insurance       MLT, high

Insurance            small and private insurance companies have
                     limited capacity to underwrite agricultural risks.
                     Government should lead the support to private
                     insurers in this situation, and ensure that they
                     have the time and resources to acquire the
                     capacity to deal with agricultural risk. Strong
                     regulation of all insurers is also advised to avoid
                     subsidy abuse and preserve client trust.

capacity and         Experience shows that with moderate costs
access to            any country can obtain the necessary volume
actuarial services   of professional knowledge and skills within 2-3
                     years. Basic rate calculation methodologies
                     are publicly available, and more sophisticated
                     methodologies can be obtained at reasonable
                     cost. Some fine-tuning may be required but this
                     can be done by outsourcing actuarial services
                     from other countries.
Facilitate access    The key obstacle to quality re-insurance is the        MLT, moderate

                     level of technical knowledge within the insurance
                     companies. Major reinsurers are not usually
                     interested in reinsurance programs with less
                     than 500 thousand dollars/euros premium per
                     year. However, these reinsurers may lower their
                     qualification requirements if the client/country can
                     prove that there is potential for program growth in
                     the future.

                                              VI. Public Expenditure
Concentrate           Public expenditure may be more effectively used         Medium term,
public                in fewer, larger and more sustained programs of         high
expenditure on        budget support, and/or re-allocated to strengthen
large programs        the delivery of essential public services. The
                      growing current expenditure allocation to
                      direct budget support for agriculture has been
                      characterized by the evolution of numerous, small,
                      erratically financed subsidy and grant programs—
                      particularly in the MoA. The impact of some of
                      these programs is questionable. Their small size
                      and lack of continuity precludes the transfer
                      of a critical mass of financial resources, and is
                      unlikely to encourage private investment in related
                      activities.
Revise the            Strive for a much better balance between                Medium term,
balance in public     investment in public and private sector institutions    high
expenditure           and human capital, versus investment in

provision of          still dominated by investment in irrigation, water
extension             supply and drainage projects, which accounted
services              for 91% of public investment in agriculture in
                      2014; followed by investment in environmental
                      protection (8%). Only 1% of investment
                      expenditure is currently allocated to support for
                      agricultural services. This is a worrying trend
                      given the need to build a knowledge-based
                      economy with the capacity to modernize and
                      commercialize agriculture and to build a sector
                      driven by agricultural exports.
Increase budget       An increased budget allocation to critical public       Medium term,
allocation to         services is warranted, particularly for services        high

public services       the development of a knowledge economy; and
                      for crop protection, which improves producer
                      capacity to mitigate the risks and volatility of crop
                      production. Very little of the sharp increase in
                      real current expenditure has been allocated to
                      improve the provision of essential public services,
                      despite continued sector growth, as evidenced
                      by a 26% increase in the real value of agricultural
                      GDP from 2010 to 2014. A growing sector needs
                      a growing capacity to provide the public services
                      that assure it functions well. Only food safety and
                      animal health have received increased budget
                      allocations, while expenditure on all other public
                      services has either fallen or been held constant in
                      real terms.
