1.      The last poverty assessment for Rwanda was conducted in 1997. Three years after the
genocide, the country was characterized by deep and widespread poverty, rock -bottom health
indicators, and pervasive hunger and food insecurity. In real terms, GDP per capita was lower
than it had been in 1960. The current poverty assessment has been prepared in very different
circumstances. In real terms, the economy quadrupled between 1995 and 2013. Enrolment in
primary school is near universal and infant and child mortality are among the lowest in Africa. A
large part of the population, including the extreme poor, is covered by public health insurance.
2.      This poverty assessment focuses on the evolution of poverty and other social
indicators over the past decade (2000/1-2010/11). Using data from a variety of sources, mainly
the three household living standards surveys (EICV) and the three Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS) conducted during the past decade, the poverty assessment documents trends in
monetary and non-monetary dimensions of living standards and examines the drivers of observed
trends. The aim of the poverty assessment is to provide policy makers and development partners
with information and analysis that can be used to improve the effectiveness of their poverty
reduction and social programs.
     1. A Snapshot of Poverty in Rwanda
3.     Despite solid progress since 2000, poverty remains widespread and pervasive. In
2010/11 (the most recent living standards survey), 45 percent of the population lived below the
national poverty line, and 24 percent was considered extremely poor (lived below the national
food poverty line). The national poverty line is frugal, witnessed by the large difference between
poverty based on the national poverty line (45 percent) and poverty based on the international
$1.25 a day line (63 percent).
4.      As in many countries, poverty has important geographical dimensions. Half of the
rural population lives below the poverty line, compared to 22 percent of the urban population.
More than 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas. The rural-urban distribution of poverty
closely corresponds to the capital city vs ―rest of the country‖ divide: Outside the capital city of
Kigali poverty is invariably high, ranging from 43 percent in the Northern and Eastern Province
to 57 percent in the Southern Province.
5.       Poverty is concentrated in the south-west of the country. Five Districts in the south-
west have poverty rates ranging from 60 percent to 73 percent and house 23 percent of the total
poor (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The better-off districts are the three districts of Kigali City (poverty
ranging between eight and 26 percent) and the three districts in the north-west of the country
(poverty ranging between 20 and 35 percent). Gicumbi District in the north, though not among
the poorest in terms of poverty rates, accounts for the single largest number of poor people due to
its large population size (Figure 2).

Rwanda‟s Poverty Profile: The Expected…
6.      The poverty profile is largely unsurprising. Next to the geographical dimensions, poor
households are on average larger, have more children and have a higher child dependency rate.
Because poor households have more children, children are overrepresented among the poor: 50
percent of children under 15 live below the poverty line, compared to 40 percent of adults.
Household headed by a younger person are less likely to be poor, although this is likely
intertwined with the life-cycle effect of family formation (younger households have lower
dependency rates).
7.      Lack of education is one of the most salient characteristics of the poor . Only 20
percent of heads of poor households completed primary education, and less than four percent
attained at least some secondary education. Education beyond primary seems to have the highest

correlation with poverty: Poverty headcount among households whose head completed primary
is still high at 42 percent, but drops sharply to 20 percent if the head completed a couple of years
of secondary education. Only five percent of households with a head who completed secondary
education are poor.
8.      The poor depend on agriculture to make a living. 80 percent of poor household have a
main occupation in agriculture, either in subsistence farming or farm wage labor, accounting for
60 percent of household income (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Relative to the second quintile (the poor
but not extreme poor), the extreme poor (the first quintile) are more likely to have a main
occupation in wage labor on other people‘s farms and derive a bigger share of total income from
this activity. Agriculture is the main occupation and income-earner for all but the wealthiest 20
percent of households.

11.    Female-headed households in Rwanda are not at greater risk of poverty. Though the
poverty rate among female-headed households (47 percent) is somewhat higher than the overall
poverty rate (45 percent), this can be explained by factors other than the gender of the household
head. Controlling for these factors, there is no inherent effect on welfare of having a female
household head. This is a marked change from 2001, when having a female head of household
was correlated with lower living standards, even after controlling for a range of other
characteristics.
12.      The bottom 80 percent of the population are remarkably similar. The bottom 80
percent engages largely in the same activities to generate income (Figure 4), derives a roughly
same share of income though independent farming (Figure 5), and live in households headed by
little educated persons (Figure 8). In contrast, the upper quintile is structurally different: Regular
non-farm wage jobs are the most frequent main occupation, only a marginal fraction of income is
derived through agriculture, and educational attainment is markedly higher. This is also reflected
in daily consumption expenditures, which are not all that different for the first four quintiles but
substantially higher in the fifth quintile (Figure 9).

13.    The high stunting rates appear to be more an issue of environmental health than an
issue of poverty or inadequate food intake. While only a third of children in Rwanda have a
minimum acceptable diet, poor diets do not explain the high stunting rates. In contrast, the
poverty assessment finds that inadequate environmental health, defined as inadequate access to
clean water, improved sanitation, and immunizations, is the most robust predictor of stunting,
both by itself and in combination with poor diets and/or inadequate care practices. This is in line
with emerging evidence from African countries and beyond, which document a robust link
between poor environmental health and high stunting rates.

Inequality is high, driven by location, education, and occupation
14.     Consumption in Rwanda is unequally distributed. The bottom 10 percent of the
population accounts for two percent of total consumption, 20 times less than the share captured
by the top 10 percent (42 percent). The top 1 percent captures 14 percent of total consumption,
which is slightly higher than the share of the bottom 40 percent together 1. This translates in a
Gini coefficient of per capita consumption of 50.82. Inequality is substantially higher in urban
(Gini of 58) than in rural areas (Gini of 40).
15.     Education and occupation are the main sources of inequality. Differences in living
standards across education subgroups are high and explain 40 percent of total inequality, while
differences across occupation account for 31 percent of inequality (occupation and education are
of course related). Location is also an important source of inequality: differences in consumption
between households in urban and in rural areas are large, explaining almost a quarter of total
inequality.




1
    This should be interpreted with caution, as outliers may overestimate the share accruing to the top 1 percent.
2
    The Gini coefficient of consumption per adult equivalent (instead of per capita) amounts to 49.0.

Strong performance in health and basic education
16.    Relative to other low-income countries, Rwanda overperforms in the health domain.
Immunization for children 12-23 months is almost universal, compared to a low-income average
of about 80 percent, and a higher fraction of the population has access to clean water and an
improved sanitation facility (Figure 10). This translates into significantly lower child mortality:
Under-5 mortality in Rwanda is estimated at 52 (per 1,000 live births), considerably lower than
the low-income average of 76.
17.    Net attendance in primary school is high and relatively irresponsive to household
welfare levels. 90 percent of children from the poorest 10 percent of households attend primary
school, compared to 99 percent of children from the wealthiest 10 percent of households. In
contrast, attendance in secondary school remains low and strongly correlated with living
standards: Only 11 percent of children from the poorest 10 percent of households attend
secondary school (regardless of age), compared to 78 percent for the top 10 percent of
households. Overall, gross attendance in secondary amounts to 40 percent. Net attendance
amounts to 20 percent3.

      2. 2001-2011: Pro-Poor Growth and Strong Poverty Reduction
18.     While poverty in Rwanda still is high, the trends over the past decade have been
firmly positive. Between 2001 and 2011, Rwanda‘s economy grew at more than eight percent
per year, earning the country a spot on the list of the ten fastest-growing countries in the world.
Strong growth resulted in rapid poverty reduction, with the share of the population below the
national poverty line dropping from 59 percent in 2001 to 45 percent in 2011 (Figure 11). The
fact that poverty is still high in Rwanda hence is a reflection of where the country came from (the

19.    The pattern of growth and poverty reduction differed substantially between the first
and second half of the previous decade. In the early years of the 2000s consumption growth
was concentrated in Kigali City, where only a marginal fraction of Rwanda‘s poor live. The
growth in rural areas was weaker and benefited disproportionally the wealthier households
(Figure 13). The net result was weak poverty reduction (two percentage points) and an increase
in inequality. The experience in the second half of the decade was the exact mirror-image:
Growth was stronger in rural areas than in Kigali City and benefited the poor more than the non -
poor (Figure 14). The net result was strong poverty reduction (12 percentage points) and a sharp
decrease in inequality.

20.     Poverty reduction happened at the borders. Although the districts that border another
country account for less than 30 percent of the total population, they accounted for over half of
the reduction in poverty between 2001 and 2011. Overall, poverty headcount dropped by 23
percentage points in districts bordering another country and 8 percentage points in other districts
(between 2001 and 2011). The border effect is largely driven by DRC and Burundi: In 2001,
bordering DRC did not have an impact on consumption (Figure 15). By 2011 however,
households in districts bordering DRC consumed 25 percent more, controlling for all other
factors. Similarly, in 2001, bordering Burundi was bad for consumption, being associated with
almost 40 percent less consumption. This negative effect had subsided by 2011, explaining the
strong poverty reduction in the southern districts bordering Burundi (although these districts
remain among the poorest in the country).

Poverty Reduction was driven by Agriculture and Diversification…
22.     Agriculture has been the main driver of consumption growth and poverty reduction.
Agricultural productivity sharply increased, in particular in the second half of the previous
decade, leading to better harvests and increased rural incomes. In a statistical framework, the
increase in household-level agricultural production over the past decade accounted for 20 percent
of the total increase in consumption, with the increased commercialization of agriculture (the
increased share of harvests being sold on markets) adding another 12 percent (Figure 17). Taken
together, the improvements in agriculture accounted for one third of total household
consumption growth between 2001 and 2011.
23.      Diversification into non-farm income-generating activities has been the second main
driver of growth and poverty reduction. Over the past decade, Rwandan households have
increasingly taken up activities in the non-farm sector next to their traditional agricultural
activities. Since 2001, the fraction of Rwandan households engaged in non-farm activities more
than doubled to 70 percent, leading to a sharp increase in the average number of income sources
per household. The observed diversification has had two positive effects. First, diversification
has reduced income risk inherent to engaging in rain-fed agriculture as households now have
other income activities to cushion a potential shock. Second, diversification also boosted
consumption: The move to self-employment in small informal household businesses accounted
for 15 percent of household consumption growth between 2001 and 2011, while the move to
non-agricultural wage employment accounted for 12 percent (Figure 17). Increased self-
employment has been particularly important in rural areas, while increased wage-employment
emerges as the main driver of consumption growth in Kigali. Given the relatively low incidence
of poverty in the capital, wage employment has only been of marginal importance for poverty
reduction.

…and Helped by a Drop in fertility and a Boost in Transfers and Remittances
24.     The drop in fertility and the increase in transfers and remittances also contributed
considerably to consumption growth. Fertility rates dropped from 5.8 in 2000 to 4.6 in 2010,
leading to a decrease in the child dependency ratio and an increase in household disposable
income. The decrease in the dependency ratio accounted for 12 percent of overall consumption
growth, similar to the impact of increased transfers and remittances to Rwandan households.
Both of these factors were however less important at the lower end of the consumption
distribution: Fertility rates dropped less for women in poor households and those households
were also less likely to receive transfers and remittances compared to non-poor households.
25.      While all provinces experienced a reduction in poverty over the past decade, the
Northern Province has been the star performer. Poverty in the Northern Province dropped by
21 percentage points, driven mainly by a more than average increase in agricultural production
and an exceptionally sharp decline in fertility. Agriculture emerges as the main driver of growth
and poverty reduction in all rural provinces but the Eastern Province. Consumption growth in the
east, a province particularly prone to droughts, was mainly driven by diversification into non-
farm self- and wage employment.
26.     Qualitative focus group discussions conducted in the framework of this poverty
assessment largely confirm the results of the statistical analysis. Agriculture was most
frequently mentioned as the main driver of poverty reduction, followed by the growth of
different kinds of savings and credit vehicles (cooperatives, Village Savings and Loans
Associations, etc.) which participants perceived as a main driver of the increased non -farm
activity (Figure 18). The increased availability of contraception to limit family size was also a
frequently mentioned driver of improved living standards.

27.     While the focus group participants highlighted agriculture as the main driver of
poverty reduction, they perceived the weather as the main obstacle to sustained poverty
reduction going forward. This highlights a key vulnerability for Rwanda‘s poverty reduction:
The performance of agriculture largely determines the pace of poverty reduction, but is in its turn
overly dependent on unpredictable weather patterns. Given the concentration of households
around the poverty line (both above and below), a bad weather draw could sweep away part of
the gains achieved over the past decade.

Education and Income Diversification Drive Drop in Inequality since 2006
28.     Inequality in 2011 was a little lower than in 2001 (Figure 27). The modest decrease in
inequality was the net result of an increase in inequality between 2001 and 2006 followed by a
fairly rapid decrease in the second half of the decade. The decrease in inequality since 2006
boosted poverty reduction: 3.5 percentage points of the observed 12 percentage-point reduction
in poverty since 2006 is accounted for by the drop in inequality. In contrast, the increase in
inequality between 2001 and 2006 held back poverty reduction.
29.    The reduction in inequality since 2006 can largely be explained by population shifts
across education and occupation subgroups. Between 2006 and 2011, the share of households
headed by an uneducated or little-educated person dropped, while the share headed by persons
with some secondary education increased. As a result, a larger share of households now benefit
from higher consumption levels associated with higher education levels, pushing down
inequality. Similarly, the shift from farm to non-farm occupations increased the share of

households in the higher-earning non-farm category (and decreased the share in the lower-
earning agricultural occupations), having a downward influence on inequality.
    3. Ending Extreme Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity
30.    In a highly stylized and simplified fashion, Rwanda experienced a “textbook”
episode of poverty reduction during the past decade. The reduction in poverty resulted from a
sharp increase in agricultural productivity, combined with (or followed by) a progressive move
towards more lucrative non-farm economic activities. The extent to which these twin evolutions
can be strengthened and consolidated will determine in large part whether the pace of poverty
reduction can be sustained.
31.      Agriculture holds the key for sustained poverty reduction in the short term. Over the
past ten years the poor have moved closer to the poverty line, which means there is scope for
rapid poverty reduction in the years to come. Given that the majority of Rwanda‘s poor live in
rural areas and still depend on agriculture (both self and wage employment) for the bulk of their
livelihood, further improvements in agriculture will likely be the main engine of poverty
reduction over the medium term (keeping in mind the crucial role of the weather). In this light it
is important that the government keeps up its strong investment in agriculture, including the
facilitation of market linkages, building rural infrastructure-not the least irrigation-and enhancing
agricultural skills necessary to raise productivity on small landholdings and make the transition
to higher-value crops which require greater know-how.
32.     Agriculture will however not be able to absorb the rapidly growing labor force. In
the coming decade 200,000 working-age adults are expected to join the labor force each year.
Given the scarcity of farmland in Rwanda, independent farming, for long the traditional
occupation in rural Rwanda, will no longer be a viable option for many of them. Indeed, the
proportion of working-age adults with a main occupation in independent agriculture dropped
sharply from 85 percent in 2001 to 62 percent in 20114. Given the relatively low skills and
education of the labor force, the bulk of the newcomers will not qualify for modern wage
employment in the formal economy. This implies that most of the growing labor force will try to
make a living in the informal sector, both in wage- and self-employment. This is already
reflected in the most recent household data, which shows increasing engagement in agricultural
wage labor and employment in small, micro- and household enterprises. Investing in
apprenticeships and quality vocational training could provide youth with a way out of
unattractive farm wage employment and a pathway to enter the more lucrative and productive
non-farm sector.
33.     As more and more young Rwandans leave the family farm, the role of household
and micro-enterprises in providing employment will continue to grow. In 2011, there were
less than 220,000 wage jobs in the formal private sector, catering for less than five percent of
working-age population5. In contrast, there were 1.27 million household enterprises, providing
employment to an even larger number of people. Even if wage employment in the formal private
sector would double over the coming five years, its share in overall employment would still
remain low in light of the expanding labor force6. While the Government should and is
undertaking the measures to create a modern economy and attract large formal private

enterprises (investments in energy, transport, and ICT, business climate reforms, etc.), improving
productivity in the informal sector needs to be part of the agenda to provide employment to new
labor market entrants. A buoyant informal sector would provide a more attractive alternative than
agriculture and could in the longer-run increase domestic revenues if some of the informal firms
grow and enter the formal sector.
34.    Access to finance, even only small-scale, will be important in facilitating and
sustaining the move towards non-farm livelihoods. Although the Poverty Assessment does not
examine the determinants of the observed move to non-farm activities, the qualitative study
highlighted that successful transition to non-farm activities is inextricably linked to the
availability of finance. The establishment of sector-level Savings and Credit Cooperatives
(SACCOs) appear to have been important in enabling individuals and households to transition to
self-employment activities outside farming. Due to relatively high interest rates and the timing of
loan repayments, SACCOs however remain out of reach for a large part of the rural poor.
Designing and mainstreaming even smaller-scale savings and credit vehicles with modalities
more adapted to the agricultural calendar could help the poor make the step towards bigger
financing provided by SACCOs.
35.     The high rate of chronic poverty stresses the need for continued investment in an
effective social safety net. Given their low levels of human and physical capital, it is unlikely
that the chronic poor will manage to escape poverty by themselves. In addition, the chronic
poor‘s heavy dependence on agriculture makes them highly vulnerable to weather shocks.
Stabilizing and growing the incomes of the poorest will, next to further improvements i n
agriculture, require an effective, well-targeted, and sufficiently generous safety net. In particular,
targeting of the existing social protections programs, which according to available evidence is
weak, will need to be improved to make sure social protection benefits reach the poorest.
36.     What would it take for Rwanda to meet the poverty goals set out in its national
development plans? The medium term development plan, EDPRS-II, aims for the national
poverty rate to be below 30 percent by 2017/18. Vision 2020, the long-term development
strategy, aims to push poverty below 20 percent by 2020. Figure 19 shows the combination of
household consumption growth and inequality reduction that would be sufficient to meet the
EDPRS-II target (blue curve) and Vision 2020 target (red curve)7. Sustaining the pace of growth
and poverty reduction observed since 2006 (red square in Figure 19) would suffice to hit the
EDPRS-II target, but would not achieve the Vision 2020 poverty target. Extrapolating the past
decade trend (blue square) would mean missing both targets. Clearly, making strong progress on
poverty reduction will require strong growth in household consumption as well as significant
dents in inequality. Progress on education and income diversification will be key, as these
factors, next to being correlated with higher consumption growth, also have tended to drive down
inequality.

37.     While this poverty assessment uncovers some of the key drivers of the fast reduction
in poverty over the past decade, more research is needed to better understand the
underlying evolutions. For instance, the diversification into nonfarm activities has been a main
driver of poverty reduction, but what has driven this extremely rapid move to nonfarm activities?
What kinds of people or households have successfully transitioned to nonfarm activities and
what are the specific types of activities they are engaging in? Similarly, what has been the driver
of the recent increase in agricultural productivity? Was it the weather, or have the Government
programs been so effective. Answering these questions will enable a more comprehensive
understanding of Rwanda‘s successful poverty reduction story.

                               Introduction: Framing Rwanda‟s Progress

The last poverty assessment for Rwanda was conducted in 1997 and published in 1998 . The
aftermath of the civil war and the genocide was characterized by widespread and deep poverty
and severe deterioration of health indicators. The share of the population living in poverty was
estimated at 70 percent, up from 47 percent during the 1991 household survey, infant mortality
had risen from 87 (per 1,000 live births) before the genocide to 131 in 1997 and maternal
mortality had quadrupled8. Agricultural output had recovered to only 78 percent of pre-war
levels, leaving many households highly food-insecure and dependent on irregular food aid. Real
per capita GDP had not caught up with its pre-war level and, even worse, was lower than its level
in 1960 (Figure 20).

The current poverty assessment was prepared in a dramatically different situation. In real
terms, the size of the economy has increased four-fold since 1995. Poverty rates have fallen from
59 percent at the start of the 2000s to 45 percent in 2011. Infant mortality stands at 49 per 1,000
live births, one of the lowest in low-income countries9. Enrolment in primary school is just shy
of universal. 70 percent of births are attended by a skilled health care provider10. Food insecurity
and hunger, once rampant in the country, have eased substantially11. A large fraction of the
population, even those in extreme poverty, are covered by public health insurance, which has
significantly expanded access to health care12. Rwanda has become a poster child of business and
investment climate reforms, climbing to the 32nd place on the 2013 World Bank‘s Doing
Business Ranking, leaving countries such as France and Belgium trailing. It has the highest
proportion of female legislators in the world (64 percent).

Why has Rwanda been able to make such progress? Which are the factors that have
facilitated the strong progress on poverty reduction and social indicators? This poverty
assessment will shed light on some of the drivers of the impressive social and economic progress
at the level of the household, and will highlight areas where progress is lacking or lagging. Based
on the findings, the poverty assessment will speculate-in an informed manner-on the sources of
future poverty reduction and will make recommendations on how to maintain or even speed up
the pace of growth in household living standards and how to address the shortcomings. The
poverty assessment will however not focus on the overarching macro conditions that have
enabled the progress. Given their importance, we will nevertheless slightly elaborate on them in
this introduction.

IDA countries (in Africa and beyond). Sound policies and institutions contributed to the strong
social and economic progress witnessed since the early 2000s.
Foreign aid has been an important ingredient in Rwanda‟s progress. Over the past decade
Rwanda has received significantly more aid than other African countries (Figure 22), and has
used that aid effectively to boost development. While Rwanda‘s ability to attract this level of aid
is of course a result of the tangible results on the ground, the high level of dependence on aid
(foreign assistance accounted for between 35 and 40 percent of the budget in recent years) makes
that progress is vulnerable to fluctuations in external assistance.
Next to policies and institutions, Rwanda has been successful in avoiding a return to
violence. This is no mean feat. Large-scale violent conflict, not to mention an event as
devastating as the 1994 genocide, leaves the economy in shatters, the social fabric torn, and a
legacy of atrocities, which together form the ideal breeding ground for further conflict. The
typical country emerging from civil war faces a 44 percent risk of returning to violence within
five years, creating a so-called conflict trap, whereby countries impoverished by violent conflicts
run a high risk of relapsing into conflict exactly because of the sheer extent of poverty (World
Bank, 2003). That Rwanda has managed not to do so is an accomplishment by itself, and has
undoubtedly played an important role in enabling the progress experienced since the early 2000s.

Despite the progress achieved over the past decade, much more remains to be done. Even
after the strong reduction in poverty, Rwanda remains one of the poorest countries in the world.
An estimated 63 percent of the population live below the 1.25 US$ international poverty line and
over 80 percent below the 2 US$ line (based on EICV3 data). GDP per capita only surpassed the
1960 level in 2002. The score on the Human Development Index remains comparatively low
(ranked 151st but steadily moving up) even despite the recent progress. Lack of jobs and the
relatively low levels of education mean that decent employment in the formal sector remains
well beyond the reach of most Rwandans.
The structure of the economy did not change much over the past decade. Fuelled by strong
growth (over 10 percent per annum between 2001 and 2011), the services sector increased its
share in GDP from 43 percent in 2001 to 46 percent by 2011 (Figure 23). The industry sector
also grew at 10 percent per annum, although from a low base, and increased its share in the
economy by two percentage points to 16 percent by 2011. Agriculture, which grew at an average
rate of 5 percent per annum, decreased its share in GDP from 37 percent to 32 percent (Figure
23). By and large, the structure of the economy by 2011 was not very different from the one in
2001.

growth and poverty reduction, focusing in particular on four key evolutions witnessed over the
past decade: the increase in agricultural productivity, the rapid diversification into non -farm
activities, the sharp drop in fertility, and the jump in transfers and remittances. The fourth
chapter focuses on the high incidence of chronic malnutrition (stunting) in Rwanda and examines
the determinants of poor childhood nutritional outcomes. Finally, Chapter 5 explores the
structure of inequality and examines the driving forces behind the strong drop in inequality since
2006. Given the importance of education as a source of inequality, this chapter also explores the
distribution of public expenditures on education.

The main data sources used in this Poverty Assessment are the Integrated Household
Living Conditions Surveys (known by the French acronym EICV) and the Demographic
and Health Surveys (DHS). We draw on the three EICVs implemented since 2000: EICV1
(2000/1), EICV2 (2005/6) and EICV3 (2010/11). The EICVs are LSMS-style multi-topic
household surveys that collect a wealth of information on household demographics, education,
health, agriculture, economic activities and income, assets, and consumption and are conducted
over a period of 12 months to control for seasonality. We also use the three DHS surveys
conducted over the past decade: DHS2 (2000), DHS3 (2005) and DHS4 (2010). In the
framework of the Poverty Assessment, a qualitative study based on focus group discussions was
commissioned to contextualize the findings and insights from the statistical analysis. The main
results from the qualitative study are presented in Chapter 3.
Given the availability of several rounds of the different surveys, the Poverty Assessment is
able to focus on trends and the determinants of the observed trends. The first three chapters
focus on the longer-term trends by comparing the 2010/11 data with the 2000/1 data. Chapter 4
focuses on malnutrition in 2010 and is largely cross-sectional. The final chapter examines the
inequality dynamics between 2006 and 2011, a period during which there was a rapid decrease in
inequality.

1. Introduction
Rwanda posted a strong macroeconomic growth performance during the first decade of the
2000s. Between 2001 and 2011 Rwanda‘s economy grew at a rate of 8 percent per annum,
earning the country a spot on the list of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world. The
strong growth was accompanied by substantial improvements in living standards, as witnessed
by a two-thirds drop in child mortality and the attainment of near-universal primary school
enrolment. Poverty headcount followed the general trend, with the share of population living
below the national poverty line dropping from 59 percent in the early 2000s to 45 percent in
2011.
This chapter will use several sources of data to paint a detailed picture of the evolution of
poverty and household living standards in Rwanda in the first decade of the 2000s. The
chapter has three parts. In the first part we will offer a detailed description of the evolution of
poverty using data from the three most recent ―Integrated Household Living Conditions Surveys‖
(henceforth EICV, its French acronym), implemented in 2000/1 (EICV1), 2005/6 (EICV2) and
2010/11 (EICV3). In the second part we will examine whether the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS), implemented in 2000, 2005, and 2010, corroborate the trend in household living
standards as measured by the EICVs. The third part will present the geographic distribution of
the reduction in poverty.
2. Strong Household Consumption Growth and Poverty Reduction
Household consumption in Rwanda increased by 28 percent in real terms over the past decade,
resulting in a drop of 14 percentage points in the poverty headcount, from 59 percent in 2001 to
45 percent in 2011. In 2011, the average adult in Rwanda lived on US$2.5 a day, with a
significant disparity between Kigali (US$7.6) and the rest of the country (US$1.9).13
Consumption growth over the past decade has been higher for poor households than for non-
poor households, resulting in a decrease in inequality. In Kigali however, inequality slightly
increased over the past decade due to slow growth of the middle class compared to the growth
recorded by both the poor and the rich. Despite the impressive reduction in the poverty
headcount, the number of people in Rwanda who live in poverty declined by only 1 percent due
to high population growth.

2.1. Strong Reduction in the Poverty Headcount
The solid GDP growth in the last decade was associated with a substantial increase in
average household consumption as measured from the EICV surveys. Total household
consumption expenditures per adult equivalent recorded an increase of 28 percent between 2001
and 2011, translating into an annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. While the average household
spent RwF 210,000 per adult per year in 2001 (PPP US$ 707), this had risen to 270,000 in 2011
(PPP US$ 912)14. Consumption growth was a little lower in Kigali (27 percent) than in the other

were constructed and made comparable across survey years, consult NISR (2012a).

four provinces combined (30 percent)15. Despite the slower growth in Kigali, average
consumption in 2011 was still more than four times higher in Kigali (Rwf 844,000 or US$ 2,842)
than in the poorest province (average consumption expenditures of Rwf 184,000 or US$ 619 in
Southern Province) – see Table 1.
The growth in household consumption translated into impressive poverty reduction.
Poverty headcount-the share of the national population living below the national poverty line
(see Box 1) -dropped from 59 percent at the start of the decade to 45 percent in 2011. In Kigali
City, home to approximately 10 percent of Rwanda‘s population, the incidence of poverty
decreased with six percentage points, from 22.7 percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent in 2011. Starting
from a much higher base, all other provinces experienced strong drops in poverty (Table 1): 9
percentage points in the Southern Province, 14 percentage points in Western Province, 21
percentage points in Northern Province and 17 percentage points in Eastern province. The
poverty gap ratio, which takes into account the distance separating the poor from the poverty
line, dropped by almost 10 percentage points, from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2011.
This means that next to the reduction in the proportion of people living in poverty, those who
still live below the poverty line are now closer to it than they were in 2001, which bodes well for
future poverty reduction (see Section 2.2).

     Box 1
             Hanging by a Thread
             Rwanda‟s Poverty Line
To measure the incidence of poverty, Rwanda uses an absolute poverty line defined as a minimum food
consumption basket that offers the required number of calories for a Rwandan adult involved in physically
demanding work. The required number of calories is set at 2,500 per adult equivalent per day, and the cost of a
minimum food basket that provides this calorie requirement is the food poverty line, also called the extreme
poverty line. The food poverty line amounts to 83,000 RWF per adult equivalent per year in 2011 prices (about
US$ 0.68 per adult per day in PPP prices). When augmented with an allowance for basic non -food consumption,
the overall poverty line equals 118,000 RWF (about US$ 0.96 per adult per day). When we refer to the ―poor‖, we
refer to the people living in households with per adult equivalent expenditures below this amount 16. The poverty
line was estimated based on data from the EICV1 survey (1999 -2001) and may be obsolete. A new poverty line
will be estimated based on the EICV4 survey currently under implementation (2013/14).

   The reclassification of enumeration areas following the 2002 census meant that some enumeration areas that were
rural in the 2001 survey were classified as urban following the 2002 census. This implies that the urban -rural
classifications in the 2001 and 2011 EICVs are not comparable and would lead to misleading representations. As a
result, we cannot use the rural/urban dichotomy to compare the 2001 and 2011 data. We can however compare the
2006 and 2011 urban and rural data.

threshold. In 2011, over 80 percent of the population fell below this threshold.

Despite the strong poverty reduction over the last decade, poverty in Rwanda was
relatively irresponsive to growth. While consumption increased by 28 percent, the incidence of
poverty decreased by 24 percent, resulting in a growth-elasticity of poverty of -0.82. The growth
elasticity of poverty measures the percentage change in the poverty headcount for each
percentage change in consumption. Over the past decade in Rwanda, a one percent increase in
average household consumption was associated with a 0.8 percent decrease in the poverty
headcount, which compares poorly with an estimated average global elasticity of -2 (see
Ravallion, 2001 and 2004). For the sake of comparison, Table 2 shows the growth elasticity of
poverty in a selection of countries for the decade between the early 1990s and the early 2000s.
Only two countries in the table had growth elasticities lower than Rwanda‘s over the past decade
(the high inequality countries of Bolivia and Brazil). If Rwanda had had the growth elasticity of
Ghana during the 1990s (-1.19), poverty headcount would have dropped by 20 percentage points
instead of the observed 14 percentage points.
As argued by Bourguignon (2003) and Klasen and Misselhorn (2008), comparing growth
elasticities across countries can give misleading results. The growth elasticity of poverty is
notoriously sensitive to the baseline level of development and the location of the poverty line
relative to mean consumption. More specifically, if initial levels of consumption are low, growth
rates in consumption will be relatively high for a same absolute change, which will lead to an
underestimation of the growth-elasticity of poverty. As such, growth elasticities tend to be higher
in richer countries. As an alternative measure of the sensitivity of poverty to growth, Klasen and
Misselhorn (2008) propose the ―semi-elasticity‖ of poverty reduction. This measures the
percentage-point reduction in poverty for a one percent growth in consumption and does not
automatically increase when a country grows richer (rather to the contrary). Table 2 shows that
the semi-elasticity of poverty in Rwanda was relatively high: A 1 percent increase in
consumption in Rwanda was associated with a 0.5 percentage point reduction in the poverty
headcount. Only three countries in the list had a higher semi-elasticity than Rwanda‘s
(Bangladesh, Burkina Faso and Bolivia).

2.2. No Change in the Number of Poor
High population growth during the past decade meant that the absolute number of people
living in poverty declined only marginally despite the large drop in the poverty headcount .
The absolute number of people living below the poverty line increased from 4.79 million in 2001
to 5.26 million in 2006 and fell back to 4.73 million in 2011 (see Figure 26 and Figure 27).
While poverty headcount dropped by 24 percent between 2001 and 2011, the number of people
living in poverty dropped by only 1 percent (see Box 2).

reduction of all Regions (annual drop of 4 percent
compared to 2.7 percent globally), it also had the slowest population growth (annual growth rate of 1 percent
compared to 2.6 percent globally). The net result was a drop in the number of people below the poverty line from 1
million in 2001 to 0.74 million in 2011.
Table 3 shows the relationship between population growth, the rate of poverty reduction and the percentage
change in the number of people below the poverty line. The absolute number of poor people increased in regions
where the rate of population growth was higher than the rate of poverty reduction. The two regions with the largest
increase in the absolute number of poor (Eastern Province and Kigali) are the regions with the highest population
growth rates: 4.3 percent for Eastern province and 4.0 percent for Kigali. The high population growth in Eastern
Province can be explained by immigration due to the relatively low population density there, and hence the
availability of the scarcest of all assets: land (population density in Eastern Provinces amounted to 180 persons per
km² during the 2002 census, compared to the national average of 321).
Despite the stagnation in the number of people in poverty, there is hope on the horizon . If current trends in
poverty reduction persist, there will likely be a substantial drop in the absolute number of poor over the next ten
years. Data from the 2005 and 2010 Demographic and Health Surveys showed that total fertility rates are dropping
fast, from 6.1 in 2005 to 4.6 in 2010. This drop in fertility combined with strong reduction in the poverty headcount
will-if sustained-translate into sharply falling poverty numbers over the coming decades.

again.
Poor households recorded on average higher growth rates between 2001 and 2011
compared to better-off households. Casual examination of the growth-incidence curve suggests
that average growth rates for the households to the left of the vertical red line were on average
higher than those to the right of the vertical line. The vertical red line depicts the poverty
headcount in 2001 (59 percent). The average growth rate for the poor households amounted to
3.1 percent, which is higher than the 2.9 percent growth rate for the whole distribution and the
2.5 percent for the non-poor. The rate of pro-poor growth, which Ravallion and Chen (2003)
define as the average growth rate for the poor, amounted to 3.1 percent per annum between 2001
and 2011. Table 2 compares Rwanda‘s rate of pro-poor growth with that of 12 other countries.
Only three of the 12 countries have higher rates of pro-poor growth than Rwanda (Vietnam, El
Salvador and Brazil), highlighting Rwanda‘s strong performance in shared growth over the past
ten years (see Box 3).

over the past 10 years. The incidence of extreme poverty dropped from 40 percent in 2001 to 24 percent in 2011.
The government‘s goal is to push extreme poverty below 9 percent by 2018 and eliminate it altogether by 2020.
Shared prosperity, as defined by the income growth of the bottom 40 percent, is on the rise too: the mean growth
rate of the bottom 40 percent amounted to 3.5 percent per year between 2001 and 2011, compared to 3.1 percent
for the poor and 2.9 percent for all households.

The pro-poor nature of growth between 2001 and 2011 can entirely be accounted for by the
exceptionally strong growth rates for the extremely poor. The average growth rate of the
bottom 20 percent of the distribution amounted to 3.7 percent per annum and was substantially
higher than the overall average growth rate of 2.9 percent. Beyond this, mean growth rates for
the poor are actually lower than those for the non-poor (Figure 29). This pattern may reflect the
impact of the policies that were adopted in Rwanda‘s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy

agriculture and social protection schemes.
The distribution of growth was different in Kigali City than in the rest of the country. The
growth-incidence curve for Kigali shows a clear U-shaped pattern, with strong growth for the
very poor and in particular those at the top of the consumption distribution (see Figure 30). The
urban ―middle class‖, the part of the distribution roughly between the 40th and the 80th percentile
recorded relatively slow growth, with mean growth rates between 1 and 2.5 percent per annum
(except for a peak around the 75th percentile). The growth-incidence curve for the rest of the
country (the 4 provinces combined) mirrors that for Rwanda as a whole, with a U-shaped pattern
that is less pronounced than in Kigali (Figure 31)17. The rate of pro-poor growth was higher in
the rest of the country (3.1 percent per annum) than in Kigali (2.7 percent per annum).

2.4. A Small Decrease in Inequality
The very poor recorded the highest growth rates between 2001 and 2011. This resulted in a
declining share of total consumption for the top end of the distribution. Figure 32 shows the
consumption shares of the poorest households between 2001 and 2011. The consumption share
of the poorest 10 percent of households decreased from 1.9 percent in 2001 to 1.8 percent in
2006 but increased to 2.2 percent in 2011, higher than the share in 2001. In a similar fashion, the
consumption share of the bottom 20 percent of household first declined, from 4.8 percent in 2001
to 4.7 percent in 2006, and then increased substantially to end the decade higher than it started
(5.4 percent).
Focusing on the other end of the distribution we find the exact opposite pattern . The
consumption share of the richest 10 percent increased between 2001 (42.8 percent) and 2006
(44.7 percent) but fell back to 42 percent by 2011, still high but lower than the share at the start
of the decade. We observe a similar pattern for the richest 20 percent, who saw their

  Given that the rest of the country accounts for 90 percent of Rwanda‘s population, the growth pattern for Rwanda
as a whole will always mirror that of the rest of the country.

evolutions, consumption remains unequally distributed in Rwanda: in 2011, the top 1 percent
accounted for 15 percent of all wealth (consumption), more than the share of the bottom 40
percent (who account for 14 percent of all consumption – up from 13 percent in 2001).

Given the small decrease in inequality, almost all of the poverty reduction in Rwanda
between 2001 and 2011 can be accounted for by the growth in consumption. Of the 14
percentage point reduction in poverty, 98.7 percent can be explained by growth in mean
consumption and 1.3 percent by redistribution in favor of the poor (the decrease in inequality). In
Kigali the increase in inequality held back poverty reduction: While poverty fell by six
percentage points in Kigali between 2001 and 2011, it would have fallen by 7.8 percentage
points if inequality had not changed.
3. Different Patterns in Both Parts of the Decade
The reduction in poverty over the past decade can largely be attributed to the strong
performance during the last five years. In the first half of the previous decade, household
consumption grew at two percent per year but that growth did not translate into significant
poverty reduction. Between 2006 and 2011 however, consumption growth of three percent per
year translated into a reduction in poverty by 12 percentage points. The difference between the
two sub-periods can be explained by changes in the patterns of growth between and within rural
and urban areas. First, while growth in the first half of the decade was concentrated in Kigali,
where only a marginal fraction of Rwanda‟s poor live, growth since 2006 was largely
concentrated in rural areas. Second, while growth was pro-rich in the first half of the decade,
holding back poverty reduction and increasing inequality, growth in the second half of the
decade disproportionally benefited the poor. This led to a substantial decrease in inequality
which provided an extra boost to poverty reduction. The absolute number of people living in
poverty decreased by over half a million during the second half of the decade.
The graphs in the preceding sections suggest a different pattern of growth and inequality in
the first and in the second halve of the decade. Figure 32 and Figure 33 show that
consumption shares of the poorest households decreased between 2001 and 2006 while the
shares of the wealthiest households increased, resulting in a rise in inequality (see Figure 34).
Between 2006 and 2011 however, the consumption share of the wealthiest fell back to below
their 2001 level while the share of the poorest quintile rose quite substantially (by 15 percent) to
end the decade higher than where it started.
Figure 35 and Figure 36 confirm that the patterns of growth differed substantially between
the first and second halves of the previous decade. Between 2001 and 2006, consumption
growth was higher for the non-poor than for the poor households (Figure 35). The richest
households grew particularly fast during this period. The growth pattern in the second half of the
decade is almost the exact mirror-image: Growth was higher for poor households than for non-
poor households and was particularly strong for the extremely poor: Average growth per annum
for the poorest 20 percent of households amounted to 6.2 percent between 2006 and 2011 (Figure
36).

Between 2001 and 2006 consumption expenditures per adult equivalent grew at a
respectable rate of 2 percent per annum. Poverty headcount however dropped by only two
percentage points (from 58.9 percent to 56.7 percent), as did the poverty gap (from 24.4 percent
in 2001 to 22.3 percent in 2006). Growth and poverty reduction were relatively strong in Kigali
and Eastern Province but weak in the other Provinces (see Table 4). Consumption grew at an
annual rate of 3.1 percent in Kigali compared to 2.2 percent in the rest of the country. In relative

growth in the rural areas was strongly
pro-rich (see Figure 38).
Taken together, the disappointing performance in terms of poverty reduction in the first
half of the decade was related to the urban-rural difference in both the magnitude and the
distribution of growth. Growth in Kigali was strong and pro-poor but benefited only a marginal
fraction of the poor (in 2001 Kigali accounted for only 3.9 percent of the national poor). Outside
Kigali, where over 96 percent of the poor lived, growth was relatively slow and disproportionally
benefited the wealthier households. The net result was weak poverty reduction despite moderate
consumption growth.

     3.2.2006-2011: Strong Growth, Decreasing Inequality and Impressive Poverty
         Reduction
Between 2006 and 2011 consumption grew at a rate of 3 percent per annum compared to 2
percent in the five years before. During the same period the incidence of poverty decreased by
an impressive 12 percentage points and the poverty gap ratio fell from 22 percent to 15 percent

Consumption growth between 2006 and 2011 was pro-poor. The growth-incidence curve in
Figure 36 is downward-sloping, with higher average growth rates for the poor. The decrease in
inequality during the second halve of the decade gave an extra boost to poverty reduction.
Consumption growth alone accounted for 8.5 percentage points (71 percent) of the 12
percentage-point reduction in poverty, while the decrease in inequality added another 3.5
percentage points (29 percent). While the decrease in inequality clearly facilitated the strong
poverty reduction between 2006 and 2011, the relationship is far from clear-cut: the bulk of the
reduction in poverty came from a province where inequality actually increased (Box 3).
The extent to which poverty responded to growth in consumption was radically different in
the first than in the second half of the decade. Between 2001 and 2006 a 10 percent increase
in consumption was associated with a three percent (two percentage points) decrease in poverty,
translating into a growth elasticity of -0.32 and a semi-elasticity of -0.2, lower than any elasticity
listed in Table 221. In the second half of the decade however, poverty decreased by 21 percent
(12 percentage points) following a 17 percent increase in consumption. The resulting elasticity of
-1.25 and semi-elasticity of -0.71 are among the highest of those listed in Table 2.
In sum, the different poverty performance between the first and second halves of the
decade can largely be explained by differences in the magnitude and nature of growth. The
first half of the decade (2001-2006) was characterized by high growth in Kigali and low pro-rich
growth in the rest of the country (except Eastern province), leading to an increase in inequality
and modest poverty reduction. The second half of the decade (2006-2011) experienced higher
overall growth, mainly concentrated outside of Kigali City, and recorded an exceptionally strong
growth rate for the poor, reducing inequality. The net result is a decade of strong growth and
poverty reduction during which welfare gains were realized at each point in the distribution and
in particular for the poor. Despite decreasing inequality, poverty reduction has almost
exclusively been the result of growth.

      Box 4            The biggest contribution to poverty reduction comes from a Province with
                       increasing inequality
Inequality dynamics matter for poverty reduction. All else being equal, a given growth rate will lead to more
poverty reduction if inequality falls than if inequality stays the same or increases. The importance of inequality is
illustrated by Rwanda‘s experience over the past decade: If inequality had remained the same between 2001 and
2006 (instead of increased), poverty would have decreased by more than 5 percentage points instead of the two
points actually observed. If inequality had remained the same between 2006 and 2011 (instead of decreased),
poverty would have decreased by 8 percentage points instead of the 12 points actually observed.

Despite the importance of inequality, the single biggest contribution to poverty reduction in Rwanda comes
from a Province where inequality increased. In the Northern Province, the non -poor grew faster than the poor,
resulting in a modest increase in inequality between 2001 and 2011. This Province accounted nonetheless for one -
third of national poverty reduction, despite it being only the third largest province in terms of population (Figure
39). This pattern can be explained by the Northern Province‘s superior growth rates, which made that consumption
of the poor in this province grew faster than that of the poor in other Provinces, despite growth in the Northern
Province being biased towards the non-poor (Figure 40). This situation highlights an oft encountered finding in
                                                                                          22

It is worth mentioning that the two sub-periods largely coincide with Rwanda‟s two latest
poverty reduction strategies. The first Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP I) was implemented
from 2002 to 2005 and focused largely on the transitional period of rehabilitation and
reconstruction, which may explain the higher growth rate in Kigali during this period. Though
progress had been made during PRSP I, assessments showed that productive sectors, in particular
agriculture, infrastructure and the private sector, were lagging behind in terms of performance
(Republic of Rwanda, 2011). In response, the second poverty reduction strategy elaborated
ambitious programmes to boost the productive sectors, in particular agriculture, and reduce
extreme poverty. This stronger focus on extreme poverty and on the rural areas is reflected in the
second-period data, when growth was higher outside Kigali and benefited the extremely poor
more than it did the less poor and the non-poor. Although the data do not allow attribution, it

appears the focus on agriculture and rural development in the second poverty reduction strategy
paid off in terms of poverty reduction and raising the living standards of the extremely poor.
4. How Real is the Reduction in Poverty?
Since the EICV3 survey coincided with an exceptionally good harvest, it is possible that the true
extent of poverty reduction is exaggerated. Evolution of asset holdings and health and education
indicators measured by the DHS however corroborate the consumption trends measured by the
EICVs. There have been substantial improvements in material living standards and social
indicators between 2000 and 2010, and the improvements have followed the same trend as
consumption: timid improvements or even reversals in the first half of the decade, followed by
strong gains in the second half.

Rwanda‟s record of poverty reduction
over the past decade has been closely Figure 41: An exceptional harvest during the EICV3
linked to its agricultural fortunes. The survey       (2010/11)
                                             (Production index of main crop categories, 2000/1=100 )
weak reduction in poverty between 2001
and 2006 is often explained by the                                    2005/6     2010/11

survey (NISR, 2012). In a similar
fashion, the strong reduction in poverty               300
in the subsequent five-year period can be              250
tied to the exceptionally good harvest
during the EICV3. Except for cereals,                  200

                                                                  Cereals         Pulses       Roots and

however, harvested quantities of cereals
were more than three times higher than in Source: FAOSTAT, 2013
2000/1, the harvest of pulses was 50
percent higher and that of roots and tubers was almost double.
Did the windfall harvest during the EICV3 survey exaggerate the “true” extent of poverty
reduction? Agricultural production has an immediate influence on the consumption aggregate
used to measure poverty. First, households with a good harvest can consume more of their own
production, which would show up in the consumption aggregate. Second, more surplus can be
sold on markets, resulting in extra income that can be spent on other things. As such, it is
possible that a windfall harvest results in a temporary increase in household consumption and a
reduction in transient poverty. In this section we will examine whether the patterns observed in
the EICV surveys can be replicated using data on assets and non-income dimensions of poverty
from the 2000, 2005 and 2010 Demographic and Health Surveys.

4.1. Assets Increase and Human Development is Improving
The DHS asset data broadly confirm the improvements in household living standards since
the early 2000s. The ownership of household durables increased substantially, in particular for
radios (increase in ownership of 27 percentage points), bicycles (ownership doubled to 15

percent in 2010) and mobile phones (less than 5 percent in 2005 and more than 40 percent in
2010-panel A of Figure 42)23. The increase was also notable for rare assets: in 2010, 5 percent of
households owned a television set, up from 2 percent in 2000. The quality of households‘ homes
also improved over the last decade, witnessed by the rising fraction of households living in
houses made of better-quality materials (roof made of aluminum sheeting or tiles, walls made of
brick, floor made of tiles or cement). Access to electricity increased between 2000 and 2010, but
remained very low (less than 10 percent of households).
Sanitation indicators followed the general positive trend. The use of an improved pit latrine
increased almost ten-fold and the percentage of households with an ordinary latrine plummeted
from 87 percent in 2000 to 23 percent in 2010 (panel C of Figure 42). The indicators related to
water are the only ones that do not give a clear picture. The percentage of households who use
piped water (either at home or from a public tap) for drinking purposes decreased, while use of
spring water increased substantially (due to changes in the DHS questionnaires over time, we
cannot make the distinction between protected and unprotected springs). As a clear positive sign,
the use of surface water decreased (panel D of Figure 42). A household‘s source of drinking
water is however more determined by the type of infrastructure available in the community than
by the household‘s own living standards. As such, the source of drinking water may be a rather
poor indicator of a household‘s idiosyncratic wealth levels.
The most salient observation in Figure 42 is that the evolution of asset indicators is similar
to that of poverty and consumption: smaller improvements in the first half of the decade
followed by larger improvements in the second half. This is reflected in Figure 42 by a steeper
increase (in case of a positive wealth indicator) or decrease (in case of a negative wealth
indicator) in the second half of the decade than in the first half. To illustrate, ownership of radios
increased by 10 percentage points between 2000 and 2005, and by 17 percentage points over the
subsequent five years. Similarly, the percentage of households with a tin or tiled roof increased
by 3 percentage points between 2005 and 2010 and by 10 percentage point thereafter. This
pattern is evident for household durables, all housing and energy indicators and all sanitation
indicators, and confirm the trend in consumption poverty observed in the previous section.

  In all likelihood, the explosion of mobile phone ownership stems in large part from the progressive availability of
ever more affordable devices, rather than from an increase in household wealth. No mobile phone data in 2000 DHS.

5. How Did the Extreme Poor Fare?
The share of people living in extreme poverty (below the food poverty line) dropped by 40
percent over the past decade. For those still in extreme poverty, living conditions have markedly
improved. More than 90 percent of children from extreme poor households attend primary
school, up from less than 70 percent in 2000, and almost all extremely poor children are fully
immunized (compared to less than half in 2000). Literacy rates and education have recorded
strong gains and housing quality has improved. Despite the gains, important challenges remain:
the extreme poor have largely missed out on the ongoing fertility transition and while their
children are in school, they are typically several grades behind children from better-off
households.
Between 2001 and 2011, the extreme poor grew faster than both the “non -extreme poor”
and the non-poor (Figure 29). This led to a reduction in the extreme poverty headcount from 40
percent of the population in 2001 to 24 percent in 2011. In contrast to the number of people
living in poverty, the number of people living in extreme poverty dropped substantially: from
3.25 million in 2001 to 2.53 million in 2011, a drop of 22 percent. But are the extreme poor
better-off now than they were at the turn of the century?
Living conditions of the extreme poor improved substantially over the past decade. Figure
44 summarizes the evolution of living conditions of the extreme poor along five dimensions:
housing, water, consumption, health and education. The percentage of extreme poor households
with improved housing (defined as having brick walls and a tiled or iron-sheeted roof) doubled
from 25 percent in 2001 to 50 percent in 2011, while the use of an improved water source
increased from 60 percent to 67 percent24. Real consumption expenditures of the extreme poor
increased by 12 percent over the past decade, but remain extremely low at RwF 77,400 per adult
per year (US$ 0.63 per adult per day in 2011 PPP)25.

   We define durable housing materials as brick walls (oven-fired, cement or adobe bricks) in combination with a
roof made of tiles or corrugated iron. Improved wate r sources include piped water (both in dwelling and on public
tap), protected well, protected spring, tubewell or borehole, and rainwater (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring
Programme).

Children in extremely poor households experienced strong improvements in basic health
and education. According to the EICV surveys, the percentage of extremely poor children
between 1 and 5 years of age who are fully immunized (received full doses of BCG, DPT, polio
and measles vaccines) jumped from less than 50 percent in 2001 to almost universal in 2011 (98
percent). 90 percent of extremely poor children of primary school age attended primary school in
2011, up from 68 percent in 200126. The net attendance rate for extremely poor children is only
marginally lower than the overall rate (93 percent in 2011).
Living conditions of the extreme poor improved along other dimensions as well . Relative to
2001, extremely poor households are more likely to be headed by a literate person (although
more than half of extremely poor household heads were still illiterate in 2011-Table 6). The
highest level of education found in extreme poor households increased by three years from the
second grade of primary school in 2001 to the fifth grade in 2011. The fraction of extremely poor
households owning cattle almost doubled, and an increasing proportion is engaged in non-farm
activities, which typically have higher payoffs than agricultural work. Curiously, more than 40
percent of extremely poor households had a bank account in 2011, compared to less than 1
percent in 2001.

Over the past decade, the extreme poor increasingly took up wage employment . The
percentage of extremely poor households engaged agricultural wage labor, a typically precarious
and low-wage activity, increased from 19 percent in 2001 to 75 percent in 2011. Although
hypothetical, the move to agricultural wage labor is likely related to the ever increasing pressure
on land: between 2001 and 2011, average land size per working-age adult decreased by more
than 30 percent in extreme poor households. On a more positive note, engagement in non-farm
wage activities and non-farm self-employment, which are typically better paid, also increased.
Extremely poor households diversified their income-generating portfolio. In 2001, more than
65 percent of extremely poor households engaged in only one income-generating activity (among
the four broad activity categories listed in Table 6: independent farming, farm wage labor,
independent non-farm business, non-farm wage labor). By 2011, less than 10 percent of
extremely poor households had only one income activity. The majority (42 percent) engaged in
two of the four broad income-generating categories while 37 percent engaged in three. As a
result, the average number of income sources of the extreme poor increased from 1.4 in 2001 to
2.5 in 2011, reducing the inherent risk of relying on one single source of income.

Despite the improvements in the lives of the extreme poor since 2001, many challenges
remain. While enrolment in primary school among extremely poor children is almost at par with
the national average, access to secondary schooling remains problematic: Net attendance in
secondary school amounts to 9 percent for girls and boys from extremely poor households, less
than half the national average of 21 percent. The disparity is even bigger looking at gross
attendance: 17 percent for the extreme poor vs. more than 40 percent nationally. The inability of
extremely poor households to pay secondary school fees risks reproducing poverty across
generations.
For primary education, the large increase in enrolment masks other difficulties, mainly
related to late entry and excessive repetition of grades. To illustrate, Figure 45 plots the
probability of a 12-year-old (who is
theoretically supposed to be in sixth grade) Figure 45: Extremely poor children are likely to
being in the different grades of primary be several grades behind

6. The Geography of Poverty Reduction
The reduction in poverty over the past decade has largely happened at the borders. Districts that
share a land border with another country experienced strong growth and poverty reduction,
while districts in the hinterland or districts that have a natural border lagged behind. Poverty
reduction was particularly rapid in the northern districts bordering DRC and the southern
districts bordering Burundi. Overall, poverty declined by 23 percentage points in the border
districts vs 8 percentage+ points in the other districts.
Over the past decade, the incidence of poverty decreased substantially in all of Rwanda‟s
provinces. The pace of the decrease differed across provinces, ranging from 13 percent in the
Southern Province to 33 percent in the Northern Province (Table 1). Given that there only five
provinces, it is likely that there was substantial within-province variation in the pace of poverty
reduction. In this section we take a closer look at the evolution of poverty at the level of lower
administrative units.
Examining the geography of poverty reduction in Rwanda is complicated by the
administrative reorganization of 2006. Until 2006, Rwanda consisted of 12 so-called
Prefectures, and all surveys (including EICV1 and EICV2) were representative at the level of the
Prefecture. Following the reorganization, Rwanda was divided into 5 new Provinces, subdivided
into 30 Districts. All surveys since are representative at the level of the Districts (such a s
EICV3). This means that there is no consistent geographic basis to monitor the evolution of
poverty.
For this exercise, we will explore the evolution of poverty at the level of the new Districts.
Following the administrative reorganization, households sampled for the EICV1 and EICV2
surveys were retroactively mapped to the new Districts, making a District-level comparison
possible. This comes however with a health warning: the EICV1 and EICV2 surveys were
representative at the level of the old Prefectures, not the new Districts. As there are more
Districts than there were Prefectures, District-specific sample sizes in EICV1 and EICV2 are too
small to give a representative picture (next to other potential biases). As such the District poverty
headcounts from EICV1 and EICV2 need to be treated with caution.

                                                                                                  48

Keeping the caveats in mind, the spatial distribution of poverty changed considerably over
the course of the previous decade. At the turn of the century, poverty was concentrated in the
South, South-West and North of the country (darker colors indicate a higher poverty headcount
in Figure 47). The Southern Districts of Bugesera and Nyaruguru had poverty headcounts above
84 percent. By 2006, poverty was still largely concentrated in the Southern and Western parts,
while in the Districts up North the incidence of poverty had somewhat declined (Figure 48). The
2011 poverty map looks substantially different: first, the map is dominated by brighter colors, a
result of the strong poverty reduction between 2006 and 2011, and second, the districts up North
that were among the poorest in 2001 are now among the least poor (Figure 49). Poverty in 2011
remained concentrated in the South-Western pocket of Rwanda bordering Burundi (to the South)
and Lake Kivu (to the West).
Visual inspection of the poverty maps suggests that the reduction in poverty was
concentrated in the northernmost and, to a lesser extent, southernmost parts of the
country. In contrast, the central and some of the eastern and western parts seem to have
experienced only modest decreases in poverty. This comes out clearly in Figure 50 and Figure
51, which show the reduction in poverty between 2001 and 2011 and 2006 and 2011,
respectively. Districts in the north and south of the country recorded exceptionally strong poverty
reduction (especially between 2006 and 2011), while districts bordering Lake Kivu and on
eastwards towards Kigali experienced only modest decreases, and in some cases even increases,
in poverty. Southern districts experienced strong poverty reduction too, but they remain among
the poorest in the country.
Poverty reduction in Rwanda seems to have happened at the borders. The northern districts
bordering Uganda and DRC (Burara, Musanze, Nyabihu, Rubavu) experienced record declines in
poverty, as did the southern districts bordering Burundi (Bugesera, Gisagara, Nyaruguru). In
contrast, the districts in the hinterland achieved only minor declines in poverty, with poverty
headcounts even increasing in several districts (keeping in mind the caveat of
representativeness). Curiously, border districts that do not border another country (such as those
bordering Lake Kivu to the west or Akagera national park to the east) did not experience the
same ―border-effect‖ (poverty hardly changed there). Overall, poverty headcount dropped b y 23
percentage points in districts bordering another country and 8 percentage points in other districts
(between 2001 and 2011). The next chapter will elaborate more on the border effects.
To summarize, Rwanda experienced an episode of exceptionally strong growth and poverty
reduction during the past decade, and in particular since 2006. Consumption growth was
pro-poor, resulting in a modest drop in inequality that gave an extra push to poverty reduction.
While the increase in living standards was broad-based, the Northern Province experienced the
strongest consumption growth and fastest poverty reduction, and accounted for one-third of the
national reduction in poverty between 2001 and 2011. Trends in non-monetary dimensions of
welfare confirm the positive evolution, witnessed by substantial improvements in household
assets and strong improvements in child health and education. The next chapter will explore in
depth the characteristics of the poor and how or if these characteristics have changed over time.

1. Introduction
The previous chapter summarized the poverty and inequality dynamics over the past
decade. This chapter will focus on profiling the poor in terms of a range of characteristics and
will examine the key correlates of poverty. As we are interested in the ―current‖ characteristics
of the poor, this chapter will use data from the EICV3 survey (2011) to construct the poverty
profile. In examining the main correlates of poverty, we will however also explore if and how
these correlates have changed over time.
2. The 2011 Poverty Profile
Rwanda has a traditional poverty profile. The poor tend to live in rural areas in large
households with high dependency rates, headed by an older and little-educated household head.
Poor households are relatively isolated from key infrastructure and depend heavily on
agriculture, deriving the bulk of total income though subsistence and wage farming. Female-
headed households are somewhat more likely to be poor, though the difference is small and has
narrowed significantly since 2001. Poverty disproportionally affects the young: 50 percent of
children (under 15) are poor, compared to 40 percent of adults. A salient finding is that the
correlates of poverty are remarkably flat up until the fourth consumption quintile: in absolute
terms, the bottom 80 percent of the population looks relatively similar.

     2.1.      Poverty has a strong regional dimension
Poverty in Rwanda is concentrated in the southwest. The Southern and Western Provinces
have the highest poverty rates (57 percent and 48 percent, respectively) and account for more
than half (56 percent) of national poverty. Kigali by contrast is the least poor province,
contributing only 3 percent to overall poverty, substantially lower than its population share
(approximately 10 percent-see Annex Table 1).
Poverty is predominantly rural. Close to half of the rural population lives below the poverty
line, compared to 22 percent of the urban population. 93 percent of the poor live in rural areas.
The spatial dimension of poverty is closely linked to the rural-urban divide: Outside the main
urban agglomeration (Kigali Province), poverty is high, ranging from 43 percent in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces to 57 percent in the Southern Province (Annex Table 1).
The spatial distribution of the poor largely corresponds to the distribution of poverty.
Poverty rates are highest in the districts in the southwest (Figure 52), which also house the
largest number of poor people (Figure 53). There is one exception: Gicumbi district in Northern
Province is not among the poorest in terms of poverty rates, but nevertheless accounts for the
single largest poor population (6 percent of the national poor live in Gicumbi). Four districts in
Rwanda account for over 20 percent of the poor population: Gicumbi, Nyamasheke, Nyamagabe,
and Karongi (Figure 51).

   2.2.       The poor live in large households with high dependency rates
Poor households tend to be larger than non-poor ones. In 2011, extreme poor households had
on average one family member more than non-poor households (Table 7). This difference is
driven entirely by the higher number of children in poor households: while the average extremely
poor household had 2.8 children (below the age of 15), the average non-poor household only had
1.7. Given that the number of adults does not differ significantly across welfare groups, this
means that the strain on household resources is higher for poor households. This is illustrated by
the dependency ratio (the number of dependent children per working-age adult in the household),
which is more than 60 percent higher for poor than for non-poor households (Table 7).

Dependency ratios are strongly correlated with poverty. Households with less than 0.5
dependent children per working-age adult have an average poverty rate of 30 percent, while
households with dependency rates in excess of 2 have poverty rates of more than 60 percent
(Figure 54). More than 20 percent of the poor have dependency rates in excess of 2, compared to
16 percent of the overall population.

percent of children live below the extreme poverty line, compared to 21 percent for people aged
15 or more).

   2.3.    Younger and male-headed households less likely to be poor
Looking at the characteristics of the household head, we find that households with younger
heads are less likely to be poor. Poverty among households with a head aged 14 to 30 amounts
to 34 percent and this increases to approximately 50 percent for households with a head aged 38
to 58 (Annex Table 1). Poverty then decreases again among households with older heads (older
than 58). The age-effect is probably partly explained by its relation to household composition:
young households usually have lower dependency rates (family formation is only just
beginning), while households with a head aged 38-58 typically have many mouths to feed.
Dependency rates decrease again for older households as children get married and form their
own households.
Female-headed households are somewhat more likely to be poor, though the gap has
narrowed since 2001. In 2011, 47 percent of female-headed households lived below the poverty
line, compared to 44 percent of male-headed ones. This is a marked improved from 2001, when
65 percent of female-headed households were below the poverty line (compared to 56 percent for
male-headed ones).
The relation between age and poverty is Figure 56: Tough old ladies
different for female- and male-headed (Poverty headcount for female and male-headed households, by
                                             age)

male-headed households peak at the age of                           Male              Female

(Figure 56). At younger ages, male-headed     40%

              Poverty among female-headed households
              Female-headed households are worse-off only if there was a man involved
Households headed by women are worse-off only if the women are young (Figure 56). Why is it that
households headed by young women perform badly, both in comparison with men of the same age and with older
women? One part of the answer can be found by looking at the reason why these women are heads of household.
                                                                    Figure 57: Different kinds of female-headed

Household headed by single women are Source: EICV, 2011. World Bank staff calculations
significantly less likely to be poor. Needless to
say, this finding is far from causal but driven by several selection effects: Single female heads of household are on
average more educated, younger and live in smaller families than the average household head. They are also more
likely to live in urban areas. And they are still a lot worse off than households headed by single men, where
poverty amounts to only 10 percent.

     2.4.      The poor are largely unskilled
A salient characteristic of the poor all around the world is their general lack of education
and skills. In Rwanda, lack of education is a general characteristic of household heads, not only
of the poor: 67 percent of all household heads are unskilled (did not complete primary
education), and this increases to 77 percent for poor households. There is a strong link between
education and poverty: Poverty is highest among households with a head who never went to
school, and decreases with each extra level of education (Figure 58). Education beyond the
primary level seems to have the biggest returns in terms of poverty reduction: Households whose
head has some education beyond primary have poverty rates that are less than half of those of
households whose head completed primary but did not start secondary.
Educational attainment of household heads is low and largely flat for the bottom 80 percent
of households. 18 percent of household heads in the bottom quintile (the extreme poor)
completed primary education, and this increases modestly to 23 percent in quintiles two and
three and 29 percent in the fourth quintile (Figure 59). 55 percent of household heads in the top
quintile completed at least primary education, double the percentage in the fourth quintile but
still low. Secondary education is even flatter: slightly more than one percent of household heads
in the fourth quintile completed secondary education, compared to 0.3 percent in the first three
quintiles. In the top quintile secondary completion shoots up sharply but remains below 20
percent.

Overall, lack of education is not only an attribute of the poor but rather a general
characteristic of the bottom 80 percent of the population. This is unsurprising given the low
living standards even in the upper quintiles. Converted to 2005 PPP, daily per capita
expenditures are below the international poverty line for the first three quintiles (Figure 60).
While average expenditures in the fourth quintile exceed the $1.25 a day line, households in this
quintile are hardly living large (daily expenditures of USD 1.6). Only the households in the top
20 percent of the consumption distribution seem to live on a reassuring distance from the poverty
line. Over 80 percent of the population lives below PPP USD 2 a day.

Educational attainment of household heads increased modestly between 2001 and 2011.
The percentage of household heads who completed primary school increased from 26 percent to

primary school. As household heads typically stay on for long, the slow pace of the increase in
average educational attainment is not surprising.

       2.5.      The poor depend on agriculture
While agriculture is the mainstay of employment in Rwanda as a whole, it is particularly
important for the livelihoods of the poor. Overall, 71 percent of households in Rwanda have
their main occupation in agriculture (independent agriculture of wage farming), but this increases
to well over 80 percent for the bottom two quintiles (Figure 61)27. Similar to the findings on
education and consumption, the occupational structure of the bottom 80 percent of households is
remarkably similar: 70 percent of households in the fourth quintile still engage in agriculture as a
main occupation and the percentage engaged in wage employment in the non-farm sector as
main occupation (16 percent) is not that much higher than in the bottom quintile (11 percent).
Again, the top quintile seems structurally different: Almost 70 percent of households in this
quintile have a main occupation outside agriculture (Figure 61).
While the bottom 80 percent of households are largely agricultural, there is a difference in
the type of agricultural work they engaged in. Agricultural wage labor is most common
among the poorest, being the main occupation for 15 percent of households in the bottom
quintile (red bars in Figure 61). The prevalence of this type of labor decreases in each successive
consumption quintile. Independent farming in contrast follows an inverted-U pattern, increasing
from the first to the second quintile (probably because of the small landholdings in the first
quintile) and gradually decreasing after. The percentage of households engaging in independent
farming as main occupation is approximately the same in the first as in the fourth quintile.
Non-farm occupations are most common in the upper consumption quintiles. About 15
percent of households in the bottom two quintiles have a main occupation outside agriculture,
and this rises to 20 percent in the third quintile, 30 percent in the fourth quintile, and 70 percent
in the top ((Figure 61). In each quintile, wage employment is more prevalent that self-
employment in the non-farm sector. Having a main occupation outside farming is strongly
related to better living standards: Households with a main occupation outside agriculture have
poverty rates of 22 percent (self-employment) or 28 percent (wage employment), compared to 52
percent or 75 percent for independent farming or wage farming, respectively.

labor consistently decreases with higher
consumption levels.

    2.6.     The poor are relatively isolated
The poor tend to live in remote areas. Approximately 60 percent of households in the bottom
quintile have to walk for at least one hour to reach the closest market, health center, or public
transport stop (Figure 63). In the top quintile, less than 30 percent of households are that remote.
The biggest differences in accessibility between the bottom and top quintile are observed for
markets, health centers, and public transport. Access to all weather roads is fairly evenly
distributed, as is access to primary schools (not shown in Figure 45).

Remoteness from key infrastructure can potentially have adverse effects. Remoteness from
markets and public transport may induce farmers to sell at lower farm-gate prices to traders,
hereby foregoing the premium of getting a higher price either on the local market or in a nearby
bigger (urban) market. It also increases the costs of purchased goods because of higher transport
costs. Remoteness from health centers may result in individuals not seeking care when needed
(because of transportation costs) or urgent care administered belatedly, with potential detrimental
health consequences, particularly for children and pregnant women.
Access to infrastructure is relatively similar in the first four consumption quintiles . While
households in the fourth quintile are generally closer to key infrastructure than households in the
previous quintiles, the differences are small. The top quintile is different, with much better
connectivity. This is partly because households in the top quintile are more likely to live in urban
areas: 35 percent of households in the top quintile are urban, compared to less than 9 percent in
the four other quintiles. This however does not jeopardize the basic message: Even focusing only
on rural areas, we find that access to infrastructure is significantly better for wealthier than for
poorer rural households.
Isolation from infrastructure is strongly related to poverty. Based on a factor analysis of the
distance to infrastructure variables in the EICV3 we create an isolation index, with higher values
on the index proxying remoteness from key infrastructure. Poverty headcount in the most
connected quartile (lowest scores on the index) amount to 27 percent and increases to 45 percent
in the second most connected quartile (Figure 64). In the least connected quartiles, poverty rates
average 54 percent.

All figures presented so far are merely
bivariate correlations and do not control for the influence of other characteristics. For
instance, it is possible that households in the southwest of the country are not more likely to be
poor just because of their location, but because of other characteristics that may be more
prevalent there (such as low education levels, poor connectivity, etc.). Similarly, the finding that
poverty rates are higher in female-headed households may not be due to a pure gender effect, but
due to women having other characteristics that correlate with higher poverty (such as lower
education). The next section will provide a more robust analysis of the correlates of poverty by
controlling for the effects of confounding factors in a regression framework.
3. Correlates of poverty
Education, occupation, and location are the main correlates of poverty. In terms of consumption,
returns to education are high, especially at post-primary levels. While a household headed by
someone who completed primary education has consumption levels that are 19 percent higher
relative to a similar household with no education, this increases to over 50 percent for
households headed by someone with some secondary education. Having a main occupation in
agriculture significantly decreases consumption, in particular for agricultural wage
employment. Effects of location are important and have changed substantially during the past
decade. In particular, the effect of sharing a border with DRC or Burundi has strengthened
tremendously over the past decade, resulting in strong consumption growth and poverty
reduction in the border districts, possibly due to the improved regional security situation.
Finally, controlling for other factors, having a woman head of household is unrelated to
household consumption levels.
We conduct a number of analyses with various explanatory variables (―covariates‖) of
consumption classified into two broad groups: (i) one set of covariates that summarize the non -
geographic attributes of a household, such as age, level of education, demographic composition,
occupation, etc., denoted by vector D; and (ii) a set of variables that summarize the geographic
attributes of a household, denoted by vector G.
Specifically, the set of covariates summarized by vector D consists of variables characterizing
the demographic composition of the household are listed below.


                                                                                                                     61

     Dependency ratio: number of economically dependent children per working-age adult;
     Gender of the household head: Dummy (1 if female, 0 if male);
     Age of the household head (years).
     Education: binary variables identifying the highest education level attained by the household
     head (primary incomplete, primary complete, post-primary incomplete, post-primary
     complete, secondary incomplete, secondary complete, and superior education);
     Occupation: binary variables for the income source of the household: farm wage
     employment, non-farm wage employment, independent farm employment, independent non-
     farm wage employment.
     Infrastructure access: Dummies for distance to key infrastructure (primary school,
     secondary school, health center, public transportation, main road, main market). For each
     infrastructure variable, three categories are defined: near, far and very far, with the first
     variable left out of the regressions as reference variable. In EICV3 data, ―far‖ implies a
     travel time of 1-2 hours, and ―very far‖ implies a required time of at least two hours to reach
     a destination. In EICV1 sample, ―far‖ implies a distance 10-20 kms to nearest health center
     or market, and ―very far‖ implies a distance of more than 20 kms. There is no information
     on distance to secondary schools in 2001, and the variables on primary school as well as on
     transportation were omitted due to a limited number of observations.
The covariates summarized by vector G include the following geographic attributes of the
household:
     Province: Dummies for province (Southern province is left out as reference);
     Border district: Chapter I showed that poverty reduction in Rwanda was driven by the
     border districts. To examine whether this holds when also controlling for other factors, we
     create a series of dummies indicating whether the district has a land border with another
     country. Districts that border a natural barrier (lake, national park) are not considered border
     districts in the analysis. To explore the importance of the neighboring country, we create
     separate dummies for districts bordering Burundi (Gisagara, Nyaruguru and Bugesera, but
     not Ngoma due to small size of land border), DRC (Rubavu, Rusizi and Musanze), Tanzania
     (Kirehe), Uganda/Tanzania (Nyagatare), and Uganda (Burera, but not Gicumbi due to small
     size of land border);
The model can be specified as follows:
                                                                            (1)
                                                                            (2)
where C is the vector of household consumption per adult equivalent (in Rwandan Franc using
2001 prices), is the intercept, and is the error term. The regressions are performed separately
for rural (denoted R) and urban (denoted U) households to rule out potential structural
differences that could result in different determinants of poverty.
Models (1) and (2) are based on data from EICV3, i.e. calendar years 2010/2011. Due to a
reclassification of enumeration areas following the 2002-census, the urban-rural distinction of
households surveyed in 2011 is not directly comparable with the 2001 survey (EICV1). Instead,
data at the provincial level, comparing Kigali to the rest of the country, provides a rough estimate
of the urban-rural difference in 2001 and 2011. Due to comparatively few observations for Kigali

                                                                                                  62

in 2001, the comparison of the poverty correlates in 2001 and 2011 is only presented for rural
areas. In the regression summary presented in Annex 2, Models (3) and (4) represent different
versions of (1), using Kigali as a rural/urban divider for 2011, and 2001, respectively.
While the dependent variable in the specifications presented above is the logarithm of
consumption, some regressions in the literature on poverty are based on probit regressions to
analyze the determinants of poverty. The disadvantage of analyzing poverty as a binary
(poor/non-poor) variable is that relevant information (the distribution of consumption) is thrown
away, making the results difficult to interpret, should there be a change in the poverty line.
Therefore, we use the probit regressions only as robustness checks. The models are defined as
follows:
                                                                                    (5)
                                                                                    (6)
Again, Model (5) is repeated using Kigali as the rural/urban divider to define Model (7) for 2011
data, and Model (8) using 2001 data. Detailed regressions outcomes are presented in the Annex
2.
In the following sections, we discuss and compare the findings on the main poverty correlates for
two different strata: (i) rural versus urban Rwanda in 2011, and (ii) rural Rwanda 2011 versus
rural Rwanda in 2001. Finally, note that the analysis only sheds light on the factors that are
closely correlated with poverty, without necessarily implying causality.

   3.1.    Demographic correlates
Controlling for other variables, dependency ratios are significantly correlated with
consumption levels. Each 0.1 increase in the dependency ratio is associated with 2 percent less
consumption in rural areas and 3 percent less consumption in urban areas (Figure 65). Though
dependency ratios significantly decreased over the past decade (Table 7), its effect on
consumption has increased. In rural areas, the negative effect of high dependency ratios almost
doubled from 10 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2011 (Figure 66). As noted earlier, this may be
explained by the fact that the poor have lagged behind in the demographic shift towards lower
dependency ratios.
Next to dependency rates, larger households in general have lower living standards. The
association, while statistically significant, is however modest: In rural areas, one extra household
member reduces consumption levels by slightly more than four percent while in urban areas, it
reduces consumption by three percent (Figure 65). This suggests that it is really the age
composition of the household, rather than its size, that matters for living standards.
When controlling for the influence of other variables, the gender of the household head
does not matter for household consumption level. While poverty among female-headed
households (47 percent) is somewhat higher than the average, this does not appear to be caused
by having a female head but rather by other variables that are controlled for in the analysi s
(Figure 65). This is a sharp change compared to 2001, when households headed by women had

The easing of the negative gender effect may be explained by a number of efforts over the
past decade close the gender gap. In 2003 for instance, Rwanda adopted one of the world‘s
most progressive constitutions in terms of its commitment to equal rights for all, gender equality
and women‘s representation. With 64 percent female representation in Parliament—Rwanda far
exceeded the 30 percent constitutional requirement and became the first country in the world
with the highest female representation in decision making institutions. Rwanda is one of few
economies in the world that have established quotas for women on boards of publicly listed

Age of the household head does not matter for consumption. The descriptive finding in the
previous section that households with younger heads are less likely to be poor can thus be

explained by other variables that are correlated with age, most likely education (younger heads
of household tend to be more educated) and dependency ratios (household with younger heads
have lower dependency ratios).

     3.2.      Returns to education are high
Education is by far the main correlate of poverty, both in rural and urban areas. In urban
areas, each higher level of education is associated with larger consumption gains. While having
completed only a few years of primary school adds 4 percent to consumption, a full cycle of
primary education already adds 27 percent (Figure 65). The returns are even bigger at the
secondary level: Having completed a couple of years at the secondary level adds 70 percent to
consumption, while having completed secondary school basically doubles consumption (relative
to households with an uneducated head). Households headed by someone who enjoyed higher
education (whether completed or not) have the highest consumption levels, all else being equal.
Returns to education (in terms of consumption) are lower in rural than in urban areas. The
effect of different levels of education is generally larger for urban areas, with two notable
exceptions: First, incomplete primary education is significantly related to higher consumption
levels in rural areas but not in urban areas. This suggests that increasing the levels of education
in rural areas by only a couple of years could have substantial welfare effects. Second,
vocational and technical training (‗post-primary education‘ in Figure 65) seems twice as
effective in raising consumption levels in rural than in urban areas. In rural areas, household
headed by a person who completed post-primary education have consumption levels that are 128
percent higher than households with an educated head. General secondary education in rural
areas seems to pay off less than technical and vocational education (although the difference is
not significant due to the small number of people who have completed technical and vocational
training).
Focusing on the changes since 2001, we find that returns to education in rural areas have
somewhat decreased. In 2011, a rural household with a head having completed primary school
had an expected consumption that was 15 percent higher than a similar household with an
uneducated head, down from 34 percent in 2001 (Figure 66). This pattern holds for ever y
education level except complete prost-primary education, for which returns four-folded between
2001 and 2011. However, this effect is insignificant in a statistical sense due to the small sample
size.

     3.3.      Agriculture is correlated with lower living standards
The occupation of the household head has a large impact on consumption and poverty.
Even controlling for the fact that farmers are typically little educated, having an occupation in
agriculture is associated with poverty: Households with a head engaged in agriculture have
consumption levels that are approximately 30 percent lower (in rural areas) compared to
households who do not engage in agriculture, with wage labor being particularly harmful:
households that are engaged in agricultural wage labor are 27 percent more likely to be poor,
compared to 9 percent for independent farming.
Rural households whose head has a wage job in the non-farm sector are not discernibly
better-off. These households have consumption levels that are only 3 percent higher compared
to households not engaging in non-farm wage employment, and are only one percent less likely
to be poor. In rural areas, households engaged in nonfarm self-employment are among the best-

                                                                                                66

off, with consumption levels that are 15 percent higher, all else being equal. Those households
are 11 percent less likely to be poor compared to households without a nonfarm business activity
(Figure 65).
The negative effect of being employed in agriculture is even higher in urban areas. Urban
households that are engaged in agriculture have consumption levels that are between 30 percent
and 40 percent lower depending on the type of employment (self -employment or wage-
employment).In urban areas, households with wage employment in the non-farm sector are the
least likely to be poor (associated with a 16 percent increase in consumption), followed by those
with non-farm self-employment.
The consumption payoffs from different occupations have changed since 2001. In particular,
the negative effect of being employed in agriculture seems to have increased between 2001 and
2011. While being engaged in independent agriculture was associated with 14 percent less
consumption in 2001, it was associated with 33 percent less consumption by 2011 (Figure 66).
The reasons behind this evolution are unclear since agricultural productivity has improved
greatly since 2001 (see next Chapter). At the same time, the positive effect of having a nonfarm
occupation has diminished too. This can potentially be explained by the large increase in the
proportion of households engaged in nonfarm activities (the proportion of households with a
nonfarm activity more than doubled between 2001 and 2011), which has tended to decrease
average incomes in the nonfarm sector (which are however still a lot higher than in agriculture).

     3.4.    Land – size matters, but only marginally
Ownership of land is pretty equally distributed in Rwanda. 96 percent of households in rural
Rwanda own farmland and this proportion does not vary much between poor (97 percent) and
non-poor households (95 percent). As such, it is no surprise that land ownership is not associated
with consumption levels (Figure 65). Land size however is more unequally distributed. While the
extreme poor in rural areas owns on average less than 0.4 hectares, the poor (but not extreme -
poor) own 0.5 hectares and the non-poor 0.7 hectares (according to the EICV3). Bigger
landholdings are associated with higher consumption levels: Each extra hectare of land is
associated with six percent more consumption and a six -percent drop in the likelihood of being
poor. Since average landholdings are so small however, this effect is only of marginal
importance28.
In urban Rwanda, ownership of farmland is strongly associated with consumption. Urban
households that own farmland have consumption levels that are 26 percent higher than similar
households without farmland. This result may seem counterintuitive given that the best -off
households in urban areas are typically those who have stable well-paid formal non-farm
employment and do not engage in agriculture whatsoever. This is confirmed by the data: Urban
households without any farmland consume on average 40 percent more compared to households
with farmland. However, controlling for the influence of all other variables (such as education,
age, occupation, etc.), having farmland is associated with higher consumption in urban areas.




28
   In the Rwandan context, quality of land may be more important than land size. We do however not have data that
allow examining the effects of land quality.

     3.5.       Isolation is associated with lower consumption levels
Isolation from infrastructure tends to be associated with lower levels of consumption,
though the size of the association is generally modest. In rural Rwanda, living far from a
health center (‗far‘ defined as a walking time of between one and two hours) is associated with
four percent less consumption, living far from markets is associated with two percent less
consumption, and being far for public transportation with seven percent less consumption
(Figure 67). For health centers and public transportation, living very far (―very far‖ defined as at
least a two-hours walk) exacerbates the negative impact on consumption. This is not the case for
markets. Access to public transportation seems to matter most for poverty: Being very far from
public transportation increases the likelihood of poverty by eight percent (Figure 67).

Comparing the effects with 2001 is complicated by the different units of measurement. In
2001, the questions on distance to infrastructure were asked in kilometers, while in 2011 they
were asked in terms of travel time (by foot). For the 2001 survey, we defined ―far‖ as a distance
of between 10 and 20 kilometers and ―very far‖ as a distance of more than 20 kilometers.
Keeping this caveat in mind, we find that distance to public transportation did not influence
consumption in 2001 (while it does in 2011). This finding is perhaps best explained together with
the effects of accessibility to the nearest market. While being close to the market was associated
with a large increase in consumption in 2001 (boosting consumption by 33 percent compared to
those very far away), the effect in 2011 was 10 times smaller29. This may indicate that with
increased access over the past decade to public transportation, people may no longer be
dependent on the closest market, but may instead choose markets further away from the
household.



29
   It is important to note that the measures are not strictly comparable over time: in 2011, distance was measured in
terms of time (minutes) to reach the destination, whereas in 2001, the geographic distance (kilometers) was
measured.

Isolation from infrastructure is a better predictor of poverty in urban than in rural areas.
In urban areas, living far from a health center is associated with 8 percent less consumption and
living very far even with 28 percent less consumption (Figure 68). In a similar fashion, living far
from public transportation brings down consumption levels by 12 percent in urban areas,
compared to seven percent in rural areas. Urban households that are relatively isolated from
infrastructure are typically among the poorest, living on the outskirts of the city underserved by
public infrastructure.

Access to other types of infrastructure, such as schools and roads, is either insignificant in
explaining consumption or difficult to interpret. Distance to roads is not significant in
explaining household consumption, perhaps due to the collinearity with access to public
transportation30. The results on access to schools--primary as well as secondary—are not clear-
cut. For instance, urban households living far from a primary school have consumption levels
that are 23 percent lower, while those living very far have consumption levels that are 60 percent
higher (relative to households living within one hour‘s walk).

     3.6.         Location matters – even after controlling for other factors
Geographic location of households is strongly associated with consumption levels, even
after controlling for the influence of other household characteristics . Relative to similar
households living in the Southern Province, rural households living in Kigali and the Eastern
province consume 16 percent more, while those in the Northern and Western Province consume
12 percent and 6 percent more, respectively. In urban areas, location is even more important:
relative to urban households in the Southern Province, urban households in Kigali and the
Eastern Province consume 30 percent more, and households in the Western province consume 17
percent less (Figure 65). Compared to 2001, living in the Eastern Province has become more

(Figure 66).
It is important to note that the effects of geography remain strongly significant after
controlling for differences in education, occupation, demographic characteristics, etc. The
implication is that provincial differences in household living standards, and hence in the
vulnerability to poverty, are not only a consequence of different educational attainment levels,
demographic differences across geographic areas, and access to services. They can also be
explained by other factors that are related to the specific geographical location of a household.

and Tanzania and Uganda (13 percent less likely to be poor), though the effects are smaller than
they are for DRC.
Looking at the changes since 2001, we can start to understand why the border districts
accounted for so much of the reduction in poverty. In 2001, household in districts neighboring
DRC did not experience any particular advantages from this. In fact, neighboring DRC was
associated with an insignificant 1 percent reduction in consumption. This was the period of the
Second Congo War (1998-2002). By 2011 however, neighboring DRC was associated with a 25
percent higher consumption level (Figure 70). Informal cross-border exports may explain this
positive effect: Informal exports to DRC account for over 80 percent of all informal cross-border
exports, and recently accounted for nearly one fifth of formal trade (National Bank of Rwanda,
2013). Globally, agriculture products and livestock (including dried beans, bovine cattle, maize
flour and beef) are the major commodities traded in informal cross -border exports. Households
in districts bordering DRC appear to have been able to improve their living standards by
exploiting the proximity of a big market and the relative calm reigning during the 2010/11
period.

The story for Burundi is different. Controlling for other factors, household in districts
bordering Burundi were substantially worse-off in 2001. Sharing a border with Burundi was
associated with 38 percent less consumption, likely owing to the large scale civil war raging in
Burundi at that time, which disrupted cross-border trade and potentially had negative spillovers
on the Rwandan side of the border. By 2011, the war in Burundi had subsided, and so had the
negative effect of proximity to Burundi (Figure 70). As the negative border effect disappeared
between 2001 and 2011, the districts bordering Burundi experienced strong poverty reduction
(but remain among the poorest in the country).
4. Conclusions
Overall, the poverty profile for Rwanda is unsurprising. As in most low-income countries in
the world, the poor are poorly educated, depend on agriculture despite having small
landholdings, live in large households with high dependency rates, and tend to be further away
from key infrastructure. Children are most likely to be poor: 50 percent of children younger than
15 live below the poverty line, compared to 40 percent for people 15 and older.
Education, occupation and location are the main correlates of poverty. Each higher level of
education of the household head is associated with an increase in household consumption, and
households with a head who completed secondary education consume twice as much than
households with an uneducated head, all else being equal. Engaging in farm wage labor is a
strong predictor of poverty, increasing the probability of living below the poverty line by 27
percent in rural areas and 15 percent in urban areas. Location is important too, with especially
households living in Kigali and the Eastern Province getting a substantial consumption bonus
just from living where they live.
Two of the most interesting findings are the effect of the household‟s head gender and the
effect of living in districts with a land border. While in 2001 consumption levels for
households with a female head were lower, controlling for a range of other characteristics, this

                                                                                                                             71



                                                                  RWA N D A P o v er t y A ssessm en t ‫ ׀‬A p r i l 2 0 1 5   77
was no longer the case in 2011, when the gender of the household head did not matter for
consumption. Concerning location, we find that households living in districts with a border to
another country are substantially better-off, after controlling for the effect of the Province and
the effects of household characteristics. This is particularly the case for districts bordering DRC,
the hub of informal cross-border exports.
The beneficial border effects make the case for one of the interventions planned for in the
EDPRS-2, improving the domestic connectivity in Rwanda. Currently, it seems that only the
households that are physically close to the borders are able to take advantage of the opportunities
offered by them. Increasing the domestic transport infrastructure (and getting transport costs
down) could enable households from ‗landlocked‘ districts to participate in the trading
opportunities offered by the borders, particularly in light of increasing agricultural production
that is creating tradable surpluses.

     1. Introduction
The previous chapters showed that Rwanda experienced a strong episode of growth and
poverty reduction and sketched the characteristics of poverty. In this chapter we will take a
closer look at some of the factors that have been associated with the reduction in poverty,
focusing in particular on four key evolutions over the past decade: the boom in agriculture, the
progressive move towards non-farm occupations, the sharp drop in fertility, and the large
increase in transfers and remittances. This chapter will also summarize the results of the
qualitative study conducted in the framework of this Poverty Assessment and will explore
whether the people‘s verdict corresponds with the statistical analysis.
This chapter proceeds as follows. In the first section, we describe some of the key evolutions in
Rwanda over the past decade, focusing in particular on. Section 3 uses data from the EICV1 and
EICV3 surveys to examine how these evolutions have been associated with consumption growth
at various points of the distribution.
     2. What were the Key Evolutions during the Past decade?
The improvements in household consumption described in Chapter I came amidst a period of rapid
changes in the economic and socio-demographic structure of the Rwandan economy. Agricultural
productivity increased rapidly from a low base, mainly driven by policies in the second half of the
previous decade. At the same time, households diversified massively into non-farm activities, reducing
overall income risk. Fertility rates, which have traditionally been high, started dropping rapidly,
resulting in a significant decrease in household size and dependency ratios. Finally, both remittances
from abroad and within-country transfers increased substantially, boosting disposable income at the
household level.

     2.1.Increased Agricultural Production and Commercialization
Agriculture is the backbone of the Rwandan economy. Although the share of agriculture in
GDP has fallen from 45 percent in 2001 to 34 percent in 2011, agriculture remains the main
occupation for over 70 percent of working Rwandans. Of the 1.4 million new people working in
Rwanda between 2001 and 2011, the largest increase in new jobs is in agriculture (430,000). In
terms of income, agriculture accounts for almost half of aggregate household income and much
more for poor households (see Chapter II). The proportion of Rwandan households cultivating at
least one plot of land has remained stable throughout the previous decade at 90 percent.
Increasing agricultural productivity and transforming agriculture from subsistence-based to
market-based was one of the priorities for both the first PRSP (2001-2005) and the EDPRS
(2007-2012). Rwanda was the first signatory of the African Union‘s Comprehensive African
Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) and has steadily increased the proportion of its
total budget devoted to agriculture. Public expenditures on agriculture reached 10 percent of the
national budget as of 2009, as committed to in the CAADP. The increased public and donor-
funded investments in agriculture have been associated with a stark increase in aggregate
production (see Figure 71): Production of cereals more than tripled between 2000 and 2010,
while production of pulses and roots increased by 58 percent and 79 percent respectively. This is
also reflected in the household data (see



                                                                                                   73

2001 (Rwf 105,000 per household) and 2011 (Rwf 223,000 in 2011 prices) 31. The percentage of
farmers who reported having purchased fertilizers also increased sharply, from 7 percent in 2001
to 30 percent in 2011. Since agriculture is the single most important income source for poor
households, the increase in agricultural production is believed to have contributed substantially
to consumption growth and poverty reduction. At the same time, commercialization of
agriculture by households-defined as the share of harvest sold on the market- also increased: In
2011, the average household sold 21.4 percent of its total produce on the market, up from 13.4
percent in 2001.

The jump in agricultural production and productivity is a recent phenomenon. As shown
by Table 8, the increase in agricultural production was a lot higher in the second half of the
decade than in the first half: Aggregate production of cereals increased by 135 percent between
2006 and 2011, compared to 28 percent in the preceding five-year period. While the production
of roots and tubers actually declined between 2001 and 2006, it almost doubled during the past
five years. Same goes for the increase in agricultural productivity: While average yields grew
timidly between 2001 and 2006, they sharply increased during the last five years (see Figure 72).
The boom in agriculture coincides with the roll-out of the Crop Intensification Program (CIP), a
comprehensive program of land consolidation, regionalization and intensification phased in in
late 200732.

  According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture there were large productivity gains in CIP areas: Production of
maize and wheat increased six-fold, production of cassava and Irish potatoes tripled while that of rice and beans
increased by 30 percent (MINAGRI, 2011).

     2.2.Diversification of Income Portfolios Marked by a Move towards Non-Farm
         Activities
The changing composition of households‟ economic activities is one of the most remarkable
evolutions in Rwanda over the past decade. While engaging in non-farm income activities was
still relatively rare at the start of the previous decade (less than 30 percent of households had a
non-farm activity in 2001), 70 percent of households had an activity of this kind in 2011 (see
Table 9). Given the strong correlation that is found in empirical literature between non-farm
activities and household welfare, the increased engagement in non-farm economic activities
seems to have contributed to the observed consumption growth. Both non-farm wage
employment and non-farm self-employment in small businesses substantially increased between
2001 and 2011: 48 percent of households earned income through non-agricultural wage
employment in 2011, up from 22 percent in 2001. Non-farm self-employment in 2011 stood at
42 percent, compared to 15 percent in 2001 (Table 9).
The progressive move to non-farm activities was broad based. As presented by Figure 73, the
percentage of households engaged in non-agricultural self- and wage employment in Kigali City
increased in an almost linear fashion between 2001 and 2011. In 2011, three-quarters of
households in Kigali City earned income through non-agricultural wage employment and half

through self-employment in small non-agricultural businesses33. Starting from a lower base, the
percentage of households in the mainly rural areas outside of Kigali that earn income through
non-farm self-employment tripled to 40 percent in 2011. Non-agricultural wage employment
among rural households also increased significantly, from 18 percent of households in 2001 to
45 percent in 2011. Importantly, the poor have not stayed behind: the proportion of poor
households engaging in nonfarm occupations increased from 21 percent in 2001 to 62 percent in
2011.

A salient feature of the shift in households‟ activity portfolios is that households did not
abandon one income activity to take on another but rather diversified and took up more
income activities (both as main and secondary occupations)34. The average number of income
activities increased from 1.4 per household in 2001 to 2.3 per household in 2011. As shown by
Figure 74, the share of non-farm activities in the total portfolio was higher in 2011 (36.4 percent)
than in 2011 (19.4 percent)35. In other words, the increase in the number of income sources can
mainly be explained by households‘ take-up of non-farm activities in addition to their traditional
agricultural occupations.



33
   Throughout this chapter we maintain the distinction between Kigali and the ―Rest of the Country‖. Although it
would be more straightforward to use the urban-rural distinction, the reclassification of enumeration areas following
the 2002 census meant that some enumeration areas that were rural in the 2001 survey were classified as urban
following the 2002 census. This implies that the urban-rural classifications in the 2001 and 2011 EICVs are not
comparable and would lead to misleading representations. As a result, we use the distinction between Kigali and the
Rest of the Country (which corresponds closely to the urban -rural difference).
34
   We consider four broad income activities: Farm self -employment, farm wage employment, non-farm self-
employment and non-farm wage employment.
35
   This share is calculated as the number of non-farm activities of the household divided by the total number of
income activities.

unabated: Total fertility rates dropped
further to 4.0 in 2012, although the DHS and Census figures may not be fully comparable.
Lower fertility can have positive effects on household living standards in both the short and
longer run. In the short run, lower fertility rates translate into smaller households and lower
child dependency rates. As evident from Table 9, average household size in Rwanda decreased
from 5 in 2001 to 4.7 in 2011, while the child dependency ratio, the number of economically
dependent children (under 15) for each adult (between 15 and 64) in the household, dropped
from 1 in 2001 to 0.87 in 2011. Fewer dependent children in a household mean less strain on
household resources and a mechanical increase in per capita income or consumption
expenditures.

In the longer-run, sharp drops in fertility tend to lead to increased female labor market
participation and better human capital outcomes for the young generations. Women with
fewer children are more likely to enter the labor market, increasing household-level labor supply.
Because the opportunity cost of having extra children is higher when women participate in the
labor market, employed women typically choose to have fewer children, leading to a virtuous
circle of falling fertility and wealth creation. When families have fewer children, they also tend
to invest more in the education their children, laying the foundations for improved household
living standards in the next generation38.
The sharp drop in fertility will have dramatic consequences for the age structure of the
population. Currently, Rwanda is characterized by a youth bulge (43 percent of the population is
below 15) and a relatively small labor force (53 percent of adults are of working age). The 2010
population pyramid reflects the typical pattern of a developing country—wide at the bottom and
narrowing fast as one moves up the age distribution (Figure 76). By 2050 however, the
population pyramid will look completely different (Figure 77). It will be bell shaped and
characterized by a bulging labor force rather than a youth bulge (working-age adults will account
for more than 64 percent of the population, and the share of youth will drop to 29 percent in the
medium-fertility scenario). In the logic of the demographic dividend, these age structure changes
hold significant economic promise.

             2.4.The Boom in Transfers and Remittances
The value of remittance inflows in Rwanda increased exponentially over the past decade . In
nominal terms international remittances shot up from eight million US$ in 2001 to over 100
million US$ in 2011 (Figure 78). As a share of GDP, remittances four-folded from 0.4 percent in
2001 to 1.6 percent in 2011. This is reflected in the household data (Table 9): the proportion of
households receiving transfers or remittances increased from 61 percent in 2001 to 97 percent in
2011, while the average value of transfers more than tripled to RWF 56,000 per household in

substantial impacts in terms of poverty reduction. Research on the household -level impacts of
remittances shows that incoming transfers and remittances reduce the risk and depth of poverty,
enable households to smooth consumption and relax credit-constraints for households engaged in
small business activities (World Bank, 2006).

Although we pool transfers and remittances in the analysis, we acknowledge the important
differences between the two. While transfers are common (over 96 percent of households
received private transfers from within the country), remittances are rare: Less than five percent
of households received remittances (from other countries) during the EICV3 survey. Remittances
are also strongly biased towards the rich: 70 percent of all remittances flowed to households
within the top two consumption quintiles, and only seven percent to the bottom quintile.

   Transfers and remittances include money or items received from family members living either abroad or in
Rwanda. It does not include public transfers received from Government or aid organizations.

Transfers in contrast are relatively neutral (only slightly biased towards the upper quintiles).
Although remittances only account for 15 percent of total transfers (both domestic and foreign),
the average value of remittances (for the few households that receive them) are far higher than
the average transfer value.
To summarize, the last decade has witnessed significant changes in a number of key
economic and demographic variables, as shown by
Table 9. The increase in household consumption was accompanied by rising levels of
agricultural production and commercialization at the household level and the diversification of
income portfolios. Average household size diminished due to falling fertility, resulting in lower
child dependency ratios. More households are receiving transfers, and the average value of those
transfers has increased. In the next section, we explore how these evolutions have been related to
the observed growth in welfare and the reduction in poverty43.
     3. And How Have they been related to Consumption Growth and Poverty
        Reduction?
Increased agricultural production and the move from a traditional production mode to a more
market-oriented model emerge as the main drivers of the growth in consumption of Rwandan
households, explaining one third of total consumption growth. Increased self-employment in
small non-farm businesses has been the second main driver of consumption growth, while the
observed move to non-farm wage employment emerges as the single most important driver of
consumption growth in Kigali. The rapid fall in fertility rates in recent years has changed the
demographic composition of Rwandan households and has lowered the child dependency ratio,
which has been associated with increased consumption both in Kigali and in rural areas.
Transfers and remittances were a main driver of consumption growth for the wealthy households
but were only of marginal importance for the poor.
To examine to what extent the factors mentioned above were associated with growth in
household consumption we will use a statistical decomposition method based on recentered
influence functions44. The method is detailed in Annex 3. In simple terms, the method
decomposes the observed change in consumption at a particular point of the distribution into a
part that can be explained by changes in covariates (the ―explained‖ part) and a part that can be
explained by changes in coefficients, that is, changes in the returns to those covariates (the
―unexplained‖ part). The explained part can further be decomposed into the contribution of each
single covariate. In our case we will for instance examine how much of the increase in median
consumption between 2001 and 2011 can be explained by changes in covariates (such as
increased agricultural production, the move to non-farm activities, etc.). We will carry out the
decompositions at five points of the distribution, representing five different welfare groups: The
10th percentile, the 25th percentile, the 50th percentile (median), the 75th percentile and the 90th




43
   Other important evolutions over the past decade include the introduction of a social protection program (Vision
Umurenge Program –VUP) in 2007/8 and the roll-out of community-based health insurance. These can however not
be included in the decomposition analysis because they did not yet exist in 2001. While the VUP was still very
small-scale in 2011 (less than 1 percent of households in EICV3 had received social protection benefits), 65 percent
of the population was covered by community-based health insurance.

percentile. Given the different structure of economic activity in Kigali than in the rest of the
country, we will carry out separate decompositions for the two regions45.
The changes in covariates between 2001 and 2011 explain to a large extent the observed
increase in consumption. 85 percent of the growth in median consumption in rural areas can be
explained by the evolution of covariates (Figure 79). Growth in consumption at the lower part of
the distribution however is under-explained by the change in covariates: Poor rural household
grew by more than what would be expected based on the growth in their covariates46. In Kigali
City consumption growth is over-explained by the change in covariates: Consumption in Kigali
grew less than what the changes in covariates would predict, especially at the middle of the
distribution. This suggests that the returns to certain activities or endowments decreased between
2001 and 2011. Detailed results of the decompositions can be found in Annex 4.

While there has been a move to non-farm wage employment in the rural areas over the past
decade, this has not been associated with significant gains in consumption.
In contrast to the rural areas, the move to wage employment has been the single main
driver of consumption growth in Kigali City, explaining 77 percent of growth in median

   It should be stressed that the decomposition exercises only identify the main correlates of consumption growth.

   The under-explanation of growth of the rural poor may be explained by omitted variables. Since 2008 the
Government of Rwanda has introduced and progressively rolled -out social protection programmes that provide
benefits to the extreme poor. If these programmes were successful in raising consumption levels of the poor, their
omission from the analysis will lead to an under-explanation of consumption growth. The social protection variables
can however not be included in the model since they did not yet exist in 2001 (the baseline year in the analysis).

in relative terms been less important for households in Kigali City than for those in rural areas47.

      3.1.Agriculture Main Driver of Rural Consumption Growth
The increase in agricultural production over the past decade emerges as the main driver of
consumption growth for all but the richest rural households. Increased production has made
a bigger contribution to the growth in consumption of wealthier households compared to poorer
ones: The boost in agricultural output explains 11 percent of consumption growth at the 10 th
percentile and one quarter of growth at the 75th percentile. This can potentially be explained by
the larger landholdings of wealthier households, as a result of which they have benefited most
from the boost in agricultural production. After the 75th percentile the importance of increased
production falls back but remains well above its median contribution of 19 percent. The
contribution of increased commercialization of agriculture (the increased shares of harvests sold
on the market) to consumption growth is fairly uniform across the distribution, explaining
between 10 and 13 percent of growth between the 10th and the 75th percentile. The importance of
increased commercialization is smallest for the wealthiest households.

      3.2.Diversification into Non-Farm Activities Boosted Growth for both Rural and Urban
          Households
The diversification of income portfolios has been an important driver of growth, both in
rural areas and in Kigali. The increased self-employment in small non-farm business activities
(so-called household enterprises) has been particularly important for households outside of
Kigali and emerges as the second main driver of growth (Figure 81). The contribution of
increased non-farm self-employment to consumption growth is higher for non-poor than for poor
households and peaks at the 75th percentile (Figure 84). For the wealthiest rural households the

  Since consumption growth in Kigali City is overexplained by the growth in covariates, the sum of the individual
covariates‘ contributions to observed consumption growth is higher than 100 percent.

importance of self-employment falls back, presumably due to their relatively high levels of
education and skills which allow these households to access the better wage jobs. This is
confirmed by the contribution of increased wage employment, which is very low or even non -
existent at the lower end of the distribution but shoots up sharply for the wealthiest rural
households: Increased engagement in non-agricultural wage employment explains 4 percent of
growth in the median but 23 percent of growth in the 90th percentile. Note that non-farm wage
employment did not contribute at all to the growth in consumption of poor households, despite
poor households‘ increased engagement in this type of activity (see Box 6).

while the remaining 361,000 were created in the farm                                                                    838

Poor rural households have increasingly taken up
non-farm wage employment between 2001 (14                  600

While construction is also the dominant sector for non -
poor rural workers (26 percent), 20 percent of them have wage employment in local government services (compared
to 4 percent of poor workers).
Next to poor workers‟ overrepresentation in less desirable sectors, the nature of their employment seems
more precarious. 67 percent of poor wage -workers in the non-farm sector are paid on a daily basis, usually
indicative of more casual forms of day labor, compared to 47 percent of non -poor workers. Poor workers work on
average 14 hours per week, 10 hours less than non -poor wage workers in the nonfarm sector. The average wage a
poor worker takes home at the end of the day amounts to RWF 817 (2.4 US$ in 2011 PPP terms), compared to RWF
2,004 for non-poor workers (6.0 US$).
Poor rural households have also increasingly taken up agricultural wage employment on other people‟s
farms, from 17 percent in 2001 to 69 percent in 2011. Agricultural wage employment is an unstable and low-paid
activity typically reserved for the poorest households with small or no landholdings. Average daily wage for
agricultural wage laborers amounts to 1.7 US$ in the EICV3 data. If we take the move to farm wage employment
into account, the net effect of wage employment on the rural poor has been largely negative, holding back
consumption growth for all but the richest rural households.

 In contrast to rural areas, the progressive move to wage employment has been the main
 driver of consumption growth in Kigali City. Increased wage employment emerges as the
 main driver of growth across the distribution, explaining 32 percent of consumption growth at
 the 10th percentile, 78 percent at the median and 33 percent at the 90th percentile (Figure 86).
 Increased self-employment has been far less important for households in Kigali City, and was
 only associated with consumption growth of the poorest half of households. The predominant
 importance of wage employment in Kigali may be explained by lower barriers of entry to wage
 employment, as the poor in Kigali have on average completed primary school, and of course the
 higher availability of non-farm wage jobs in urban agglomerations.

      3.3.Fertility Drop Associated with Consumption Growth across the Board
 The rapid drop in fertility over the past decade has brought down child dependency rates,
 and this has been associated with consumption growth in both in Kigali and in the rest of
 the country. In the rural areas, dependency ratios have been falling more for the non-poor than
 for the poorer households: The average child dependency ratio in poor households declined only
 marginally from 1.14 in 2001 to 1.10 in 2011 (drop of 3.5 percent), while in non -poor
 households it declined by 10 percent (from 0.8 in 2001 to 0.72 in 2011). This explains the
 relatively higher contribution of decreased dependency ratios to growth in consumption for
 better-off households: decreased dependency ratios explain 11 percent of growth at the 75th
 percentile compared to seven percent at the bottom quartile (see Figure 85).
 The child dependency ratio in Kigali fell from 0.81 in 2001 to 0.68 in 2011 . This accounted
 for 32 percent of growth in consumption of the median household (see Figure 87). In Kigali we
 find a significant negative correlation between dependency ratios and engagement in wage
 employment: The move to wage employment in Kigali seems to have been accompanied by

falling fertility48. Although this is consistent with economic theory, we cannot establish causality
with the data at hand (that is, did fertility decline because there were more people in wage
employment, or did people take up wage employment because fertility declined and there were
fewer children to take care of?).

Further decreases in the dependency ratio have the potential to boost consumption growth
and poverty reduction in the coming decades. As illustrated by Figure 76 and Figure 77,
working-age population in Rwanda is projected to grow fast over the coming decades (faster than
the economically dependent population) , which means dependency ratios are expected to
progressively decrease over the coming years. The decomposition results suggest that this could
be associated with further improvements in household living standards and poverty reduction.

     3.4.Transfers and Remittances Major Driver of Consumption Growth, Especially for
         the Wealthiest Households
The exponential increase in transfers and remittances over the past decade emerges as the
main driver of consumption growth at the top end of the distribution. 27 percent of the
increase in consumption at the 90th percentile in rural areas can be explained by transfers and
remittances, a contribution higher than that of any other covariate. At the lower end of the
distribution the importance of transfers and remittances has been marginal, explaining
respectively 4 and 6 percent of consumption growth at the 10th and 25th percentiles (see Figure
85). This does not imply that the increase in transfers and remittances has been unimportant for
the poor: At the 63rd percentile (the proportion of the rural population below the poverty line in
2001), transfers and remittances explain over 13 percent of the growth in consumption, making it
the third main contributor to consumption growth below the poverty line. Consumption growth
of wealthy rural households has largely been driven by wage employment and transfers, two
factors that are marginal in explaining growth of poor rural households.
A similar pattern emerges in Kigali City. The increase in transfers and remittances has been
less important in terms of consumption growth for poor than for wealthier urban households. The
increase in transfers and remittances explains 12 percent of growth at the first quartile and 30
percent at the 90th percentile (see Figure 87).
Figure 88 pulls the rural and urban findings together to summarize the contribution of
various factors to growth in consumption at the national level. Agriculture has been the main
contributor to growth in median consumption in Rwanda between 2001 and 2011. The increase
in agricultural production explains 20 percent of national consumption growth while increased
commercialization explains another 12 percent. Taken together, these two factors account for
close to one-third of consumption growth over the past decade. The increased engagement in
non-agricultural household businesses emerges as the second main correlate of consumption,
explaining 15 percent of its increase between 2001 and 2011. Although increasing wage
employment in the non-farm sector has not been an important driver of consumption growth
outside of Kigali City, its preponderance in Kigali means that the move to wage employment
accounted for 12 percent of national consumption growth. The decrease in child dependency
ratios spurred by rapidly falling fertility rates and the increase in transfers and remittances have
been equally important, each explaining 12 percent of national consumption growth.
Different factors have been associated with growth at different points of the consumption
distribution. Both in and outside of Kigali City, growth in consumption for better-off
households can largely be explained by non-farm wage employment and transfers and
remittances. At the lower half of the rural distribution, growth in agriculture and increased
commercialization of agricultural produce has been most important, together with increased
engagement in household enterprises. Consumption growth at the lower end in Kigali City was
correlated with increased engagement in wage employment and, to a lesser extent, self-
employment. The drop in child dependency ratios has been associated with consumption growth
across the distribution, though less so for the poorest households who experienced only a
marginal drop in dependency ratios.

    3.5.Under- and over-explanation of consumption growth: Diminishing returns to non-
        farm employment and easing of gender-effect
The graphs in the previous section show the part of consumption growth that can be
explained by changes in covariates between 2001 and 2011. As shown by Figure 79, growth
in Kigali is over-explained by the changes in covariates (consumption grew by less than what
would be expected), while growth in rural areas is under-explained (consumption grew by more
than what would be expected), especially at the lower part of the distribution. In the logic of the
decomposition exercise, this means that returns to activities or endowments have decreased in
Kigali while they have increased in rural areas. What can a closer look at the unexplained part of
consumption growth tell us?
In Kigali, consumption growth was held back due to decreasing returns to non-farm
employment, in particular wage employment. While the observed move to non-farm wage
employment has been a main driver of the growth in consumption, the influx of workers in this
segment appears to have put downward pressures on average returns. This is confirmed by data
on wages and incomes: The average income of a wage job in the non-farm sector has decreased
over the past decade.
In rural areas, the returns of having a female head of household increased or, more
precisely, the negative effect of having a female head subsided. This mirrors the finding of the
previous chapter: In 2001, having a female household head dragged down consumption. By
2011, that was no longer the case. As a result, the returns to having a female head moved from
being negative to being non-significantly positive, explaining in part why the growth in
consumption in rural areas is not fully explained by the observed changes in covariates.

      4. Drivers of Growth at the Province Level
The increase in agricultural production has been the main driver of consumption growth in all
Provinces except for the Eastern Province, where diversification into non-farm activities
accounted for the bulk of growth. The Northern Province has experienced the strongest growth
in agriculture and the largest drop in fertility, explaining this province‟s exceptionally strong
poverty reduction. The Southern Province, which has lagged compared to other provinces,
experienced the same underlying evolutions as the other provinces, though the magnitude of the
changes were more modest there, explaining the comparatively slow growth.
So far we have lumped together all Provinces outside Kigali City as “rural areas”.
However, as highlighted in the previous chapters, the pace of consumption growth and poverty
reduction differed substantially across provinces, and geographic variables are important in
explaining household consumption levels even after controlling for a wide range of other
observables. In this section we will explore to what extent the drivers of consumption growth
differed across Provinces, focusing on the same key evolutions highlighted above.

(compared to a national average of 6.1) but fell to 4.1 by 2010 (compared to a national average
of 4.6)49. As a result, child dependency rates dropped by 20 percent in the Northern Province,
faster than in any of the other provinces (Figure 89).
Needless to say, the expansion of agriculture has been the main driver of growth in the
Northern Province. In absolute terms, the contribution of agriculture to consumption growth
was higher in the Northern Province than in any of the other Provinces. The decrease in
dependency rates, which was the fifth main driver of overall consumption growth in rural areas
(Figure 81), has been more important for consumption growth in the north: It emerges as the

     4.2.The Eastern Province: Diversification
The rapid diversification into non-farm activities over the past decade was associated with
substantial consumption gains. Nowhere has this diversification been more salient than in the
Eastern Province. The proportion of households with a wage or independent activity in the non -
farm sector both increased fourfold in the Eastern Province, from approximately 10 percent in
2001 to 40 percent by 2011. Overall, 66 percent of households in the east had a nonfarm income
activity in 2011, up from 19 percent in 2001.
The Eastern Province is the only Province where agriculture was not the main driver of
consumption growth. The move to nonfarm activities explains 40 percent of the growth in
consumption in the east, with the largest part (28 percent) being accounted for by the move to
non-farm self-employment (Figure 90). Even nonfarm wage employment, which is marginal in
explaining overall consumption growth in rural areas, has been important in the east, explaining
12 percent of growth. The contribution of decreased dependency rates is substantially lower in
the east, owing to the fact that dependency rates only declined modestly (by five percent) in this
province.

     4.3.The Southern Province: Improving but Lagging
The Southern Province experienced the slowest consumption growth and poverty reduction
of all. Household consumption grew by 1.5 percent per year between 2001 and 2011 and the
poverty headcount dropped by nine percentage points. While this performance is not bad as such,
it is below the average performance of Rwanda over the past decade. In 2011, poverty headcount
in the south was 57 percent, significantly higher than overall headcount of 45 percent.

slower than in the other provinces goes a
long way in explaining the slower pace of growth and poverty reduction.

     4.4.The Western Province: Agriculture, Dependency Rates, and Small Businesses
Compared to the average, the Western Province experienced a large increase in
agricultural production and a rapid move towards nonfarm self-employment. Together,
these evolutions explain half of total consumption growth in the west (Figure 92). Households in
the Western Province also experienced a large decline in child dependency rates, explaining
another 16 percent of the increase in consumption. Though the west did experience a strong
move to nonfarm wage employment as well, this did not at all contribute to increasing
consumption levels.
To summarize, the increase in agricultural production over the past decade has been the
main driver of growth in all rural Provinces except for the Eastern Province, where
diversification to nonfarm activities was the main driver. Decreasing dependency rates have
especially been important for consumption growth in the north and the west, while the move to
small nonfarm business activities was particularly important in the east and west. The south
experienced the same evolutions as all other provinces, but the magnitude was substantially
smaller, resulting in slower consumption growth and poverty reduction.

   5. Drivers of Poverty Reduction: The People‟s Verdict
The findings of the focus group discussions correspond with those of the statistical analysis.
Participants identified agriculture as the main driver of improved living standards, followed by
cooperatives and other kinds of savings and credit vehicles. Social protection and contraception
were also frequently mentioned as having contributed to better living conditions. The most
important drivers of progress were at the same time identified as the main obstacles.
Unpredictable weather and, related to this, the volatile performance of agriculture was
considered the main obstacle to continued poverty reduction, together with the difficulty of
accessing financial services. Participants in high-poverty little-dynamic areas were more
concerned with adverse effects of bad weather, while dynamic areas with strong poverty
reduction stressed the need for finance to facilitate their transition to non-farm activities.
The focus group discussions that were held in the framework of this poverty assessment
elicited participants‟ opinions about the drivers of poverty reduction, both positive and
negative. To summarize the research design (the full methodological approach can be found in
Annex 5), 40 focus groups discussions were held in eight districts of the country, covering all
rural Provinces. Districts were selected based on their current (2011) poverty levels (below
average vs above average) as well as their recent poverty reduction experiences (strong vs slow
poverty reduction). Within each district, two sectors were selected based on their level of
connectivity: One isolated sector (far from key infrastructure) and one more connected sector.
One cell was selected in each of the sectors. Finally, in each cell, one male and one female focus
group were conducted. In each District, there was also one focus group with youth (18-25).

Agriculture the Main Driver of Poverty Reduction
Participants in the focus groups (FGs) most commonly mentioned agriculture and livestock
as the main positive driver of change, confirming the findings of the quantitative analysis.
Participants listed a number of specific changes, including improved agricultural techniques,
such as land consolidation, the use of improved inputs, such as chemical fertilizer, and the
increased availability of large livestock. These techniques were used by participants to improve
their harvest, which was both a source of increased food and income. Many of these changes
were strongly linked to government policy and programmes. Land consolidation, extension
services and subsidized inputs were seen by most groups as having a direct impact on their
agricultural yields. The vast majority of groups saw land consolidation as a positive change,
leading to improved harvests that can be sold in bulk and receive a better price, as well as
improved security of crops due to the sharing of land and growing of the same crops.
Although agricultural inputs were seen as important positive drivers, inaccessibility of
these inputs, particularly in the case of selected seeds and fertilizer, was seen as a negative
driver of change in poverty status. This inaccessibility often forced participants to revert to
traditional cultivation methods, which produced lower yields than those using improved inputs.
This was particularly true for groups that had used chemical fertilizer while it was subsidized,
but then had to abandon its use when the price increased.


                                                                                             93

While agriculture was considered the main driver in most FGs, there was notable variation
across groups. The Eastern Province was the only Province where participants did not mention
agriculture as a positive driver but rather noted negative impacts of terracing and land
consolidation. Participants in FGs in the Eastern Province explained that their crops were
uprooted prematurely due to terracing of the land done through VUP. This resulted in the loss of
their harvest during that season. Although the positive impact of these methods may be realized
at a later time, the participants were concerned about their current livelihood situation. The
Northern Province, in contrast, was all about agriculture, which again confirms the quantitative
findings (see section 4.1). Focusing on gender, male FGs were a lot more likely to consider the
improvements in agriculture as the main driver of poverty reduction. Female FGs attached more
importance to the increasing availability of financial services (see below).
Financial services, businesses and cooperatives deemed important, especially by youth and
women
Drivers related to access to financial services revolved around saving in banks, accessing loans
from banks such as SACCOs, and informal saving groups. The increased availability of savings
vehicles and access to credit was discussed frequently as having a direct impact on improved household
conditions. In particular, participants linked financial services directly to diversified income sources as
external credit provided necessary capital for investment in small -scale non-farm businesses and
agricultural activities (in particular investment in livestock). The increased availability of savings and
credit vehicles seems to have facilitated the transition to non-farm activities (see quote).


 “Before I started my small business, I farmed on a very small plot. I could grow a few kilos of maize and
  beans, but never enough to save anything. I opened a business selling phone credit. My husband and I
 decided to get a loan from a SACCO. We sat down together and figured out a good plan. When we got
  the loan, we used the money exactly as planned and made enough money to repay the loan. Because
 we repaid on time, I was able to ask for another loan, which I used to buy fertilizer for our farm. Taking
   a loan from a SACCO helped us a lot. We had a little land that we were able to use as collateral. My
  husband came up with the idea to buy phone credit and we were able to go from there. Compared to
                before, I would say my family has improved its conditions at least 3 times.”

Woman in Gakenke District

Credit through formal channels such as banks and SACCOs was however only available to
certain groups. Most groups felt they lacked the required collateral or loan guarantee necessary
to receive a commercial loan. Financial literacy was also a challenge, as many groups felt
uncomfortable with or did not comprehend loan conditions. As a result, most focus group
participants gave more importance to cooperatives and informal sources of finance, such as
IBIMINA (a type of ROSCA) and village savings and loans associations. Savings groups with
rotating pools were frequently mentioned by male, female and youth participants as important
sources of capital that would normally be out of reach, and got many votes as an important driver
of change (see quotes).

     “For me, what helped were the savings groups. I my life I never have had good conditions. I do now,
      and I owe this to the savings groups. That’s how I get clothes, or buy clothes for my kids. I eat well
                          when I get money from savings groups. I will stay in them.”

Woman in Kayonza District


   “When other people told me about savings cooperatives, I decided to do the same thing. I got a
  hundred people from the village to contribute 100 RwF into a rotating fund. 2 years later, we each
contribute 1,000 Rwf. It’s really helped a lot of people here, especially since the cooperatives oblige you
                                 to spend part of your funds on Mutuelle.”

Man in Ngoma District

Many participants used the savings group capital for consumption smoothing or to make
household investments in materials, furniture or for school fees and health insurance . Some
participants were also able to invest in productive activities or small businesses. Commercial
loans were more often used in this manner, as the potential for defaulting provided a strong
disincentive to using credit for household spending. Nonetheless, participants also discussed
using informal sources for investing in small businesses. In terms of small business, participants‘
involvement in petty commerce was often heavily linked to agriculture. Selling produce in
markets was one of the most commonly discussed types of small business. Selling non -
perishables in kiosks or boutiques was a more lucrative source of income, but required larger
investment. Younger participants expressed a greater interest in non-agricultural types of petty
commerce, such as bicycle transport and hair-dressing.
Financial services through banks and SACCOs were seen across all provinces as positive
drivers of change. Similarly, informal savings groups were seen as having had a positive
impact, and ranked highly as a key cause of positive change. The Northern Province in particular
highlighted the positive effect of credit and loans from banks and SACCOs as drivers that helped
people to move out of poverty. In the Western and Eastern provinces, by contrast, a lack of
capital to start businesses and inability to pay loans were identified as negative drivers regarding
financial services.
Social protection important for women and youth in poorer Districts
Social protection support, in particular through VUP, was also perceived as having had a
positive impact on improving household conditions50. Participants in lower Ubudehe
categories felt the programme provided a key source of employment for youth, who have been
employed in terracing programmes and road construction thorough Public Works. It has also
provided an income source for the vulnerable and elderly, particularly through Direct Support.
Social protection was however only mentioned as an important driver in the poor Districts of
Nyaruguru and Gakenke. Male FGs did not mention social protection as often as female and
youth FGs.

     For reasons explained before, social protection programs (VUP) are not included in the quantitative analysis.

Health insurance, in Rwanda known as Mutuelle de Santé, was also highly ranked by
participants as a strong contributor to poverty reduction. Participants explained that
insurance minimized their health care costs, which previously would have made health care out
of reach or required sale of important assets. Participants also noted that prior to community
based health insurance community members were less likely to access health facilities and
treatment as a result of financial barriers to access.
Although Mutuelle was considered important, many participants stated that financial
barriers to health insurance still existed. As health insurance is paid for each member of the
household, large households usually cannot afford insurance. Without health insurance, the high
cost of health care remains a challenge. Even more concerning is that some of the FGDs in the
Eastern province also stated that community members who did not purchase their Mutuelle
membership in time faced stiff penalties, including seizure of assets or detention.

     5.2.The Obstacles to Poverty Reduction
Figure 94: Bad weather and lack of capital main obstacles to poverty reduction
(Obstacles to poverty reduction, 2014 )




Source: World Bank, 2014.

Adverse weather the main barrier to escaping poverty
Households in rural Rwanda remain all too dependent on the vicissitudes of unpredictable
weather patterns. The majority of FG participants engaged in agriculture as an important part of
their livelihoods, and unpredictable rainfall and droughts were the most commonly cited
obstacles to sustained poverty reduction. Groups in five districts, especially in the east and south
of the country (Figure 94), explained that their current harvest was significantly reduced by a
long dry season this year. As a result, food availability for their households has significantly
decreased. Likewise, wage farm opportunities have been significantly curtailed due to poor
weather and resulting bad harvests.

                                                                                                                   96

Next to insufficient rainfall and droughts, FG participants also frequently mentioned the
opposite phenomenon, flooding. Flooding was especially a problem in the isolated sectors,
which are often located in flood-prone valleys. In addition to causing considerable damage to
housing, flooding also often resulted in a loss of their harvests. Curiously, lack of land, a
pervasive issue in Rwanda, was only mentioned sporadically and only in the north of the country
(Figure 94)
Lack of capital and banking barriers constrain the transition to more lucrative activities
The second most frequently mentioned barrier was a lack of capital and inadequate access
to financial services. While there has been a growth in informal sources of credit, such as
Ibimina (ROSCAs), the available capital within these sources is limited, as they rely on small
contributions of usually a few hundred francs per member per week. Participants also mentioned
that credit from these sources is often consumed by household expenses. As a result, there is
often little leftover to invest in productive assets or petty commerce.
Banking barriers are closely tied to a lack of capital, as external financing was often seen as
required to enable a household to start a more lucrative non-farm business. Issues related to
banking identified as barriers by participants included delays in receiving loans, the lack of
collateral or guarantee to be approved for a loan and the high interest rates on loans.
Interestingly, participants mentioned that the existing loan arrangements in Savings and Credit
Cooperatives (SACCOs) do not match their income-earning schedule, and hence were concerned
about their ability to repay a loan (see quote).


        “People tell us to go to the SACCO but it’s difficult. Say I want to get money for fertilizer and
      planting. They want loan payments every month, and we don’t have income until the harvest. I
                                        can’t make those payments.”

                                                   Woman in Musanze District

Lack of capital and banking barriers were far more frequently mentioned in the areas with
lower poverty and those that have experienced strong poverty reduction in recent years.
The Provinces that have experienced the strongest poverty reduction over the past decade
(Northern and Eastern Province) are transitioning faster to non-farm activities, and need access
to finance to facilitate this transition. This comes out clearly in the FGs, where inadequate access
to finance is a far more important barrier in the better-off districts (Figure 94). In contrast, the
poor districts in the south of the country are more concerned with the effects of adverse weather
and only sporadically mention issues related to finance and external capital.
Family conflict main obstacle according to women
Women mentioned family conflict and poor gender dynamics as the main negative driver.
The discussion on this driver was considerably gendered. Male participants described negative
household dynamics as an outcome of poverty, whereas women FG participants discussed
poverty as an outcome of negative household dynamics. Women participants described family
conflict as domestic violence, including verbal and physical violence, as well as limited control
of women over household finances. Family conflict was seen as a negative driver as it resulted in
loss of income due to health care related expenses or time not spent on income generation (see
quote).


                                                                                                            97

    “When you go to farm and you have like ten plantain bunches, the husband might sell them and
   then drink the money away. When you ask him about it, he beats you and then you have to go to
     the hospital and you waste a lot of time that you could be using to earn money for the house.”

                                  Woman in Nyaruguru District

Alcohol use was often related to family conflict, and mismanagement of funds, and was
only mentioned as an activity engaged in by men. It was frequently discussed in relation to
household dynamics, as women indicated that they had limited control over household finances
and thus were unable to prevent their husbands from spending household earnings or savings on
alcohol.

   5.3.Salient differences across groups
Overall, the drivers and barriers mentioned by the participants were relatively similar
across focus groups. There did however emerge a number of interesting nuances, related in
particular to the difference between adults and youth and between districts with high and districts
with low poverty reduction.
Optimistic, and with a firm eye on the non-farm sector
Rapid expansions in education in recent years as well as scarcity of land makes that youth
are structurally different than their parents. While independent farming was the main
livelihood in all adult FGs, youth were much more likely to engage in non-farm activities. Most
youth mentioned mining, construction, brick-making, bicycle-transport and hairdressing as
activities frequently engaged in by youth in their communities. In contrast, when adults
mentioned non-farm activities, this tended to refer to the commercialization of agricultural
products. While youth acknowledged the importance of agriculture in their communities, there
was a notable desire of youth to work in the non-farm sector. Youth also felt that the availability
of non-farm opportunities had been increasing.
Consistent with their focus on non-farm activities, youth FGs mentioned lack of capital and
financial services as the main obstacle to better living standards. As regular non-farm wage
jobs are scarce in rural communities, youth participants emphasized the importance of non -farm
self-employment to earn a living. Starting a non-farm activity was perceived to be inextricably
linked to obtaining external capital (loans), and the difficulty of obtaining loans for youth
without collateral was seen as the main obstacle. Despite their higher levels of education as
compared to adults, youths were the only ones to mention education as an obstacle, as they
believed successful entry into the non-farm sector required technical skills and vocational
training they do not currently have.
Despite the many challenges they face, youth FG participants were remarkably optimistic.
Youth FGs emphasized the importance of hard work and ―having a good mindset‖ to get ahead
in life, and were a lot more likely to ascribe failure to escape poverty to a lack of personal
responsibility. They were also more likely to value personal responsibility as a positive dri ver
than either male or female groups, focusing in particular on the importance of setting goals and
objectives as the first step to improving the household situation.

Different priorities for different types of Districts
Districts that experienced strong poverty reduction in recent years were considerably more
concerned with barriers to finance than those with slow poverty reduction. Districts with
rapid poverty reduction are progressively transitioning to non-farm activities (although
agriculture still remains the dominant activity), and, as a result, require access to loans to support
this transition. Barriers to finance, in particular prohibitive interest rates, were particularly salient
in the better-off districts of Musanze and Nyabihu. Districts with low poverty reduction
mentioned adverse weather and natural disasters as the cause of their low poverty reduction, and
were also considerably more concerned about health shocks (in particular the poor districts of
Nyamagabe and Gakenke).
It is interesting to note the synergy between agricultural improvements and the move to
non-farm activities: while participants in high poverty reduction districts considered agriculture
and the public programmes in agriculture as the main driver of poverty reduction, they
considered inadequate access to finance as the main obstacle to any further improvement in
living standards (through the development of non-farm businesses). Youth FGs also noted this
synergy, by stating that the availability of non -farm employment in their communities is heavily
linked to agricultural growth. At least in this specific context, rapid growth in agriculture seems
to be a prerequisite for the development of a more lucrative non-farm sector.
      6. Conclusions
Agriculture has been the main driver of Rwanda‟s strong poverty reduction over the past
decade. Driven by public investments in improved farming practices, improved input use, and
more efficient land use, the productivity of agriculture increased substantially in the second half
of the past decade, resulting in strong household consumption growth. Together with the
increased market-orientation of agriculture (as more and more households have surpluses to be
sold), increased agricultural production accounted for about one third of the increase in median
consumption between 2001 and 2011.
Rural households‟ consumption levels were further buoyed by the progressive uptake of
non-farm activities. The share of rural households with a non-farm activity almost tripled since
2000, and this has had a positive effect on consumption, in particular for self-employment in
small non-farm businesses. While the quantitative analysis did not examine the reasons behind
this impressive adoption of non-farm activities, findings from the focus group discussions
suggest that this has been closely linked to the increased availability of formal (SACCOs) and
informal (ROSCAs, VSLAs) savings and credit vehicles. For households in Kigali City, the
growth of non-farm wage employment has been the single most important driver of consumption
growth.
Diminishing household sizes have increased disposable incomes. The total fertility rate
dropped from 5.8 in 2000 to 4.6 in 2010, leading to a decrease in child dependency rates. The
effect of decreased dependency rates has been higher in Kigali than in rural areas and has been
more important for the better-off households, largely because the drop in fertility was weakest
for the poor: total fertility rates dropped from 6.0 in 2000 to 5.3 in 2010 for the bottom 40
percent of the population and from 5.7 to 3.9 for the top 40 percent. In the qualitative study, lack
of family planning was also mentioned as an obstacle to escaping poverty. Curiously, men
seemed to be more concerned with this than women.
Improvements in agriculture, the move to non-farm self-employment, and, to a lesser
extent, declining dependency rates have been the main drivers of consumption for the poor.
                                                                                                      99

This is confirmed with the findings from the focus groups discussions, which frequently
mentioned agriculture, non-farm work (closely tied to external capital) and to a lesser extent
family planning as drivers of change. The drivers of consumption are different at the other end of
the distribution, which mostly benefited from an increase in transfers and remittances and
expanded wage employment in the non-farm sector. As these drivers mainly affected the better -
off, they were not mentioned in the focus group discussion (as participants came from the bottom
Ubudehe categories).
Findings from the qualitative study suggest that the development of non-farm activities
depends strongly on the performance of agriculture. For adults this link is straightforward, as
their main non-farm activity consisted of selling agricultural produce on the market. Youth FG
participants however also noted that the availability of non-farm activities was closely linked to
the performance of agriculture in the community. The overall picture is that when and where
agriculture performs well, there is money in the community that facilitates the development of
non-farm activities. If agriculture performs poorly, the development of other activities is stunted
given the dearth of external capital required for initial investment.

            1. Introduction
Buoyed by strong growth, rapid poverty reduction and increases in agricultural
production, hunger levels in Rwanda dropped sharply since the turn of the century.
Rwanda‘s score on the Global Hunger Index-a composite indicator of undernourishment and
child mortality-almost halved between 2000 and 2013, making Rwanda one of the best
performers on the global stage during this period (IFPRI, 2013). In line with this, average per
capita calorie intake in the country increased by almost 20 percent over the past decade
(FAOSTAT, 2014).
Yet despite these positive evolutions, the incidence of child malnutrition remains
stubbornly high. The 2010 DHS and the 2012 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability
Analysis and Nutrition Survey (CFSVA) found that 44 percent of children under five years of
age in Rwanda suffer from chronic malnutrition (stunting), putting Rwanda on the 11th spot in
the global malnutrition league table (UNICEF, 2013)51. Stunting decreased by a modest 4
percentage points over the past decade, a disappointing drop given the large improvements in
other areas52. Though Rwanda has among the highest stunting rates in Africa, relative to GDP
per capita it does not perform particularly badly: Stunting in Rwanda is somewhat higher than
what would be expected based on GDP (the observation is slightly above the regression line), but
only marginally so (Figure 95).

  On the other hand, acute malnutrition or wasting is low at 3 percent.
52
  Of course, the strong reduction in child mortality over the past decade may be one of the reasons why malnutrition
did not decrease much: some of the malnourished children may not have survived in the past.

Chronic malnutrition in early childhood has consequences that last for a lifetime . Poor
nutrition in early childhood, and indeed even in utero, is causally linked to increased mortality,
disease and disability, worse educational outcomes, and lower productivity and income as
adults53. The first 1,000 days of a child last forever, and as such the high incidence of
malnutrition in Rwanda risks jeopardizing human capital outcomes of the future labor force, with
negative implications for productivity and economic growth.
This chapter takes a closer look at the incidence, evolution and underlying factors of
stunting in Rwanda, using data from the 2010 DHS survey. The chapter proceeds as follows:
Section 2 presents the stylized facts about malnutrition in Rwanda, while Section 3 presents and
quantifies the UNICEF framework that will be used to analyze the causes of stunting. The
empirical results are presented in Sections 4 and 5. The final section wraps up.
     2. Stylized Facts about Malnutrition in Rwanda
The rate of chronic malnutrition in Rwanda has declined from 48 percent in 2000 to 44 percent
in 2010. The decrease in stunting was concentrated among the wealthier households, while
stunting rates among poor households have stagnated at above 50 percent. About 16 percent of
children are already stunted at birth, but the real damage is done between 6 and 24 months of
age, when the prevalence of stunting jumps from 18 percent to well over 50 percent. In poor and
non-poor households alike, higher birth-order children are significantly more likely to be stunted
than their older siblings, suggesting a strain on household resources and/or time. Stunting is not
merely a manifestation of poverty. 25 percent of children in the top wealth quintile are stunted
and the district-level stunting map diverges considerably from the district-level poverty map.
2.1. Stunting is on the Decline, but the Poor are Lagging
The high level of stunting masks the progress that was made over the past decade. Between
2000 and 2010, stunting rates decreased modestly from 48 percent to 44 percent, but since 2005
the drop was more pronounced. The level of stunting actually increased between 2000 (48
percent) and 2005 (51 percent), but dropped by 7 percentage points since. In line with this, the
percentage of children who are severely stunted (height for age z-score below -3 standard
deviations) decreased from 23 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2010.
The progress on stunting has however been uneven and has largely bypassed the poor.
Between 2000 (blue line in Figure 96) and 2010 (green line in Figure 96), the incidence of
stunting dropped by a mere 1 percentage point in the bottom two wealth quintiles, while it
dropped with seven, 10 and eight percentage points in respectively the third, fourth and fifth
quintile. Since 2005 however, progress on stunting has included the bottom quintiles: Stunting in
these quintiles increased between 2000 and 2005 (red dashed line in Figure 96) but decreased
significantly since. Progress in the higher quintiles remained however substantially stronger.

with age (Figure 97). While
approximately 16 percent of children aged 0-6 months are stunted, this increases to 30 percent
for children aged 11-12 months, 46 percent for children aged 17-18 months and 55 percent for
two-year-olds. After this, stunting decreases somewhat and stabilizes at a high level of about 50
percent. This is consistent with the literature on child development, which suggests the critical
period for nutrition investments is the first 1,000 days of life, and that only limited catch -up
growth is possible after that.
The stunting pattern presented in Figure 97 suggests that the underlying causes of stunting
are diverse. The high stunting rates at birth point towards factors that affect child nutrition and
development in the womb, such as poor maternal nutrition and health during pregnancy and

                                                                                                                                   103

insufficient prenatal care. The stable stunting rates between 0 and 6 months suggest that children
are shielded during this period by good breastfeeding practices (exclusive breastfeeding below 6
months is high in Rwanda), while the sharp increase in stunting between 6-24 months is likely
the result of cumulative nutrition and micronutrient deficits as complementary foods are
introduced (and additional exposure to infections and diseases as children are weaned off breast
milk). The analysis in this chapter will cater for this by focusing on the separate and cumulative
impacts of food intake, care practices and environmental health conditions.

   2.3.Poverty isn‟t the Only Culprit
Poverty and nutrition are closely related. Children in the poorest quintile are more than twice
as likely to suffer from chronic malnutrition than children in the wealthiest quintile, and more
than three times as likely to be severely stunted (Figure 96). Despite this, stunting is high even
among children in better-off households: 25 percent of children in the top wealth quintile are
stunted and this increases to 40 percent in the next-to-upper wealth quintile. While poverty and
stunting are certainly related, poverty is not the whole story.
Geographically too, the incidence of stunting is only partially related to poverty. Poverty is
concentrated in the south-western part of Rwanda, with five districts having poverty rates
between 61 and 80 percent (Nyamasheke, Nyamagabe, Karongi, Nyaruguru and Ruhango, see
Figure 98). Stunting however is most pervasive in the north-western part of the country,
particularly in the districts of Rubavu, Rutsiro, Karongi and Gakenke (Figure 99). While there
are important overlaps between the two maps (Karongi, for instance, is both poor and stunted),
the differences are obvious too (one of the poorest districts in Rwanda, Ruhango, has stunting
levels similar to the ones in Kicukiro, Rwanda‘s richest district).

    2.4.Higher Birth-Order Children are More Likely to be Stunted
Having extra children puts an additional strain on the household budget. As poor
households get more children, household resources get increasingly stretched, which may result
in worse nutrition for children of higher birth-order (that is, children born later than their
siblings). Care practices may also suffer as the number of children increases, because the
mother‘s time and attention needs to be divided between many children (especially if the interval
between births is short). As a result, first-borns may be advantaged both from a nutritional and a
care point of view.
First-born children in Rwanda are significantly less likely to be malnourished. Stunting
rates among the first-born children in the 2010 DHS amount to 36 percent, compared to 43
percent among second-borns, 47 percent among third-borns and more than 50 percent for
children with birth order higher than five (Figure 100). Intriguingly, the same pattern holds for
households in the two top wealth quintiles as well (labeled ―non-poor‖ in Figure 100): 24 percent
of first-borns in non-poor households are stunted, but this increases rapidly to 32 percent for
second-borns and 40 percent for children with birth order higher than five. This pattern is even
more salient for the wealthiest 20 percent of households (stunting rates jump by 60 percent
between the first- and second-born). Assuming that these households are not constrained with
respect to quality and quantity of food, this suggests that factors other than nutrition alone are at
play. This calls for a more holistic analysis of the causes of malnutrition.

If children of higher birth-order are more likely to be stunted, then the high level of fertility
may an important factor contributing to the high incidence of stunting. Indeed, in each wealth
group, average stunting rates are lower in households with up to three children than in
households with more children (Figure 101, although the difference is not statistically significant
for the third and fifth quintile). In this light it is possible that the rapid decline in fertility

The data presented in this section suggest that stunting is the result of a complex
interaction between many risk factors. The high incidence of stunting at birth points towards
the importance of proper prenatal care and maternal nutrition during pregnancy. The rapid
increase in stunting between 6 and 24-months of age suggests a problem of insufficient quantity
or quality of complimentary food intake during this critical period. The finding that stunting is
high even among wealthier households implies that stunting in Rwanda cannot be analyzed by
concentrating only on poverty-related determinants. This calls for a multisectoral approach to
stunting, taking into account issues related to poverty but also issues related to sanitation, pre-
and post-natal care, child care practices and behaviors.
       3. A Multi-Sectoral Framework of Child Malnutrition
The UNICEF framework considers three underlying causes of malnutrition: Inadequate food
intake, inadequate environmental health, and inadequate care. Quantifying this framework for
Rwanda, we find that access to the three underlying components is low: One third of children 0-
24 months have adequate food intake, 44 percent have access to adequate environmental health,
and 18 percent to adequate care. Only 4 percent of children have adequate access to all three
underlying components. Adequacy in the underlying components is associated with stunting.
Children 0-24 who are adequate in nothing have the highest stunting rates (46 percent), while
children who have a minimum acceptable diet (but nothing else) already have far lower stunting
rates (31 percent). The lowest stunting rates (20 percent) appear in children who have both
adequate access to food and environmental health, defined as having a minimum acceptable diet,
clean water, improved sanitation, and full immunizations.
More than two decades ago, UNICEF outlined a conceptual framework of the determinants
of child nutrition. According to the framework, malnutrition is caused not only by a lack of

adequate quantity and quality of food, but also by frequent illnesses, poor maternal and child
care practices and substandard access to health services. The framework defines inadequate food
intake and frequent diseases as the immediate causes of malnutrition, while food insecurity at the
household level, inadequate care and feeding practices, and poor environmental health are
considered to be the underlying causes (Figure 102). According to the framework, good
nutritional status will prevail if children have access to adequate quantity and quality of foods,
receive age-appropriate care, live in a healthy environment with access to safe water and
sanitation and have access to adequate health services.
Figure 102: The UNICEF framework of malnutrition

A key premise of the framework is the non-substitutability between the underlying causes
of malnutrition. Increasing the access to, say, safe water and sanitation will not have a sizable
impact on the likelihood of being stunted, unless it is accompanied by improved food intake and
improved care practices as well. Likewise, increases access to more and better -quality food will
not do much for malnutrition if it is not complemented by improvements in care practices and
environmental health. This makes intuitive sense for a country like Rwanda, where large
improvements in household food security have yet to be translated in a commensurate
improvement in stunting rates.
While the UNICEF framework is intuitively appealing, most research on stunting tends to
focus on one of the underlying causes in isolation. This is understandable given the difficulty
in convincingly quantifying the different components of the framework. In this chapter we will
attempt to quantify the framework drawing on the methodology proposed by Skoufias, Cuesta
and Tiwari (2014). Using the 2010 DHS data, we will explore to what extent the high rate of
stunting in Rwanda can be explained by inadequate access to food, health and care practices.

              3.3.Quantifying the Framework: Adequate Food
To define adequate food intake, we adopt the recommendations for infant and young child
feeding practices developed by the World Health Organization (WHO). For babies under 6
months, the adequate food intake consists of exclusive breastfeeding (WHO, 2008). For children
between 6 and 23 months, we proxy adequate food by WHO‘s ―minimum acceptable diet‖
indicator. A child is considered to have a minimum acceptable diet if (a) s/he is fed a minimum
number of times a day and (b) is fed with at least four different food groups (has the minimum
dietary diversity)55.
While exclusive breastfeeding in Rwanda is high, most children between 6 and 23 months
do not have adequate food intake. Almost 85 percent of children 0-5 months are exclusively
breastfed and have, according to the WHO standards, an acceptable diet. However, this drops to
only 18 percent for children 6-23 months (Table 12). Looking at the separate components of a
―minimum acceptable diet‖, about half of children 6-23 months are fed with the minimum
frequency, but less than 30 percent of children eat sufficiently varied foods (have the minimum
dietary diversity). The figures in Table 12 correspond with the pattern in Figure 97, where
stunting rates are stable between 0 and 5 months (exclusive breastfeeding is high) and increase
rapidly thereafter (since only a small fraction of children 6-23 have a minimum acceptable diet).
Overall, one in three children 0-23 months have adequate food intake.

 acceptable diet

How does adequate food intake or the lack thereof relate to stunting? Overall, there is a
large difference in stunting rates between children with and without access to adequate food. 25
percent of children who have a minimum acceptable diet are stunted, compared to 39 percent of
children who do not have an acceptable diet. These descriptive statistics are however misleading:
children who have an acceptable diet are significantly younger (8.2 months) than children who
have not (13.5 months), which drives down stunting in the former group due to the natural effect
of age (younger children are less likely to be stunted). Within each age group (0-5 months and 6-
23 months), children with an acceptable diet are still less likely to be stunted, but the differences

  Minimum meal frequency is 2 times for breastfed children between 6 and 8 months and 3 times for breastfed
children between 9 and 23 months. For non -breastfed children, minimum meal frequency is 4 times a day. Non -
breastfed children need to have at least 2 milk feedings per day to have a minimum acceptable diet (next to having a
minimum meal frequency and dietary diversity).

not sufficient for sound nutritional outcomes.

diet (only 15 percent of children 6-23 have a minimum acceptable diet).
To fully capture adequate food intake, we would also need to include information about
food security at the household level and, for young children, nutritional status of the
mother. Unfortunately, the 2010 DHS does not include questions on household food security or
food intake of the mother. In the analysis, we will proxy for the mother‘s nu tritional status by
including mother‘s body mass index at the time of the survey. This is of course an imperfect
proxy, as it does not necessarily correspond with the body mass index in the immediate post -
natal period.

               3.4.Quantifying the Framework: Adequate Environmental Health
We define adequate environmental health as having access to a clean water source, an
improved sanitation facility, and having received all age-relevant immunizations. According
to the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation, a
household has access to an adequate water source if it gets its water from one of the following
sources: piped water, either into the household‘s dwelling, yard or from a public tap; tubewell or
borehole; protected dug well; protected spring; or rainwater. A household has adequate sanitation
if the type of toilet the household uses is a flush toilet (flushed to sewer system, septic tank, or
pit latrine), a ventilated improved pit latrine, a pit latrine with slab, or a composting toilet56.
For the age-specific immunizations, we use the recommendations by WHO (2014)57. WHO
guidelines stipulate that to be fully immunized, children should receive one dose of BCG
(against tuberculosis), three doses of DPT (against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), three doses
of oral polio vaccine, and one dose of measles vaccine. Based on WHO (2014), we adopt
following schedule for age-specific immunizations: 0-2 months: none; 3 months: BCG; 4
months: BCG, DPT 1, polio 1; 5 months: BCG, DPT 1 and 2, polio 1 and 2; 6-11 months: BCG,

In general, access to the underlying components of environmental health is relatively high.
70 percent of children 0-23 in the DHS sample have access to an improved water source,
approximately the same as the proportion with access to improved sanitation (71.5 percent).
More than 83 percent of children are fully immunized. However, less than half of children (44
percent) have access to all three components at the same time, and are classified as having
adequate environmental health (Table 13).

The spatial variation in adequate environmental health is strongly related to stunting. The
stunting and environmental health maps largely correspond, and the spatial correlation
coefficient amounts to -0.77. In fact, based on bivariate correlations, environmental health
correlates more with stunting than having an adequate food intake. Districts that have

exceptionally low stunting rates despite high poverty typically do well on environmental health:
66 percent of children in Ruhango (poverty headcount of 60 percent) have adequate
environmental health, compared to less than 42 percent of children in ―wealthy‖ Musanze
(wealthiest district outside Kigali).

            3.5.Quantifying the Framework: Adequate Care
Adequate care applies to both mothers and children and relates to practices such as
breastfeeding, timely introduction of appropriate complimentary feeding, hygiene and
health seeking behaviors, ante- and postnatal care etc. The care component of the UNICEF
framework partly overlaps with the food intake component: Exclusive breastfeeding in the first
six months is an adequate care practice, but also represents the recommended diet for newborns.
Similarly, timely introduction of complimentary foods is a good care practice, but is also part of
the minimum acceptable diet for children 6-23 months. To avoid overlaps, we decided to classify
everything related to feeding practices in the ―adequate food‖ component, except for rapid
initiation of breastfeeding, which we consider as an adequate care practice.
To define adequate care, we adopt a number of WHO guidelines on ante- and postnatal
care, use of mosquito nets, and a selection of feeding practices. Following WHO (), adequate
antenatal care consists of minimum four visits during pregnancy, attended by trained personnel.
It is recommended that delivery takes place in a health facility and that postnatal checkups for
both mother and child happen within the first two days of delivery (WHO, 2014). On feeding
practices, WHO recommends that children are put to the breast within one hour of birth (early
initiation of breastfeeding).
The prevalence of good care practices varies widely. While 80 percent of children 0-23
months in the sample were born in a health facility, only 4 percent received a postnatal checkup
within the first two days of birth. 36 percent of mothers benefited from at least four antenatal
consultations, but less than 20 percent had a checkup within the first two days of delivery. 75
percent of children slept under a mosquito net the night preceding the interview, and 70 percent
of children were put to breast within one hour of birth (Table 14).

If we define adequate care as the combination of the six selected care practices, its
prevalence is close to zero (0.6 percent). Excluding postnatal child care, which is very low in
Rwanda, from the adequate care definition increases the fraction of children with adequate care
to 3.5 percent, still very low. Further excluding the postnatal maternal check-up from the

definition increases the incidence of adequate care to 18 percent (Table 14). We will use this
specification of adequate care ―light‖ in the analysis.
A number of care practices are strongly related to stunting. Children born in a health facility
are 12 percentage points less likely to be stunted than children born home, and children who
slept under a mosquito net have stunting rates that are six percentage points lower than other
children (Table 15). Children who received a postnatal check within the first two days of birth
are less likely to be stunted, but the difference is not statistically significant (only 72 children in
the sample received postnatal care). Early initiation of breastfeeding is also related to lower
stunting rates. Antenatal visits do not seem to be related to the risk of being stunted. Note that
children with positive care practices (such as being born in a hospital or having had a postnatal
check) are on average somewhat younger than children without the positive practices, which
means the differences observed in Table 15 could be biased by the natural age-effect.

The most stringent composite adequate care variable (including all six components) is of no
use for analytical purposes. If we include all six criteria, only nine children in the sample have
adequate care58. If we exclude postnatal child care, still only 55 children (out of 1,545) have
adequate care. Even in the third specification (without postnatal child and maternal care), only
271 children classify as having adequate care. The stunting rate for these children amounts to 27
percent, nine percentage points lower than that of children without adequate care (and
statistically significant).
To summarize, access to adequate food intake, adequate environmental health and
adequate care is relatively low in Rwanda. Based on the 2010 DHS, 34 percent of children 0-
23 months have a minimum acceptable diet, 44 percent have adequate environmental health, and
18 percent received adequate care. Only 4 percent of children have adequate access to all of the
three components (food, environmental health, and care). Preliminary correlations show that
cross-district variation in the three components is significantly related the district-level incidence
of stunting, with the correlations being stronger than the one between stunting and poverty (Box
7). The next section will examine to what extent the incidence of stunting can be explained by
the combination of any or all of the three components.

children in Ruhango have a minimum
acceptable diet (national average is 33 percent), two -thirds have access to improved water and sanitation and are
fully immunized (national average of 44 percent), and 35 percent had adequate care before, during and after birth
(national average of 18 percent). These remarkable figures likely explain, at least in part, the low stunting rates in
Ruhango. It remains unclear, however, what is driving the particularly strong performance on the underlying
causes in this district.


             3.6.Applying the Framework: How does Adequacy Relate to Stunting?
For the UNICEF framework to be of any practical value, stunting rates should decrease as
adequate access to the underlying components increases. In particular, children with
inadequate access to all three components should have the highest rates of stunting, while
children with adequate access to all three should have the lowest rates. This is indeed largely the
case: stunting rates for children with inadequate access to all components amount to 45.7 percent
(compared to the average of 34.5 percent59), compared to 28 percent for children with perfect
adequate access (Figure 106). Only 62 children however (4 percent of the sample) have adequate
access to all three components.

  Note that the analysis is restricted to children 0 -23 months. 34.5 percent of children below 24 months in Rwanda
are stunted, compared to 44 percent of children below 60 months.

Stunting rates go down as adequacy in the three components goes up. Children with
adequate food intake (but inadequate environmental health and care) have stunting rates of 31
percent, significantly lower than those for children with inadequate access across the board but
still high. Environmental health and care are important too: Children with adequate
environmental health (but none of the other two components) have stunting rates of 34 percent,
while children with adequate care have stunting rates of 35 percent (Figure 106).
The real impact on stunting seems to happen when children have both adequate food
intake and adequate environmental health. 14 percent of children in the sample have adequate
access to both food and environmental health, and their stunting rates (20 percent) are lower than
any other of the possible combinations (although not always in a statistically significant fashion).
As argued by the UNICEF framework, there are substantial synergies and complementarities
between the components: While having adequate access to only one of the components (say,
food) definitely helps, the larger effects are observed when children have adequate access to at
least two of the components: children with both adequate food intake and adequate care have
stunting rates of 21 percent (although only 36 children have this particular combination) and
stunting for children with both adequate care and adequate environmental health amounts to 22
percent.
While the figures and correlations presented so far are informative, they do not account for
other factors that also influence child health. In the next sub-section, we estimate a number of
multivariate models to examine the contribution of the different adequacy categories and their
interaction while controlling for the influence of other important determinants such as age and
sex of the child, birth order, various characteristics of the mother, regional effects, etc. For the
sake of clarity, only the main results are presented in the text, while the regression estimates are
put in annexes. The analysis focuses on both the underlying height for age z -scores (linear
regression) and the binary stunting category (logistic regression).

   4. The Determinants of Chronic Malnutrition
Examining the correlates of malnutrition in a regression framework, we find that adequate food
by itself does not matter for stunting. The only factor that is consistently related to stunting is
environmental health. Environmental health matters both in isolation and in combination with
any of the two other underlying causes. Depending on the specification, children with adequate
environmental health are 9 to 10 percentage points less likely to be stunted. Combining
environmental health with adequate food reduces the risk of being stunted by 12 percentage
points, while combining it with adequate care reduces the risk by 15 percentage points. Boys are
more likely to be stunted than girls, and children with educated mothers are less likely to be
stunted.
The results presented in this section are based on four specifications. The first two
specifications include three dummy variables on whether the child has adequate food intake
(regardless of adequacy in the two other components), adequate environmental health or
adequate care, controlling for the influence of a set of child, mother and household
characteristics. This specification yields the partial correlation coefficients between a child‘s
height for age z-score or his/her probability of being stunted and adequacy in the three
categories. This simple specification does not cater for potential synergies and interactions
between the underlying causes of malnutrition and can be written as:
             ∑                                       (1)
for the height for age z-scores as dependent variable and
                     ∑                               (2)
when the dependent variable is the probability of being stunted.     is a series of three indicator
variables to capture adequacy in the three components regardless of adequacy in the other
components. The only difference between specifications (1) and (2) is the dependent variable:
the continuous height for age z-scores in specification (1) and the discrete stunting indicator in
specification (2).  is a vector of child, mother and household characteristics such as age, sex
and birth order of child, education, age and body mass index of mother, sex and age of the
household head and household wealth.
The third and fourth specifications include a full series of mutually exclusive adequacy
categories and their interactions, and controls also for the influence of child, mother and
household characteristics. These specifications can be written as:
             ∑                                       (3)
for the height for age z-scores as dependent variable and
                      ∑                              (4)
when the dependent variable is the probability of being stunted.      is a series of seven indicator
variables to account for all possible combinations of the three adequacy categories:
          is 1 if the child is adequate in food only and 0 otherwise
          is 1 if the child is adequate in environmental health only and 0 otherwise
          is 1 if the child is adequate in care only and 0 otherwise
          is 1 if the child is adequate in food and environmental health only and 0 otherwise
          is 1 if the child is adequate in food and care only and 0 otherwise

                                                                                                                   116

          is 1 if the child is adequate in food, environmental health, and care and 0 otherwise
The only difference between specifications (3) and (4) is again the dependent variable.

      4.1.       Simple Specification: How do the Underlying Causes Relate to Stunting?
This section presents the results from estimating specification (1) (height for age z -scores as
dependent variable) and specification (2) (the probability of being stunted as dependent
variable). Figure 107 summarizes the results of the logistic regression in specification (2) and
shows the impact of each variable on the probability of being stunted. Full regression results are
presented in Annex Table 10.
Adequate food intake does not seem to matter…
Counter to intuition, having a minimum acceptable diet is not significantly related to
stunting. Controlling for other factors, having adequate food intake (regardless of adequacy in
care or environmental health) lowers the probability of being stunted by two percentage points,
though this effect is not statistically discernible from zero (Figure 107). Using the continuous
height for age z-scores as dependent variable, having a minimum acceptable diet actually lowers
the child‘s height for age z-score, though the coefficient is small and statistically insignificant
(Annex Table 10).

…While environmental health seems to matter a lot
Of the three underlying causes, environmental health correlates most strongly with the
incidence of stunting. Fully immunized children with access to both an improved source of
water and an improved sanitation facility have, all else being equal, stunting rates that are nine
percentage points lower than that of other children, an effect statistically significant at the 1%-
level. This finding is mirrored by the results of the OLS, which shows children with adequate
environmental health have average height for age z-scores that are 0.22 standard deviations
higher compared to other children.
To appreciate the importance of environmental health, it is illustrative to compare its
impact with that of wealth. As expected, children in wealthier households, as measured by the
household‘s score on the wealth index, are less likely to be stunted. The estimation results
indicate that an increase of one standard deviation on the wealth index lowers the probability of
being stunted by 4 percentage points (Figure 107). This means that having adequate
environmental health equals an increase of two standard deviations on the wealth index in terms
of its impact on stunting. This corresponds to moving from a house with an earth floor and dung
walls to one with brick walls and a concrete floor.
Good care practices positively affect nutritional outcomes, though the evidence is mixed
In both the OLS and the logit regression, adequate care is related to lower stunting rates,
though statistically significance depends on the specification. According to the logit
regression (Figure 107), having had adequate care before, during, and just after childbirth lowers
the probability of being stunted five percentage points60. This effect is however not statistically
significant at conventional levels. In the OLS however, having had adequate care increased the
average z-score by 0.26 standard deviations, statistically significant at the 1%-level (Annex
Table 10).
Control variables have the expected signs and magnitudes
All control variables included in specifications (1) and (2) have the expected impacts on
child nutrition, though the level of statistical significance varies across specifications. We
observe the typical age-pattern of stunting, with older children more likely to be stunted (to have
lower z-scores) than young children. Height for age is a measure of long-run nutritional status
and includes the cumulative effect of all past and present nutritional deficits, which explains why
older children have lower z-scores (they have had more time to accumulate nutrition deficits).
Boys are more likely to be stunted than girls, and higher birth-order children have lower z-
scores, although the effect is only statistically significant in the OLS. Age of the mother and the
sex and age of the household head do not seem to matter much for child nutritional outcomes
(although there are a number of significant terms when higher order polynomials are included;
their magnitude is however small).
Mother‟s education is the main determinant of a child‟s nutritional status. Relative to a
child whose mother never went to school, a child whose mother completed primary has a
probability of being stunted that is eight percentage points lower. Children whose mother
attained incomplete secondary or complete secondary have stunting rates that are 15 or 24


60
  A child is considered as having had adequate care if (i) the mother had at least four antenatal visits, (ii) the mother
gave birth in a hospital, (iii) the child was put to breast within one hour of birth, and (iv) the child slept under a
bednet the night preceding the survey.

                                                                                                                              118

percentage points lower, respectively (Figure 107). As such, the increasing primary school
completion rates and expanding access to secondary education (although still low) can be
expected to drive down stunting rates through improved education outcomes for the future
generations of mothers. This is however an effect that will only materialize in the medium to
longer run. Note the mother‘s education is likely to be correlated with the underlying causes and
hence may impact the estimated coefficients (for instance, educated mothers likely have more
knowledge about proper nutrition, impacting the ―minimum acceptable diet‖ category).

      4.2.     Full Specification: What are the Synergies between Food, Care and
               Environmental Health?
In this section we present the results of specifications (3) and (4). These specifications
contain seven mutually exclusive categories indicating the adequacy of a child in the three
underlying causes separately, in two of the three causes, or in all three. Full regression results are
presented in Annex Table 11, while Figure 108 summarizes the results of the logit analysis
(specification (4)).
Adequate food alone does not matter; combined with environmental health though, it
matters a lot
Having access to an acceptable diet does not matter for stunting if it is not accompanied by
adequacy in care or environmental health. By itself, being adequate in food intake reduces the
probability of being stunted by four percentage points, insignificant from a statistical point of
view (Figure 108). In the OLS (specification (3)), having adequate food intake is negatively
related to height-for-age z-scores, though the coefficient is small and insignificant. This finding
confirms a fundamental premise of the UNICEF framework: increasing access to food security
alone will not substitute for inadequate levels of the other factors.
When adequate food intake is combined with adequate environmental health however, the
impact on stunting is large. All else being equal, children with adequate access to both food
and environmental health have a probability of being stunted that is more than 12 percentage
points lower than other children (Figure 108). In the OLS (specification (3)), children who are
adequate in food and environmental health have an average height for age z -score that is 0.21
standard deviations higher than that of other children. In this specification however, the effect
misses statistical significance (p. = 0.14).

Environmental health matters most, both in isolation and in combination with adequate
food or care
Having adequate environmental health seems to be crucial for stunting. Children with
adequate access to only environmental health (and inadequate access to food and care) are
significantly less likely to be stunted than other children (10 percentage points less likely). This
is confirmed by the OLS results, which show children with good environmental health have
significantly higher z-scores than other children (0.23 standard deviations higher). Further
expanding the provision of clean water and improved sanitation may well lead to lower rates of
chronic malnutrition, next to being important for health in general.

                                                                                                                                 120

Environmental health has important synergies with the other underlying causes. When
combined with adequate food, the impact on stunting amounts to 12 percentage points, making it
a powerful combination to drive down stunting rates (at least in the logit regression). Combined
with adequate care, stunting rates are 15 percentage points lower than for other children (Figure
108). The OLS results paint a different picture: while the combination of food intake and
environmental health improves height for age z-scores, the coefficient is not statistically
significant and considerable smaller than the care-health interaction: The combination of
adequate environmental health and care increases z-scores by 0.69 standard deviations, a large
effect that is strongly statistically significant61.
Adequate care by itself is also significantly related to stunting. According to the logit
specification, having adequate care (but inadequate food intake and inadequate environmental
health) is significantly related to lower stunting rates (Figure 108). This finding is confirmed by
the OLS specification, where the coefficient of adequate care is positive (associated with better
z-scores) and marginally statistically significant. The combination of adequate care and adequate
environmental health is strongly related to improved nutritional outcomes, both in the logit and
in the OLS specification. The care-food combination has the expected sign, but is never
statistically significant62.
Adequacy in all three underlying causes is not related to improved nutrition outcomes.
Only 62 children in the sample are adequate in food, care and environmental health, as a result of
which the effect is imprecisely estimated. A child who is adequate in all three underlying causes
is two percentage points less likely to be stunted, insignificant from both a statistical and
economical point of view. The magnitude of the effect is small, which suggests other
combinations may be more effective in reducing stunting rates in Rwanda.
To summarize, although the logit and the OLS results differ in certain respects, they agree
on the crucial importance of environmental health and adequate care. In particular,
environmental health is the only underlying cause that matters consistently across specifications.
Environmental health is important in isolation and is the key component in the synergy with the
other underlying causes. While a minimum acceptable diet is of marginal importance by itself, it
is of crucial importance if accompanied by access to improved water and sanitation and full
immunizations. Environmental health is however most effective in lowering stunting rates if
combined with adequate care. The combination of adequate food and care is the only
combination that is consistently statistically insignificant across specifications.
      5. Can the Underlying Causes Explain Differences in Stunting Across Groups?
Using a decomposition framework, we examine whether differences in stunting between poor
and non-poor households and between high-stunting and low-stunting districts can be explained
by differences in access to the underlying causes. Most of the differences between groups remain
unexplained, meaning that differences in coefficients (returns to characteristics) are more
important than differences in the characteristics themselves. Nevertheless, environmental health
is the only variable that is capable of explaining a statistically significant part of the difference


61
   Note that the effects of the synergies are estimated from small samples: 14 percent of children have both adequate
food and environmental health, 5 percent have both adequate environmental health and care, and 2 percent have
adequate food and care (while being inadequate in the third factor).
62
   Only 46 children in the sample have the combination of adequate food and care (and inadequate environmental
health), which may explain the lack of a statistically significant relationship.

                                                                                                                121

in stunting between groups. Non-poor households and households in low-stunting districts both
have better access to environmental health and appear to make better use of it (have a bigger
return to environmental health). While there are differences in adequate food and care across
groups, these differences do not explain the differences in stunting.
The analysis in the previous section showed that certain underlying causes as defined by
the UNICEF framework are significantly related to stunting in Rwanda. To what extent can
differences in underlying causes across groups explain differences in stunting rates? To answer
this question, we decompose stunting rates by groups defined in terms of poverty (comparing
children in households with low wealth scores and those in households with high wealth scores)
and in terms of geographical location (comparing low stunting districts and high stunting
districts.
To decompose differences in stunting rates across groups, we use the well-known Oaxaca-
Blinder (OB) decomposition. The OB decomposition decomposes differences in a variable (in
our case: stunting) across groups into a part that can be explained by differences in independent
variables (for instances, higher adequacy in any of the underlying causes, higher education
levels, etc.) and a part that can be explained by differences in returns (differences in
coefficients). We are particularly interested to see whether differences in stunting across groups
can be explained by different level of adequacy in the underlying causes or differences in the
returns to the underlying causes.

5.1     Decomposition by Wealth
For the decomposition by wealth, we divide households in the sample into two groups,
depending on their score on the wealth index. Households in the bottom 60 percent of the
wealth index are classified as poor, while the other households are considered non-poor. This
largely corresponds to Rwanda‘s poverty headcount using the international US$ 1.25 a day line
(63 percent).

Two main messages emerge from the full decomposition results (Annex 8). The first is that
more than half (60 percent) of the difference in stunting rates across poverty groups remains

                                                                                                                      122

unexplained by the differences in covariates (although the part that is explained by the covariates
still is strongly statistically significant). This means that most of the difference in stunting
between poor and non-poor households can be explained by differences in coefficients or
―returns to endowments‖. Although difficult to capture intuitively, this suggests that non-poor
households make better use of certain important inputs in child health (such as mother‘s
education, clean water and sanitation, etc.) which explains the better nutritional outcomes of their
children.
The second message is that environmental health is the only underlying factor that is
capable of explaining the difference in stunting rates across poverty groups. Children from
non-poor households are 20 percentage points more likely to have adequate environmental health
(Figure 109), and this explains approximately 10 percent of the difference in stunting rates
between poor and non-poor households63. Taken together, differences in environmental health
between poor and non-poor households (both in levels and in returns) explain roughly 26 percent
of the difference in stunting rates64.
While adequacy in food and care is also higher for children in non-poor households, these
differences do not explain differences in stunting rates. Although a usual suspect, poor
children‘s inferior diets thus do not seem to blame for their worse nutritional status (Box 1). Next
to environmental health, one more variable is significantly related to the different stunting rates
between poor and non-poor households: mother‘s education, which is significantly higher in
non-poor households.

improved water and sanitation and be fully immunized, 3 percentage points more likely to have
adequate care, and 6 percentage points more likely to have adequate food. Note that the
distribution of adequacy across districts is largely similar as the one by poverty group (Figure
109).

             Should we get rid of kitchen gardens?
             Probably not, but they won’t do much good by themselves
The use of kitchen gardens is increasingly being advocated as a means to provide households with cheap and
nutritious fruits and vegetables to complement staple-rich diets. The argument is that although children eat a
sufficient quantity of food, the main staples (such as bananas and cassava) have low nutritional value, which means
children still end up malnourished. Kitchen gardens can improve the quality of diets by introducing a more diverse
mix of foods and drive down the high rates of chronic malnutrition. In Rwanda too, kitchen gardening is included
as an intervention in the draft Food and Nutrition Policy and the EDPRS -2.
According to the results of the analysis, kitchen gardens are unlikely to substantially affect stunting rates.
About one third of children in the 2010 DHS have a minimum acceptable diet (which combines diversity and
quantity of food), but this is not related to lower stunting rates. While children in better -off households are more
likely to be adequately nourished, this does not appear to explain their better nutritional outcomes. In short, the
widely-heard claim that the high rates of chronic malnutrition in Rwanda can be explained by low quality diets is
not supported by the data (at least not by the DHS).
Does this mean kitchen gardens are useless? The answer is no. While kitchen gardens, or having access to a
more diverse diet, will not do much good in isolation, there are important synergies with other underlying causes of
malnutrition. In particular, the results show that when combined with improved environmental health or adequate
care, having an acceptable diet helps a lot, more than only having adequate environmental health or adequate care.
This highlights the need for a multi-sectoral approach to combating malnutrition, combining interventions that
tackle food security, diversity, and environmental health.

The decomposition by districts is similar to the one by poverty group. Most of the difference
in stunting rates across districts (almost 70 percent) can be explained by differences in
coefficients or ―returns to endowments‖. Interestingly, this is almost entirely driven by the
different returns to adequate environmental health: in high stunting districts, having adequate
environmental health lowers the probability of being stunted by only 1 percentage point. In the
low stunting districts, it lowers the probability by 11 percentage points. Although difficult to
capture intuitively, this suggests that households or caretakers in the low stunting districts make
better use of clean water and sanitation (or there are complementary factors present) which
explains the better nutritional outcomes of their children. This could for instance happen if
households in low stunting areas have superior knowledge on various aspects of child health,
which makes them to adopt better behaviors and practices (such as handwashing behaviors).
Similar to the decomposition by poverty status, environmental health is the only underlying
cause that explains a significant part of the difference in stunting across districts65. The
effect is however small: the higher proportion of children in low stunting districts who have
access to improved water and sanitation and immunizations explains approximately 7 percent of
the difference in stunting across districts. Taken together, differences in environmental health
(both in levels and in returns) between low and high stunting districts explain more than 37
percent of the difference in stunting.

  Comparing stunting rates in Africa and India, Spears (2013) also finds that sanitation, and in particular open
defecation, explains much of the excess stunting rates in India.

Although adequate diets are more prevalent in the low-stunting provinces, differences in
food intake do not explain differences in stunting rates (coefficient of zero in Annex Table
12). The same is true for differences in adequate care, which do not explain the different stunting
rates between low- and high-stunting districts. Households in low-stunting districts are on
average wealthier than those in high-stunting districts, and this explains approximately seven
percent of the difference in stunting. Finally, the results show that mother‘s education is higher
in low-stunting districts, also partly explaining the lower stunting rates there.
      6. Conclusions
Despite a decline since the turn of the century, the incidence of chronic malnutrition or
stunting in Rwanda remains high. In 2010 and also in 2012, 44 percent of children under age
five were stunted, potentially jeopardizing their long-run human capital accumulation. While
stunting has decreased over the past decade, and especially since 2005, the poor are lagging
behind. Stunting rates in the bottom two wealth quintiles remain higher than 50 percent, and
have hardly changed since 2000.
A counterintuitive finding of the analysis is that poor diets, although common in Rwanda,
do not seem to explain the high incidence of chronic malnutrition. About one third of
children have a minimum acceptable diet, but this does not appear to be linked to better
nutritional outcomes. In a similar fashion, the lower stunting rates among children in better-off
households are unrelated to those children having better nutritional outcomes.
In contrast, adequate environmental health and adequate care seem to matter a lot for
nutritional status. Children who have access to improved water and sanitation and who are fully
immunized (the three components of environmental health) are 10 percentage points less likely
to be stunted, while children with adequate care (but not adequate food or environmental health)
are 9 percentage points likely to be stunted. Children who combine adequate environmental
health with adequate care are 15 percentage points less likely to be stunted.
The empirical results confirm a fundamental premise of the UNICEF conceptual
framework of malnutrition: that there are substantial synergies between the different
underlying causes of malnutrition. While having a minimum acceptable diet may not reduce
stunting by itself, when combined with access to clean water and sanitation and complete
immunizations, the impact on stunting is large.
While not clear-cut, the results point towards the crucial importance of environmental
health. Environmental health is the only underlying cause that is consistently significant in
isolation, and is the key ingredient in any combination with the other underlying causes. Based
on these results, expanding access to clean water and improved sanitation, both at approximately
70 percent in the 2010 DHS, could do more to bring down stunting than a policy aimed uniquely
at improving the quality and diversity of diets.

     Chapter V. Inequality and the Distribution of Public Expenditures

1. Introduction
As Rwanda‟s experience over the past decade illustrates, what happens to inequality
matters for poverty reduction. Between 2001 and 2006, household consumption grew by 10
percent, though poverty decreased by only two percentage points. In the subsequent five years,
consumption grew by 16 percent, and poverty fell by 12 percentage points. In the first half of the
decade, rising inequality constrained poverty reduction. In the second half, falling inequality
boosted it (see Chapter I).
Relative to other African countries and low-income countries in general, consumption
inequality in Rwanda is high. In 2011, the top 1 percent accounted for over 14 percent of total
consumption, higher than the share captured by the bottom 40 percent together (slightly less than
14 percent)66. As a result, Rwanda‘s Gini index of inequality (50.8) is substantially higher than
the average level of inequality in Africa (Gini of 43.3 in 21 African countries with a comparable
consumption survey around the same period) and the average inequality in low -income67. Since
2006, inequality has however decreased faster in Rwanda (decrease of 2.3 percentage points)
than in the average African country (average decline of 0.7 percentage points between 2005 and
2010).
Given the importance of inequality dynamics in determining the pace of poverty reduction,
this chapter takes a closer look at inequality in Rwanda. The first part of this chapter explores
the sources of inequality and the mechanisms that have pushed inequality down -albeit from a
high level- since 2006. The second part of the chapter will link inequality in consumption to
access to education and will examine the distributional effects of public expenditures on
education.




66
 This should be interpreted with caution, as outliers may overestimate the share accruing to the top 1 percent.
67
  The reader is advised to treat these comparisons with caution, as different countries have different ways of
measuring consumption.

considered a substantial decline (Figure
111). The Lorenz curves for 2006 and 2011
do not cross, which means the consumption
distribution was more equal in 2011 than in
2006 for any standard measure of inequality
(Figure 112)68. Inequality is substantially
lower in rural areas (40.2) than in urban
areas (58.2) and also decreased faster: The
Gini index decreased by 4.3 percent in rural
areas compared to 2.7 percent in urban
areas.
The decrease in inequality has been most
salient among both the very poor and the
wealthiest. While the Gini coefficient is
most responsive to changes in inequality in
the middle of the distribution, the so-called
generalized entropy (GE) measures of
inequality can highlight changes in
inequality for different levels of

at the very bottom of the consumption distribution, while GE(2) focuses on the top of the

pattern is especially salient in rural areas (Table 16).

3. Sources of Inequality and the Inequality Drop
                3.1.The Structure of Inequality
To help understand the factors that account for the high level of inequality, we decompose
overall inequality in a within- and between-group component. Within-group inequality
measures the contribution to total inequality of inequality within certain groups (such as
consumption differences within rural areas, within provinces, within occupations, etc,), and is

                                                                                                                                       129



                                                                         RWA N D A P o v er t y A ssessm en t ‫ ׀‬A p r i l 2 0 1 5          139
also called ―unexplained‖ inequality. Between-group inequality quantifies the contribution to
total inequality of consumption disparities between groups, such as differences in consumption
between rural and urban areas, between farm and non -farm workers, etc. Between-group
inequality, also called ―explained‖ inequality, is particularly important as it indicates
convergence or divergence of the welfare of different groups of the population over time.
To examine the sources of inequality, we focus on six household attributes : the household‘s
regional location, whether the household is rural or urban, the main occupation of the household
(defined as the occupation that procures the largest part of household income), highest
educational attainment in the household, size of household landholdings, and household
composition in terms of dependency rates. The variables are defined as follows:
     Regional location: The five Provinces in Rwanda;
     Main occupation of the household: Independent farming (self-employed), wage farming,
      independent non-farm (self-employed), wage non-farm, or other (mostly transfers and rents),
      depending on which activity procures the largest part of household income;
     Highest educational attainment in the household: The highest educational attainment of any
      household member, not necessarily the head, grouped in ―no education‖, ―some primary‖,
      ―some vocational‖, ―some secondary‖, and ―some tertiary‖;
     Size of landholdings: Divided into three categories, whether household landholdings are
      among the smallest 20 percent, among the middle 60 percent, or among the largest 20
      percent; this only refers to rural households;
     Household composition: Households are categorized in five groups depending on the child
      dependency rate (0; 0-0.5; 0.5-1; 1-1.5; larger than 1.5);
Since the Gini index is not additively decomposable, we use the GE(0) index of inequality (also
referred to as the Mean Log Deviation or Theil-L index), which is additively decomposable by
subgroup. Annex 9 details the methodology.
Education and Occupation Main Sources of Inequality
Among the factors considered, education was the main contributor to total inequality in
2011. Differences in consumption between education subgroups explain 40 percent of total
inequality in 2011 (Figure 116), up from 30 percent in 2006. Although hypothetical, the
increasing share of overall inequality explained by differences between education subgroups may
point towards increasing returns to education between 2006 and 201169. As a cautionary note, we
cannot infer causality from the statistical decompositions presented in Figure 116. While
differences in education can cause disparities in welfare, it is equally likely that past differences
in wealth or welfare cause disparities in education.
Occupation of the household, defined as the activity that procures the household most of its
income, emerges as another important source of inequality. Differences in consumption
across occupation subgroups explained over 30 percent of overall inequality in 2011 and have
become more important since 2006 (25 percent of total inequality). This can be explained by
consumption levels of independent farming growing slower than the average.

  In a recent research paper, Montenegro and Patrinos (2014) indeed find that returns to education in Rwanda have
increased between 2006 and 2011.

Regional Effects are Substantial but Have Eased Since 2006
Geographical disparities are another important source of inequality. Differences in welfare
between urban and rural areas explained 23 percent of total inequality in 2011, the same share as
differences between the five Provinces (Figure 116). Isolation from key infrastructure matters
too. As noted in Chapter 2, there is a large difference in living standards between connected and
isolated households. These differences explained 22 percent of overall inequality in 2011.
Rural and urban areas have converged since 2006, though the difference in living
standards remains large. Differences in consumption between rural and urban households
accounted for 23 percent of total inequality in 2011, down from 25 percent in 2006. As noted in
Chapter I, rural areas grew faster than urban areas over the past decade, narrowing the rural -
urban consumption gap (which remains however large). This led to an absolute decrease in
between-group inequality (see Figure 117). Inequality between provinces decreased somewhat
too, but less than overall inequality, which makes that differences between provinces explained a
higher share of total inequality in 2011 (23 percent) than in 2006 (20 percent).
Household Composition and Landholdings of Marginal Importance
Counter to popular perception, differences in landholdings explain only a tiny fraction of
overall inequality. Differences in consumption between households with small (bottom 20
percent), medium (middle 60 percent) and larger (top 20 percent) landholdings explain only 6
percent of total inequality (Figure 116), but have slightly increased since 2006 (when they
accounted for 4.5 percent of inequality)70. Differences in consumption between groups of
households with different dependency rates explain 10 percent of total inequality, up
substantially from 7 percent in 2006 (Error! Reference source not found. and Figure 117).

     We can however not account for differences in land quality.

Strong Decreases in Within-Group Inequality
Since the share of between-group inequality mostly increased since 2006, the decrease in
overall inequality implies that within-group inequality must have decreased. Indeed,
inequality within groups declined almost across the board, with particularly strong drops within
educational and occupational categories. Inequality dropped most within agricultural
occupations, which already had the lowest levels of inequality to begin with (Figure 118).
Inequality also dropped within each education subgroup, though more at the lower levels of
education (Figure 119).

                      3.2.The Drivers of the Inequality Decline
The static decompositions presented in the previous section are useful in getting an overall
picture of the structure of inequality, but do not say much about what has driven the
decline in inequality since 2006. This section presents the results of dynamic decompositions of
inequality to gain more insights into the factors that have been associated with the change in

                                                                                                                                      132

inequality since 2006. The methodology for the dynamic decompositions is exposed in Annex
10.
Intuitively, a change in inequality can be decomposed into three components: a change in
within-group inequality, a change in between-group inequality, and changing population shares.
In a dynamic analysis, each of these components can change: Total inequality could change if
inequality increases faster within some groups (increase in within-group inequality), if average
income or consumption growth varies across groups (change in between-group inequality),
and/or if there are population shifts between groups. All else equal, a population shift from a low
inequality to a high inequality group would push up overall inequality, while a population shift
from a low consumption group to a higher consumption group would depress inequality (as a
bigger share of the population would enjoy higher consumption).
Population Shifts Drive Drop in Inequality
As already mentioned in earlier chapters, Rwanda experienced a number of notable
evolutions over the past decade. Among the more salient evolutions were the move to non-farm
economic activities, the rapid drop in fertility, and the expansion of access to education. These
transitions substantially affected the population shares of each subgroup since 2006. The share of
households with a main occupation in independent farming dropped from 74 percent to 61
percent, while the share engaged in non-farm wage employment doubled from 8 percent to 16
percent (Figure 120). In education, the share of households with ―some primary‖ as highest
education level dropped by 11 percent, while ―some secondary‖ increased by more than 40
percent (Figure 121). As a result of the decline in fertility, the share of households with low
dependency rates (less than 0.5 children per adult) somewhat increased, while the share with
high dependency rates (more than 1.5 children per adult) decreased (Figure 122). At the same
time, internal migration has affected the population shares of the Provinces: the share of
households living in the Southern Province (the poorest Province) decreased, while the share
living in the Eastern Province increased (Figure 123)71. The population share of the other
Provinces changed only marginally.




71
  Migration towards the Eastern Province can likely be explained by the availability of land: Population density in
the Eastern Province (275 people/km²) is substantially lower than the average (416 people/km²), and average
landholdings are substantially larger.

The population shifts across subgroups largely explain the decrease in inequality, in
particular the educational and occupational shifts. Table 17 shows the results of the dynamic
decompositions. Each column shows the net contribution of each component, holding the other
components constant. For education for instance, the decrease in equality within education
subgroups (see Figure 118) decreased total inequality by 0.0987 (column 1), while the increase
in between-group inequality (the divergence of consumption across education subgroups)
increased total inequality by 0.1543 (column 4). The larger population share in higher education
subgroups increased inequality by 0.0161 (column 2), due to the higher levels of inequality
among higher levels of education (Figure 119). The population shift from lower to higher levels
of education however strongly decreased inequality (column 3). Overall inequality as measured

The occupational transitions affected inequality in much the same way as education. Pure
between-occupation inequality (column 4) increased substantially between 2006 and 2011,
pointing towards consumption divergence across occupations. The higher share of households
engaging in more unequal non-farm occupations also pushed up inequality (column 2). Here too,
the population shifts from agricultural to non-agricultural occupations have a strong equalizing
effect (column 3), as more households now enjoy the higher consumption levels associated with
non-farm occupations. Note that the same dynamic that reduced poverty is also driving the
decrease in inequality: the progressive move to non-farm occupations was a main driver of
poverty reduction (Chapter III) and also decreased inequality.
The other subgroup decompositions are qualitatively similar to the ones for education and
occupation. Overall, pure between-group inequality increased (except for rural-urban) and
within-group inequality decreased. The population shares and shifts (columns 2 and 3)
consistently have opposite effects: The increasing population shares in the higher inequality
subgroups tended to increase inequality (column 2), while the population shifts to higher-
consuming subgroups tended to push inequality down (column 3). The net effect of the
population shifts was to push inequality down.
4. Access to Education and the Benefit Incidence of Public Spending on Education
As shown in the previous section, differences in educational attainment are the main source
of inequality in consumption. This links back to the literature on inequality of opportunities: if
access to important childhood opportunities (such as education) in a country is unequal, and the
same childhood opportunities are closely related to living standards later in life, one can expect
that those living standards will also be distributed unequally.
In recent years, attention has progressively shifted from focusing on inequality in outcomes
(such as consumption or income) to focusing on inequality in opportunities (such as
education, health, etc.). One of the reasons behind this shift is the question of which kind of
inequality actually matters. Income or consumption inequality, the traditional locus of interest,
may well be a result of individual efforts or innate differences in talent which make that some
people are better-off than others. Many people would consider this inequality as fair: after all, it
is a result of merit or talent. On the other end, inequalities in childhood opportunities which stunt
a child‘s future prospects would almost universally be considered unfair. After all, these are
inequalities that are beyond the control of the individual child and preclude her/him from
developing her/his full potential. Research suggests that opportunities for children in Rwanda
have increased since 2000, while the opposite is true for infants (Box 9).

Outcome inequality can be decomposed in a part that can be attributed to inequality of
opportunity (the unfair part) and a part attributable to factors that are largely within the
control of the individual (the „fair‟ part). Developing the conceptual framework and applying
it to seven Latin American countries, the World Bank (2009) finds that between 27 percent and
52 percent of overall inequality in household consumption can be explained by inequality of
opportunity. In Rwanda, based on the EICV2 data, about 25 percent of inequality is due to an
uneven playing field in childhood, roughly the same as in Ghana at the same time72 (Ferreira and
others, 2014). This means that making opportunities more broadly accessible to children from all
backgrounds can be expected to drive down inequality among future generations, next to
improving aggregate welfare.
Public expenditures are a key instrument in levelling access to opportunities. Public
subsidies for, among others, education amount to in-kind transfers to households, and can in
particular increase use of education services among poor households who are typically
disadvantaged in accessing them. Given the importance of education in explaining Rwanda‘s
level of inequality, this section will examine the extent to which public expenditures on
education benefit different groups of the population in terms of welfare and the extent to which
these expenditures affect poverty and inequality73.
      4.1.      Access to Education
Physical access to education facilities in Rwanda is good. The median rural household has a
primary school within a 25 minute-walk, while for urban households this decreases to 15
minutes. While the poor tend to live somewhat further from primary schools, the differences are
small and insignificant from an economic point of view (Figure 126): Children from rural
households in the bottom consumption quintile (the extreme poor) walk on average (on median)
30 minutes to the nearest primary school, ten minutes more than children from households in the
top quintile. In urban areas, where infrastructure and households tend to be more clustered, the
differences are even smaller. Access to secondary schools is good as well, with children from the
poorest rural households walking 15 minutes longer (45 minutes) than children from the upper
quintile (30 minutes - Figure 127). Isolation or remoteness hence does not seem to be a crucial
barrier to entry to secondary education.




72
   For technical reasons, estimating inequality of opportunity in Rwanda based on the 2010/11 survey is not included
in this chapter: there are too few so-called circumstance variables. Even for the 2005 estimation (based on EICV2),
the only circumstance variables were gender, religion, and region of residence.
73
   At the outset of this chapter, it should be noted that this exercise refers to the 2010/11 fiscal year (same year as the
EICV3 survey) and that the distribution of public expenditures may have changed since then. It is however
straightforward to replicate this analysis with data from the ongoing EICV4.

                            Access to Opportunities
Box 9                       Random circumstances have become more important in determining access
                            to opportunities for infants in Rwanda
To what extent do circumstances beyond your control influence the access you have to a set of important
basic services? That is the question that is addressed by the Human Opportunity Index (HOI), developed by the
World Bank. In simple terms, the HOI looks at the coverage of an important basic service or ―opportunity‖ in a
society (for instance, enrolment in primary education) and combines this with information on the extent to which
access to that opportunity is determined by circumstances beyond a child‘s control (such as having been born in a
rural area instead of the capital, having been born as a girl rather than a boy, etc.). In the ideal society, access to
opportunities should not be influenced by random circumstances.
A recently released report on human opportunities in Sub-Sahara Africa considers access to basic
opportunities for infants (0-1 years) and children (6-11 years) in a sample of 20 African countries 74. Human
opportunities for children in Rwanda have improved significantly over the past decade, driven in large part by the
impressive gains in education (Figure 125). The human opportunity index for infants however decreased (Figure
124). The decrease can be explained by the bigger weight of circumstances in determining whether or not an infant
is stunted (as mentioned in Chapter 4, progress in stunting has lagged for the poor) and the decrease in the
proportion of infants with access to a clean water source (the report defines clean water as piped, well, or rainwater).

 There is substantial variation in the progress on the different opportunities underlying the composite HOI. In
education, Rwanda has made strong progress in increasing net primary school attendance and starting primary
school on time, but less on finishing primary school on time (the opportunity on which Rwanda scores lowest of all
countries). In basic infrastructure (electricity, water, and sanitation), gains were limited, and access to clean water
(defined as in the previous paragraph) actually decreased. In health, strong progress was made on full immunization
(the opportunity on which Rwanda scores highest of all countries) but progress on stunting has lagged.

Of course, wealthier countries tend to have higher HOI scores. Countries with more resources can provide basic
opportunities to a larger part of their population, resulting in a higher HOI. Therefore, a ‗fairer‘ way to compare
human opportunities across countries is to control for countries‘ per capita GDP, and see what countries perform
relatively better or worse conditional on their income level. This exercise reveals that Rwanda slightly
underperforms for its level of income, losing one rank in the overall HOI ranking (from 11 th to 12th place out of 19
countries).

Attendance in primary school is high and relatively irresponsive to household living
standards75. Net attendance amounts to 90 percent for the poorest 10 percent of households and
increases to 99 percent for the richest decile (Figure 128). Girls of primary-school age are
somewhat more likely to attend (94.3 percent) primary school than boys (92.7 percent), and
attendance rates are marginally higher in urban areas (96 percent) than in rural ones (93.2
percent). Attendance in public and so-called Government-aided schools account for the bulk of
overall attendance, expect in the richest decile where attendance in public schools drops off
sharply (Figure 128). Overall, 51 percent of school-going children of primary school-age go to
public schools, 45 percent go to Government-aided schools, and four percent to private schools.
Children from poorer households are more likely to attend Government-aided schools, while
children from wealthier household are more likely to attend pure public schools (except for the
top decile, who are more likely to use private schools).

  The EICV3 household survey measures attendance rather than enrolment. According to administrative data for the
same year (the education MIS), net enrolment in primary school amounted to 95.9 percent (somewhat higher than

The equitable access to education is the result of strong Government efforts in expanding
access to education in the past ten years. At the turn of the century, before the roll-out of free
universal basic education in 2003, there was a clear economic gradient in school enrolment, with
attendance rates being 25 percentage points lower in the bottom consumption decile (62 percent)
than in the top quintile (87 percent – see Figure 129). The roll-out of free basic education since
2003 (between the EICV1 and EICV2 surveys) substantially increased net attendance, from 73
percent in EICV1 to 87 percent in EICV2, with gains in particular at the lower half of the
distribution. Overall, the difference in attendance rates between the bottom and top decile
narrowed from 25 percentage points in 2001 to 9 percentage points by 2011.

In contrast to primary education, attendance in secondary is low and strongly correlated
with living standards. Net attendance in secondary school amounts to 20 percent and is lower
than six percent for the poorest 10 percent of households (Figure 130)76. Net attendance is low
even at the upper end of the consumption distribution: only 44 percent of children of secondary
school-age from the wealthiest 10 percent of households attended secondary school in 2011. Net
attendance in secondary school is substantially higher in urban (37 percent) than in rural areas
(18 percent), and is higher for girls (23 percent) than for boys (18 percent).


Gross attendance in secondary school is twice as high as net attendance. Gross attendance
amounted to 40 percent in 2011 and ranged from 11 percent in the bottom decile to 78 percent in
the top decile (Figure 130)77. The fact that the difference between net and gross attendance rates
increases with consumption suggests that low net attendance for the higher deciles is mainly a
question of students staying in secondary beyond the normal secondary school-age, while at low
consumption levels few children enter secondary school, regardless of age. Most children who
attend secondary school go to public or government-aided facilities, except for the top decile
where most children go to private schools (Figure 130).




76
  According to the education MIS, net enrolment in secondary school amounted to 25.7 percent in 2011.
77
  According to the education MIS, gross enrolment in secondary school amounted to 35.5 percent, actually lower
than gross attendance according to the EICV3 survey.

While attendance in secondary school remains low and unequal, important gains have been
made over the past decade. Gross attendance in secondary school doubled between 2001 and
2006 (from 10 percent to 20 percent), and then doubled again by 2011 (40 percent). The
introduction of the Nine Year Basic Education Program (9YBE) in 2009, which offers six years
of primary education and three years of junior secondary free of charge, dramatically expanded
access to secondary school at all points of the distribution, in particular for the poorest: between
2006 and 2011, attendance in secondary school increased five-fold in the poorest decile, four-
fold in the second-poorest decile, and three-fold in the third-poorest decile (Figure 131). Overall,
secondary school attendance among the bottom 40 percent jumped from 3 percent in 2001 to 20
percent by 2011.

      4.2.      Benefit incidence of public spending on education
To examine whether public expenditures on education have an equalizing or dis-equalizing
effect on the distribution, we perform a so-called benefit incidence analysis. A benefit
incidence analysis combines data on public spending on certain services with household survey
data on use of those services to estimate which groups of individuals, ranked in terms of welfare,
benefit most from public subsidies. The methodology is detailed in Annex. Note that this
exercise uses expenditure data from the 2010/11 fiscal year (same year as the EICV3), and that
the distribution of expenditures may have changed since.

Poorer children hence benefit disproportionally from public spending on primary education.
About 25 percent of total expenditures on primary education (about RwF 40 billion in 2010/11)
accrue to the poorest 20 percent, compared to 13 percent for the richest 20 percent (third column

While spending on public primary education is pro-poor in rural areas, the opposite is true
for urban areas. The bottom 20 percent in urban areas account for 14 percent of total subsidies
on public primary education, compared to 27 percent in rural areas (Table 18). At the other end,
the top 20 percent captures 29 percent of subsidies in urban areas, compared to 10 percent in
rural areas. Figure 132 shows this graphically: the benefit incidence curve for rural areas is
located above the line on equality, which means the poor get a proportionally higher share of the
subsidy. For urban areas, the benefit incidence curve lies below the line of equality, meaning that
the poor capture a proportionally smaller share. This is however a common finding and in large
part a reflection of the fact that there are a lot less poor households in urban than in rural areas.

While primary spending is pro-poor, spending on secondary education is biased towards
the rich. Children from better-off households account for the bulk of the enrolments in public
and government-aided secondary education and hence capture the bulk of public subsidies for
this level of education. The richest 20 percent account for over 30 percent of total expenditure on
secondary education, higher than the share accruing to the bottom 40 percent (Table 19). This is
particularly the case for urban areas, where households in the bottom 40 percent account for a
mere 12 percent of expenditures on secondary education while households in the top decile
account for 38 percent. This can be explained by the fact that there are relatively few poor
households in urban areas and, on top of that, they are much less likely to enroll their children in
secondary school.

Figure 133 summarizes the benefit incidence of public spending on primary and secondary
education. Spending on primary education disproportionally benefits the poorer segments of the
population, while spending on secondary is biased towards the rich. However, spending on
secondary education is still distributed more equitably than consumption and hence is still is
relatively progressive: if people who make use of public secondary education were given income
instead of the in-kind benefit (government-sponsored education), the consumption distribution
would become more equitable.

Overall, public spending on primary and secondary education has a modest equalizing and
poverty reducing effect. If households had to pay for the education children receive in public
and government-aided schools, the poverty rate would increase to about 47 percent (up from the
actual rate of 45 percent) and inequality as measured by the Gini would marginally rise to 0.5
(from 0.49 now).
Spending on tertiary education in low-income countries is typically heavily skewed towards
the rich. Children from wealthier households tend to be overrepresented among enrolments in
higher education, and public spending per student is usually many times higher for tertiary than
for primary and secondary education. Rwanda is not an exception: The unit subsidy for public
tertiary education amounted to Rwf 737,553 in 2011, 47 times higher than the unit subsidy in
primary and 14 times the one in secondary (Annex Table 13). Children from the bottom decile
accounted for zero percent of enrolments in public institutes of higher education, while children
from the top decile accounted for 70 percent. As a consequence, public spending on tertiary
education is pro-rich and distributed more unequally than consumption (Figure 133).
The regressive nature of public spending on higher education begs the question as to how
higher education should best be funded. This is an ongoing debate in education research,
pitching those who argue that higher education is a private good and as such should not be
funded, against those who argue that higher education has important social benefits in the form
of higher growth, innovation, and job creation, and as such should be publicly funded78. While
the poverty assessment will not argue in favor of either point-of-views, the high level of funding
for higher education (on a per capita basis) and its regressive pattern imply the existence of
important trade-offs between spending on the different levels of education.
5. Conclusions
The transitions that have driven the reduction in poverty have also had a downwards
impact on inequality. As more and more households moved from agriculture to non-agricultural
activities, their average consumption levels increased and overall inequality decreased as the
population share of the low-income group (agriculture) got smaller. A similar story applies to the
decline in fertility: As fertility rates fell, the share of households in the poorest high dependency
category decreased and that in the better-off lower dependency category increased, boosting
consumption levels and pushing down inequality.
The largest part of inequality in consumption is accounted for by the inequality in
educational attainment across households. Given the recent successful efforts in expanding
access to education, inequality in educational attainment can be expected to decrease over the
coming decade, with potential effects on consumption inequality. In general, Government‘s
efforts to make primary education universal had almost eradicated economic gradients in primary
school enrolment by 2011. This is good news, both for inequality and consumption growth.
Recent research shows that returns to education in Rwanda are amongst the highest in the world,
with particular strong returns at the primary level: In 2011, each additional year of primary
education increased earnings by 34 percent, up from 17 percent in 200679. The rapidly increasing
completion rates in primary school thus hold significant promise for future living standards.

Though progress has been made here too, access to secondary education remains highly
dependent on household wealth. While the introduction of 9YBE in 2009 expanded access to
secondary education, in particular for the poorest households, a child from the poorest 10 percent
of households still was, in 2011, eight times less likely to attend secondary than a child from the
richest 10 percent of households. Given that the effect of education on consumption is a lot
stronger for education beyond the primary level (see Chapter II), it appears particularly important
to get far more children of disadvantaged households in and through secondary school. This
would also change the distribution of public expenditures on secondary education and make
them more neutral or pro-poor.

  Annex Table 4 and Annex Table 5 disaggregate the evolution of consumption drivers by welfare
  group. We present the descriptive statistics for three distinct groups: The poorest 20 percent of
  households, the richest 20 percent of households, and the 60 percent of households between the
  20th and the 80th percentile. Annex Table 4 shows that there were significant evolutions in drivers
  of consumption in all welfare groups in rural Rwanda between 2001 and 2011. The most notable
  findings are that the percentage of households engaged in independent farming did not change
  between 2001 and 2011, regardless of welfare group, and that the overall decrease in dependency
  ratios largely bypassed the poorest 20% of rural households, for which fertility rates and
  dependency ratios remain high.
  Annex Table 5 present the descriptives by welfare group for households in Kigali City. Overall,
  we find significant changes in all welfare groups. The most notable findings are that the average
  dependency ratio increased significantly for the bottom 20 percent of households, going in
  against the general trend, and that the richest 20 percent of households did not increase their
  engagement in self-employment. The richest 20 percent of households in Kigali City are almost
  uniformly engaged in formal wage employment.

Annex 4: Statistical Decomposition Methods and Results (Chapter 3)
In general terms, statistical decomposition methods decompose changes in the mean of a variable
in a part that can be explained by changes in covariates (the ―explained‖ part) and a part that can
be explained by changes in coefficients (the ―unexplained‖ part). In this special focus, we are
interested in decomposing the change in mean household consumption between 2001 and 2011
into a part that can be explained by changes in the means of the covariates (such as increased
agricultural production and commercialization, increased non-farm activity…) and an
unexplained part.
The Oaxaca-Blinder method is one of the best-known statistical decomposition methods but only
decomposes changes in the mean of a variable (Oaxaca, 1973; Blinder, 1973). From a policy
perspective only focusing on the mean is of limited importance. In our case, we would like to
know which factors were associated with consumption changes at various points of the
distribution. That is, can the same factors explain consumption growth of both the poor and the
rich, or were certain factors more important for the poor and vice versa?
To explore this, we apply a novel method that generalizes the Oaxaca-Blinder method to all parts
of the distribution instead of just the mean (Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux, 2007 2009). In this
fashion we can examine what has driven consumption growth at various points of the
distribution. The FFL decomposition procedure includes two steps: In the first step a
counterfactual consumption distribution is estimated that shows how consumption in 2001 would
have been distributed if covariate parameters were the ones of the 2011 distribution. The
difference between the actual consumption distribution in 2011 and this counterfactual
distribution is the part of the change in consumption that can be explained by the changes in the
covariates between 2001 and 2011 (coefficients are held constant). The difference between the
actual consumption distribution in 2001 and the counterfactual distribution is the part of the
change in consumption due to changes in coefficients (covariates are held constant). In the
second step, recentered influence function regressions are used to decompose the explained and
unexplained parts into the contribution of each individual covariate.
We will carry out the decompositions at five points of the distribution: The 10th percentile, the
25th percentile, the 50th percentile (the median households), the 75th percentile and the 90th
percentile. In technical terms, we perform following decomposition:

                  [                       ]



Where         is a particular percentile, X is a vector of covariates and           denotes the coefficients
of the quantile regressions. The first part of the expression,
[                     ]       ,
is the explained part: The part of the difference in consumption between 2011 and 2001 that can
be explained by differences in the covariates (the X‘s), using the coefficients from the pooled
regression (         ). This part can further be decomposed into the contribution of each
individual covariate. The second part


is the unexplained part: The part of the difference in consumption between 2011 and 2001 that is
due to the difference in regression coefficients (the difference in returns to activities between

2001 and 2011). In our case, we are interested in the explained part: To what extent can the
difference in consumption between 2001 and 2011 be explained by the difference in covariates
between 2001 and 2011? In other words, can the higher level of consumption in 2011 be
explained by a higher level of consumption-driving covariates in 2011 compared to 2001?
Annex Table 6 shows the results of the decomposition for the rural areas and Kigali City. The
first thing to notice is that the growth in consumption mirrors the growth-incidence curves for
rural Rwanda (Figure 31 in main text) and Kigali City (Figure 30 in main text): In rural areas
growth was higher for the poorest households (10th and 25th percentile) than for the median
households (50th percentile) and the better-off households (75th percentile). In Kigali City we
find the U-shaped pattern, with growth being highest for the poorest and the richest households
and lower in the middle.
On average, 88 percent of the growth in consumption in rural areas can be explained by the
―growth‖ in covariates between 2001 and 2011. The explained part is higher for wealthier than
for poorer households. This can potentially be explained by the fact that the model does not
include social protection transfers that particularly benefit the extra poor. Since the social
protection programs did not yet exist in 2001, they cannot be included in the model.
Focusing on the role of individual covariates, we find that the increase in agricultural production
between 2001 and 2011 accounts for the lion‘s share of the increase in household consumption.
Increased agricultural production explains 13 percent of consumption growth at the 25th
percentile, 19 percent for the median households and 25 percent at the 75th percentile. Adding the
role of increased agricultural commercialization, improvements in agriculture account for 25
percent of consumption growth at the 25th percentile, 33 percent at the 50th percentile and 35
percent at the 75th percentile.
The move to self-employment in non-agricultural businesses emerges and the second main
correlate of consumption growth, explaining 15 percent of consumption growth at the median.
Increased non-farm self-employment has been important for poorer and wealthier households
alike. In contrast, the increase in non-farm wage employment has only been important for the
better-off households, explaining 8 percent of the growth in consumption at the 75th percentile
and 23 percent at the 90th percentile. For the poorest households, the move to nonfarm wage
employment has actually held back consumption growth.
The decrease in the child dependency ratio spurred by falling fertility rates has also been
associated with consumption growth across the distribution. The role of decreased dependency
ratios was smallest for the poorest households which experienced the smallest declines in fertility
rates and dependency ratios over the past decade.
In Kigali City the growth of consumption is ―overexplained‖ by the changes in covariates. This
means that consumption in Kigali grew by less that would be expected by the changes in
covariates, suggesting that returns to activities diminished between 2001 and 2011. The
increased engagement in non-agricultural wage employment has been the single main driver of
consumption growth in Kigali, explaining 78 percent of consumption growth at the median. In
contrast to rural areas, self-employment has been less important, especially at the higher ends of
the distribution.
The increase in transfers and remittances has been associated with consumption gains at every
point of the distribution, both in rural areas and in Kigali City. They have however been more
important for consumption growth at the higher end: 4 percent of rural consumption growth at
the 10th percentile can be explained by the increase in transfers and remittances, compared to 27

and remittances is a lot higher for the 90th percentile (30 percent) than for the 10th percentile (5
percent).

Annex 5: The qualitative research study
   1. Introduction
There is ample statistical data on the evolution of poverty and social indicators in Rwanda. The
three EICV surveys, four DHS surveys, and two Population Censuses that have been
implemented since the turn of the century point towards substantial social, demographic, and
economic progress, some of which will be treated in depth in this Poverty Assessment. In
contrast, much less is known about people‘s perceptions on the evolution of their living
standards and the perceived drivers of this. To address this, the Poverty Assessment
complements the statistical analysis of existing survey and census data with a new qualitative
research study. The qualitative study examines the perceptions of ordinary citizens, in particular
those at the bottom of the welfare distribution, on the evolution of their living standards and the
main drivers thereof, both positive and negative.
   2. Methodology

   2.1. Selection of Study Location
The qualitative study in the framework of the Rwanda Poverty Assessment was carried out in
June 2014, through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in eight districts in all of the four rural
Provinces (Kigali City was not included). In each district, two FGDs were held with male
participants and two were held with female participants, for a total of 32 FGDs. An additional 8
FGDs were conducted with mixed groups of male and female youth between the ages of 18 and
25, within the selected districts. Overall, 40 FGDs were conducted. 5 case studies, 3 with men
and 2 with women were also conducted to elaborate the findings of the FGDs.
The eight districts were not selected randomly but according to their experiences in growth and
poverty reduction, with a focus on districts with comparatively high or low poverty levels and
higher or lower rates of poverty reduction. The four selection criteria included the following:
1. High Poverty despite Strong Poverty Reduction (HPHR): Districts with high poverty levels
   despite rapid recent poverty reduction. These include the southern districts of Nyaruguru and
   Gisagara (Annex Table 7);
2. High Poverty and Slow Poverty Reduction (HPLR): Districts with high poverty levels and
   with slow poverty reduction. These include the districts of Nyamagabe (Southern Province)
   and Gakenke (Northern Province);
3. Low Poverty and Strong Poverty Reduction (HPHR): Districts with lower poverty levels and
   rapid poverty reduction. These include Musanze (Northern Province) and Nyabihu (Western
   province);
4. Low Poverty despite Slow Poverty Reduction (LPLR): Districts with lower than average
   poverty levels despite a slow pace of poverty reduction. These include Ngoma and Kayonza
   in the eastern Province)

Annex Figure 1     shows the geographical distribution of the selected districts.
 Annex Figure 1: Districts selected for the Focus Group Discussions




Within each of the selected districts, two sectors were selected for the FGDs: one isolated sector
(far from infrastructure, urban centers,…) and one more connected sector (near a road, closer to
infrastructure, etc.). The criteria for determining a sector‘s connectivity considered factors such
as distance to a paved road, infrastructure, such as presence of a covered market, and terrain,
which considered ease of access to other, more urban, areas. Within each of the sectors, a cell
was selected according to whether the sector was designated as isolated or connected. To select
the isolated and connected sectors, a heatmap was created to give an approximation of urban
density for each district (Annex Figure 2). Sectors outside of the main urban zones were
classified by their distance to urban areas or town centers.                                    164

To narrow down the selection, a spatial analysis was then undertaken of each sector within the
list of potential sectors designated by the heatmap. Satellite imagery was used to gauge a sector‘s
isolation or connectivity and to select the cell within the sector for the FGD. Distance to paved
roads was accounted for and particular emphasis was given to terrain. Given Rwanda‘s hilly
terrain and the poor quality of roads in many rural sectors, a distance of under 10 km may require
over an hour to reach by vehicle, increasing the isolation of the sectors. Connected sectors by
comparison were in relative proximity, if not adjacent, to a paved road and had clustered
settlements. Isolated sectors were usually located several hills behind a paved road, often in
valleys. Settlements were scattered along hillsides and the village center consisted of only a few
small buildings. Through this process, the following sectors and cells were selected in each of
the chosen districts.

     2.2. Selection of Participants
Participants for the FGDs were selected following the selection of sectors and cells. Lists of
household members by Ubudehe category were provided by the Cell Executive Secretary for
each of the selected cells80. From this list, a random selection of men, women and youth were
selected from Ubudehe categories 1-3. In some cases, to facilitate selection and field logistics,
local officials were given instructions by the field team to enable them to undertake the random
selection of 6-8 participants from the cell lists for each FGD.
Each cell has approximately 4-8 imidugudu (villages), from which 2 men, 2 women and 2 youth
(in sectors where a youth FGD was conducted), from each fifth house, were selected, until the
total FGD size requirements were met. This selection criteria was used to address selection bias
and enable cross-FGD comparison for the analysis, as groups had similar characteristics.
Participant lists provided by cell leaders, in the case where selection was done by the cell
officials, were cross-checked with the demographic information provided by participants at the
start of the FGD and adjustments made as required.
Prior to the finalization of the FGD methodology, a pilot focus group was conducted in Gasura Cell, in
the far north of Gasabo District. These selection methods were tested through the pilot FGD and enabled
the consulting team to make necessary adjustments prior to the start of the study.

     2.3. Focus Group Discussions
The FGDs focused on four main themes:
     1. Perceptions of poverty at the household and community levels and changes in living
        standards experienced in the past 5 years;
     2. Perceptions of the positive and negative drivers of changes in living standards;
     3. Obstacles to improving living standards;
     4. Strategies for improving household living standards and poverty reduction;


80
   Ubudehe is a social poverty categorization done at the community level for all Rwandan households. Categories 1
to 3 are considered the poorest in the community.

                                                                                                                              168



                                                                   RWA N D A P o v er t y A ssessm en t ‫ ׀‬A p r i l 2 0 1 5    177
In addition, the youth FGDs also focused on employment opportunities and livelihood strategies
for young people in the community.
The FGDs started from a general discussion and moved into more specific exercises. Exercises
were developed using Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) methodology, which sought to
effectively engage participants in identifying responses, as well as analyzing them and evaluating
their level of importance. The methodology engaged facilitators to guide the discussion and
focused on developing and understanding perceptions within the groups to ensure accurate
reflection of responses and improve ownership over the assessment findings. All FGDs were
conducted in Kinyarwanda by Rwandan facilitators to improve participation and level of comfort
by participants. The exercises and themes covered in each FGD are outlined below.
Icebreaker
Participants introduced themselves to the facilitators and identified a song that had their name in
it, or another song they wanted to share with the group. The individual or group sang a few lines
together, and this helped to put participants at ease and increase their level of comfort with the
discussions.
Description of Poverty
Participants were asked to describe characteristics of household poverty within their
communities, in the format of a group discussion. Characteristics of poor households included
lack of basic needs, assets, poor housing quality, type of income sources, and inability to cover
costs for health or education. This general discussion set the framework for the following
exercises, which discussed poverty changes in more detail.
Household Level Changes in Poverty Status
Participants worked together to draw visual representations of their household and surrounding
compound today, in 2014, and five years ago, in 2009. Participants included depictions of
housing materials, assets and livestock, items in the household and other structures most often
found in their own or a similar compound in the community. Once the drawings were completed,
participants discussed the changes in poverty status between the two periods, using the drawings
a reference. The visual representations were an important reference for helping participants to
think about the changes their communities have experienced.
Vulnerability and Social Differentials in Experienced Changes
Following the household drawing exercise, participants were asked whether certain groups had
benefited more or less from the changes they had identified that have occurred in the past five
years. Facilitators ensured consideration of particular vulnerable groups, such as widows, elderly
men and women, orphans, female headed households, households with many children, people
living with HIV/AIDS and people with disabilities. Not all groups were considered in all FGDs,
as this component of the FGD was an open discussion, and participants raised examples and
perceptions without prompting, unless deemed necessary by the facilitator.
Community Livelihoods and Income Sources
Participants discussed their main sources of income and those they perceive as the main sources
of income for others in the community. They were asked whether these sources of income have
changed over the past five years, and if so, for which members of the community. Youth were
then asked a second question about the main types of employment available for youth, and their

perceptions of whether this was different than employment previously engaged in by youth in
their community.
Ranking Drivers of Change
Participants discussed the major drivers of the change in poverty status within their community.
The key drivers mentioned were noted on a flipchart along with whether they were positive or
negative in nature. After the discussion, participants each received 5 tokens with which to vote
on the importance of each driver (Annex Figure 3). They voted and explained their selections.
After the voting, participants discussed as a group whether the prioritized drivers reflected their
experiences and then ranked the drivers by level of importance, making adjustments to the
number of tokens for each driver.
Annex Figure 3: Ranking the drivers of change in Save sector




Voting on Obstacles to Change
Participants were asked to explain the major obstacles to improving their poverty status faced by
individuals and households in their community. Based on the discussion, participants then voted
through a show of hands on the importance of the obstacles mentioned. Each participant had one
vote in order to improve prioritization of the identified obstacles.
Strategies
Participants listed strategies that they or others in the community have used to overcome the
obstacles to improving poverty status. Once the strategies were listed, a ―wall and ladder‖
exercise was undertaken, in which each listed barrier was drawn as part of a wall and each
strategy was drawn on the rungs of a ladder leaning against the wall. Facilitators explained that
the strategies were like the rungs of a ladder, helping to overcome the barriers to improving the
household living situation. Participants matched the strategies to specific barriers that had been
raised, drawing these linkages on the flipchart. However, not all strategies or barriers were
linked, and some strategies were linked to more than one barrier.

Case Studies
Case studies were conducted in the form of short interviews with individuals identified through
the FGDs. This included either FGD participants themselves, or other community members
identified by FGD participants as having had an interesting experience related to change in
poverty status. Case study participants were asked to share their experience through a series of
open-ended questions. These interviews have been transcribed and included in this report based
on their relevance to the thematic areas.
      3. Overview of Participant Demographics
A total of 303 participants took part in the 40 FGDs in 8 districts. Of the participations, 150 were
men and 153 were women, with 60 youth participants (of whom half were men and half were
women). The median age of participants was 44 for female FGDs, 43 for male FGDs and 22 for
youth FGDs. Youth FGD participants had attained more years of education than men and women
in the other FGDs (Annex Table 9).

Over one third of participants had attended primary school and around one fourth had completed
primary education (Annex Figure 4). More women had no formal education than men. Youth
were more likely to have completed secondary education and all of the youth had at least some
primary education. Older participants tended to be less educated: the average age of participants
with no formal education was 56, compared to 25 for participants who had completed primary
school.

Most of the FGD participants were married.
None of the male participants were divorced or separated, but a small number of the female
participants were. Women FGD participants also included a significant number of widows,
which may be due to the predominance of this group in lower social poverty categories. Two -
thirds of the widows in the study were in Ubudehe categories 1 and 2, and all were over the age
of 40, with more than two-thirds over 50 years of age. Both male and female youth were more
likely to be single than other participants.
Most participants identified their primary income source as farming on their own farm, or on
rented land (Annex Figure 6). While many, if not most, relied on multiple sources of income,
own-farming was the main primary livelihood. A small number of participants also listed
farming on other people‘s land for wages as their main source of income. Wage non-farm
activities included tailoring, masonry and teaching.

 Notes: For decomposition by household poverty, household is considered poor if its score on the wealth
 index is in the bottom three quintiles and non-poor otherwise. For decomposition by district, district is
 considered ―low-stunting‖ if stunting rates in the district are below the national average. Other covariates
 included but not presented are: age of mother and father, sex of household head, age and sex of child, birth
 order of child, body mass index of mother. Figures in the table show the contribution of each covariate to the

Annex 9: Inequality Decompositions (Chapter 6)
For the static decompositions of inequality across subgroups, we use the GE(0) inequality
measure (also referred to as the Mean Log Deviation or Theil-L index), which is additively
decomposable by subgroup. The decomposition of the Theil-L index can be written as (Jenkins,
1995)
                                             ̅
                                    ∑       ( )    ∑


where     is the consumption of individual , ̅ is average consumption,           is the number of
individuals, is the number of subgroups and         is the number of individuals in subgroup .
is the inequality in consumption within subgroup .           is the inequality between subgroups,
which is essentially the difference in average consumption between different subgroups.
The dynamic decomposition of changes in inequality between two periods can be wri tten as
(Jenkins, 1995)


                      ∑            ∑           ∑     (     )           ∑              (     )


where ,       and    are respectively the population share, within-group inequality and relative
mean of subgroup . The numeric subscripts refer to periods one (2011) and zero (2006). The
four terms capture the following four effects: (1) changes in within-group inequality; (2) how
changes in population shares affect within-group inequality for instance, an increase in the
population share of a high-inequality group would push up inequality); (3) how population shifts
affect between-group inequality (for instance, an increase in the share of a group which has a
relatively high mean compared to the overall mean would decrease inequality); (4) changes in
between-group inequality.

Annex 10: Benefit Incidence Analysis Methodology (Chapter 5)
For the benefit incidence analysis for public expenditures on education, we follow the
methodology outlined by Demery (2000). First, we obtained data on Government spending on
different levels of education in the 2010/11 fiscal year. Second, we obtained data on number of
children enrolled in the different levels of education in the same year. Third, we calculated a unit
subsidy (subsidy per school-going child) for each level of education, by dividing spending by the
number of children enrolled. This unit subsidy is then imputed to each school-going child as an
in-kind transfer.
Following Demery (2000), we only included recurrent spending on education. While capital
spending was a negligible part of total spending on primary education (less than two percent –
see Annex Table 13), it was a large part of total spending on secondary (32 percent). As
expenditures on secondary education disproportionally benefit the better-off households,
including the capital expenditures would bias the analysis by painting an excessively pro-rich
pattern of education spending.

The unit subsidy is obtained by dividing recurrent spending by the number of children enrolled
and amounts to about RwF 17,000 (PPP USD 50) for primary schooling and RwF 60,000 (PPP
USD 179) for secondary schooling. This unit subsidy is scaled down to account for the
difference in household consumption between the survey and the national accounts. The ratio of
household consumption as measured by the EICV3 to household consumption as measured by
the national accounts was 0.91 in 2010/11, meaning that the survey represented an economy that
was 9 percent smaller than the one measured by the national accounts. To avoid overestimating
the impact of the subsidy on household consumption, the subsidy is scaled down by 0.91. The
adjusted unit subsidies are then used to conduct the benefit incidence analysis.
