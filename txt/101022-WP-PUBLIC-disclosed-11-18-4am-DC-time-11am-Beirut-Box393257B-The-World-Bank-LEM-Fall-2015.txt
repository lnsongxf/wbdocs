will negatively impact lending to the private sector
and raise Lebanon’s large debt service, as new debt
will need to be contracted at higher interest rates
given the ongoing large gross financing needs.

VI.	     Lebanon’s post-civil war governance
system has evolved and deteriorated to a point of
failing the country and its citizens (Special Focus
#1). The public sector has become increasingly
governed by bribery and nepotism practices, failing
to deliver basic public services and incapable of
resolving the most urgent needs. This has culminated
in the comprehensive breakdown in the political
process, with the three branches of government
either vacant or effectively idle, and the only
national plebiscite abrogated. Since the summer, a
series of protests and civil disobedience measures
erupted—sparked by failure to collect garbage in the
country—and is targeting the ruling political class
with emphasis on corruption and incompetence.
Current conditions are unsustainable, and without
significant political and economic reforms, a
widening and worsening of socio-economic unrest
is not unfathomable.

VII.	Lebanon’s healthcare system is a complex
amalgam of public and private institutions,
providing health services to the population
(Special Focus #2). Key challenges include; (i) low
public spending on health; (ii) high household out-
of-pocket spending on health; (iii) disproportionate
allocation of resources on expensive curative
rather than preventative care; and (iv) emerging
epidemiologic and population trends associated with
unprecedented influx of refugees having significant
implications on the delivery and financing of the
health sector. Despite the challenges and prolonged
periods of instability, the Ministry of Public Health
embarked on several successful reforms that
contributed to the resilience of the system in the
face of the crisis.

la politique monétaire au Liban. La politique
expansionniste suivie par la BdL serait impactée à
terme lorsque la Fed commencera sa politique de
normalisation des taux compte tenu de la nécéssité
de maintenir une marge entre les dépôts en dollars
et en livres au Liban. Cela aura un effet négatif sur
les prêts au secteur privé et relèvera le service de la
dette publique au Liban.

VI.	Le système de gouvernance du Liban
durant la période d’après-guerre civile s’est
détérioré au point que l’Etat n’a plus la capacité
de décemment servir le pays et ses citoyens
(Dossier No 1). Le secteur public est devenu de
plus en plus régi et capturé par la corruption et
le népotisme, et se trouve incapable d’assurer les
services publics de base ou de répondre aux besoins
les plus urgents des citoyens. Cette ineptitude est
illustrée par l’inefficacité ou la vacance au niveau de
la tête des trois postes les plus élevés de la fonction
publique et surtout par le blocage de l’élection
présidentielle. Depuis l’été, une série de mouvements
de protestation et des mesures de désobéissance
civile, déclenchés par la crise des déchets, ont vu le
jour, visant la classe politique et mettant en cause
sa corruption et son incompétence. Cette situation
ne peut durer sans avoir d’importantes répercussion
négative. Néanmoins sans d’importantes réformes
politiques et économiques, il est à craindre que les
troubles socio-économiques ne s’accentuent.

VII.	Le Système de santé au Liban est constitué
d’un amalgame complexe d’institutions
publiques et privées, qui offrent des services de
santé à la population (Dossier No 2). Les principaux
défis comprennent : (i) une faiblesse du budget
public consacré à la santé; (ii) un budget élevé
consacré par les ménages aux dépenses de santé
(iii) une allocation disproportionnée des ressources
sur les traitements coûteux; et (iv) l’émergence
de nouvelles épidémiologies associés à l’afflux

    The output gap is an economic measure of the difference between the actual output of an economy and its potential
    output, such that if it is positive the economy is running at above potential. Due to uncertainties surrounding output
    gap estimation techniques and due to data limitations for which Lebanon is known, two alternative estimation
    techniques are employed: The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter and a Production Function (PF) model. The HP filter is
    a de-trending statistical method, which we employ using three standard smoothing parameters. To minimize the
    end-point bias that the HP filter is normally susceptible to, the sample period is extended through 2017 using World
    Bank staff projections. Output gap is also estimated using a PF model, which is a structural method incorporating
    economic theory that relates output to total factor productivity and production inputs. The output gap for Lebanon is
    estimated using the sample periods of 1988-2017 and 1990-2017 for the HP and the PF methodologies, respectively.
    For most periods, the estimation methods yield different output gap, both in levels and cumulative; nevertheless, the
    trajectories generated by the four methodologies are highly correlated. An immediate observation is that there exists
    a large variation in growth rates, with actual output sharply surpassing potential in boom periods and significantly
    below during recessions. This is consistent with volatile economic and security conditions in the country, which has
    been subject to a high frequency of large shocks. In the early nineties, and following the end of the civil war, Lebanon
    witnessed a reconstruction program, which generated robust growth rates. This was followed by a prolonged slack
    in economic activity, such that by 1999, the positive output gap that had persisted during the nineties reverted to
    zero. The enduring economic slack, however, led to an increasingly negative cumulative gap, until 2007, when a high
    growth period ensued until 2010.
    The regional turmoil starting in 2011 was felt strongly in Lebanon, causing sluggish economy activity. All methods
    indicate that the large positive output gap that existed in 2010 starts narrowing in 2011 and closes by 2014 (Figure
    2). In fact, the output gap even turned slightly negative in 2014 with estimates from the different methods ranging
    from -0.51 percent to -1.02 percent of potential output. The very large negative cumulative output gap that existed
    over the period 2000-2008 has significantly narrowed and virtually closed by end-2014 (Figure 3). Estimates of the
    cumulative output gap over the period 2000-2014 range from -2,749 to 1,084 billion LBP, with an average of -725
    billion LBP across the four estimation methods.

efficiency of spending and eliminating waste. Primary
health care reforms through the UHC program,
if well implemented, can shift the composition of
spending toward prevention of diseases, helping to
contain costs in the future.

68.	    Fast tracking pharmaceutical reforms is
also key, given the financial and fiscal importance
medicines have in the overall funding of services.
Implementing cost control through the use of generic
drugs is a good first step in that direction.

69.	     Careful planning is crucial for moving
the UHC program to the second stage of
implementation, which may include expanding
service coverage as well as population coverage
to reach the informal sector. This will entail
expanding prepayment schemes, increasing the
efficiency of revenue collection and encouraging
risk pooling and coordination. As such, extensive
policy analysis and key policy questions will have to
be addressed―who should pay and how much, what
type of fund is most appropriate (public, private) and
whether contribution should be made mandatory.
Strengthening the public health insurance system
through the harmonization of public pooling
arrangements (e.g.; MoPH, NSSF) will also need to
be considered and carefully examined.

highlights the critical importance of having accurate,
