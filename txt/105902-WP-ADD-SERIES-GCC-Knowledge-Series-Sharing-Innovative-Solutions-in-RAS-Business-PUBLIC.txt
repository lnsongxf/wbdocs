         lobal GDP growth remains lackluster, at an estimated 2.4 percent in 2015,
         down from 2.6 percent in 2014. This performance reflects sluggish world
         trade, particularly merchandise trade, and persistently weak commodity
         prices. These trends are contributing to subdued inflation in advanced
    economies and commodity-importing emerging market and developing
    economies (EMDEs), while consumer prices are elevated or accelerating in many
    commodity-exporting EMDEs.

    Despite the headwinds to growth, financial conditions in EMDEs have improved somewhat since the
    start of 2016. Asset prices and capital flows have rebounded, while bond spreads have receded. EMDE
    exchange rates have rallied somewhat against the U.S. dollar after plunging during the past three years.
    Oil prices have risen from January lows, although they remain low versus historical levels due to both
    supply and demand factors.

    Economic performance in large emerging markets—including multiyear contractions in Brazil and Russia
    and continued rebalancing in China—could set back any improvement in the pace of global growth in
    2016. Oil-exporting EMDEs, where fiscal buffers are declining and in most cases inflation is accelerating,
    are under particular pressure.

    With their high dependence on the oil sector for government and export revenues, the prolonged
    period of low oil prices continues to have detrimental impacts on GCC economies. Budget rebalanc-
    ing is underway, but further fiscal consolidation is likely in the medium term given that oil prices are
    expected to recover only gradually. Slowing growth in GCC countries stands to generate negative
    spillovers for oil-importing countries in the Middle East and North Africa through trade, investment,
    and remittances channels.



    Global Outlook

    Global growth: activity lackluster. With the slowing of growth in emerging market economies, the
    contribution to global growth from advanced economies ticked upwards in 2014 and 2015 (Figure 1A).
    However, disappointing growth outcomes during the fourth quarter of 2015 in the United States and
    Euro Area, as well as contracting activity in Japan, contributed to a deceleration of global growth to
    1.5 percent (q/q, annualized), from 2.4 percent the previous quarter. High-frequency indicators point to
    weak momentum carrying over into 2016, as evidenced by subdued industrial production (Figure 1B) and
    falling manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes in emerging and advanced economies in February.
    The weak indicators in February were followed by tentative signs of stabilization in March, however.

    World trade: sluggish. Global merchandise trade was subdued in 2015, as import demand fell in com-
    modity exporters, and weakened in China due to slowing activity and economic rebalancing (Figure
    1C). Last year’s merchandise trade growth of 1.7 percent almost matched the post-crisis low reached
    during the Euro Area crisis in 2012. Services trade appeared more resilient, supported by strengthening
    consumer spending and rising purchasing power among major oil importing economies. The volume

     A: EMDE commodity exporters are countries in the World Bank’s classification of emerging and developing economies (EMDE) where, on average in
     2012-14, either (i) total commodities exports accounted for 30 percent or more of total exports or (ii) exports of any single commodity accounted for 20
     percent or more of total exports. Countries for which these thresholds are met as a result of re-exports are excluded. EMDE non-commodity exporters
     are the rest of the EMDE group.
     B: The last observations are December 2015. Data are seasonally adjusted.
     D: Inflation expectations are defined as the 5-year ahead 5-year rate of inflation compensation derived from the inflation swaps market in the given
