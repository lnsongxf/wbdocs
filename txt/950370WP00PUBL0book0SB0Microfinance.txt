Foreword
By increasing access to finance for out-of-reach households and families, microfinance
continues to be an essential tool for improving livelihoods at the base of the pyramid. The
last 20 years have seen remarkable growth in the microfinance sector. From its early stages
in small-scale microenterprise lending, through its commercial expansion to offer savings
and a broad array of financial services to low-income customers, to its entry into new
markets and incorporation of technological innovations, microfinance is ensuring that an
ever-greater number of households have permanent access to a range of high-quality and
affordable financial services. The microfinance industry is estimated at $60 to $100 billion
globally, where several thousand microfinance organizations reach an estimated 200 million
clients, most of whom were not previously served by the formal financial sector. However,
2.5 billion adults still lack access to formal financial services. Financial services for low-
income people are an important factor when it comes to poverty reduction, as it enables
them to build assets, increase incomes and reduce their vulnerability to economic stress.
Moreover, microfinance continues to be an important tool when it comes to empowering
women.

IFC is the World Bank Group’s main investor in microfinance, working with around 300
microfinance institutions (MFIs) and SME-focused financial institutions, which provide
financial services in 91 countries. IFC is also one of the leading global investors in terms
of volume. In fiscal year 2014, we committed $519 million in 43 projects with MFIs. Our
cumulative investment portfolio in microfinance exceeded $3.5 billion, with outstanding
commitments of $2.0 billion. In fiscal year 2014, IFC advisory services comprised $74.2
million, representing advisory assistance for 86 projects.We have taken an active role in
advising microfinance institutions and building or strengthening comprehensive and
robust credit reporting systems such as credit bureaus, which are critical to avoiding over-
indebtedness and supporting responsible lending practices. In addition, IFC’s work has
been critical in post conflict countries: we have engaged in 32 IDA and 10 post-conflict
countries, including Bosnia and Afghanistan, and with a particular emphasis on Sub-
Saharan Africa, where we supported the creation of greenfield microfinance institutions in
33 countries. This SmartBook, titled From Small Beginnings to Great Opportunities, presents
practical lessons learned from the work that we have been doing on microfinance projects
over the last twenty years. From launching the Microfinance Enhancement Facility to
help the industry stay afloat during the time of crisis, to working on a project to support
microfinance clients to fulfill their housing dreams, these narratives are both engaging and
insightful and we hope you will learn from them. We would also like to acknowledge the
efforts made by IFC staff in not only working on microfinance, but also documenting some
of these lessons for others to learn.

    The Need for Speed:
    Helping the Microfinance Industry Stay Afloat in Times of Crises

    Microfinance has been a lifeline for many low-income people at the base of the pyramid, helping
    them break the cycle of poverty and improve their lives. Yet the rapid growth of the microfinance
    industry, combined with limited financial literacy among its customers, made it particularly
    vulnerable during the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. To expand short-term financing solutions
    to the microfinance industry following the crisis and to keep credit flowing during a period of
    unprecedented financial strife, IFC together with KFW and other DFIs launched the Microfinance
    Enhancement Facility, one element of its comprehensive Counter-Cyclical crisis-response package.
    A timely response was critical, and implementation risks were high. This SmartLesson shows how
    strong cooperation with partners and the decision to develop an outsourced model contributed to
    the success and reliability of this crisis-response initiative.



    Prior to the crisis in 2008–2009, the microfinance        quickly dried up in many markets, and in some

    Network Holding Companies: A Pillar of IFC’s
    Commitment to the Microfinance Industry
    An early supporter of the development of the microfinance holding model, IFC has been investing
    in network holding companies since the early 2000s. The structure has been fundamental in
    quickly expanding access to finance in numerous regions and in bringing microfinance to several
    IDA and post-conflict countries for the first time. Holding companies have helped microfinance
    expand its reach and achieve commercial viability. This SmartLesson shares experiences from IFC’s
    involvement in microfinance networks at the holding and subsidiary levels.

     Keeping a Stumble from Becoming a Fall:
     Lessons Learned from Global Workouts with
     Microfinance Institutions
     For the last twenty years, IFC has invested in microfinance projects, committing $3.5 billion to 215
     clients across 400 projects in 73 countries. During this time, IFC’s microfinance team has learned
     several lessons from our projects with microfinance institutions (MFIs) that we can apply to help
     propel our partners to financial success. Many such lessons can be drawn from cases in which IFC
     had to undertake workouts, or deal restructuring, for projects that faced significant challenges in the
     start-up phases. In most cases, this involved delays in reaching financial and operational sustainability.
     In all cases, IFC portfolio teams in conjunction with the sponsors and other shareholders, had to
     provide very proactive supervision and onsite monitoring.

     Resonating to the “Kundu” Beat:
     Rural Banking in Papua New Guinea
     Innovative solutions are helping people in rural areas gain access to basic banking services. But
     actually implementing those solutions and providing those services entails many challenges. Take,
     for example, the Electronic and Mobile Banking project in Papua New Guinea with Bank South
     Pacific (BSP), an IFC investee institution. The project aligns with the strategic interest in Access to
     Finance to support mobile banking projects across the Pacific to reach underserved segments of the
     population through the provision of electronic and mobile banking. The integration and collaboration
     of BSP with BSP Rural (its wholly-owned subsidiary) as a single bank have provided an extraordinary
     opportunity to offer a variety of banking options for the bank’s diverse customers. This SmartLesson
     details the lessons learned from BSP’s experiences with rural banking.

     through Sustainable, Prudent
     Financial Inclusion
     Responsible finance—the pragmatic way forward in the global microfinance community today—is
     helping IFC have an impact on its clients’ operations and bottom lines, as well as influence on the
     markets where they operate. Responsible finance brings the focus back to clients and encourages
     financial institutions to build client-centric operating practices that support prudent and sustainable
     financial growth over the long term. This Smart Lesson uses recent projects in China to show how
     responsible finance is breaking new ground for IFC in microfinance, enhancing IFC’s relationships
     with its existing partners, and providing demonstration results to share with potential new partners,
     within the microfinance sector and beyond.

     Applying Corporate Governance to the
     DNA of a Transforming Microfinance
     Institution: Mission, Culture, and Risks
     When IFC introduced advisory projects to help companies improve their corporate governance, it
     expected the client base to be real sector companies and regulated financial institutions. However, in
     Europe and Central Asia, IFC started receiving requests to help microfinance institutions run by non-
     governmental organizations (NGO-MFIs) develop their governance standards as they transformed
     into regulated for-profit entities. This SmartLesson describes how IFC responded to this demand, and
     sets out some lessons learned.

     Applying the Pareto Principle in the
     Kyrgyz Republic: Microfinance Matters
     for Job Creation
     By increasing access to finance for micro and small enterprises, IFC helped unlock opportunities for
     job creation in the Kyrgyz Republic. The synergy of a two-pronged approach—improving a regulatory
     framework and supporting a microfinance company in expanding its outreach objectives—resulted in
     the successful transformation of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) into a microfinance bank. The
     client, Bai-Tushum, received a banking license in November 2012, becoming the first microfinance bank
     in the Kyrgyz Republic. This SmartLesson describes how IFC Azerbaijan and the Central Asia Micro and
     Responsible Finance project contributed to this progress—and applied the Pareto principle to help make it
     happen.

        Box 3: Bai-Tushum’s Successful Transformation

        Bai-Tushum bank became an IFC client after signing a $1.2 million loan in 2005 and a subsequent $4 million deal in 2009 to
        finance micro and small entrepreneurs through individual and group lending products. In 2014, IFC approved an investment
        package to Bai-Tushum bank that included risk-management facilities and senior loan of $8 million to support MSMEs in the
        Kyrgyz Republic. IFC was engaged in the company transformation, first with the deposit-taking organization and next with the
        bank, through contributing to the following four components of the transformation:

        Component 1: In strategic planning of the company, the project provided mentoring support to the management for producing
        an investor presentation for potential equity investors in 2009, moderating a shareholder seminar in August 2010, and advising
        on investor relations and negotiations. As a result, Bai-Tushum attracted the first equity investor to the newly registered LLC
        in 2011 and a year later formed a joint-stock company with two other social investors. Thus Bai-Tushum fulfilled the first two
        legal and regulatory requirements (the joint-stock company structure and charter capital requirements) to become eligible for a
        banking license.

        Component 2: To strengthen Bai-Tushum’s institutional structure in preparation for becoming a bank, the project provided
        advice for internal control and audit as well as an inventory of all business processes, which entailed development of a complete
        set of policies—another prerequisite for a banking license.

        Component 3: To help Bai-Tushum build institutional capacity to introduce deposits and obtain a deposit-taking license prior
        to the banking license, the project supported the design and implementation of a stakeholder-engagement advisory module that
        included advice on promoting deposits to customers, designing communications strategies and actions, and developing internal
        deposit-collection policy and procedures for employees. The module also helped Bai-Tushum strengthen relations with the NBKR,
        which gradually became strongly supportive of the company’s plans to become a bank.

        Component 4: The project supported Bai-Tushum with an IT (information technology) audit and assessment of the budget
        allocated for capital investment in hardware to make full use of a newly acquired MIS (management information system), support
        considerable expansion, and acquire a bank license planned in 2012. The consultant’s recommendations were highly valued and
        served as guidance during the company expansion in 2012.

        Component 5: Stakeholder engagement (see Lesson 2).

        As of June 30, 2014, Bai-Tushum provided loans to over 45,182 customers, an increase of 45.5 percent over the same indicator
        in June 30, 2013. Bai-Tushum expanded business considerably upmarket and increased the average loan size to $2,200. The value
        of outstanding loans is $99 million—a 24.6 percent increase over the same indicator in June 2013.

     Avoiding Altitude Sickness in the

     An Old Innovation for a New Era:
     Lessons Learned from Financial
     Cooperatives in the Latin America and
     the Caribbean Region
     Cooperative financial institutions (cooperative banks, credit unions, and building societies) have
     prospered in many markets around the world and have come to play a major role in financial
     inclusion. According to the latest data from the World Council of Credit Unions, there are 51,000
     credit unions in 100 countries, with a total of 196 million members. IFC’s Financial Institutions Group
     team has traditionally found it difficult to engage with cooperative financial institutions because of
     challenges of democratic governance, low financial returns, and limited possibilities to acquire equity.
     However, in recent years there has been a concerted effort to develop partnerships with leading
     institutions in a number of markets. This SmartLesson highlights some of the experiences from IFC’s
     engagement with cooperatives in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region.

     Managing Credit Risk in Microfinance:
     Challenges in the Wake of the Arab
     Spring
     Enda Inter-Arabe (ENDA), a market-leading microfinance institution in Tunisia, was one of the first such
     institutions affected by a repayment crisis linked to the Arab Spring. However, rather than spiral out of
     control, ENDA took quick steps to limit the damage while demonstrating an unwavering commitment
     to its clients. Today, IFC is helping ENDA remain at the vanguard of regional microfinance institutions
     through the adoption of advanced risk management practices. This SmartLesson highlights the lessons
     learned from the crisis, explores the nuances of effective credit risk management, and shows how
     microfinance institutions like ENDA can remain ahead of the curve in the years ahead.

     Lessons from Transformation:
     Recognizing When a New Strategic
     Investor Is the Best Way Forward in
     Bridging a Financing Gap
     “Transformation” in the microfinance world began with the creation of BancoSol in 1992, inspiring a host
     of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to become regulated financial institutions. The boons were
     easy to see: access to commercial capital, opportunity to exponentially increase outreach, and diversification
     into other financial products such as savings and payment transfers. From an industry perspective, this
     model meant private sector ownership and accountability from a formerly “rudderless” institution—and,
     ultimately, improved governance, strengthened internal control structures, and financial sustainability. And
     these improvements spurred strong regulatory support. Many NGOs achieved the desired objectives, but for
     some the journey was not without pitfalls and challenges. This SmartLesson examines the transformation and
     subsequent experience of one such institution, Kashf Microfinance Bank (KMB). It illustrates the challenges
     facing a transformed entity as well as the pivotal role that IFC can play in salvaging a deteriorating situation
     and turning it around for the benefit of the bank, the investors, and the sector.

     Islamic SME Banking:
     Upscaling from Micro to SMEs in Yemen
     Al Kuraimi Islamic Microfinance Bank (KIMB)—one of the fastest growing and most innovative new
     microfinance institutions in the Arab world—is all the more remarkable given that it operates in the
     fragile and conflict-affected environment that pervades Yemen today. The private sector is a key pillar of
     the country’s development strategy, and SMEs (small and medium enterprises), a core driver of economic
     diversification and job creation, have become a key focus. But many SMEs lack access to finance, with
     banks reluctant to lend and microfinance institutions unfamiliar with this segment. To address this gap,
     IFC is working with KIMB, its long-term partner, to design and pilot a new SME financing product. This
     SmartLesson shares insights from the product design and early pilot phase that may prove useful for other
     regional microfinance institutions looking to enter this important space.

     Microfinance Banks in Sub-Saharan Africa

     You probably already know that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in global
     job creation and economic growth. Since the onset of the global financial crisis and the ensuing
     unemployment fallout, “SME” has become a veritable buzzword, and by now most people have heard
     the headline statistics: in OECD countries, SMEs account for over two-thirds of formal employment, while
     the 2013 IFC Jobs Study and other recent World Bank research suggest that the statistic is similar—or
     even greater—for developing countries. Similarly, there is a growing consensus that access to finance—
     while certainly not the only barrier to SME growth—is a significant constraint. This SmartLesson shares
     some experiences of IFC’s microfinance clients with SMEs.

        Box 1: Advans Cameroun’s Experience with SME Lending
        In 2010, in its third year of operations, Advans Cameroun launched an SME loan product with loans ranging from
        CFA 5 million to CFA 50 million (about $10,000 to $100,000). The average loan disbursed is CFA 7.75 million
        ($15,500) and has an average tenor of 14 months.

        In the first three years, the SME loan portfolio grew to CFA 6 billion ($12 million), with 1,077 loans outstanding as
        of the end of 2012. It had a major impact on the institution—accounting for 48 percent of the total loan portfolio
        by volume and 10 percent of the number of loans outstanding. Performance and quality of the SME loan portfolio
        are very good by industry standards. Although PAR>30 increased to 4.7 percent in 2012, by the end of 2013 it came
        down to about 3.5 percent.

        To be eligible for an SME loan, a business must have annual turnover of at least CFA 100 million ($200,000), a
        minimum of five employees, and sufficient skills to provide historical financial information and a vision to project
        the business over the next 12 months. Formal financial statements are not necessary, but the relevant inputs for loan
        officers to piece together an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flows are required. Besides the initial eligibility
        criteria, the primary differentiating factor is the combined historical and projected business analysis.

        A key risk the institution has identified is underfinancing or overfinancing the business. If it is underfinanced, the
        proprietor may need to abandon the proposed plan in favor of a less capital-intensive option that was not evaluated
        in the loan application process. When overfinanced, a business may move into uncharted territory, beyond the scope
        and capacity of the owner to manage. Overfinancing was also cited as a reason why PAR has been seen to dip after the
        third loan cycle in the portfolio. In these cases, there may be adverse incentives for the loan officer to increase loan size
        for consistently well-performing borrowers. This risk can be compounded by overly optimistic borrowers with visions
        of vertically integrating their core business by taking over parts of the supply chain or distribution but without the
        proper planning or evaluation of such expansion.

        The institution has found that profitability of the SME loan portfolio is driven by revenues on larger loan sizes. However,
        it has also found limited, if any, cost savings on the SME loan portfolio. Loan officer productivity, as measured by SME
        loan portfolio per loan officer, is not much higher than for the microloan portfolio, meaning that SME officers make
        fewer larger loans, whereas microloan officers make many smaller loans. Overall, Advans Cameroun views the SME
        segment as a core part of its business model, serving the poor and underserved population in Cameroon by filling the
        gap between the traditional microfinance and commercial banking sectors in the country.

    Box 2: SME Lending in Liberia: When Regulatory Changes Add to Risk
    When AccessBank Liberia—the first microfinance bank in the country—started operations in February 2009, the
    business plan included SME lending as a core component of the loan portfolio and business model, which would
    launch in the second year of operations. However, as AccessBank prepared to launch the product, the Central Bank
    of Liberia introduced a new definition of SME loans, starting at $7,000, and prescribed an 18 percent declining
    interest rate, roughly half the rate assumed in the original business plan.

    In March 2012, the bank launched the SME loan product and intentionally grew the portfolio slowly. One year after
    launching, the SME loan portfolio consisted of 104 loans, representing a portfolio of $1 million, or approximately
    11 percent of the overall portfolio. The average loan size at disbursement is $18,000, whereas the largest single loan
    disbursed to date is $25,000, and the maximum loan size is $50,000. If higher interest rates were allowed in the
    Liberian market, the bank would target SMEs to represent 50 percent of the portfolio by volume.

    As with other countries in the region, there is a high demand for SME loans in the market, but many of the traditional
    banks will not lend to SMEs, given the mix of low maximum interest rates, poor credit culture, and weak legal
    infrastructure for recourse. This combination of high demand and limited supply contributes to an elevated risk of
    fraud, particularly involving collusion between borrowers and loan officers. As a result, AccessBank has had to insist
    on tight controls and oversight of the SME loan portfolio, including the centralization of all credit decisions. This
    shift has also reinforced its focus on existing customers, who are already familiar with the bank’s operating procedures,
    rather than using the new product to attract new customers.

    Regarding profitability, the high cost of training loan officers capable of evaluating SMEs and managing the credit
    process, combined with the more competitive market for SME lending, makes margins relatively tight. Spikes in
    arrears or worsening portfolio quality leading to write-offs can have a direct impact on profitability in this segment,
    making careful and constant management of the underwriting standards essential.

     Breaking Free of the Branch:
     Designing Alternative Delivery Channel
     Projects for Microfinance Banks in Africa
     Nearly 80 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa do not have an account with a formal financial
     institution. Despite recent well-publicized successes in increasing financial inclusion in a small number
     of African markets, such as Kenya, hundreds of millions of African adults still lack access to affordable
     financial services. In response to this need, IFC and The MasterCard Foundation partnered to introduce
     alternative delivery channels in IFC’s key microfinance partners in Africa. Although the partnership is still
     at an early stage, this SmartLesson distills some general lessons from two of the first alternative delivery
     channel engagements. These lessons may be useful for other IFC teams in structuring such projects with

     Greenfielding in Africa:
     A Model for Building Capacity and Scale
     in Nascent Markets
     Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the lowest level of access to finance of any region, with banking services available
     to only about one-quarter of the population. The banking systems are small, and the microfinance sector has
     been relatively slow to expand. Services are concentrated in larger urban centers, with meager service delivery in
     rural areas. Until a few years ago, the main providers of financial services to base-of-the-pyramid customers were
     credit unions, savings and loan associations, and nonprofit credit programs. Now new players include specialized
     greenfield microfinance institutions, downscaling pan-African commercial banks, and mobile network operators.
     This SmartLesson describes how the IFC Microfinance Program for Africa’s greenfield model is increasing the
     number of commercially viable microfinance institutions in the region.

The actual average net income and equity positions for the greenfield cohort were used as a starting point.
The $3 million received in external grants for advisory (“TA funding” in the table) is spread evenly across the first 36 months of operations.
The remaining $1 million funded by the microfinance institution is already reflected in the average net income and equity figures.




 Box 2: Impact of Advisory Services on Financial Performance

 Greenfield microfinance projects generally include substantial grant funding for advisory assistance, largely because of investor
 constraints and because of donor and investor belief in the potential benefits of well-run and (eventually) large microfinance
 institutions offering a range of financial services to microenterprises, small businesses, and low-income populations in Sub-Saharan
 Africa. Although it is possible that these institutions may turn out to be good investments for the initial investors, it is unlikely that
 this will happen over any reasonable time horizon, which most investors consider to be five to eight years. Development-oriented
 investors may accept lower expected returns for higher expected impact, but they also have limits on how far this can be stretched.

 Greenfields receive on average $3 million in external advisory-assistance grants for start-up, and they typically pay about $1
 million more out of their own pocket, for a total advisory budget of $4 million. The Table 2 model illustrates what could happen
 if the full advisory cost were borne by the institution. It shows that typical greenfields would experience higher retained losses if
 paying fully for the advisory services.

 The model also indicates more volatility in the return on average equity, fueled by higher initial losses and diminished equity.
 The time to reach the monthly breakeven point, however, remains the same, at month 42. But since the retained losses are higher
 and will take longer to recover, the expected return to investors is lower. Without advisory grants, the expected internal rate of
 return (IRR) at five years is approximately 1 percent; with advisory grants, it is about 14 percent. An IRR of 1 percent is too low
 for direct foreign investors (DFIs) to justify, even with an important development effect on the local market—even 14 percent
 is below what many DFIs and social investors consider acceptable in a region like Africa.

     Fulfilling the Housing
     Dreams of Microfinance Clients
     Rahees Mohammed and his wife lived in a rented house in a slum and had one wish—to build a
     house that would be a permanent home for the whole family. Aadhar Housing Finance Private Ltd.
     helped Rahees realize his dream by offering a housing finance product that corresponded to his
     needs, preferences, and capacities. This SmartLesson, building on Aadhar’s experience and that of our
     other housing finance clients in South Asia, provides a brief overview of the dos and don’ts for the
     implementation of housing finance products.



     Aadhar offers housing finance loans to households
     earning $1,200 to $4,800 per year and with no proof
     of income, such as self-employed business owners
     like Rahees. It offers smaller loans for repairs or
     incremental construction as well as mortgage loans.
     Aadhar entered the housing finance market in 2010
     with IFC’s support. In addition to financial, IFC
     provided advisory services covering market-entry
     strategy and product design, sales and marketing
     approach, and a risk management framework. As of
     June 30, 2014, Aadhar’s housing finance portfolio
     amounts to $102.5 million.

     Why enter the housing microfinance business?

     Housing microfinance (HMF) is a subset of
     microfinance and fits well into the microfinance
     mission. It is designed to meet the housing needs
     and preferences of low-income groups, especially
     those without access to the banking sector or formal
     mortgage loans. HMF is intended for low-income
     groups who wish to expand or improve their dwellings
     or to build a home in incremental steps, relying on
     sequential small loans. Loan sizes vary from $800 to
     $3,000, and the tenor ranges from 24 months to 60
     months. Interest rates in India are from 22 percent
     to 24 percent. Microfinance institutions require          Rahees Mohammed and his family enjoy their

      The India Microfinance Story:
      Putting the Focus on Borrowers
      IFC has worked on client protection issues since its first microfinance investment in the early 2000s. These
      activities took on a more defined shape when seeds of the Responsible Finance program were sown with
      the Microfinance Credit Reporting Initiative in 2009, which aimed at reducing the significant information
      asymmetry between microfinance borrowers and lenders by supporting increased links between
      microfinance institutions and credit bureaus.

      This SmartLesson shares the lessons learned during the implementation of components of the
      Responsible Finance program of IFC’s Advisory Services—and how that program is having a clear and
      defined impact on India’s microfinance industry.


      In Andhra Pradesh, high growth in the microfinance           project components of the program (Box 1) span
      industry led to an overemphasis on the supply side,          sector, institutional, and client levels:
      ignoring the impact on clients, and brought the sector
      under scrutiny with the onset of a microfinance crisis       • The Microfinance Credit Reporting project promotes
      in August 2010. The state government’s restrictions on       use of credit bureaus for decision making and links
      new lending and recovery led to huge nonperforming           credit bureaus to microfinance institutions, the key to
      loans in microfinance portfolios, and consequently bank      reducing multiple borrowing and over-indebtedness.
