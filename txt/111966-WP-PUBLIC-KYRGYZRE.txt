The objective of the programmatic series of Development Policy Operations (DPOs) is to support the Government in laying the
foundations for faster growth, reduced poverty, and shared prosperity through improving public sector governance and enhancing
the business environment. The program is anchored in the 2013–2017 National Sustainable Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz
Republic. The DPO2 builds on the measures supported under the DPO1, such as the adoption of a new Budget Code, the
streamlining of business registration, etc.
This DPO program supports key areas of the reform program with the objectives of improving transparency and accountability
in managing public resources and promoting simpler and more efficient business regulation and a stronger financial sector.
To improve public sector governance, the DPO2 supports a number of important measures, including:
      completing the verification of asset declaration for a selected group of public officials;
      adopting a judicial sector development program (i.e., an independent budget for the judiciary);
      improving the functioning of the internal audit system;
      bringing the Law on Public Procurement in line with international good practice;
      improving transparency and accountability in the state-owned enterprises in the energy sector.
The DPO2 is also addressing some of the bottlenecks to more vibrant development of the private sector and a stable financial
sector. This includes:
      implementing a risk-based approach to inspections in key inspection agencies in the Bishkek region;
      strengthening the accountability of executive directors through amendments to the Law on Joint Stock Companies;
      developing a credit registry within the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as amendments to the Law on Deposit
         Protection to improve the functioning of the system.
Results to be achieved:
     Increased compliance with anti-corruption regulations;
     A more independent judiciary as well as a more efficient public financial management structure (internal audit function,
        budget code, and public procurement);
     Lowered burden of inspections of business activities and a more stable financial sector.

The objective of the project is to improve the reliability of the electricity supply in the capital city Bishkek and the Chui
and Talas regions—an area served by the state-owned power distribution company Severelectro JSC—and to strengthen the
governance of Severelectro’s operations. By focusing on the service area of Severelectro, the project will ensure that benefits
accrue to the largest share of customers, since it is the largest distribution company, serving more than 40 percent of all
residential customers in the country and delivering more than 50 percent of total electricity consumption.
Specifically, the project will aim to:
 Improve power supply reliability in the service area of Severelectro by strengthening its distribution infrastructure
     (including investments in new substations to eliminate overloads and in advanced meters);
 Enhance the quality of services to customers by providing Severelectro with better information management tools for a
     faster and more effective response to service interruptions and customer complaints;
 Improve the financial viability of Severelectro through a reduction in technical and nontechnical losses in its service area;
 Strengthen governance and internal controls in Severelectro through the provision of access to real time and reliable
     corporate and commercial information, as well as institutional strengthening.

Results to be achieved:
    The project will enhance the reliability of the power supply in Severelectro’s service area and make the company more
     responsive and accountable to customers for the quality of its services. For example, the incorporation of management
     information systems and business process reengineering will facilitate customers’ communication with Severelectro
     through a 24/7 customer call center, ensuring that customer inquiries and complaints are executed in a timely,
     accountable, and transparent manner.
The project is currently undergoing the process of internal reviews by the Government for the signing and subsequent
ratifcation of the Financing Agreement. Meanwhile, Severelectro, the largest distribution company in the country and the
implementing entity, continues to strengthen its capacity to ensure that the project can move to the active implementation
stage soon after it is ratified and declared effective.
The Ministry of Energy and Industry and Severelectro will undertake the next steps to ensure that the project becomes
effective: (i) ensure completion of the internal reviews of the Financing Agreement by the Government for signing; (ii)
initiate ratification; (iii) fulfill the effectiveness conditions of the project, including approval of the project ’s Operational
Manual by the Project Steering Committee and the signing of the Subsidiary Agreement with the Ministry of Finance; and
(iv) prepare supply- and installation-type bidding documents for substations, meters, and management information systems.
Key Partners: Ministry of Energy and Industry, Severelectro OJSC.

The Project Objectives
The Energy Sector Development Policy Operation (DPO) aims to improve the financial viability of the energy sector and
enhance its governance and accountability while also managing the impact of power shortages on poor regions. Accordingly,
the proposed operation supports government efforts in the following three areas: 1) improving the financial viability of the
sector; 2) enhancing sector governance, transparency, and accountability; and 3) managing the impact of power shortages on
poor regions. The program is at the core of the National Power Sector Development Strategy 2012–2017 and is fully aligned
with the objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy for 2013–17 and the World Bank’s objective of reducing poverty and
promoting shared prosperity. The proposed operation incorporates the following key lessons: (i) support complex and
politically difficult reforms through a dedicated sector DPO; (ii) concentrate on a few policy areas that are fundamental to
addressing key sector challenges and that have the Government’s full ownership; and (iii) complement the DPO with other
instruments for Bank support, including investment project financing, technical assistance, and economic and sector work.

Results to be achieved:
       The improved financial viability of the energy sector through power and heating tariff reforms will allow investments
        in maintenance and system improvements and the procurement of fuel for the combined heat and power plants.
       The strengthened governance, transparency, and accountability of the sector will ensure that increased revenues lead
        to improvements in sector operational and financial performance for the benefit of all groups of the population.
       The management of power shortages will ensure that power rationing is equitable across the country and is not to
        the detriment of poor regions.

The political turmoil of 2010 in the Kyrgyz Republic led to significant financial sector instability, causing the collapse of its
largest bank and stress in several other financial institutions. This in turn impacted access to financial services in the country,
as the number of nonperforming loans and funding constraints grew and lending slowed, which further reduced the already
low level of access to formal financial services in the Kyrgyz Republic. Bank credit and deposit penetration in the country are
among the lowest in Europe and Central Asia, and interest rates are among the highest and constitute one of most significant
constraints to private sector development. While non-bank financial institutions, such as microfinance organizations, are filling
some of the gaps for smaller borrowers, including in rural areas, they remain small and face high operational and funding costs
as well as legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints that inhibit their expansion.
The Project Objectives are: to enhance financial sector stability and increase access to financial services throughout the
Kyrgyz Republic, including in remote rural areas. Specifically, the project will: (i) strengthen banking regulation and supervision,
including by means of a new IT system for bank supervision; (ii) support reforms in the Kyrgyz Post Office to expand its
financial services; and (iii) modernize the movable collateral registry to expand the use of movable collateral, such as equipment,
livestock, and accounts receivable.
Results to be achieved:
Those living in remote or rural areas will benefit from significantly improved access to financial services through:
         New points of sales in post offices
         Possibilities to better leverage their assets to obtain loans
         An enhanced consumer protection and financial literacy framework
         Greater access to safe deposit facilities
         Expanded payment and remittance services
Given the explicit targeting of women as good clients by many microfinance organizations and credit unions, it is expected that
women will particularly benefit from this project.
Increasing access to a variety of financial services, especially deposit services, for the poor, vulnerable, and other underserved
populations will help them manage shocks (e.g., food prices, illness, unemployment), especially in rural areas and remote regions
of the country, and will enhance employment opportunities.
The project has made progress on the administrative arrangement by improving a legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework
for the banking sector and increasing the National Bank’s capacity to monitor and address vulnerabilities; transforming the
Kyrgyz Post Office’s existing operation into a more cost-effective distribution channel for basic financial services with increased
access by poor and rural communities, and strengthening the regime for movable collateral registration and execution.

To control the effects of growing migration on urban development in Bishkek and Osh, the Kyrgyz authorities in the early years of
independence began allocating agricultural land to migrants for housing construction in semi-informal settlements, so-called novostroiki
(literally “areas containing new construction”). The creation of such novostroiki continued throughout the 1990s and early 2000s at a
relatively moderate scale, but accelerated significantly after 2005. Today, Bishkek has about 50 such settlements, with a population of
between 125,000 and 200,000, or up to one-fifth of the city’s total population. Osh has eight, with a total population of possibly in excess
of 50,000. Developing these novostroiki was instrumental to preserving a reasonably orderly urban fabric and averting the emergence of
slum-like neighborhoods, but it did little to provide minimally acceptable living conditions to the residents of these areas or help secure
their integration into the urban community. As a result, the two cities have become surrounded by a ring of settlements whose inhabitants
are generally poor, lack basic infrastructure, and have limited access to social, educational, and other services.
The Project Objective is to increase the availability of basic urban services and social infrastructure in the novostroiki in the cities of
Bishkek and Osh, as well as in selected small towns. The outcome of the project will be improvements (that can be monitored) in the
quantity and quality of basic services (water supply, roads, etc.) available to novostroiki residents. Specifically, the project’s performance
will be assessed against criteria such as: (i) increase in the number of residents benefiting from the 12-hour availability of safe potable
water, (ii) increase in the number of residents with access to piped potable water within a distance of less than 150 meters, (iii) increase
in the number of residents with access to roads open to public transportation within a distance of less than 500 meters, and (iv) the
completion of a number of community investment projects.
Results achieved:
 In Bishkek, 21.5 kilometers of roads have been constructed and rehabilitated, thereby providing access to a year-round
   transportation network to about 30,745 novostroiki residents. In Osh, construction of water mains and distribution networks
   have been completed and are now supplying water to about 50,000 residents.
 About 210,300 residents of Osh and Bishkek have benefited from 77 social investments projects.
 28 trucks were equipped with GPS trackers, and data base and electronic data management has been developed in Osh, and
   the solid waste management utility (Spetsavtobaza) in Osh was supported to improve its operations.
 Collaboration with Bishkek city has been expanded and support provided in developing the Municipal Asset Management
   Information System, which will improve management, accountability, and transparency in municipal governance,
 Financial investments have been made in the water supply in Bishkek (Bashkara-Suu water intake) to supply water to over
   100,000 residents of novostroiki, and water supply and sanitation investments made in Batken, Naryn, Talas, Isfana, Tash-
   Kumyr, and Shopokov.
 A total of 174 community subprojects in Bishkek, Osh, and 29 small towns have been approved. To date, 139 have been
   completed, 29 are under implementation, two are in the process of tendering, and four are under the approval process.
   Subprojects have been selected by communities and reflect local needs and priorities.

The Project Objective is to improve community-based pasture and livestock management in the project area.
The project will support 140 pasture user unions (PUUs) and 420 private veterinarians in Chui and Talas oblasts in the
north of the country. The PUUs and private veterinarians in the remaining five oblasts will receive a similar program of
support from parallel-financed International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)-funded projects under common
terms and conditions. The project will also pilot community-based pasture management in five forestry enterprises (out of
42 nationally) in Chui and Talas oblasts as a basis for a future program nationally.
The project is expected to generate improved incomes for livestock owners as a result of higher livestock productivity due
to improvements in animal nutrition and health. Improved animal nutrition from pastures will be generated from the better
alignment of stocking rates with pasture carry capacity, the restoration of degraded pastures, and improved access to
underutilized pastures.
Improved animal health and reduced mortality will result from better animal disease control and improved nutrition. Other
benefits that were not quantified in the analysis include: more equitable access to pastures, including for vulnerable groups
and women, as a result of better governance of PUUs; improved public health as a result of a reduced incidence of zoonotic
diseases; improved incomes from nongrazing pasture use; reduced soil degradation; and reduced water runoff in pastures,
which are an important part of the watershed, and improved carbon sequestration. Fiscal benefits to the Government will
include improved land tax revenues as a result of greater pasture user willingness to pay and improved land tax collection
rates.

Results to be achieved:
     About 190,000 rural households in Chui and Talas oblasts will benefit from improved PUUs and private veterinarian

The Central Asia Road Links (CARs) Program, the result of a collaborative effort initiated by respective governments in
the Central Asia region, has been developed as a regional, multiphase program considered to be a regional transformational
project. The program has the overall objective of increasing transport connectivity between neighboring countries in Central
Asia along priority cross-border road links while supporting improvements in road operations and maintenance practices.
The road links once rehabilitated will improve access along priority transport connections between major urban
agglomerations within the Central Asia region, thereby supporting the creation of an integrated economic region across
borders.
The CARs Program is designed as part of a series of projects (horizontal regional program) with multiple
countries. The program is horizontal in that not all countries would need to start at the same time, but rather each would
begin when ready, through a series of sequential phases. The proposed project in the Kyrgyz Republic is the first phase in
this program (CARs-1), since the country has demonstrated formal commitment and readiness. Tajikistan and Kazakhstan
have also expressed interest in the program. The Second Phase of the CARs (CARs-2) in Tajikistan is already under
preparation. Discussions between the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Kazakhstan are ongoing
with a view to increasing transport connectivity between the two countries in Issyk-Kul oblast (Kyrgyz Republic) with
bordering Almaty oblast (Republic of Kazakhstan).
The Project Objective of the first phase of the CARs (CARs-1) is to increase transport connectivity between the Kyrgyz
Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan along priority cross-border road links in Batken oblast while supporting
improvements in road operations and maintenance practices. The road sections to be financed under CARs-1 prioritize
connectivity between the Osh and Batken oblasts in the Kyrgyz Republic and Sugd oblast in Tajikistan, as they build lateral
spurs from the Osh-Isfana axis to the Tajik border.

Results achieved:
 The project was declared effective on December 14, 2014.
 The Implementing Agency (Investment Projects Implementation Group, IPIG) has initiated advance procurement for
   civil works as well as construction supervision and recruitment of key staff.
 The Implementing Agency, in collaboration with the Bank team, has started preparations for the project launch
   workshop to take place at the end of May 2015.

Irrigation has been practiced in the Kyrgyz Republic for centuries. Since 1991, due to technical, managerial, and financial
constraints, the deterioration of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure has led to an unreliable supply and distribution of
irrigation water, as well as drainage and waterlogging problems. With the assistance of the first On-Farm Irrigation Project
(OIP-1), 450 water users associations (WUAs) were established, and 63 WUAs with a total command area of 122,000
hectares benefited from rehabilitation. After OIP-1, a large unfinished agenda remained. Insufficient investment in
rehabilitation and modernization left many farmers without access to adequate and timely water resources, and the assistance
to WUAs needed to be redirected toward developing the skills necessary to sustain their infrastructure and maximize
utilization.
The Project Objective is to improve irrigation service delivery on a sustainable basis that will contribute to increased
agricultural productivity among irrigation farmers.
The project will achieve its objective through (i) assistance to ensure that WUAs are able to efficiently and productively
utilize their rehabilitated on-farm irrigation systems on a sustainable basis, with special emphasis on water and asset-
management aspects; and (ii) the rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation and drainage infrastructure for around
29 WUAs commanding 51,000 hectares under the OIP-2, and an additional 18 WUAs (34,800 hectares) under the Additional
Financing.
Results achieved:
 Rehabilitation works were completed in 30 WUAs covering around 70,000 hectares, which significantly exceeds the
    project target of 51,000 hectares. 30 subprojects were completed.
 There are now 312 WUAs nationwide, with well-informed water users actively interacting with WUA management
    through their zonal representatives and taking part in WUA activities.
 As result of the rehabilitation of systems and capacity-building support under OIP-1 and OIP-2, 182,888 hectares have
    improved irrigation and drainage services.
 WUA Support Units were initially constrained in their work as a result of government budget deficits, but with the
    funding of some of their operational costs, their performance in supporting WUAs continues to improve.
 An additional 19 WUAs are supported under the Additional Financing. Currently, the status of WUAs selected for
    rehabilitation works is as follows: rehabilitation works have started in 16 WUAs; mobilization is ongoing in two; and
    one tender was conducted at the end of February 2015, with the evaluation of the tender bid ongoing.

This project is designed as a sector-wide approach in which joint financiers pool funds at the Treasury with government funds to support
the government health strategy. This approach to implementation resulted in a much stronger coordination among donors and contributed
to a high level of aid effectiveness and government ownership of the reform process.
The Project Objectives are to improve the performance of the health sector, strengthen the targeting of social benefits, and improve and
sustain the health and nutritional status of vulnerable populations affected by food price shocks.
Components: (i) Supporting the government health strategies Manas Taalimi and Den Sooluk programs to help finance the State-
Guaranteed Benefit Package; (ii) Strengthening the administrative system of the Ministry of Social Protection (MSP) to help it to design a
social safety net strategy and build staff capacity; and (iii) Protecting the population’s health and nutritional status by supporting a package
of nutrition activities targeting women and children.
Results achieved: The Government adopted a new health strategy Den Sooluk for 2012–16 to further strengthen primary health care
(PHC) and address delivery system deficiencies, especially for cardiovascular diseases, mother and child care, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB)
services. The implementation of the Den Sooluk Program 2013, supported by a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp), remained largely unfunded
until July 2014, due to uncertainty about the approval and ratification of the Joint Financiers’ new contributions to SWAp-2. Key results so
far include:
 Infant and child mortality rates have begun to decrease and Kyrgyzstan is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4
  (MDG), but it is off track on achieving MDG5 (maternal mortality). TB incidence and mortality have been on the decline, and
  cardiovascular mortality among working-age adults has stabilized. HIV incidence continues to rise and the emergence and growing
  incidence of multi-drug resistant TB is a worrying sign. It is critical for Den Sooluk to accelerate further progress toward improving key
  health outcomes.
 With support from the SWAp-1, health expenditures increased from 10.6 percent out of total government expenditures in 2006 to 13
  percent in 2010–13.
 The financial burden of the poorest 40 percent declined during 2003–09, and geographic and financial barriers to access have decreased
  due to the introduction of the single payer system and the pooling of funds, efficiency gains obtained from restructuring, and the
  expansion of the state-guaranteed benefits package (SGBP). No further reductions in financial burdens have taken place since 2009. This
  leaves a continued agenda for Den Sooluk.
 The efficiency of resource allocation within the SGBP has improved: the share of health expenditures allocated to PHC has increased
  from 29 percent in 2005 to 38 percent in 2009, and direct patient expenditures (drugs, supplies, food) have increased from 20 percent in
  2005 to 30 percent in 2009, due to the optimization of excessive health infrastructure. However, a drastic increase in the salaries of health
  workers in 2011 squeezed the share of non-salary expenditures. It is critical to ensure that it reach at least 35 percent in the next few
  years.
 The use of primary care services has risen slightly, although the further strengthening of primary care will be addressed in the new strategy.
  Consensus has been reached that improving the quality of care needs to be the main driver of Den Sooluk.

The objectives of the Project are to improve health outcomes in four health priority areas in support of the Den Sooluk National
Health Reform Program 2012–2016 and support the Government’s efforts to enhance the effectiveness and targeting performance of
social assistance and services. The first component supports the implementation of the Den Sooluk Program through a Sector-Wide
Approach (SWAp). The focused areas are: improving the delivery of core services as defined in the Den Sooluk Program, strengthening
the health system, supporting the State Guaranteed Benefits Package (SGBP), and strengthening the fiduciary capacity of the health
sector. The second component involves strengthening the policy and administrative capacity of the Ministry of Social Development to
support the Government’s efforts to enhance the effectiveness and targeting performance of social assistance and social servi ces aimed
at supporting the poor and the vulnerable. The third component is a contingency emergency response. The objective of this component
is to improve the Government’s response capacity in the event of an emergency.
Results to be achieved:
 Government health expenditures as a percentage of total government expenditures will be sustained at a level of 13 percent;
 Increased coverage of the enrolled population, with an increase in the percentage of detected cases compared to the number of
     estimated cases under disease management programs with incentives for providers and patients (hypertension, diabetes, etc.);
 Financial burden of the two poorest quintiles will at least be sustained at the level of the achieved 22 percent;
 Share of social assistance spending on poverty-targeted programs will increase from 15.5 to 35 percent.
Health: Thematic meetings on health financing, curbing the tobacco epidemic, and refining primary health care (PHC) brought together
various stakeholders, including the Deputy Prime Minister, other policy makers, leaders of health organizations and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and representatives of development partners. The meetings have identified the steps needed to refine existing
health purchasing/output-based provider payment methods and the model of PHC delivery and to implement effective tobacco control
measures:
 improving public finance and transparency, improving the primary care payment system and the refinement of a case-based hospital
     payment system, and enchancing the State Guarantee Benefits package;
 increasing excise taxes, baning smoking in public places, and using large pictorial health warnings on tobacco products, among other
     measures;
 fine-tuning the model of care with the further integration of outreach services provided by village health communities into family
     medicine; revisiting the financial incentives by combining the current capitation mechanisms with a pay-for-performance incentive;
     and reviewing and adjusting human resource policies and training with a focus on redefining the role of mid-level providers and
     upgrading their training curriculum to reflect the expanded scope of work.
Concerted efforts are needed to push the PHC development and health financing refinement agenda forward. Strong leadership and
political commitment is a mandatory condition of further improvement.
Social Protection: (i) safety net reform, (ii) modernization of disability services, and (iii) capacity building, particularly in developing
plans and measures for the gradual reform of the social safety net to refocus it on protecting the poor from abject poverty and mitigating
the negative effects of various shocks on the poor.

The Project is to pilot performance-based payments for, and/or enhanced supervision of, the quality of maternal and neonatal
care in randomly selected rayon hospitals and to strengthen the capacity of the Government and providers in performance-
based contracting and monitoring and evaluating (M&E) for results.
There are two components:
The first component would finance a randomized controlled trial to test two alternatives for improving the quality of maternal
and neonatal care at the rayon (regional) hospital level: a) an enhanced supervision scheme using a balanced score card (BSC)
together with a performance-based payment, and b) an enhanced supervision scheme using a BSC only.
The second component would finance training and technical assistance to providers in participating facilities to a) understand
their roles and responsibilities under performance-based contracting; b) enhance their capacity to conduct peer verification of
results; and c) increase their ability to conduct self-M&E for results.
Results to be achieved:
 Performance-based payment for, and enhanced supervision of, the quality of maternal and neonatal care will be piloted
     in selected rayon and small town hospitals;
 Capacity of the Government (Ministry of Health and Mandatory Health Insurance Fund) and providers in performance-
     based contracting and M&E for results will be strengthened.
Pilot project has been successfully scaled up to all 42 hospitals since the project effectiveness on July 30, 2014. That included
four rounds of quarterly peer verifications and one round of semiannual counter verification. The scale up of the pilot project
since project effectiveness demonstrates promising results - the hospitals performance has improved in average from 9% to
33,8%, 42,3% and 53,6% between July 2015 baseline survey and follow up October 2014, January and April 2015 rounds of
peer verification. All 42 hospitals have prepared hospitals development plans to address identified issues, focusing on quality
improvement measures. Counter verification conducted in10 randomly selected hospitals (5 in each Arm) in March 2015
showed difference in scores below the acceptable threshold of 10%. Structural measures of quality have shown striking
improvement, for instance, with the availability of blood stocks and kits of emergency care drugs increasing to near-universal
availability from baseline across both Arms. The improvement of process measures of quality would require further actions,
both at the national and local levels. As agreed with key partners, the use of clinical vignettes seems to be the next step in
enhancing the content of care processes. Another priority area is enhancing provider autonomy, which is necessary to
strengthen hospital governance and the effectiveness of the results-based payment mechanisms.
Overall, first year implementation has created an interest among providers across all three Arms and at the oblast level of health
care. It has been also agreed that preparation of the pilot PHC PBF scheme needs to be accelerated, focusing on all key
needs/issues identified at the PHC level and on the entire PHC network, including stand-alone Family Groups Practices/FGPs
and remote small PHC facilities/FAPs. Close attention needs to be paid to (i) timely design of an open-source information and
communication technology (ICT) system for the RBF program and (ii) technical assistance (TA) for capacity building of
providers' knowledge and skills. Both should contribute to improvement of quality of care.

The Project Objective is to create the conditions for improved learning outcomes in basic education.
There are three components:
The first component focuses on enhancing classroom learning through (1) the design and implementation of an in-service
training program for about 10,000 primary school teachers to improve teaching-learning practices in support of the newly revised
curriculum, and the design and implementation of training programs to enhance the capacities of approximately 1,500 deputy
directors, district-level methodologists, and inspectors to support primary level teachers to teach the new curriculum; (2) the
printing and distribution of approximately 3 million textbooks, teacher guides, and student workbooks for primary and lower
secondary schools and the provision of a package of essential teaching-learning materials for primary schools; (3) support for
the ongoing revision of the curriculum for grades 5–9, focusing on the piloting and finalization of subject standards and program
content; and (4) a sample-based assessment of student learning achievements at grade 4 and an assessment of teaching-learning
practices at the primary level.
The second component aims to improve the management of education resources and accountability for their use. The
component would support: (1) the expansion of per capita financing (PCF) and the operationalization of a monitoring system
for school budgets and expenditures, training, and technical assistance to key players at the local and central levels; and (2) the
strengthening of school leadership and management through the training of school directors and accountants and the production
of support materials.
The third component is communications and implementation support. This component has two subcomponents: (1)
communications and outreach activities to engage and inform stakeholders about the changes in the education sector; and (2)
implementation support to finance operating costs at the Ministry of Education and Science to implement the project.
Results to be achieved:
       10,000 teachers trained to implement the revised curriculum and apply improved teaching learning practices;
       1,500 school directors and district-level methodologists trained to provide instructional support to teachers;
       3 million copies of textbooks, teacher guides, and student workbooks printed and distributed;
       All students in grade 3–4 using revised textbooks;
       A new curriculum for grades 5–9 piloted and a sample-based achievement test carried out for grade 4;
       Schools operating under a new financing model and accountable for the annual school budget and expenditures.

The Project Development Objective is to increase equitable access to preschool education and to establish conditions
for improving its quality. The project has three components:

Component One: Expansion of quality preprimary education (US$11.60 million equivalent). The objectives of this
component are to increase access to preschool education for children aged 4–5 years in targeted areas and to enable all
children who are in the year prior to grade one to complete a full-year school preparation program. As such, this component
would finance: (i) the provision of teaching-learning materials and furniture to enable the opening or expansion of
kindergartens in poor communities with limited or no access to preschool services and the universal coverage of the full-
year preparation program; and (ii) the training of kindergarten and preparation program teachers on the knowledge and
skills needed to deliver appropriate education programs. The component is constituted of three subcomponents that
reinforce one another by promoting greater coverage, quality, and integration.

Component Two: Improved policy, programs, and system effectiveness (US$0.34 million equivalent). The objective of this
component is to improve policy, programs, and system effectiveness. To that end, it would finance technical assistance,
materials, and the monitoring of child development and classroom practices.

Component Three: Communications and implementation support (US$0.76 million equivalent). The objective of this
component is to finance communications and incremental operating costs generated by the project.

Results to be achieved:
       80,000 children 5–6 years old enrolled in the full-year school preparation program;
       Up to 100 new community kindergartens established in targeted communities;
       10,000 children 3–5 years old enrolled in community-based kindergartens in targeted communities;
       100 percent of school preparation classes have received a package of essential learning and teaching materials;
       90 percent of the teachers in newly established kindergartens are certified after training.

The Project Objective is to increase the agricultural productivity of the project beneficiaries. Project activities are aimed at
improving access to finance to support investments in farm inputs, agricultural machinery, and marketing infrastructure; timely
and reliable weather forecasts; and complementary training activities for farmers.
Investment Support for Improved Farm-Level Productivity Component provides a credit line to farmers and farmer
associations: (i) working capital loans for spring and fall planting and harvesting activities; and (ii) investment loans and leases
for farm machinery and investments in warehouses and other productive assets. It also finances the further expansion of the
community seed funds (CSFs) and women self-help groups (WSHGs) aimed at supporting poorer rural households with high-
quality seeds and fertilizer, as well as training for CSF and WSHG members.
Technical Support for Improved Farm-Level Productivity Component supports pilot delivery of weather information to
farmers, including early warnings for adverse weather events, to reduce crop losses due to such weather events; and training
and extension services to farmers and farmer cooperatives on modern, sustainable agricultural practices (including integrated
pest management) and quality management systems at the farm level to increase agricultural productivity and reduce on-farm
losses. The funding for the project is provided by the Russia Food Price Crisis Rapid Response Trust Fund for the Kyrgyz
Republic and Tajikistan.
Results achieved:
 505 subloans in the total amount of about US$3.9 million equivalent have been provided to farmers, including 96 women.
  100 percent of the credit line proceeds have been used for investment, mainly in herd improvement and agricultural
  machinery.
 A total of 95 CSFs have been established in all seven oblasts since autumn 2012, with an initial membership of 2,566 farmers,
  13 percent of whom were women. The number of CSFs is higher than the initially proposed total number of 65 CSFs. The
  newly established CSFs have received 684.2 tons of seeds and 911.3 tons of fertilizer. In 2013, CSF members achieved yields
  of about 56 percent and 49 percent for winter wheat and potatoes, respectively, higher than they achieved before the project
  in 2012 and about 35 percent and 54 percent higher than national average yields.
 During 2013–14, 302 new WSHGs with 2,050 members were created in 59 villages and provided with vegetable seeds. A
  total of 0.301 tons of seeds were distributed among the WSHG members (tomato, cucumber, onion, carrot, cabbage, red
  beet). In 2013, the women’s groups sold 1.438 tons of vegetables and earned more than KGS 22.5 million from sales.
 334 farmers in the pilot rayons of Chui, Talas, and Issyk-Kul oblasts were subscribed to receive via short message service
  (SMS) the three-day weather forecasts and adverse weather warnings produced by Kyrgyz Hydromet and the Rural Advisory
  Services.
 1 456 training sessions on improved agro-technical practices and on-farm quality management have been provided to
  approximately 4,183 poor farmers throughout the country, of which 2, 224 were women heads of households. Surveys
  indicate that over 80 percent of trainees rated the training as useful and efficient, while 73 percent of respondents reported
  adopting at least one improved practice promoted by the training courses.

The 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) indicated the need for continued reform of the
public financial management (PFM) system in the Kyrgyz Republic, including budget preparation, execution, and transparency,
internal audit, and cash management. Furthermore, the experience of PFM reform over the past decade indicates that significant
reforms have been achieved only when supported by external technical support and the provision of training for civil servants.
Thus the main part of the project focused on capacity building in PFM. Diverse donor support for PFM reform in the past has
not always been fully coordinated or focused on key reform priorities. There are immense management challenges for public
administration in the country and in particular, in the Ministry of Finance (MoF), to implement PFM reforms effectively. In the
past, a general criticism of various technical assistance projects has been that they have provided substantial advice and guidance
from international consultants but less in terms of direct capacity-building activities. However, this need was addressed through
the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) project by conducting a comprehensive assessment of capacity gaps/needs so that there
will be adequate capacity to implement all key tasks outlined in the project.
The Project Objective is to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of PFM through strengthening the
budget process, the internal audit and control functions, and the institutional and human capacity of the MoF, as well as other
agencies involved in PFM in the country. The project has the following components: (i) strengthening the budget process; (ii)
improving the medium-term budget framework, including the line ministries; (iii) enhancing internal audit and control; and (iv)
strengthening capacity building for PFM.

Results achieved: Strengthening the Budget Process. The project supported the MoF in developing a draft Budget Code. A unified
draft, which incorporated comments from various stakeholders, was developed. The code is intended to establish a framework
for budget management that will reflect best international practices. Progress has been made on increasing transparency through
the provision of budget information to the population in a user-friendly format, particularly through development of the Citizen’s
Budget, and conducting hearings on the budget proposals for both 2014 and 2015, which were arranged in four regions.
Moreover, several additional initiatives of the MoF have been supported to enhance the transparency of budget information,
resulting in an improvement of the Open Budget Index (OBI) from 15 in 2010 to 20 in 2012.
Medium-Term Budget Framework. Elements of performance budgeting were developed for 28 agencies in 2014, and
recommendations on performance budget (program budget) classification were developed. But a stronger linkage of the Medium-
Term Budget Framework (MTBF) to the annual budget is a necessary next step.
Capacity Building for Public Financial Management. A Training Plan has been developed based on a needs assessment, and the project
is supporting the training activities envisaged in the plan. A business plan for the Training Center has been developed to ensure
the sustainability of the project’s capacity-building activities. The Training Center staff and consultants conducted numerous
training events in 2014–15. Currently, the Training Center is working on implementing an e-learning strategy (distance learning)
to efficiently build the capacity of MoF staff around the country.

Fiscal year: 2010
Guarantee holder: Finrep Ges. m.b.H.
Investor country: Austria
Gross exposure: US$5.8 million

The project is the construction and operation of an air cargo complex and an air catering center at Manas International
Airport in Bishkek.

MIGA originally issued contracts to Italian Technology & Innovations S.r.l. (ITI) and MCC S.p.A. (MCC) (formerly
Mediocredito Centrale S.p.A.) in 1998 and 1999, respectively, for this project. MIGA reissued the contracts in FY02 to
accommodate changes in the commercial arrangements of the respective parties. Further details of the project appeared
in MIGA’s 1998 and 1999 annual reports.

MIGA has modified an existing contract of guarantee with Finrep Handles GmbH (Finrep) of Austria, increasing the
guarantee amount to US$5.8 million. This includes the coverage of shares and future retained earnings, reflecting a revised
80 percent shareholding in Manas Management Company and extending the tenor of guarantee by two years. MIGA’s
coverage is against the risk of expropriation.

The project has been operating at Manas International Airport since 2001 as the sole licensed provider of cargo handling
and storage services, as well as in-flight catering services. The company is based and operates in a strategic cargo and
transportation hub with significant growth potential in the rapidly expanding Central Asian market.
Results achieved:
The cargo complex at Manas International Airport has enabled the airport to increase the volume of incoming and
outgoing airfreight, with broader economic benefits for the Kyrgyz Republic (which has only one international airport).
The complex has also provided the necessary infrastructure to improve the capacity of the airport. It was built and now
operates to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) standard. This will continue to make the airport a more
desirable destination for international airlines, leading to increased air traffic.
MIGA’s continuing support to Manas International Airport is consistent with the World Bank Group’s Joint Country
Support Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic for 2007–10 and the Kyrgyz Republic’s Country Development Strategy for the
same period. The project contributes to the strategic goal of improving the environment for business and economic
growth.
